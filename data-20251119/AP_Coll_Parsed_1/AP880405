arab hijackers tuesday forced a kuwait 
airways jumbo jet to land in northeastern iran threatened to blow 
it up and demanded that kuwait release 17 proiranian prisoners 
they later released 25 of the 112 people on board 
irans official islamic republic news agency said without 
elaboration that the 24 women were released early wednesday after 
negotiations with irans deputy prime minister ali reza moayyeri 
a man in poor health was freed tuesday 
among the other passengers were three members of kuwaits royal 
family and a passenger with a us passport on a flight from 
bangkok to kuwait the gunmen warned the kuwaiti royals would be 
in imminent danger if kuwait refused to free the prisoners 
irna reported 
the hijackers brandishing pistols and hand grenades identified 
themselves only as arabs but their demands echoed those of 
iranianbacked shiite moslems holding american hostages in lebanon 
the kuwaiti government rejected the hijackers demand to release 
17 prisoners calling it blackmail but said it would listen to 
other demands the kuwait news agency reported 
irna said the 24 freed women included five stewardesses and 
identified them as 10 britons three thais three egyptians a 
philippine citizen a palestinian a singaporean an irishwoman a 
german an austrian a syrian and a pakistani 
the agency said the women were driven to a hotel in mashhad 
after being questioned by security officers at the airport 
after an emergency session kuwaits government said it will 
send a threeman delegation on wednesday morning to help iranian 
authorities secure the passengers release 
iran asked kuwait to send a highranking delegation to mashhad 
in northeastern iran for direct talks with the hijackers 
the hijackers earlier demanded fuel for the aircraft and 
threatened to blow it up if the iranians approached irna initially 
said the iranians refueled the plane but then said the gunmen were 
still requesting fuel 
iranian security forces surrounded the plane at mashhad airport 
to keep it from taking off irna and tehran radio said 
kuwait urged iran to handle the incident wisely and 
requested that the aircraft not be allowed to leave iran said it 
would try to resolve the crisis peacefully but said the plane would 
have to leave if it was not resolved quickly 
the plane was commandeered three hours after it took off from 
bangkok with 97 passengers and 15 crew members 
irna reported that the hijackers told the control tower at 
mashhad airport we ask you iranian officials to mediate between 
us and the kuwaiti government if you want 
our rights have been usurped we have 17 prisoners in 
kuwaiti jails who are under the worst kind of torture 
if you do not want to mediate we ask for fuel and other needs 
and then we will take off 
irna monitored in nicosia said a jordanian passenger with a 
heart condition was freed several hours after the plane landed at 
mashhad at 730 am midnight edt 
the passenger businessman mustafa issa 42 later appeared on 
tehran television also monitored in cyprus and said five or six 
hijackers were demanding to fly on to an undetermined location 
the passenger list included 30 kuwaitis 22 britons eight 
thais various other nationalities and one person with a us and 
an egyptian passport identified only as r attiaallaali 
but the us state department said it believed no americans were 
aboard in washington spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the us 
government urged iran to see that the hijackers are caught and 
tried 
airline sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
pilot was an iraqi 
elias h shiber the airlines manager in bangkok said the 
three members of kuwaits ruling family aboard were ibtesam khaled 
alsabah fadil khaled alsabah and the wife of khaled anwar 
alsabah 
hundreds of kuwaitis are related to kuwaits emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah the target of an assassination attempt by 
proiranian extremists in 1986 
frances watson the wife of british passenger albert watson 
said she was waiting by the phone for more news about her husband 
an engineering teacher from guisborough in northern england who was 
returning from bangkok 
he is a very calm and coolheaded person and i am sure he will 
take it all in his stride she said but i am terrified of what 
could happen to him 
the 17 prisoners demanded by the hijackers were jailed in the 
1983 bombings that targeted us and french embassies in kuwait 
shiites holding foreign hostages in lebanon also have demanded 
the prisoners release nine americans are among the 22 foreigners 
missing and believed kidnapped in lebanon 
the overwhelming majority of irans population is shiite in the 
persian gulf arab states sunni moslems dominate the government 
kuwait is the closest arab nation to iran and iraq which are 
locked in a 7yearold war iran often accuses kuwait of actively 
aiding iraqs military effort 
the kuwait news agency quoted a spokesman for the airline as 
saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over 
muscat oman 
iran first denied the plane permission to land but reversed its 
decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel irna 
said 
prime minister hussein musavi of iran told tehran radio that 
hijackings were against humanitarian and islamic principles and 
unacceptable as a political tactic 
diplomatic relations between iran and kuwait have been strained 
since august when iranians stormed the embassies of kuwait and 
saudi arabia in tehran kuwait closed its embassy in tehran and 
brought its diplomats home 
proiranian gunmen hijacked a kuwait airways jetliner to tehran 
in december 1984 and demanded the release of proiranian kuwaiti 
prisoners they killed two american passengers before iranian 
commandos stormed the aircraft ending the sixday ordeal

michael dukakis cautiously criticized jesse 
jacksons involvement in the panamanian standoff and expressed 
irritation with sen albert gore jr on monday as he struggled to 
pull out a victory in the critical wisconsin primary 
in a long final day of campaigning around the state dukakis 
repeatedly likened himself to john f kennedy who scored an 
important primary victory in wisconsin in his 1960 presidential 
campaign 
campaigning before students in stevens point in his last 
appearance of the night he urged that those who support him try to 
round up a little lastminute help 
when you go home tonight make a few phone calls get a hold 
of your neighbors believe me your work will make 
thedifference dukakis said 
arriving back in boston monday night he was asked about his 
prospects in wisconsin 
weve worked hard it looks good but you never know until the 
votes come in he said 
earlier dukakis recalled kennedys success in reversing a round 
of steel industry price hikes in 1962 and said he would summon 
chrysler corp president lee iacocca to the white house fast 
and demand that he drop plans to close a plant in kenosha 
polls indicate dukakis and jackson are locked in a tight race in 
wisconsin just as they are running neck and neck nationally in the 
chase for national convention delegates 
the massachusetts governor said it was a bad idea for his 
democratic presidential rival to suggest taking on the role of 
mediator between the reagan administration and panamanian strongman 
manuel noriega 
but he softened his criticism when he said he thought jackson 
had acted out of good intentions and again when he said he 
understood that jackson had issued a clarifying statement on the 
subject jackson said he had asked noriega to leave the country 
not offered to mediate 
even so dukakis said i think its a bad idea for a private 
citizen to try to inject himself into the situation 
asked about jacksons muchheralded trip to syria in 1984 when 
he won the release of captured navy flyer robert goodman dukakis 
replied i think the principle is the same 
dukakis was less charitable toward gore who rays the governor 
has been absurdly timid in criticizing jackson for fear of 
offending black voters 
dukakis cut off one reporter who began to ask about the subject 
and said sen gore ought to start campainging for the 
presidency 
he noted that he and jackson disagree on the middle east 
proposals for an oil import fee and other subjects 
asked later if he thought gore were serious about winning the 
partys nomination dukakis said i dont know what hes serious 
about 
dukakis noted that gore hasnt won any contests outside the 
south except the nevada caucuses 
dukakis criticism of jackson came at a time when aides said the 
wisconsin race appeared extremely tight 
while a weekend poll in the milwaukee journal gave dukakis an 
eightpoint lead over jackson in wisconsin the massachusetts 
governor and his aides portrayed tuesdays primary as a much closer 
matchup 
its too close to call said will robinson deputy political 
director for the campaign well take any kind of win we can 
get 
dukakis told reporters i dont have to win in wisconsin 
i just have to win a good plurality of delegates by june 9 the 
end of the primary season 
wisconsin is regarded as a critical test of dukakis candidacy 
following losses in earlier industrial state contests in michigan 
and illinois he and jackson are running neck and neck in the race 
for delegates to the democratic national convention and many party 
leaders have expressed concern that jackson a black liberal 
contender with roots in the civil rights movement would lead 
democrats to a crushing defeat in the fall 
thus a defeat in wisconsin would seriously damage dukakis 
chances for winning the nomination and would almost certainly 
rekindle talk of a draftmario cuomo movement in the two weeks 
remaining before the new york governors home state primary on 
april 19

if vice president george bush stumbles on his 
way to the white house this november erstwhile rival bob dole 
could wind up as the nations top gop spokesman 
the senate minority leader under a democratic administration 
could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s 
ev and charlie show 
it might well be called the bob and bob show with dole being 
joined by house minority leader bob michel of illinois to counter a 
democratic presidents programs and present alternatives to them 
the ev of ev and charlie was senate minority leader everett 
mckinley dirksen of illinois 
dirksen teamed with house minority leader charles halleck of 
indiana in a regular series of televised news conferences dirksen 
became the undisputed mr republican of his era 
dole crowded out of the 1988 republican field by bush has 
returned to his leadership position in the senate serving notice 
he intends to prod the gop into opening its arms to a wider 
constituency 
republicans should dole says address issues of concern to the 
homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics 
day care education longterm health care medicaid and medicare 
we must above all give more americans a reason to come our 
way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our 
staunchest supporters dole said last week 
with a sense of humor that can be dark and biting dole will 
have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national 
spokesman for the gop 
dirksen was full of fun and thunder said dirksen biographer 
neil mcneil 
mcneil in his 1970 dirksen portrait of a public man said 
the senate minority leader became a television superstar despite a 
complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in 
the age of television 
his tousled hair long his trademark was an easily 
recognizable ensign mcneil wrote his deepthroated husky 
voice his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a 
rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions 
washington post cartoonist herblock caricatured dirksen as a 
melancholy clown halleck as a buffoon and straight man 
halleck resented the ev and charlie tag he took his 
partisanship seriously 
but dirksen said he liked the name said it reminded him of such 
other allamerican duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs 
some republicans said they thought the two stood in poor 
contrast to john f kennedy the nations new youthful and 
handsome democratic president 
one complained about dirksens fuzzy hair and hallecks 
big red nose 
none of this troubled dirksen mcneil wrote for even as 
the criticisms were being made he and halleck were getting 
television and press coverage to make the oppositions case against 
the kennedy administration in time he sensed the criticism would 
wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was 
now receiving 
dirksen and halleck used the ev and charlie routine to showcase 
criticism of the kennedy domestic program 
it may be called the new frontier but the kennedy program is 
the old new deal taken out of an old warming oven dirksen said 
he scored the administration for deficit spending increased 
government controls increases in the government payroll more 
welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the 
piper more taxes 
by mid 1962 the ev and charlie show was fully launched and 
obviously effective in stating the republican case the ridicule 
evaporated 
no republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his 
disheveled flair rumpled charm and widespread appeal

in laidback california a little levity has 
been a hallmark at psa but the commuter airlines new parent 
usair is lowering the curtain on one psa feature standup 
routines by flight attendants 
for example on a recent flight from san jose to los angeles 
psa flight attendant marka mcdougall went into her act as the 
engines revved up 
ladies and gentlemen ms mcdougall said wed like to 
welcome you aboard flight 1733 on our way to seattle 
following a panicky gasp in the cabin ms mcdougall added 
just kidding i wanted to see if you were listening 
ms mcdougall who says about 10 percent of her colleagues go 
for such laughs was on a roll 
if you are traveling with infants or small children or anyone 
resembling a small child place your mask on first then assist the 
child providing theyve been good she said and now for 
those of you who have not been in a car since 1962 were going to 
show you how to fasten your seat belts 
but the managers of arlington vabased usair are not amused 
and this week is ms mcdougalls last as a kidder usair is 
completing a 385 million takeover of psa 
our policy is that we discourage that sort of thing because 
the information is very serious and should be delivered in that 
vein said david shipley assistant vice president for public 
relations at usair 
psa which has smiles painted on the noses of its jets believes 
that a light touch is helpful said sherry hendry division vice 
president for the airlines inflight and dining services 
as long as the safety announcements are done in the right 
manner we think a sense of humor is appreciated at a time that is 
perceived to be a hassle she said

ben and jerry those irrepressible vermont ice 
cream makers found out that its easier to make coffee heath bar 
crunch than to make a new york subway station shine 
about a year ago ben cohen and jerry greenfield whose ben amp 
jerrys ice cream has become a favorite of the upscale ice cream 
set proposed to spruce up and maintain a subway station on 
manhattans upscale upper east side 
cohen just down from vermont found the station really 
disgusting many new yorkers would say its better than most 
cohen and greenfield offered to spend their new york advertising 
budget for the year 200000 to 250000 cleaning painting and 
maintaining the station 
the transit authority said yes the transport workers union said 
no because cohen and greenfield wanted to use some nonunion 
workers on the project 
negotiations dragged on and ben amp jerry finally set a march 31 
deadline that passed too the matter went before an independent 
arbitrator who is expected to rule soon 
so on monday ben amp jerry set up an ice cream wagon and a van at 
a park across the street from the station and began doling out 
free ice cream as a consolation prize for passengers emerging from 
the filthy subway stop cohen and greenfield were there to promise 
that theyd keep trying to spruce it up 
nobody seemed to care about the station though not while 
there was free ice cream to be had

american households have shrunk to their 
smallest size ever containing just half as many people as at the 
start of the civil war 
the census bureau reports that the average household contained 
264 people as of last july 1 continuing a longterm decline by 
comparison the 1860 census found an average household of 528 
people 
while the household size has declined the number of households 
has continued to climb topping 90 million for the first time in 
1987 the bureau said monday 
household size is shrinking because the number of households is 
increasing faster than the overall population this is occurring 
said bureau population expert campbell gibson because of changes 
in the countrys age structure 
the many americans born in the postworld war ii baby boom are 
now in their 20s and 30s when they are most likely to set up 
households on their own he said 
the number of households rose from 804 million in 1980 to 888 
million in 1986 and is now past the 90 million mark 
at the same time the average number of persons per household 
declined from 275 in 1985 to 265 in 1986 and now to 264 gibson 
said 
by comparison the 1970 census found the average household 
contained 314 people in 1930 households averaged more than 4 
people and they averaged more than 5 in 1880 the nations first 
census in 1790 found an average household size of 579 people 
while the growing number of ever smaller households continues a 
trend gibson pointed out that household growth isnt outpacing 
population increases as fast as in the 1970s 
the same age factors that are increasing households now also 
occurred then gibson said but in addition in the 1970s the 
proportion of households in each age group was also growing that 
has not continued in the 1980s he said 
this could be occurring for a number of reasons gibson said 
for example in this decade more young people have chosen to 
remain home with their parents instead of setting up housekeeping 
on their own as many had done in the 1970s this could be caused 
by the increasing cost of housing he said 
delays in marriage while young people pursue careers and 
school have also been widely reported as a factor but gibson 
cautioned that it is too simplistic to attribute all of the 
household changes to this 
theres a whole bunch of things that affect the rates he 
said 
for example the elderly tend to have high household rates 
because a fair number are widowed resulting in many oneperson 
households 
continued low birth rates in the united states are also a 
factor the presence of children increases household size while 
populations with a larger share of adults tend to have smaller 
households 
asked what the future holds gibson said he expects to see 
households continue to lead population in growth rates over the 
next few years but that should change at some point as the 
smaller baby bust generation born following the baby boom comes 
into the household formation ages 
while the national trend was reflected in most parts of the 
nation gibson cited two states that differ 
in california and utah household growth rates were only 
slightly different from those for population he said 
in california the increasing number of hispanic and asian 
residents likely is the reason gibson said since those groups 
tend to have more people per household 
utah gibson said has larger households because it maintains 
higher fertility than other states largely because of the 
influence of the mormon religion 
households are defined as occupied housing units containing one 
or more people the number of households is on average smaller 
than the number of families because the definition of a family 
requires at least two people while there are many oneperson 
households

a record 3 million libel award against cbs 
that the supreme court has refused to disturb is not likely to have 
widespread impact on the news media says an authority on libel law 
henry kaufman of the libel defense resource center in new york 
city said the case does not establish a significant precedent 
because the facts involved are unique 
but kaufman did say that the case stemming from a broadcast on 
a cbsowned television station in chicago changes the 
psychological landscape 
this is the first libel award that has broken through the 
psychological 1 million barrier on appeal the first that has been 
able to make it through the process intact he said 
kaufman whose organization is funded by the news media 
expressed disappointment along with cbs officials that the supreme 
court on monday left the libel judgment intact 
news organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a 
first amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases 
kaufman said that opportunity has passed for the time being 
he said 
were disappointed said doug jacobs associate general 
counsel for cbs inc we believed these issues were important 
enough for review 
the case stems from a suit by brown amp williamson tobacco corp 
of louisville ky which makes viceroy cigarettes it accused cbs 
and wbbmtv anchorman walter jacobson in chicago of libeling it in 
a nov 11 1981 broadcast 
jacobson in a nightly feature called walter jacobsons 
perspective said there was a viceroy advertising strategy to 
attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes to pot 
wine beer and sex he said the idea was to present cigarette 
smoking as an initiation into the adult world as an illicit 
pleasure 
a federal jury awarded the cigarette company 5 million the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals upheld 3 million of the award 
against cbs and 50000 against jacobson 
the 3 million award plus some 400000 in interest is about 
four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news 
organization upheld on appeal awards upheld on appeal average 
between 100000 and 150000 
in the cbs case the appeals court rejected arguments that the 
broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous 
the appeals court said the remarks about viceroy were intended 
to be factual even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like 
something else 
the appeals court also rejected cbss claim that the broadcast 
was truthful 
there was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company 
actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating 
cigarettes to pot wine beer and sex the appeals court said 
finally the appeals court ruled that jacobson and cbs acted 
with actual malice in broadcasting the commentary 
for a public figure to win a libel suit it must be shown there 
was actual malice that statements were made with knowledge they 
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth the cigarette 
company was held to be a public figure 
in other action the court 
left intact rulings in a case from st louis that public 
airports may not ban all demonstrations soliciting and 
distribution of political and religious literature at their 
terminals 
agreed to review rulings that limited korean air lines 
financial liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died 
the shooting down of a kal passenger jet over soviet airspace 
reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal 
regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for 
treating medicare patients the unanimous court was led by justice 
anthony m kennedy writing his first opinion since joining the 
court feb 18 
rejected a challenge to new york citys rentcontrol law that 
limits yearly increases for affected apartments to 75 percent 
agreed to decide whether new yorks powerful board of estimate 
the citys mayor city council president and comptroller and the 
president of each of the citys five boroughs must be 
reapportioned to meet equalvoting standards

the providers of allrisk crop insurance last 
year paid out the lowest amount of benefits per premium dollar 
since a new program went into effect in 1981 according to the 
american association of crop insurers 
farmers carried 607 billion worth of multiple peril crop 
insurance in 1987 on a record 62 million acres of production 
e eugene gantz executive vice president of the association 
said monday that farmers paid 274 million in 1987 premiums and 
received 335 million in loss payments for the year nationally 
that meant for each 1 paid in premiums farmers received 122 in 
indemnities 
the multiple peril crop insurance program includes commercial 
companies that are reinsured against catastrophic loss by the 
federal crop insurance corp an agency of the agriculture 
department the fcic also handles insurance directly through master 
marketers who account for about 20 percent of the total 
up to 30 percent of a farmers allrisk insurance premium is 
subsidized by the fcic 
when the federal subsidies are included the 1987 premiums 
totaled 365 million compared with the benefits of 335 million 
thus the 1987 loss ratio was 092 or 92 cents paid out for each 
1 of premium 
gantz said that was the lowest ratio since the multiple peril 
crop insurance program began in 1981 
under the program farmers can buy varying levels of coverage 
for a variety of crops to insure them against loss from floods 
drought insects and other natural causes 
as we look forward to 1988 we hope for another good loss 
ratio performance gantz said but were concerned with dry 
conditions already cropping up in the west and midwest 
the deadline for farmers to sign up for 1988 crop insurance is 
april 15 in most areas of the country it was march 31 in some of 
the early planting areas of the south he said 
farmers who produce springplanted crops also should keep in 
mind that without crop insurance they are not eligible for 
agriculture department disaster assistance such as lowinterest 
loans from the farmers home administration gantz said 
the 1987 coverage on 62 million acres of crops compared with 
607 million acres in 1986 and 465 million acres when the program 
began in 1981 a low point was reached in 1983 when plantings were 
cut sharply by drought and government acreage programs only 313 
million acres of crops were insured that year 
however the mix of crops and variations in kinds of coverage 
have resulted in wide variations of coverage value last years 
607 billion in coverage was down from more than 622 billion in 
1986 for example despite the record acreage and in 1985 
coverage totaled nearly 717 billion on 591 million

the soviet union has been given the goahead 
by the agriculture department to buy an additional 1 million metric 
tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
acting undersecretary thomas o kay said monday that since april 
1987 the subsidized sales of wheat to the soviets have totaled 
more than 118 million tons under previously announced allocations 
of the departments export enhancement program or eep 
more than 76 million tons of the 118 million tons of 
subsidized wheat bought by the soviet union has gone to fill its 
commitment under the fifth and final year of a longterm grain 
agreement with the united states 
the pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the 
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year the soviets 
are required to seek us approval the soviets have been given 
approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
if moscow buys all of the new authorization that would push 
wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 86 
million tons all of the wheat has been subsidized 
in addition the soviets have bought 41 million tons of 
nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans and 13 million 
tons of soybean meal 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or another authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the subsidies or bonuses have run between less than 20 to 
more than 40 per ton roughly 54 cents to 109 per bushel

the food and drug administration says it is 
time for cosmetic companies to stop talking and start changing 
labels that claim skin creams can retard or reverse aging of the 
skin 
the federal agency wrote 22 companies on monday that it will 
take another look at the labels in 30 days and then crack down on 
any that persist in misleading claims 
we believe that fda has clearly stated its views regarding the 
types of claims that can appropriately be made on cosmetic skin 
care products and the types of claims that make skin products 
unapproved new drugs wrote john m taylor associate 
commissioner for regulatory affairs 
accordingly we do not believe that a detailed review or a 
prolonged discussion regarding individual product labeling is 
necessary we hope that you will make the changes in your labeling 
that are necessary to bring it into compliance with the act and 
with fdas stated views 
the food drug and cosmetic act defines cosmetics which can be 
sold without preapproval by the fda as products intended to 
cleanse or to beautify superficially 
in written warnings to the cosmetic industry last year the 
agency said that when a product is said to counteract retard or 
control the aging process or to rejuvenate repair or renew the 
skin then those statements put the product in the drug category 
with all its stringent scientific review requirements that is so 
the letter said because such claims indicate that a function of 
the body or that the structure of the body will be affected by 
the product 
the fda said then it was unaware of any substantial scientific 
evidence that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the 
socalled antiaging skin care products 
implicit in the latest letter was the fda view that talks 
started with the companies last spring intended to lead to 
voluntary changes in labeling claims have gone on long enough 
some companies have modified their labels since last spring but 
the fda said last november it could not accept the labeling claims 
continuing to appear on many products 
the latest letter said the agency will examine the labeling and 
promotions of the creams in 30 days and that a product still in 
substantial violation may be subject to immediate regulatory 
action this can include seizure of products on shelves and court 
injunctions against further distribution 
the fda action does not involve retina a prescription acne 
medication that was widely publicized recently after a study 
suggested it was effective in removing small wrinkles caused by sun 
damage to the skin the fda did not release the names of the 
companies that received the letter

one by one the favorite presidential 
candidates of some of the nations union leaders are falling by the 
wayside 
eight days ago it was missouri rep richard gephardt the 
personal choice of united auto workers president owen bieber 
gephardt finished a distant third in michigans caucuses and 
withdrew last monday 
today in wisconsins primary leaders of the united steel 
workers union expect their preferred choice illinois sen paul 
simon to be weeded from the democratic field 
quite sadly tomorrow is going to show simon to be yesterdays 
tomatoes joel vattendahl director of usws 14000member 
district 32 headquartered in milwaukee said on the eve of the 
primary 
while the union was abiding by aflcio guidelines to encourage 
their members to support any candidate of their choice simon had 
clearly become the choice by default of the usws leaders 
the first choice of usw president lynn williams had been new 
york gov mario cuomo whom he has served as an adviser on 
industrial policy 
vattendahl now believes that massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
will edge out jesse jackson among the unions members in wisconsin 
who are mostly foundry workers with tennessee sen albert gore 
also finishing ahead of simon 
i would have thought simon would have caught on better hes 
been with us for 30 years and weve been with him vattendahl 
said but its not happening that way 
going into todays votes simon actually has more delegates to 
the democratic national convention in july among union members than 
any of the other candidates all from his victory in the illinois 
primary march 15 
the latest aflcio tabulations show him with 20 elected labor 
delegates followed by jackson with 15 gore with 10 dukakis with 
six and gephardt with two 
the steelworkers were instrumental in persuading simon to stay 
in the race through the illinois primary and had hoped he would do 
well enough in wisconsin to remain a candidate through the april 26 
primary in pennsylvania where the union has its biggest political 
strength 
but gary hubbard a usw spokesman said dukakis and jackson have 
been on the phone with steelworkers union members around the 
country who had been supporting simon offering them delegate slots 
for their support 
so far its being resisted he added 
leaders of wisconsins biggest union the 48000 teachers who 
belong to the national education association also believe dukakis 
will edge out jackson among their members today 
jackson however has endeared himself to wisconsin union 
members facing the greatest strife 5500 workers at a kenosha 
chrysler plant to be closed next summer and striking meatpackers at 
cudahy and paper workers at depere 
al gore visited us and dukakis showed up at the labor temple 
in green bay said roger murphry one of 370 mostly white paper 
workers on strike the past 10 months against international paper 
cos de pere mill 
but theyre just reading off the script jesse wrote murphy 
said 
mark rosenbaum president of united food and commercial workers 
local p40 in cudahy which is striking the smithfield foods 
meatpacking plant has made trips to california to raise campaign 
money on jacksons behalf 
the picket line is white the strikebreakers are black said 
allen zack a ufcw spokesman the company orchestrated letters to 
jackson from scabs saying that he was selling them out and he 
replied a scab is a scab our cudahy people are big jackson fans 
jackson also has won the endorsement of uaw local 72 in kenosha 
which represents the chrysler workers after appearing with them in 
protest rallies in january when the company announced its intention 
to close the plant next summer 
both gore and dukakis in the past week have denounced chrysler 
chairman lee iacocca in campaign appearances but labor leaders 
view those actions as too little and too late 
the problem is people who are striking or are in trouble are 
the ones who vote and those who are working dont said joan 
baggett political director for the bricklayers union and a dukakis 
supporter that raises a real question about us getting a 
novemberelectable candidate

jesse jacksons showing in todays wisconsin 
primary will be a key measure of his emergence as a candidate who 
could have sufficient support to win the democratic nomination and 
the presidency pollsters say 
as jackson has improved his ability to win votes the poll 
analysts noted monday the expectations for his campaign have 
increased if he has done well they said he now needs to do 
better still 
it may be a constantly moving target said cbs news pollster 
keating holland the frontier is moving twenty percent of the 
white democratic vote and all the black vote is not going to win 
the election in november 
jackson gained cofrontrunner status when he upset gov michael 
dukakis in the michigan caucuses march 26 no polls were done there 
to indicate the demographics of jacksons support 
dukakis then beat jackson in connecticuts primary where 
jackson got about 20 percent of the white vote in wisconsin a 
milwaukee journal poll last week put jacksons white backing at 30 
percent 
in this state certainly hes a viable candidate said jeff 
browne the journal editor who ran the poll though it gave dukakis 
a slim lead he said it probably understated jacksons support by 
underestimating black turnout 
blacks have been the most reliable of jacksons supporters 
throughout the primary season voting for him with nearunanimity 
at the same time you have to have white voters to be a viable 
candidate said mary klett poll analyst for nbc news there 
are some white voters going his way but it will have to be much 
larger before he could get the nomination 
wisconsin and the new york primary april 19 are crucial to 
indicate that votegetting ability klett said what happens in 
wisconsin is going to be pivotal in new york she said jackson 
she suggested has to win one of those states or both 
i wouldnt put a number on it its the number of democrats 
that are voting for him klett said when he gets most of them 
voting for him thats when he becomes viable 
there are other measures as well in wisconsin the journal poll 
last week showed vice president george bush leading jackson in a 
hypothetical general election race by 50 percent to 36 percent 
that strikes me as extremely close for jackson in this state 
considering how well known bush is and how well liked president 
reagan is browne said he noted that dukakis and sen albert 
gore jr both fared even better in matchups against bush 
another issue in gauging jacksons strength is in the nature of 
the white votes he is attracting exit polls in connecticut said he 
did best with liberals and lost the bluecollar vote critical in 
the general election by 21 an analysis of the michigan caucus 
results also indicated that jackson was not particularly strong in 
bluecollar precincts holland said 
still another measure is the share of voters who have a 
favorable opinion of jackson although his rating has improved the 
last national survey by cbs news and the new york times done march 
1922 said more white democrats had an unfavorable opinion of him 
39 percent than the 31 percent favorable holland said among 
all white voters it was 46 percent unfavorable to 22 percent 
favorable he said 
you say to yourself very few white republicans are going to 
vote for him you then write off half the democrats as well and 
youre not looking at much of an electoral base said holland 
you can see why people will be putting increasing hurdles in 
front of him 
he is increasing his white vote the cbs analyst said if 
thats the case it may be acceptable to say lets see how far you 
can go with this can you reach the point where you can win in 
november twenty percent is not there i would guess its not 30 
percent 
ia lewis chief of polling for the los angeles times said he 
retained his view that jackson is able but unlikely to win the 
nomination and unable to win in november he cited jacksons 
liberal positions as well as an element of racism that exists in 
america today 
nonetheless theres already been a profound change jackson 
has been to a certain extent legitimized by his very impressive 
victories said lewis in turn he said whatever the outcome 
jackson is legitimizing blacks as legitimate presidential 
contenders

attorney general edwin meeses wife ursula 
will undergo questioning shortly in the criminal investigation of 
her husband about her own 40000ayear job say sources familiar 
with the case 
the office of independent counsel james mckay is trying to 
determine whether longtime meese friend e robert wallach in effect 
helped supplement the meeses income by recommending mrs meese for 
jobs said sources familiar with the probe speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
mrs meese has retained the same washington law firm 
representing her husband said james rocap one of meeses lawyers 
she will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be 
questioned by investigators from mckays office 
mckay said last week that his investigation of meese also 
encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding mrs 
meeses job would continue at least until the end of april 
mckay last month subpoenaed records relating to mrs meeses 
post with the washington chapter of the multiple sclerosis society 
said a lawyer for the chapter james bierbower 
a lawyer for wallach george walker has told the washington 
post that wallach had suggested mrs meese for a job with a local 
radio station owned by the bender family of washington 
mrs meese took the position with the ms society instead 
however bierbower said the bender foundation of washington 
controlled by the same family that owns the radio station is 
contributing the 40000 a year that constitutes mrs meeses 
salary with the ms group 
calls to the bender foundation seeking its reasons for paying 
mrs meeses salary were not returned 
mrs meese has been a volunteer for the ms society since 1981 
and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called 
operation job match matching ms victims with employers 
mrs meese also was questioned in an earlier independent 
counsels investigation of meese in 1984 in that investigation 
independent counsel jacob stein probed meeses failure to include 
in his financial disclosure statements a 15000 loan by edwin 
thomas to mrs meese thomas later became meeses assistant 
counselor at the white house the independent counsel found no 
connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by thomas 
his wife and his son 
in another development monday justice department sources said 
meese will face an ethics investigation by his own departments 
office of professional responsibility if mckay doesnt seek an 
indictment such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a 
recommendation to president reagan that meese be fired 
former assistant attorney general william welds files on the 
attorney generals dealings with wallach were moved to opr last 
friday the sources said 
material collected by welds criminal division last year led to 
mckays criminal investigation of meese 
mckay said friday he has insufficient evidence to date to 
warrant seeking an indictment of meese in connection with his 
involvement with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline touted by wallach 
or his involvement with the regional bell telephone companies at a 
time when he held 14000 in baby bell stock in december mckay 
said he didnt have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant 
seeking an indictment of meese in connection with his assistance to 
scandalplagued wedtech corp 
mckay said that if he decides not to seek a criminal indictment 
of meese the independent counsels office will refer all of 
those matters for review and action by the appropriate 
administrative authorities a reference to opr 
oprs chief michael shaheen denied assertions by justice 
department sources speaking on condition of anonymity that his 
office had begun examining meeses ties to longtime friend wallach 
last year 
that review was halted when mckay launched his criminal 
investigation of meese last may 11 the sources said

jesse jacksons onceimpoverished presidential 
campaign is showing new fundraising strength collecting an 
impressive 22 million in donations during march more than he 
raised during all of last year 
the sum coming mostly in contributions of 50 or less 
represents a dramatic upswing for what jackson frequently boasts is 
the poor campaign with the rich message 
bob farmer finance chairman for the democratic fields 
consistent fundraising leader michael dukakis was laudatory when 
told monday about jacksons money 
thats a tremendous achievement for rev jackson he said 
anybody that can raise 2 million in a month is a hero to me 
dukakis the massachusetts governor collected donations 
totaling more than 25 million during march farmer said sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee raised about 15 million during 
march his campaign said last week 
jackson has been picking up most of his money in small 
contributions through an aggressive directmail and telemarketing 
program the program banked 1 million during march said jacksons 
mail consultant mal warwick of berkeley calif he said the 
returns are the most impressive of any campaign he has ever 
conducted in 10 years of fundraising 
farmer said dukakis has gotten contributions averaging 135 each 
over the past 90 days 
during all of 1987 jackson raised just under 2 million while 
dukakis raised 108 million 
he has emerged as a significant player and thats reflected in 
his financial performance farmer said of jackson youre 
beginning to see this as a twoman race and the fund raising is the 
first benchmark of success 
he said jackson should be very proud of his mail returns 
jackson campaign spokeswoman pam smith said jacksons march 
receipts surprised even campaign manager gerald austin who had 
projected contributions of about 1 million in all jackson 
collected 3 million including about 800000 in federal matching 
funds dukakis took in about 34 million including 875000 in 
federal matching funds 
jacksons fundraising boost is timely as the expensive new york 
primary approaches on april 19 
theyre really banking for new york smith said noting that 
television ad time in new york city is particularly expensive by 
contrast she said the campaign spent a total of 100000 on 
todays wisconsin primary with about half going to tv ads 
jackson generally relies on a grassroots network of volunteers 
eliminating the large payroll common to more wealthy campaigns 
warwick said jacksons mail returns have picked up since super 
tuesday when jackson polled first in popular vote and second in 
delegates across 20 state primaries and caucuses on march 8 
in addition to the direct mail campaign smith said jackson 
raised about 140000 during a twoday fundraising swing through 
california where national campaign chairman willie brown put on a 
series of fundraising events 
jackson also collected about 120000 at events in michigan 
prior to the march 26 caucuses where he won a landslide victory 
dukakis got about half his march donations from three days of 
bigticket fundraising events in washington new york and boston 
farmer said

two cabinet secretaries and the secret service 
director have attested to lyn nofzigers character in letters to 
the judge who will sentence the former presidential aide for 
illegal lobbying 
letters signed by energy secretary john s herrington labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin and secret service director john r 
simpson are among 62 attached to a defense brief that urges a short 
term of unsupervised probation for nofziger 
in a threepage letter herrington urged us district judge 
thomas flannery to show compassion and understanding for 
nofziger 
society has been paid by what he has gone through in this 
trial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual 
herrington said 
rep jack kemp rny one of four members of congress who sent 
letters urged flannery to consider balancing the requirements of 
justice with the quality of mercy 
simpson wrote about nofzigers role as white house spokesman on 
march 30 1981 after president reagan had been shot and taken to 
george washington university hospital 
once mr nofziger took the podium simpson recalled he 
quickly became aware of the rapport and the trust the press had 
for any statements he made 
nofziger 63 is scheduled to be sentenced friday on three 
counts of illegally lobbying former white house colleagues on 
behalf of wedtech corp the manufacturer of the a10 antitank 
plane and a maritime engineers union 
he could receive a twoyear prison term and a 10000 fine for 
each of the three felony violations of the ethics in government act 
last week independent counsel james c mckay urged a prison 
term of unspecified length and a fine arguing that nofziger 
flouted the law and was unrepentant following his conviction feb 
11 
nofziger had likened his crime to running a stop sign 
the defense brief that was filed monday said imprisonment 
would unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation mr 
nofziger has already suffered as a result of his indictment and 
trial 
accusing mckay of making a vindictive and meanspirited 
sentencing request defense lawyers robert plotkin and e lawrence 
barcella said it is inconceivable that a sentence other than 
probation is appropriate under these circumstances 
former sen paul laxalt rnev said nofziger has been deeply 
wounded and punished physically emotionally and financially 
rep helen delich bentley rmd called nofziger a man of 
impeccable character and integrity who would never do anything 
which he understood to be morally wrong 
others who signed letters were sen chic hecht rnev rep 
mervyn w dymally dcalif and former health and human services 
secretary margaret heckler now us ambassador to ireland 
former us treasurer angela buchanan joe rodgers us 
ambassador to france and carol boyce hallett the ambassador to 
the bahamas 
the defense brief repeated a longstanding contention that 
nofziger didnt intend to violate the postemployment lobbying 
restrictions a point hotly disputed by mckays sentencing memo 
nofziger does not dispute the need for fair clear and 
balanced postemployment restriction but his lawyers contended 
if the statute were clearer he likely would not be before the 
court for sentencing

mexico had the lowest labor costs last year 
and norway had the highest as measured in dollars the labor 
department says 
average hourly costs in mexico went down to 137 from 149 in 
1986 the department said in its report released monday though 
wages more than doubled in mexican pesos the exchange value of the 
peso dropped so far that the dollar cost declined 
brazilian workers saw their wages and benefits rise when 
measured in cruzados but in dollar terms there was a decline to 
149 from 160 an hour because of the low value of the domestic 
currency 
brazil and mexico are the third worlds two biggest debtors a 
situation that tends to drive down the price of their currencies 
they were the only countries where the dollar cost of labor was 
reported to have dropped in the year 
the figures take account of the fall in the price of the dollar 
and of changes in local pay rates the costs of social insurance 
and other benefits are also figured but the figures do not 
consider whether some workers are more efficient than others 
norways average compensation of 1758 an hour was nearly 13 
times mexicos dollar amount the us average of 1346 dollars 
was almost 10 times mexicos 
low wage costs in other countries have long been used by 
politicians as the reason for protecting us industry from 
imports labor unions also have complained against exporting 
jobs arguing that low labor costs in other countries encourage 
us employers to set up production there rather than at home 
labor in the newlyindustrialized countries of asia and latin 
america remained less than a fifth as costly as in the united 
states 
of 22 countries surveyed seven had costs higher than the us 
rate here they were in addition to norway switzerland 1706 
west germany 1683 sweden 1514 netherlands 1511 dollars 
belgium 1508 and denmark l449 dolllars 
all 23 countries for which the labor department had statistics 
showed an increase of compensation in their own currency including 
the united states 
japans relative cost level in 1987 of 84 percent of us 
costs greatly exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in 
1986 said the report from the bureau of labor statistics 
it noted that japans level was now close to canadas the 
increase was due largely to the rise of the yen against the dollar

here is the text of gen manuel antonio 
noriegas letter to jesse jackson as released monday by the 
jackson campaign it was written in response to a march 23 letter 
from jackson the text as released by the campaign contained 
several fragmentary sentences misspellings and other 
irregularities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with sincere emotion i read your most attentive letter 
addressed to me dated march 23 delivered by cirilo mcsween in 
which you expressed your moral concern for the political and 
economic living conditions of the panamanian people your concern 
for the crisis which has provoked great suffering and your appeal 
to me to persist in seeking peace and to put an end to this crisis 
you expressed your anxiety to do whatever is possible to help 
alleviate the suffering and that we should act immediately 
your reputation as a great moral authority obligates me to give 
consideration and pay attention to your appeal so that we may work 
together for the peace and unification of my country in this 
sense i manifest that it has always been one of the objectives of 
the defense force and mine to try to keep social peace for the 
panamanian brothers and sisters and the foreigners that reside in 
our country our doctrine of national security is inspired in the 
ideals of social justice and not of military concepts 
i am sure that you are aware of the deep internal and external 
aspects of the political and economic situation now they have been 
destabalizing our consitutional panamanian institutions so as to 
have a country that is weak and ruined so it becomes an easy prey 
for the dictates of foreign forces i am sure that you know the 
details of the amalgam between professional panamanian politicians 
that are now dressed in sheepskin and the legislative and 
executive sectors of the united states of america who have 
translated an open and barefaced intervention into the internal 
affairs of panama with the final proposition that they do not give 
compliment to the covenant of the torrijoscarter treaty of 1977 
no panamanian with a firm nationalistic and patriotic sentiment 
would ever accept that the solution of internal problems of the 
republic of panama be dictated from washington dc 
consequently i find it unnecesary to repeat this answer to your 
letter with more details in the wheel of the panamanian crisis 
there is something that has awakened my curiosity and come to my 
attention how is it possible that the reagans administration who 
has publicly made gala of great love for god and have profound 
religious sentiment has campaigned terrible economic sanctions that 
have been imposed on the panamanian people causing the kind of 
suffering that you feel sincerely inhuman causing the threat of 
brutal military forces the sabotage the psychological war against 
a materially small and weak country but a dignified coungry just 
like panama is 
manuel solis palma is the actual head of state of panama by 
constitutional decision of the legislative assembly it is 
recognized by the supreme court of justice he has recently called 
for a sincere national dialogue between all the sectors of the 
panamanian society with the purpose of a specific solution for the 
democracy of our country with upcoming celebration of free and 
open elections of may 1989 
the defense forces support this cause by the panamanian chief of 
state and at the same time reject any imposition and any political 
and economic program that will be dictated from washington dc 
the word perpetuity has been historically imposed on panama 
by the unied states of america in the different canal treaties 
since 1903 nevertheless i assure you that those words do not 
form a part of my personal vocabulary nor of my honor in the 
military my duration as commander and chief of the defense forces 
is governed by the panamanian constitution and law of the defense 
forces 
you can do a lot to help by eliminating one of the principal 
causes of the suffering of many panamanians in other words the 
foreign intervention you may contribute by your knowledgeable 
advice and create by mutual communition the harmony and the 
material peace between all panamanians without discrimination of 
any class 
with my deepest respect for you i shall be at your disposition 
to speak with you more deeply about this theme whenever you are 
available 
attentively 
 
ps i have been lied about i have been villafied i have been 
humiliated internationally 
i consider myself to have been persecuted by illegal actions by 
socalled justice by political interests of your nation 
i as a christian before you denounce this untrue because how 
is it possible that nation as powerful should employ the services 
of journalistic misinformation the threat of death bdfore one of 
gods children such as i consider to be at the present time in 
this struggle 
this is my testimony reverend jackson before the divine and 
eternal laws of the allpowerful god 
i feel rich in faith and find my situation in isaiah 45 with 
all humility and reverence

an adviser to house speaker jim wright says he 
contacted oliver north associate richard miller nearly two years 
ago in a bid to broker a weapons deal for the contras but did not 
know he was tapping into the north private aid network 
in a deposition taken by congressional irancontra investigators 
and released monday richard pena said that he only met north once 
briefly and that miller may have mentioned north 
he said he had a sense that miller a public relations man with 
ties to the contras might be able to get a weapons offer to them 
and so pena asked him about the possibility in the spring of 1986 
wright a texas democrat and longstanding opponent of us 
military aid to the contras has said he had no idea his friend and 
adviser was trying to sell them weapons 
pena a former foreign affairs committee staff member has 
traveled to central america as wrights observer and emissary in 
the evolving peace process between the usbacked contras and the 
leftist nicaraguan government 
north is charged in the irancontra affair on a variety of 
counts stemming from his clandestine operation to supply the 
contras miller named north as a coconspirator when miller pleaded 
guilty to illegally using a taxexempt foundation for the 
nonexempt purpose of raising money to arm the contras 
rep dante fascell dfla the vice chairman of the house 
irancontra investigating committee said last week that he does 
not recall if the committee staff ever told him about penas 
connection or that pena had given a deposition pena was not called 
as a witness by the committee 
at the time of the contact with miller the house had approved 
100 million in new aid for the rebels after a cutoff that had left 
the contras supplied only through norths secret operation 
pena was trying to see that some of that money be used to 
purchase items such as grenades and bombs from a chilean arms 
manufacturer 
pena told the investigators he knew only that miller had a 
public relations involvement with the rebels but he sensed there 
was something there that could lead to an arms deal 
investigators asked him why he would go to the head of a 
washington public relations firm rather than just dealing directly 
with the contras from the start 
he seemed to have had a very good working relationship with 
them pena said he told me that he would talk to the right 
people in the administration 
but pena subsequently took the arms proposal directly to the 
contras according to documents referred to in his deposition he 
gave contra official bosco matamoros a list of weapons available 
from the chilean company industrias cardoen on aug 12 1986 
on aug 15 pena wrote a letter to a front company in the cayman 
islands that miller had set up to handle his contra transactons 
with north and to which he had told pena to address the proposal 
pena included the weapons list with his letter 
i passed it on to col north miller said in his deposition 
mr pena asked me to pass it on to whoever the appropriate person 
was 
pena said nothing ever came of the offer 
asked if he had any personal contact with north pena said he 
had met him many years ago at an organization of american states 
reception 
pena who works for a washington public relations firm has not 
returned several messages left at his office in the past 11 days

jesse jackson and massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis are virtually tied in the race for delegates from 
minnesota where a plurality of state convention delegates have 
moved into the uncommitted column 
dukakis whose campaign estimated last month that he would win 
more than twice as many national convention delegates as jackson in 
minnesota was clinging to a onevote lead among delegates elected 
to the state convention 
with returns from county conventions accounting for 75 percent 
of the 1262 delegates elected to the state convention dukakis was 
supported by 219 while jackson had 218 and illinois sen paul simon 
had 78 another 423 state convention delegates were uncommitted 
if these results held up at the state and congressional district 
conventions where minnesota democrats pick 78 of their national 
convention delegates in may and june jackson would win 19 national 
delegates dukakis would receive 18 simon would gain one and 40 
would be uncommitted 
i dont know if anything has really happened said tad 
devine who oversees national delegate selection for the dukakis 
campaign ive always viewed this as an evolving process 
we view this as a very active delegateselection process and 
well be trying in the weeks ahead to win as many delegates as we 
can from minnesota he said in a telephone interview from boston 
minnesotans began their delegateselection process on feb 23 
with precinct caucuses but because of a conflict with national 
party rules the results of those caucuses were never clearly 
reported 
minnesota secretary of state joan growe tried to produce a count 
on caucus night but the results were incomplete and in some places 
were tallied incorrectly 
the state party itself tried to produce a count two weeks later 
based on a paper ballot filled out at the caucuses but so many of 
the ballots were disallowed that those results too became 
unreliable 
based on growes results the dukakis campaign earlier had 
projected that dukakis would end up with 27 of the 78 minnesota 
national convention delegates that are elected through the process 
that begins with the precinct caucuses according to the dukakis 
campaigns initial tally jackson and simon would have received 13 
delegates each missouri rep richard gephardt would have received 
one and 24 delegates would have been uncommitted 
the dukakis campaign shut down its campaign office in minnesota 
following the precinct caucuses devine said dukakis campaign 
workers will be returning to minnesota after the tuesdays primary 
in wisconsin 
our plans are as soon as were through with wisconsin a 
number of people working there will be freed up to work on our 
efforts in minnesota and i expect we will put a lot of effort into 
that state he said 
in terms of the effort we would like to make there its most 
effective to work in the latter stages of the caucus process in 
terms of getting out your supporters devine said

if vice president george bush stumbles on his 
way to the white house this november erstwhile rival bob dole 
could wind up as the nations top gop spokesman 
the senate minority leader under a democratic administration 
could find himself playing the lead in a 1980s version of the 1960s 
ev and charlie show 
it might well be called the bob and bob show with dole being 
joined by house minority leader bob michel of illinois to counter a 
democratic presidents programs and present alternatives to them 
the ev of ev and charlie was senate minority leader everett 
mckinley dirksen of illinois 
dirksen teamed with house minority leader charles halleck of 
indiana in a regular series of televised news conferences dirksen 
became the undisputed mr republican of his era 
dole crowded out of the 1988 republican field by bush has 
returned to his leadership position in the senate serving notice 
he intends to prod the gop into opening its arms to a wider 
constituency 
republicans should dole says address issues of concern to the 
homeless and the poor and embrace programs to deal with narcotics 
day care education longterm health care medicaid and medicare 
we must above all give more americans a reason to come our 
way and at the same time strengthen the commitment of our 
staunchest supporters dole said last week 
with a sense of humor that can be dark and biting dole will 
have his own distinct style and image if he emerges as national 
spokesman for the gop 
dirksen was full of fun and thunder said dirksen biographer 
neil mcneil 
mcneil in his 1970 dirksen portrait of a public man said 
the senate minority leader became a television superstar despite a 
complete lack of the veneer said to be essential to a politician in 
the age of television 
his tousled hair long his trademark was an easily 
recognizable ensign mcneil wrote his deepthroated husky 
voice his flamboyant manners and his often astonishing use of a 
rococo vocabulary all tickled the viewing millions 
washington post cartoonist herblock caricatured dirksen as a 
melancholy clown halleck as a buffoon and straight man 
halleck resented the ev and charlie tag he took his 
partisanship seriously 
but dirksen said he liked the name said it reminded him of such 
other allamerican duos as corned beef and cabbage and ham and eggs 
some republicans said they thought the two stood in poor 
contrast to john f kennedy the nations new youthful and 
handsome democratic president 
one complained about dirksens fuzzy hair and hallecks 
big red nose 
none of this troubled dirksen mcneil wrote for even as 
the criticisms were being made he and halleck were getting 
television and press coverage to make the oppositions case against 
the kennedy administration in time he sensed the criticism would 
wane and he would be better off for the national notoriety he was 
now receiving 
dirksen and halleck used the ev and charlie routine to showcase 
criticism of the kennedy domestic program 
it may be called the new frontier but the kennedy program is 
the old new deal taken out of an old warming oven dirksen said 
he scored the administration for deficit spending increased 
government controls increases in the government payroll more 
welfare statism and that inevitable price which we must pay the 
piper more taxes 
by mid 1962 the ev and charlie show was fully launched and 
obviously effective in stating the republican case the ridicule 
evaporated 
no republican leader since has had anything quite resembling his 
disheveled flair rumpled charm and widespread appeal

panamas political crisis with 
its uncertainties and hardships has prompted concern among the 
more than 1100 americans and their families who still live in the 
former panama canal zone 
the artificially high quality of life the zone afforded 
americans for more than 60 years before it was returned to panama 
in 1979 has changed and there are fears that americans could be 
casualties of the political turmoil 
about 1300 american troops are to arrive this week to protect 
the 10000 soldiers assigned to watch the panama canal and to guard 
american lives and property 
but that does not convince all the americans in the zone that 
they are secure the us army is for the army said ann 
fahren the wife of a panama canal ship pilot who has lived in 
panama 10 years 
during the worst days of the recent crisis she said she was 
refused permission to shop at us militaryrun grocery stores even 
after the military advised against going into the city to shop 
because of protests and riots 
it burns me up she said the army should not have slammed 
its doors in our face 
when the panama canal zone existed it had its own police force 
courts clubs schools stores and even postage stamps the 10mile 
strip that ran the width of panama was a selfcontained subsidized 
enclave whose residents could forget they were in panama legally 
they were not 
the zone was turned over to panama in 1979 as part of the 1977 
treaties that transfer control of the canal to panama at the end of 
this century 
the zone is now feeling the problems of one of the regions more 
unstable countries since june panama has been rocked by 
sometimesviolent protests as opposition groups pushed for the 
ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega as head of the 15000member panamanian defense forces 
is the power behind the civilian government he is under indictment 
in the united states on federal drug trafficking charges 
panamas banks have been closed since march 3 creating a 
critical cash shortage the united states has frozen panamanian 
money held in us banks and imposed other economic sanctions 
the unguarded entrance to the canal zone is across a boulevard 
from one of panama citys toughest neighborhoods which is filled 
with old barracks used in some cases to house workers who built the 
canal for the united states from 1904 to 1914 
street gangs occasionally enter the area something unheard of 
in the old days 
its the lull before the storm said mrs fahren we used 
to go out to the beach everywhere now you dont even see people 
out on the streets 
some residents are thirdgeneration zonians as longterm 
residents are known but they are getting fewer and some zone 
residents talk now of sending families back to the united states 
i have a daughter who will go to florida state university this 
fall said jim kaufman deputy branch agent for the panama canal 
pilots association the organization of pilots who guide ships 
through the canal 
she is scheduled to come back but i may not bring her back 
said kaufman who has lived in panama 20 years 
i have a boy in the 11th grade and im looking for a place for 
him to stay in the states he said even if gen noriega goes 
tomorrow how long will it be before things are normal again here 
several residents said they were worried that the panamanian 
defense forces are responsible for their security 
what i see as the worse scenario the worst possible scenario 
is that the united states will keep the pressure up and back 
noriega into a corner and he will grab four or five americans as 
hostages said norm dixon also a canal ship pilot who already 
has sent his family back to florida 
he is one of 120 of the canals 230 pilots who works on a 
sixfour plan under which he works six weeks straight and has four 
weeks off 
there is a waiting list to get sixfour status kaufman said 
mostly because of pilots who want to send their families out and be 
with them for a month every six weeks a lot wanted to do so 
before all of this started now they really want to do it he 
said 
the number of americans in the old zone has been reduced by 
about half since the treaties were negotiated the americans either 
work for the canal or the us defense department 
some left the zone before the treaties were signed by former 
president jimmy carter and the late gen omar torrijos said john 
maher president of the pilots association others stayed hoping 
the treaties would not be ratified then left when they were 
the third exodus he said came in 1983 when panama assumed 
control of police functions in the former zone

with his ouster evan mecham joined a 
short but ignominious list of convicted governors among them a 
chief executive whoused the national guard to surround his capitol 
and one who declared martial law 
mondays vote by the state senate to sustain the two articles of 
impeachment made mecham the first us governor to be impeached and 
removed from office in 59 years 
legal scholars say impeachment was devised in england where 
parliament used it as a way to flex its muscle against kings and 
ministers impeachment was brought to america in colonial days as a 
way to protect democracy 
its basically youre fired impeachment is a way to get 
out of office those officials that violate the public trust said 
university of arizona law professor robert glennon 
had he been acquitted mecham would have joined the likes of 
thomas jefferson and huey long the flamboyant kingfish of 
louisiana among governors who were impeached by legislators but 
not convicted 
instead he became one of seven chief executives who have been 
removed from office including the first governor of nebraska and a 
pair of governors in oklahoma 
gov david butler of nebraska was removed in 1871 for 
misappropriating school funds but the impeachment proceedings 
subsequently were expunged from the legislative record and in 1888 
he was elected to another term as governor 
gov john c walton of oklahoma was removed in 1923 after he 
declared martial law and ordered the national guard to disband a 
grand jury that was investigating him 
gov henry s johnston also of oklahoma used equally strong 
tactics to try to prevent an investigation of him johnston ordered 
the national guard to surround the capitol to prevent the 
legislature from assembling to conduct the probe johnston who was 
removed in 1929 was the last governor ousted from office by 
legislators before mecham 
also on the list is gov william w holden of north carolina 
who was removed in 1871 after he unconstitutionally suspended the 
right of habeas corpus and sent militia to quell violence by the ku 
klux klan which was accused of murders aimed at frightening blacks 
into not voting 
in arizona the governor need only commit high crimes 
misdemeanors or malfeasance to face impeachment mecham 
convicted of obstruction of justice and misusing funds is the 
first arizona governor to be impeached 
jefferson was impeached by virginia colonial assembly in 1781 
among the charges was that he had fled with unseemly haste when 
british troops attacked the capital although the assembly soon 
backed down jefferson insisted on a trial and won vindication 
long was impeached on charges of misusing state funds in 1929 
the case was dropped when 15 senators enough to block conviction 
announced their support for the governor

two jet warplane crashes near 
west german nuclear power plants have increased criticism of nato 
pilottraining practices and one newspapers coverage of the issue 
has angered the us air force 
tens of thousands of west german protesters joined traditional 
easter peace marches and vigils that began saturday and lasted 
through monday 
this year the demonstrators not only called for scrapping 
nuclear arms but they also protested the two air crashes that 
occurred near atomic power plants just over 24 hours of each other 
last week 
the association for general aviation a west german organization 
of private pilots joined the protesters in demanding that nato 
keep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants 
the chance of the chernobyl nuclear accident was more than 
likely very slim but it happened anyway michael schultz 
spokesman for the group pointed out in a radio interview 
the respected wickert institute polled west germans and found 
that 15 percent want nato to halt its lowlevel military training 
flights over this nation twothirds of the 1710 people polled 
said such flights were necessary but the number should be reduced 
the tuebingenbased institute said saturday 
a french mirage jet fighter crashed on march 30 one mile from a 
nuclear power plant in the southern state of bavaria killing the 
pilot 
we escaped the worst imaginable accident by only a 
splitsecond herbert weinzierl head of the bavarian federation 
for nature protection said after the crash 
one day later a us air force f16 fighter jet crashed in the 
southern town of forst demolishing three houses and killing a 
resident and the pilot the accident occurred nine miles east of 
another nuclear power plant 
federal officials say nuclear power plants are sufficiently 
protected from even a direct hit by falling warplanes but 
protesters say such assurances are based only on theory 
west german newspapers have given intense coverage to the debate 
of the possible threat from jet warplane crashes 
on sunday the masscirculation bild am sonntag newspaper 
printed a frontpage article headlined this junk flies over our 
heads accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patchedup 
us air force f16 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified us employee at sembach 
air base located near the southwest city of kaiserslautern as 
saying poor maintenance and a shortage of spare parts made us 
f16 planes unsafe 
the report said 110000 lowlevel military practice flights were 
conducted over west germany annually by seven natomember air 
forces including the united states 
a us air force spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said us military officials were upset over what he described as 
bilds highly inaccurate report he said he could not verify 
how many lowlevel flights were made over west germany 
the spokesman said the americans would coordinate a response to 
the bild article because the united states is but one of several 
countries involved in lowlevel training flights here he declined 
to elaborate 
other nato nations that regularly train in west germany airspace 
include canada france the netherlands britain west germany and 
norway 
another spokesman told the associated press in a telephone 
interview from us air force european headquarters at ramstein air 
base that the photograph in bild was not of an f16 
the bild picture shows a nonoperational f4 which has been 
parked near the perimeter fence on sembach for some time said 
spokesman douglas moore 
its not an f16 and doesnt even have a motor its only used 
by technicians to practice fuselagepatching so they will be 
proficient in getting a damaged airplane back in the air in 
wartime moore said

michael dukakis and the democratic party 
establishment are holding their breath today while wisconsin votes 
not to mention new york gov mario cuomo and the 
scenariospinners who are watching the democratic drama play itself 
out 
in his wildest dreams dukakis probably never imagined that hed 
be engaged in a statebystate duel with jesse jackson for the 
nomination or running neckandneck with his black rival in a 
state that is 96 percent white and may have a profound influence 
over the winner of the democratic presidential marathon 
a victory would restore some of the luster that dukakis gained 
with his super tuesday wins last month in florida texas maryland 
and elsewhere a defeat would compound stinging losses in illinois 
and michigan and raise serious new questions about the 
massachusetts governors ability to compete 
a dukakis defeat would almost certainly lead to another round of 
cuomodrafting scenarios in the two weeks before the new york 
primary for all the talk of rallying around the candidate with the 
most delegates enough democratic party leaders are worried about a 
jacksonled party debacle this fall to make some sort of draft 
movement extremely likely if dukakis falters 
for jackson a victory would make him the leading contender in 
the nomination fight in fact if not in delegate totals a defeat 
might suggest that his remarkable campaign has peaked just as he 
moves into the delegaterich states of new york pennsylvania and 
ohio over the next month 
for sen albert gore a victory would be miraculous the result 
forecast by the polls third place would be another devastating 
finish to an expensive effort and already dukakis aides are 
seeking to undermine gores new york campaign 
the fourth man in the race sen paul simon of illinois would 
settle for survival 
dukakis the marathoner told reporters on monday i dont 
have to win in wisconsin i just have to win a good plurality 
of delegates by june 9 the day the primary season ends 
his aides were doing their best to cushion the impact of a 
possible defeat as well although tom loftus speaker of the 
wisconsin house of representatives told reporters i think 
dukakis is going to win by enough 3 4 5 points 
even before the polls opened today in wisconsin for the states 
democratic presidential primary dukakis aides were explaining why 
their man might lose in this industrial state to jackson as he did 
in michigan 10 days ago and in illinois before that 
the illinois loss was the result of facing two favorite sons at 
the same time jackson and simon the governors aides argued the 
michigan loss was the result of a primarycaucus hybrid and a large 
black vote in detroit that played into jacksons hands they added 
wisconsin allows crossover votes meaning that mischievous 
republicans could vote for the democrat who now appears to be least 
likely to beat george bush in november jackson 
so has it gone with the dukakis campaign in recent weeks trying 
to explain the last bigstate loss while hoping to lower public 
expectations about the contest just ahead all the while dukakis 
is hoping that the jackson tide will crest before it engulfs him 
dukakis took advantage of his connecticut primary victory and a 
full week of campaigning in wisconsin to retool his campaign he 
talked gingerly of differences between himself and jackson served 
lunch to senior citizens and visited hospitalized children in an 
attempt to shed his image as an aloof technocrat he unveiled a new 
speech designed to appeal to bluecollar voters 
all that simply raised the stakes for him in the state 
by whatever reckoning a loss in wisconsin would leave dukakis 
winless in the first three midwestern industrial states and raise 
fresh questions about whether he has the ability to gain the type 
of bluecollar support needed to produce a democratic victory in 
november 
from there its only a short hop to cuomo the governor of new 
york who has flirted all year with the democratic party and whose 
state holds the next primary in two weeks a dukakis victory in 
wisconsin would mean cuomo could only stay on the sidelines 
possibly deciding to embrace the massachusetts governor before new 
yorkers vote a jackson victory in wisconsin and the draftcuomo 
movement will take on new urgency 
forget about simon barring a miracle in wisconsin his 
candidacy is over 
what about gore going into wisconsin he had performed 
abysmally since his super tuesday successes on march 8 so poorly 
in fact that he is in debt and ineligible for federal campaign 
matching funds he poured money into wisconsin in hopes of gaining 
the 20 percent of the vote needed to requalify

sen nancy kassebaum isnt spurning talk

but shes also not taking it too seriously 
you know there are going to be 500 possible tickets between 
now and august the kansas republican said in a washington 
interview with the kansas city star 
part of the game will be for bush to keep throwing out a lot 
of names and speculation on who will be the vice presidential 
nominee thats the only game in town right now she said its 
presumptuous to think youd even be asked 
mrs kassebaum who is in japan this week was suggested for the 
vice presidential race eight years ago by sen si hayakawa of 
california to heal rifts in the gop on the abortion and the equal 
rights amendment issues she said at the time that she did not have 
the necessary experience and rejected the idea 
my staff keeps saying dont say no she told the star 
and she has followed their advice

republican presidential nomination say they are not developing a

backers of mario cuomo are suing in an 
attempt to force elections officials to place the new york 
governors name on californias june 7 democratic presidential 
primary ballot 
the suit filed monday against secretary of state march fong eu 
by the draft cuomo for president committee was scheduled for a 
hearing friday before presiding judge cecily bond of the sacramento 
county superior court 
eu has refused to list cuomo among generally recognized 
candidates who are automatically placed on californias 
presidential ballot because he has stated publicly he is not a 
candidate and she rejected the draft cuomo committee petitions 
last week on grounds they didnt contain enough voter signatures or 
meet other requirements 
attorney gerald hill state cochairman of the draft cuomo 
committee said his group is acting completely independent of cuomo 
as a true draft effort 
hill said his suit challenges the constitutionality of the state 
law eu cited in rejecting his draft petitions which he said 
contained the signatures of an estimated 17000 to 20000 
california voters 
eus office said she would have no comment on the suit until it 
is thoroughly reviewed but that she stood by her rejection of the 
cuomo petitions which not only didnt contain the required number 
of signatures but also didnt come as specified in the law from 
a group authorized by cuomo

democratic presidential hopefuls jesse jackson 
and sen paul simon oppose opening the shoreham nuclear power plant 
on long island while massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 
tennessee sen albert gore would support legislation to allow a 
federal agency to determine whether the area around the plant could 
be evacuated safely according to new york sen daniel p moynihan 
moynihan said monday he learned the candidates positions 
regarding the plant in their responses to a letter dated march 31 
in which he asked each his position on legislation he had 
introduced 
the federal emergency management agency has said long island 
could not be safely evacuated without the cooperation of state and 
local officials who have refused to participate in such planning 
however in a controversial flipflop the nrc changed its own 
rules last year to allow the commission to assume that state and 
local officials would cooperate during an actual nuclear emergency 
moynihan introduced legislation last year to require the nrc to 
abide by femas decision the bill was defeated in committee

democratic presidential contender 
albert gore jr predicted he would get a boost in todays wisconsin 
primary from the undecided vote swinging his way 
public opinion surveys showed gore and illinois sen paul simon 
trailing massachusetts gov michael dukakis and jesse jackson of 
chicago in the primary in which 81 democratic delegates are at 
stake 
but gore predicted he will get a bigger share of the wisconsin 
vote than polls indicated 
its now clear to me after the conversations with voters of 
the last few days and on the basis of the telephone calls to 
undecided voters that the undecided vote here in wisconsin is 
shifting decisively in our favor he said 
gore who did well in last months super tuesday contests is in 
need of a northern win and a victory here would give him a boost 
going into the new york primary on april 19 
gore trailed far behind the two frontrunners in mondays 
colorado caucuses 
speaking to supporters monday in this community troubled by 
business shutdowns and layoffs gore said corporations must be 
encouraged to invest their profits in expansion that creates jobs 
and that an employer should be required to give adequate notice to 
his workers when planning to close shop 
i was an original cosponsor of the legislation to require a 
different approach to plant closings to have notification of plant 
closings and projected layoffs gore said 
this would give working men and women an opportunity to make 
other plans and to get job training and would also provide them 
the opportunity to work with management to try to salvage a plant 
before it closes he said 
a day earlier gore said dukakis has been absolutely timid 
about criticizing jackson 
michael dukakis gives the impression of being scared to death 
that is the opposite of the bold leadership gore said as he 
campaigned in wisconsin 
the tennessee senator criticized both rivals for their lack of 
experience in national affairs 
neither dukakis nor jackson has had as much as a single day in 
national government to prepare themselves for the presidency 
gore said 
gore said it was likely the democratic national convention would 
meet in atlanta with no candidate possessing enough delegate 
strength to win the nomination 
it likely will go more than one ballot he said its 
going to be a long hard contest

some mecham supporters just shook their 
heads in disbelief others cried and one victorious opponent said 
she was heartsick but through it all evan mecham sat 
stonefaced as his governorship was taken from him 
it should have been close i dont know what happened said 
millie pratt who had joined a knot of formerly festive supporters 
before monday nights senate vote singing and chanting outside the 
capitol 
i feel betrayed by our legislature i had more faith in them 
a few supporters cried outside the senate chambers as the voting 
was heard on portable televisions and radios some booed and vowed 
to oust those voting against mecham next november others just 
shook their heads in disbelief 
inside mecham sat at the defense table between lawyers and 
showed virtually no emotion as the vote removing him from office 
was tallied 219 on the charge of obstructing justice 246 on the 
charge of misusing funds 
well they dont like my politics so we finished a political 
trial its as simple as that mecham told reporters smiling 
broadly in the hallway before a quick departure from the capitol 
mecham wasnt required to attend the vote and his attorney 
jerris leonard said earlier he had advised him to stay away the 
governor listened as senators explained their votes some 
castigating the firstterm republican as a liar and accusing him of 
misusing power 
as mecham sat at the defense table leonard said he gave him 
the impression that he was almost resigned to the fact that he 
knew it was coming 
mecham became the first us governor to be impeached and 
removed from office in nearly six decades 
theres no joy in anyones hearts today said democrat lela 
alston who voted to convict on both counts im heartsick 
a small number outside cheered the conviction but most of the 
200 or so assembled came to support the ousted governor they sang 
god bless america after the verdict and cheered mecham as he 
departed and offered a brief wave to the crowd 
its no surprise said andy cosentino its a kangaroo 
court 
many in the crowd listened to the proceedings on a sound system 
used by a country n western band to entertain protesters the 
festivities even included a homegrown version of the ditty 
elvira ev meeecham 
the loudest cheer of the day came when the senate declined to 
invoke the dracula clause a measure that would have barred 
mecham from holding future office in arizona 
earlier some 300 mecham supporters staged an 11th hour protest 
and mock funeral for the arizona constitution complete with 
trumpters playing taps and pallbearers toting a black wooden 
coffin 
it turned out to be a burial for mechams administration 
some wore railroad attire and blew a trainlike whistle and 
paper railroad tracks were laid across the plaza because mecham 
supporters said the embattled chief executive was being railroaded 
by the legislature a thank heaven for evan sign was taped to 
the building 
the antimecham group included barry gabriel who carried a sign 
saying simply guilty guilty guilty 
im very happy and relieved i think hes a menace and i 
think hes clearly guilty of malfeasance said gabriel who took 
time out during the voting to snap a few pictures of the crowd and 
the reporters assembled outside 
this is history he said nothing like this will ever 
happen again

fortythree percent of imported aerosol 
cosmetics contained chlorofluorocarbon compounds banned as 
propellants by the united states 10 years ago according to the 
customs service 
the noncompliance rate is below some spot checks in the past 
according to don cousins chief of the technical branch in the 
office of technical services in the customs service the figure has 
been as high as 60 percent he said monday 
customs has never before undertaken anything like the current 
checks in operation ozone which spokesman dennis shimkoski 
said constituted pretty near 100 percent of all pending imports 
the service checked 442 samples of aerosol products since feb 
15 said shimkoski of those 188 contained the offending compounds 
more than 60 different products were represented in the samples 
shimkoski said most were perfumes made in france but deodorants 
baby powders and shaving creams also were found 
the united states banned almost all use of chlorofluorocarbon 
or cfc compounds as aerosol propellants in 1978 out of concern 
that they might be attacking the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high 
that shields the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the

democratic presidential contender michael dukakis 
edged ahead of rival jesse jackson in colorados precinct caucuses 
early tuesday after a night of furious seesaw battling 
meanwhile republicans pointed to vice president george bush as 
their heavy favorite 
with 1234 of colorados 2784 precincts reporting or 44 
percent dukakis had 45 percent to jacksons 40 percent tennessee 
sen albert gore had just 4 percent and sen paul simon did not 
garner enough votes at monday nights caucuses to register any 
support 
dukakis had moved to an early lead in preliminary sample 
results but that evaporated when returns from denver began coming 
in later however he moved ahead again 
democratic state chairman buie seawell a dukakis supporter 
said early tuesday that jackson had done one hell of a job in a 
state that is not jackson country 
in colorado dukakis and jackson were fighting it out for 45 
national convention delegates and bragging rights to a victory on 
the eve of the wisconsin primary 
the colorado democratic caucuses took on added importance 
because of the tight race for delegates that has developed between 
jackson and dukakis with tennessee sen albert gore jr trailing 
republicans also held caucuses to begin the process of selecting 
36 delegates to the republican national convention 
republican straw poll results suggested bush was winning 
overwhelmingly the gop expected bush to capture most of the 
republian support here despite weekend appearances in colorado by 
former television evangelist pat robertson 
sigrid freese a state democratic spokeswoman expected only 
15000 to 20000 of colorados 570301 registered democrats to 
attend the caucuses it depends on how good the ncaa championship 
basketball game is she said of the monday night game 
at one caucus in precinct 31 in grand junction the 
21member caucus solved that problem by recessing for 35 minutes to 
watch the game 
the two democratic frontrunners campaigned in colorado over the 
weekend and both campaigns aired tv ads in hopes of attracting 
supporters to the caucuses in onetime candidate gary harts home 
state 
seawell predicted dukakis could land 15 to 20 delegates and 
jackson 15 with the remaining delegates either uncommitted or 
backing gore who was expected to attract support outside 
metropolitan denver 
jackson presented himself as the candidate of hope and invoked 
the memory of martin luther king jr whose was assassinated 20 
years ago hope has been unleashed jackson told a crowd of 
churchgoers sunday 
dukakis endorsed by seawell and gov roy romer visited denver 
on saturday continuing to sound his theme that he is a doer 
and not just a talker but avoiding direct criticism of jackson 
some political observers said the key to winning democratic 
delegates was in the hispanic community where dukakis with his 
command of the spanish language and jackson with his appeal to 
minorities both hoped to fare well 
seawell says the outcome of future contests in california new 
mexico and arizona which have large hispanic populations may 
depend on which candidate can win hispanic voters here 
hispanics make up about 12 percent of the registered voters 
statewide 
blacks expected to support jackson comprise 4 percent of 
registered democrats

his governorship gone his ailing auto 
dealership sold evan mecham faces a future in which one of the few 
certainties is his role as defendant in a criminal trial 
but for arizona the future looks brighter without the shadow of 
mechams embarrassing impeachment trial hanging over the state 
said rose mofford who became governor with mechams removal 
today we have reached the end of some difficult times in 
arizona mrs mofford a democrat said monday i know the 
decision made by the senate today was not reached lightly it is 
time to put all that behind us and move forward 
today none of us are republicans none of us are democrats 
she said we are all arizonans let us go forward together as 
arizonans 
the impeached firstterm republican was stripped of his office 
monday when the senate convicted him of trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat and misusing the 
governors protocol fund 
the end of the trial did not heal the divisions that arose 
during mechams turbulent 15 months in office predictably the 
verdict was praised by mecham opponents and condemned by supporters 
some legislators received police protection monday night after 
getting threatening phone calls that were prompted by the vote 
said department of public safety spokesman allan schmidt 
theyve been all types of intimidatingtype threatening 
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate schmidt 
said 
mechams future troubles could include a maximum 22year prison 
sentence if he is convicted on charges of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan 
he faces trial april 21 in maricopa county superior court on six 
felony counts of fraud perjury and filing false documents his 
brother willard who was his 1986 campaign treasurer faces three 
similar counts 
the senate threw out an impeachment count based on the 350000 
loan issue 
although the senate did not bar mecham from holding public 
office again his lawyer jerris leonard indicated after the 
impeachment vote that mecham may decide to bow out of politics 
i think there is doubt he said of whether mecham would try 
to appeal his case to voters in a recall election may 17 
it was not clear whether the ousted governor could remain on the 
recall ballot given him impeachment conviction the matter probably 
will be decided by the courts said attorney general bob corbin 
leonard said i think the decision of where we go from now is 
dependent on whether or not the governor himself wants to stay in 
politics and thats something that hes got to decide overnight 
after mondays conviction mecham left the senate chamber 
smiling asked what he planned next he said well decide 
tomorrow or the next day were keeping all our options open 
after he was impeached by the house of representatives on feb 
5 the 63yearold mecham hinted he might give up politics if i 
can be of service fine he said if not id enjoy private 
life the best person doesnt always win politics is not my 
favorite pastime 
mecham ran for governor five times before being elected in 1986 
although mechams son dennis testified last week that their 
mecham pontiac dealership in suburban glendale was thriving he 
announced a day later that theyd been forced to sell it for 4 
million because of dwindling sales 
dennis mecham said bad publicity surrounding his fathers 
political battles had driven customers away 
the dealership was sold last week

daughters seira candy sakai 5 and rina stephanie sakai 4 all 
three died of smoke inhalation haradon said 
mitsue and hideo sakai had been having marital problems the 
investigator said 
the murdersuicide known in japanese as oyako shinju is a 
tradition in which parents planning suicide feel obliged to kill 
their children so they will not be orphans 
mrs sakai who moved to the united states from kobe japan 
about eight years ago and her husband hideo from yokohama were 
described by acquaintances as quiet and hardworking people 
mrs sakai worked at the mitsuyoshi japanese restaurant in 
anaheim her husband is head chef at the amagi japanese restaurant 
in buena park 
yoshikazu suzuki owner of the amagi restaurant said the couple 
met at his establishment about seven years ago when mrs sakai 
worked there as a waitress 
if she lost hope or something she cannot let the children 
live suzuki said i know of many cases in japan like that 
an estimated 300 cases of oyako shinju are reported each year in 
japan authorities said 
the tragedy recalled the case of fumiko kimura a japaneseborn 
woman whose two young children died when she walked into the sea 
with them at santa monica in 1985 her motherchild suicide attempt 
was carried out in shame over her husbands alleged adultery 
mrs kimura pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was 
placed on five years probation 
although oyako shinju is illegal in japan it is considered an 
honorable way to die and lingers in the culture said mamoru iga a 
professor of sociology at california state university northridge 
and author of the thorn in the chrysanthemum suicide and 
economic success in modern japan 
iga said the crime is most often committed by mothers who have 
money problems or bad marriages

a panel of arbitrators has sided with smokey 
the cat saying the owners of an office supply business were not 
negligent for keeping the feline in their store after it was 
accused of scratching a customer 
news of the case prompted patrons of jr weldin amp co and 
numerous others to contribute more than 2000 to the defense fund 
of the 17yearold somewhat asthmatic cat 
he smokey is a star said store manager margaret brown 
who denied the cat attacked customer nicole sikorski as long as 
hes living he wont leave the store 
at a hearing monday attended by about 45 smokey supporters a 
panel of three lawyers from the arbitration division of allegheny 
county common pleas court rejected the claims of ms sikorski 24 
of suburban upper saint clair 
the arbitrators said they awarded no damages to ms sikorski 
because her attorney failed to prove damages or show smokey has a 
record of attacking customers 
ms sikorski had been seeking an unspecified award for nominal 
damages plus 1500 in punitive damages and another 1500 for her 
scars 
ms sikorski testified that smokey came from nowhere and 
sank his front claws into her left wrist while she was making a 
purchase in october she said she has a tiny scar and about a 
halfdozen pinprick marks on the back of her wrist 
smokeys defense fund will be divided among the humane society 
animal friends the animal rescue league and the society for the 
prevention of cruelty to animals ms brown said

democratic presidential contender michael dukakis carved out a 
narrow lead over rival jesse jackson early tuesday as votes were 
counted in colorados caucuses each of the frontrunners had hoped 
for a solid win to provide bounce going into tuesdays 
wisconsin primary but there was no clear winner when counting was 
called off for the night 
with 1234 of 2784 precincts reporting or 44 percent dukakis 
had 46 percent to jacksons 40 percent tennessee sen albert gore 
jr lagged far behind with 4 percent and sen paul simon wasnt 
registering any support from the monday night caucuses 
late monday preliminary returns from a party sampling of 130 
precincts gave dukakis a 21 lead over jackson but when denver 
precincts began weighing in with tallies early tuesday morning 
dukakis lead disappeared in a jackson surge then dukakis battled 
his way back 
the democratic party quit counting for the night at about 430 
am edt the results were still too incomplete to determine 
conclusively how many national convention delegates each candidate 
won 
meanwhile jackson came under fire for his contact with 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
earlier dukakis called jacksons involvement in the panama 
situation a bad idea 
gore also criticized jacksons correspondence with noriega but 
he blasted dukakis for being absolutely timid of jackson 
the massachusetts governor dismissed gore and his comments i 
dont know what hes serious about 
jackson dukakis and gore were joined by simon campaigning 
across wisconsin on monday simon is trailing badly in his effort 
to win here and keep his campaign alive while gore needs a good 
showing in the state to boost his faltering effort 
simon urged voters in milwaukee to send a message tuesday 
were not going to follow the pollsters were going to elect the 
man best qualified to be president he said quipping al gore 
agrees with that too 
dukakis aides emphasized how close the race is in wisconsin 
but tom loftus speaker of the wisconsin state assembly and a 
dukakis backer said the massachusetts governor is going to win 
by enough three four or five points 
jackson and dukakis the frontrunners in both states awaited 
the slow dribble of results from the 2784 precinct caucuses in 
colorado that will divide 45 national convention delegates 
the republicans were holding caucuses monday night in colorado 
as well as the democrats with vice president george bush already 
having locked up the nomination pat robertsons effort to win some 
of the states 36 gop delegates was a symbolic gesture 
jackson and dukakis are the frontrunners in the ap delegate 
count before the colorado results were known dukakis had 65355 
votes and jackson 64655 gore had 3818 and simon 1695 a total 
of 4686 were uncommitted at the atlanta in july 2082 votes are 
needed to win 
jackson again released his letter along with a reply from 
noriega on monday in his letter the panamanian dictator rejects 
jacksons plea in a march 22 letter to leave the country 
i remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the 
panamanian people for gen noriega to leave today i reiterate my 
public moral appeal for him to depart jackson said 
but jacksons involvement in the turbulent panamanian situation 
drew criticism from the state department and from dukakis and gore 
in our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that noriega 
likes to use to buy time said state spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
however jackson said he had talked monday afternoon by 
telephone with highranking state department officials john c 
whitehead the deputy secretary of state and michael h armacost 
undersecretary of state for political affairs and said they 
offered no disagreement with his appeal for noriega to leave 
dukakis told reporters in milwaukee that i think its a bad 
idea for a private citizen to try to inject himself into a 
delicate international situation but the massachusetts governor 
added he thought jackson had acted out of good intentions 
gore said jackson had met with other foreign leaders such as 
plo chief yasser arafat and libyan strongman moammar gadhafi 
jackson campaign spokesman eric easter though said jackson had 
never met with the libyan leader 
he didnt help matters in his meetings with arafat and 
gadhafi gore said in madison i seriously doubt if he would 
help in panama 
simon for his part would not join the chorus of criticism of 
jackson i dont criticize someone who is not on the inside so 
to speak on how he feels hed handle these things he said 
gore saved his strongest criticism for dukakis for not hitting 
jackson harder 
michael dukakis gives the impression of being scared to 
death to criticize jackson and appears absolutely timid gore 
said that is the opposite of the bold leadership the nation 
needs 
gore told the new york times that dukakis actions are a 
subtle form of racism 
dukakis was clearly irritated by gore 
sen gore ought to start camaigning for the presidency 
dukakis said cutting off a reporter who sought to question him on 
the issue 
gore lumped dukakis and jackson together saying neither has 
had as much as a single day in national government that would 
prepare them to be president 
that criticism of jackson was echoed by sen sam nunn the 
georgia democrat who declined to enter the 1988 democratic 
presidential race 
i just dont think he has the experience and i just disagree 
with him on some basic foreign policy and defense questions nunn 
told reporters in georgia 
nunn said jackson should not view opposition within the party as 
racist i dont think it should be deemed an insult or racist 
he said 
and he said jackson cant win the white house if nominated i 
dont think thered be much chance of winning 
that view was echoed by former president nixon 
if he is nominated it goes without saying he cannot win but 
everyone is overplaying the fact that he would be a liability 
because he is black nixon told the washington times that is 
simply not true jackson would be a liability because his views are 
radical 
there was good news on the fundraising front for jackson who 
shocked even his own campaign by raising more than 2 million in 
march jackson who has run a lowbudget campaign until now will 
spend the money on advertising in new yorks crucial april 19 
primary

convicted kidnapper kenneth parnell will be 
a marked man if he decides to return to mendocino county where 
he was arrested for holding two boys captive eight years ago a 
county official said 
let him go to some other state let him stay away from this 
county theres still hard feelings here mendocino county 
supervisor john cimolino state department of corrections spokesman 
bob gore said parnell is to be discharged from parole today but 
that his office was not aware of any protest over the action 
parnell 56 was paroled to alameda county in the san francisco 
bay area after serving five years in prison for kidnapping steven 
stayner then 7 from merced on dec 4 1972 and timothy white 
then 5 from ukiah on valentines day in 1980 both boys were 
abducted while walking home from school 
although stayner said parnell regularly sexually abused him 
charges of child abuse against parnell were dismissed in 1981 when 
a state appeals court said the statute of limitations had expired 
word of parnells release angered stayner who said he cant 
forgive him during the trial stayner testified that parnell 
ordered him to call him dad renamed him dennis parnell and 
told people stayner was his son throughout the eight years they 
roamed northern california living in trailer parks and motels 
a psychologist testified during parnells trial that stayner had 
been brainwashed by parnell and for years was unable to attempt 
escape 
stayner now a 23yearold college student and father of two 
said parnell remains a threat to children 
i pity him for the sickness he has i wouldnt trust him 
around any child of any age said stayner who hopes to become a 
police officer 
stayner said he escaped from parnell on march 1 1980 and 
hitchiked 40 miles with white to seek help from ukiah police to 
save the boy from sexual abuse parnell had kidnapped white two 
weeks earlier and held him in a oneroom cabin in a remote area 
west of ukiah 
when parnell was released from prison in 1985 former mendocino 
county district attorney joseph allen expressed concern theres 
no doubt in my mind he will do it again allen said 
mike echols a coloradobased author who wrote an nbctv 
ministeries about the parnell case said parnell told him six 
months ago that he planned to move to mendocino when his parole 
expired 
his parole conditions had required him to stay in alameda 
county attend weekly therapy sessions and stay away from children 
he also was prohibited from traveling through mendocino or merced 
counties 
hes a free man of course cimolino said were powerless 
to do anything about where he goes but if he comes to ukiah i 
think hell be a marked man 
echols said parnell a former hotel clerk and drifter has lived 
in a berkeley boarding house since 1985 working as a shortorder 
cook and dishwasher between bouts of unemployment 
people have yet to forget what took place said ag 
rochester mendocino countys undersheriff and yet unless he 
breaks a law theres not much we can do about it 
the county opposed parnells threeyear parole to that area 
when because of good behavior and work credits he was released 
from prison after serving five years of his concurrent eightyear 
eightmonth sentences for his two kidnapping convictions

gov michael s dukakis fresh from a flurry of 
campaigning in wisconsin was optimistic about the outcome of 
todays democratic presidential primary in that state as he 
returned to his home base 
we worked hard dukakis said shortly after his chartered jet 
landed at logan international airport just before midnight monday 
it looks good he said of his wisconsin campaign but you 
never know until the votes come in 
early today dukakis and jesse jackson were still dueling 
furiously for a firstplace finish in monday nights colorado 
caucuses early returns put dukakis well ahead but the race 
narrowed dramatically in the wee hours of the morning as denver 
returns began coming in 
when the democratic party finished counting for the night 
dukakis held a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over jackson but 
fewer than half the precincts were in and counting was not to 
resume until late this afternoon 
before he left wisconsin monday dukakis promised in a speech in 
stevens point that he would avoid criticism of rival jackson 
ive been in politics for 25 years and this is the first time 
ive been attacked for not attacking somebody else dukakis said 
at the university of wisconsinstevens point before a crowd of 
2000 
that was in reference to another democratic contender tennessee 
sen lbert gore jr repeatedly blasting dukakis for being too 
timid about taking on jackson 
dukakis also said he believes that either he or jackson will 
have a substantial lead in delegates by the end of the primary 
season in june 
in his final wisconsin appearance before heading home dukakis 
told supporters that every vote counts 
when you go home tonight make a few phone calls get a hold 
of your neighbors believe me your work will make the 
difference dukakis said 
this is a very tight race its a very competitive race he 
said 
after dukakis left the state wisconsin assembly speaker tom 
loftus told a reporter he believed dukakis would come out the 
winner in todays presidential preference primary 
the independent the sen paul simon voters are turning his 
way said loftus 
simon of illinois has trailed far behind frontrunners dukakis

former gov evan mecham was removed from 
office by the legislature because he was too loyal to some aides 
and disregarded advice from politicians who could have helped him 
both supporters and opponents say 
but some observers were more critical of the firstterm 
governor who was convicted by the state senate on monday 
heres a guy who was going to clean up state government 
because it was too corrupt and he brings in a whole legion of 
people who are accused in various sorts of ways of being corrupt 
and some are facing trial now said democratic minority leader 
alan stephens 
mecham exhibited a pattern of behavior that is given to deceit 
as standard operating procedure added sen greg lunn 
still others said the former republican governor failed to build 
support apparently forgetting that he won the governorship with 
only 40 percent of the vote in a threeway race 
youve got to understand that here was a man who was elected 
essentially without the press and without the republican party 
what he forgot was that he couldnt survive without them 
said former top mecham aide sam steiger who resigned to face an 
extortion charge for allegedly trying to influence a parole board 
members vote 
even mecham backers did not agree with his claim that he was a 
victim of a conspiracy by legislators and others in the gop 
establishment such as attorney general bob corbin 
mecham insisted on making max hawkins a loyal backer director 
of the department of administration despite strong opposition from 
many legislators hawkins eventually admitted that he told the 
governor an alleged death threat by doa aide lee watkins was a 
lot of hot air and would go away 
on monday mecham was convicted of obstructing a state 
investigation of the alleged death threat one of two impeachment 
articles that led to his removal 
watkins himself was allowed to stay on for a while after 
allegedly making the threat and after a decadesold youthful 
robbery conviction came to light 
in addition mecham ignored advice from his chief of staff jim 
colter who said it would be politically unwise to loan 80000 
from the governors protocol fund to mecham pontiac on the basis 
of that loan mecham was also convicted monday of misusing state 
funds 
sen james sossaman a republican who generally has supported 
the governor said he believed mechams problems stemmed more from 
perception of his inability to make a good chief executive 
officer for the state of arizona than whether he committed any 
crimes 
mechams relations with the media and the legislature were often 
stormy spurred on by his continual ability to undermine his own 
credibility by silly or stupid statements said senate majority 
leader bob usdane a republican 
lunn also a republican cited the governors claim in senate 
testimony retracted a day later that the former head of his 
security detail had stolen a report from colters desk 
former governor and us sen paul fannin was a member of a 
group of arizona elder statesmen formed last summer to help 
mecham with his troubles fannin said he advised the governor to 
try harder to get along with the media and the legislature but 
hes very stubborn and determined in his ways 
house speaker joe lane contended however that mechams 
relations with the legislature were really no worse than those of 
his predecessor democrat bruce babbitt

several players in a national 
desegregation drama will return to the university of alabama to 
mark the 25th anniversary of the day thengov george c wallace 
tried to block the entrance of two black students 
to commemorate the event june 11 a milestone in the civil 
rights struggle the university will host a threeday symposium 
called opening doors featuring some of the nations leading 
scholars on race relations 
the university felt the best way to recognize this event was 
through a symposium that focuses not only on the history of race 
relations the stand in the door but also the present and future 
of race relations said professor e culpepper clark who is 
writing a book on that era 
clark and harry knopke a university official helping to arrange 
the symposium said they believe the school was an unwilling pawn 
in power plays between wallace and the administration of president 
john kennedy 
the university had a very substantive productive plan for 
integrating knopke said in the late 1950s and early 1960s the 
administration and others were looking seriously at ways to 
integrate there was a plan already in place for doing that when 
wallace started speaking 
the university was just in the middle of it 
among those who have agreed to take part in the symposium which 
will end june 11 is nicholas katzenbach who as assistant attorney 
general faced off with wallace in the doorway of foster auditorium 
a few hours before students vivian malone and jimmy hood walked in 
to register 
also agreeing to take part are miss malone now mrs mack jones 
of atlanta frank rose president of the university at the time 
thendean john l blackburn and george lemaistre a prominent 
tuscaloosa businessman who organized community support for the 
schools desegregation 
we wanted to bring back some of the individuals who were 
involved in the wallace stand to share their perspectives knopke 
said we want to make something positive out of it something 
productive and informative 
sen edward kennedy dmass was invited to represent his slain 
brothers the president and robert kennedy who was attorney 
general in 1963 but he said he had another commitment 
knopke said he doubted that wallace who has been in poor 
health will be able to attend but that documentary footage of the 
governors stand will be shown 
wallace has said he made his stand to reduce the possibility of 
violence at the university although critics said it increased 
tensions 
an array of scholars will present papers dealing with race 
relations today and what can be expected in the future clark said 
there is always in the minds of alabamians the fact that 25 
years later we are far different than in 1963 yet we still 
sometimes get in our minds that were frozen in 1963 he said 
what happened then is history and were a far different people 
than we were then 
the schooldoor standoff clark said was a test of wills 
between wallace and the kennedy administration the state of 
alabama and federal authorities wallace he said has since 
acknowledged that he made a terrible public relations mistake 
clark said the university with 10 percent black enrollment 
today is so long past all that in the actual workings of this 
institution and carrying out its mission that sometimes we have to 
pinch ourselves to see if that were really us and if it were what 
does it have to do with us now 
that he said is the purpose of the symposium

a deal has been struck under which france 
and iran will resume diplomatic relations and three frenchmen held 
by a proiranian group in lebanon will be released two sources in 
damascus said today 
if there are no lastminute snags the release could come in 
the next few days one of the sources said 
in paris the french foreign ministry would not comment on the 
report british and lebanese newspapers also have reported that 
representatives of france and iran have been meeting secretly to 
work out a hostage deal 
the two sources in damascus declined to be identified but have 
proved reliable on hostage matters in the past they said a special 
envoy of the french government spent two days negotiating with the 
hostage takers in their stronghold in lebanons bekaa valley 
the sources said the envoy alexandre stefani an associate of 
french interior minister charles pasqua and an unidentified 
lebanese businessman returned to damascus on monday through a 
checkpoint on the lebanesesyrian border controlled by the syrian 
army 
the sources said stefani and the lebanese businessman were 
involved in previous negotiations which led to the release nov 27 
1987 of two french hostages 
the three french hostages held in lebanon are jeanpaul kaufman 
42 a journalist taken may 22 1985 and two diplomats marcel 
carton 63 and marcel fontaine 46 both seized march 22 1985 
the kidnappings were claimed by islamic jihad or islamic holy 
war a group of moslems of the shiite sect loyal to irans leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
moslem militants claimed in march 1985 that they killed a fourth 
french hostage researcher michel seurat but no body has been 
found 
shiite militants loyal to iran are believed to hold most of the 
22 foreign hostages in lebanon including nine americans the 
longest held hostage is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the two frenchmen released last november were jeanlouis 
normandin 34 a lighting engineer for frances antenne2 
television who was kidnapped march 8 1986 and roger auque 31 a 
freelance photographer kidnapped jan 13 1987 
france broke relations with iran in july 1987 in a dispute over 
an employee of the iranian embassy in paris who refused to give 
evidence to a french court on terrorist incidents 
the beirut daily assafir on march 31 reported progress in 
secret negotiations to free the three hostages in london the 
daily mail quoting unidentified french intelligence sources 
reported monday that iran and france are close to sealing a hostage 
deal 
france released a terrorist suspect mohamed mohajer a lebanese 
shiite on march 24 it cited insufficient evidence to hold him for 
involvement in a series of 1986 bombings officials denied at the 
time the release had anything to do with the hostage negotiations

the government is trying to deport a latvian 
accused of collaborating with the nazis in a case described by one 
federal official as so strong i would not want to be defending 
it 
konrads kalejs came to united states in 1959 saying he was a 
farmer in latvia what he failed to disclose the government 
maintains is that he belonged to a pronazi police unit in world 
war ii that killed jews by the thousands 
its main task was essentially rounding people up guarding 
them and killing them said raul hilberg a political science 
professor at the university of vermont and an expert on the 
holocaust 
hilberg was the governments main witness monday as the 
immigration and naturalization service opened deportation hearings 
the government said it has evidence that kalejs was a commander 
in the latvian security auxiliary police whose leader was 
convicted in 1979 of the murders of at least 13000 people from 
194144 
in 1985 the justice department filed for kalejs deportation 
saying he lied on his entrance visa and would not have been 
admitted to this country if officials had known about his past 
the governments case is expected to last several weeks during 
that time attorneys plan to summon witnesses who survived the 
latvian death camps and present documents detailing the actions of 
kalejs and the unit 
kalejs 74 of winnetka had little to say during proceedings 
monday he stared straight ahead as hilberg testified occasionally 
chewing gum and whispering to his attorney ivars berzins 
as he stepped onto an elevator kalejs was asked for comment and 
replied good morning thats all my comment 
berzins also refused to discuss the case 
this is one of the strongest cases i have witnessed said 
bruce j einhorn deputy litigation director of the justice 
departments nazihunting arm this case involves some very 
powerful evidence i would not want to be defending it 
during the first day of testimony before immigration judge 
anthony d petrone government attorney aron golberg asked hilberg 
to describe the german invasion of latvia and the formation of the 
police unit in charge of killing jews 
hilberg the author of the book the destruction of the 
european jews said the latvian security auxiliary police was 
formed shortly after german troops seized control of the country 
from the soviets 
the security police was comprised mostly of latvians who admired 
adolf hitler and welcomed the german invasion 
some of them wanted action wanted to be associated with 
power he said there was also promise here of compensation

at one denver neighborhood caucus democrats split 
their county convention delegates between jesse jackson and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis after the state party chairman 
and a prominent state senator took opposite sides 
at a gop caucus not far away republicans went for vice 
president george bush in a straw poll except for one diehard 
supporter for kansas sen robert dole who has dropped out of the 
race 
at a grand junction democratic caucus a timeout was called so 
participants could watch the final minutes of the kansasoklahoma 
game for the ncaa basketball championship 
and at the executive mansion of gov roy romer where another 
democratic precinct caucus was held dukakis was the 2to1 
favorite 
at 2784 democratic caucuses and the same number of gop 
neighborhood gatherings across colorado on monday night coloradans 
took the first step in choosing delegates to their national party 
conventions this summer 
the spotlight was on democrats because of the tight 
jacksondukakis race and because the colorado caucuses could give 
one of the candidates momentum going into todays wisconsin 
primary at stake were 45 of the states 51 democratic delegates to 
the national convention 
the interest level was reflected by turnout which was 
considered good at democratic caucuses and thin at gop gatherings 
party officials said 
on the republican side bush was expected to capture most of 
colorados 36 gop delegates to the republican national convention 
although bush campaign officials were wary of an ambush by pat 
robertson who spent three days in colorado on easter weekend the 
ambush failed to materialize in early returns 
state democratic chairman buie seawell and regis groff a black 
state senator from denver took opposite sides at denvers precinct 
822 with seawell endorsing dukakis and groff urging support for 
jackson 
seawell who is one of six colorado super delegates to the 
national convention and already committed to dukakis said dukakis 
not only has governed massachusetts well but i believe michael 
dukakis can win 
groff known for his fiery rhetoric said he had been a dukakis 
supporter until recently when jacksons message persuaded him to 
switch sides 
his message is an american message said groff he speaks 
to all americans 
four of the precincts seven delegates were sent to the county 
convention committed to jackson and three to dukakis 
at the republican caucus in precinct 623 of denvers capitol 
hill bush swept a straw poll 171 
all year long precinct 623 has been a dole precinct and 
there was one diehard vote for dole tonight said caucus 
chairperson evamarie mcgowan 
at denver precinct 637 the executive mansion on capitol hill 
romer who already has endorsed dukakis and will go to atlanta as 
a super delegate saw his precinct send six delegates to the 
county convention committed to dukakis and three for jackson 
tonight were all equal romer said prior to his remarks in 
support of dukakis and this party thrives on good competitive 
issues i have the highest respect for jesse jackson and al gore 
but i think mike dukakis is the best qualified and the most 
electable 
at another democratic precinct caucus on denvers capitol hill 
precinct 621a the delegates were split 33 for jackson and 
dukakis with one delegate uncommitted 
i want to throw the rascals out and dukes the man said ray 
mccall a dukakis supporter and a delegate to the county convention 
democrats in precinct 31 in north grand junction heard a 
spirited debate between dukakis and jackson supporters before 
recessing for 35 minutes to watch the final 2 minutes and 11 
seconds of the ncaa championship basketball game 
then the caucus decided to send four dukakis delegates three 
uncommitted delegates and one jackson delegate to the mesa county 
convention 
when precinct chairman joe coleman tried to resume discussions 
with seven seconds left in the game one democrat said get the 
basketball game over with lets get our priorities straight

lawmakers agreed to support a second 
superior court judgeship for racially tense robeson county 
eliminating the need for a special legislative session sought by 
supporters of a slain indian judicial candidate 
mondays agreement came during a threehour meeting in lumberton 
between lt gov bob jordan robeson county legislators and members 
of the campaign committee of julian pierce who was killed march 26 
in what police called a domestic dispute 
if approved by the general assembly in its june session 
republican gov jim martin could appoint a new superior court judge 
from robeson county 
martin said he supported the agreement and pledged he would 
appoint a minority and probably an indian 
pierces supporters had pressured the governor to call a special 
legislative session to amend state law to allow another minority 
candidate to run for the present judgeship filing for the 
judgeship closed in february and state law does not allow a 
replacement for a candidate who dies more than 30 days after the 
filing period ends 
the judgeship was one of nine established last year in areas 
with predominantly black or indian populations in an effort to 
increase the number of minority judges 
rep sidney locks a black robeson county leader who was part of 
mondays negotiations was unenthusiastic about the compromise 
but we were trying to find some way to diffuse the kinds of 
problems we currently have in robeson county he said 
jordan one of the states most powerful democrats said the 
agreement could help ease racial tensions in robeson county 
i think it certainly can do wonders at least for the feelings 
they have about the justice system he said 
the proposal also would virtually assure that joe freeman britt 
robeson countys district attorney will be elected superior court 
judge this fall pierce a lumbee indian leader in robeson county 
was britts only opposition for the special judgeship created last 
year britt is white 
also on monday about 600 people gathered in the place where 
pierce started his campaign for judge three months ago to pledge to 
continue his struggle for change 
we must keep the faith we must not let tragedy keep us down 
we must press on said the rev ben chavis 
many lumbees and blacks in the county say they are discriminated 
against and that they are not represented adequately in local 
political offices the countys population is 37 percent indian 37 
percent white and 26 percent black 
the tension was dramatized feb 1 when two armed tuscarora 
indians burst into the robesonian newspaper in lumberton and took 
at least 17 people hostage no one was injured

who founded the sclc was shot to death in memphis tenn 
mayor andrew young an aide to king and an ordained 
congregationalist minister reacted to the news with a bible verse 
whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap 
in altamont utah meanwhile where mecham grew up his removal 
from office was lamented by relatives and some old acquaintances 
its just a dirty deal and mafiaheaded he has just been

away after joining the service in 1943 he is scheduled to address 
the high schools commencement ceremony may 27

the federal trial of three white 
supremacist leaders and six other men accused of plotting to 
overthrow the us government through violence has gone to the jury 
its all in yahwehs hands sheila beam wife of supremacist 
leader louis beam jr said after the jury began deliberations 
monday if the truth is known theyll be acquitted yahweh is 
a hebrew name for god 
the jury was to resume deliberations today 
the case involves 13 defendants nine of whom are charged with 
seditious conspiracy or conspiring to overthrow the government a 
conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison 
in addition five of the defendants are accused of conspiring to 
kill federal officials and two are charged with interstate 
transportation of stolen money the maximum penalty for murder 
conspiracy is life in prison the stiffest punishment for 
transporting stolen money is 10 years 
five of the defendants are in prison for other crimes 
in addition to beam 41 of houston the supremacist leaders are 
robert e miles 63 of cohoctah mich and richard g butler 70 
of hayden lake idaho 
miles pastor of the mountain church of jesus christ is the 
author of a newsletter that attacked jews and the federal 
government butler is the founder of the white supremacist group 
aryan nations 
beam is a former ku klux klan recruiter who left the klan in 
1981 and became a representative for the aryan nations 
the government alleged that the defendants agreed to try to 
bring down the government by force during an aryan nations congress 
in 1983 
the government contended that some of the defendants went on to 
commit a series of robberies to finance their activities the 
robberies netted about 41 million of which about 1 million is 
unaccounted for the government said 
in closing arguments monday us attorney j michael fitzhugh 
said butler beam and miles came up with the idea for overthrowing 
the government 
fitzhugh said the sedition defendants maintained they hoped to 
bring about a white supremacist nation through a peaceful move to 
the pacific northwest 
but he said if that was the case why did 
defendant david lane say in a taped conversation that he needed 
to bomb some major telephone facility 
defendant bruce pierce become a member of the order a violent 
group that committed armed robberies by taking an oath declaring a 
full state of war 
the covenant the sword and the arm of the lord an 
arkansasbased supremacist group collect an arsenal of automatic 
weapons silencers grenades and other explosives and embark on 
robberies bombings and murders 
during the trial the defense attacked the credibility of 
government witnesses 
but fitzhugh told jurors plots made in hell dont have angels 
as partners 
attorney nc deday larene representing miles said in his 
closing argument monday that the governments key witness james 
ellison had serious delusions ellison belonged to the 
arkansas group 
larene said ellison made up the story about a conspiracy hatched 
at hayden lake because he lost an appeal of his racketeering 
conviction and was looking for a way out of prison 
the defense attorney said that in three earlier reports about 
supremacist activities ellison never mentioned that alleged 
meeting

an exwedtech corp executive claims the defense 
contractor sought help from a saudi arabian prince and friends of 
attorney general edwin meese 3rd in an attempt to sell military 
equipment to middle eastern countries 
but negotiations to sell bridge pontoons and other supplies to 
iran iraq and saudi arabia eventually fell through former wedtech 
vice chairman mario moreno testified monday 
moreno one of four former wedtech officials testifying at the 
racketeering trial of rep mario biaggi and six others in exchange 
for leniency was asked about the scandalplagued companys middle 
east dealings in his 14th day on the witness stand 
the jury was not present during the questioning and us 
district judge constance baker motley later ruled the topic 
inadmissible because she said it didnt provide any evidence that 
a crime had been committed but would unduly prejudice the jury 
biaggi and the six others are charged with turning the 
nowbankrupt wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paid out 
millions of dollars in bribes 
once a small machine shop in the bronx wedtech grew into a 
multimilliondollar manufacturer through a program that set aside 
federal contracts without competitive bidding for minorityowned 
companies 
prosecutors allege biaggi and others helped wedtech falsely 
portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the nobid 
program 
moreno denied that wedtech had acted on behalf of the us 
government in the middle east 
no we were acting as wedtech said moreno one of four 
exwedtech executives to plead guilty to state and federal 
corruption charges we believed we could do it legally 
you knew you could never legally have gotten an export license 
to sell military equipment asked defense attorney dominic 
amorosa 
it crossed my mind said moreno who did not elaborate 
asked if e robert wallach meeses close friend and former 
business associate had said he could help obtain export licenses 
moreno replied it never got to that point 
moreno previously testified that wedtech paid wallach 800000 
for his influence with ed meese meese has not been accused of 
wrongdoing in the case 
the witness said company officials spoke with wallach on two 
or three occasions about foreign deals 
moreno also said a former meese financial adviser w franklyn 
chinn was a conduit in trying to sell arms to iraq 
chinns lawyer cristina arguedas when called for comment 
said ive never heard this allegation before and i continue to 
deny that frank chinn has engaged in any illegal conduct 
both wallach and chinn are under federal indictment accused of 
extracting payoffs from wedtech for allegedly influencing meese and 
other officials

president daniel ortega called an aid 
package the us congress approved last week for the contra rebels 
illegal 
his comments came monday one day before the third round of 
talks between military leaders for the leftist government and the 
contra rebels aimed at working out the technical details of the 
60day ceasefire that began friday 
in another development reports reaching managua indicated that 
some fighting between sandinistas and contras has occurred despite 
the truce 
we cannot accept any type of aid to the contras because it 
would be legitimizing the interventionist policy of the united 
states ortega told reporters it is illegal because the united 
states has no right to decide what type of government nicaragua 
ought to have 
under a 60day ceasefire agreement signed march 23 in the 
southern border town of sapoa the contras agreed to accept only 
humanitarian aid from a neutral organization such as the 
international red cross 
the sandinistas said they would grant freedom of expression and 
amnesty to political prisoners and will allow rebel leaders to take 
part in national talks in todays technical talks also to be held 
in sapoa sandinista and contra representatives will hammer out 
technical details of the truce 
president reagan on friday signed the aid package for the rebels 
and victims of the fighting that has battered nicaragua for more 
than six years 
only 177 million of the 48 million package was directed to 
the rebels and the aid package contains no provision for weapons 
despite the ceasefire radio liberation an underground rebel 
station quoted contra spokesman bosco matamoros on monday as 
saying that sandinista troops had been firing on rebels 
a transcript of the broadcast also quoted contra leader adolfo 
calero as saying the sandinistas continued bombing civilian towns 
in the rural north 
the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario reported that 
contra forces attacked a sandinista army patrol saturday killing 
two soldiers and injuring three near the town of condega about 120 
miles north of managua 
the defense ministry said there were no reports of ceasefire 
violations 
the ceasefire was arranged to give both sides time to work out 
a permanent truce in the war which has killed more than 40000 
people 
under the peace plan the rebels are to gather in ceasefire 
zones during the first two weeks of april two days of meetings 
last week ended with both sides agreeing only to set up five 
ceasefire zones they failed to work out the size of the areas or 
security for the contras 
the peace agreement does not mention disarming the rebels and 
the contras claim they will never surrender their weapons 
the sandinistas met the first step of the agreement by releasing 
100 political prisoners march 27 the remaining 3300 political 
prisoners are to be released gradually as the terms of the pact are 
met 
the contras charge the sandinistas only released 10 political 
prisoners that they requested they say the others served only a 
few weeks or were common criminals 
the sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the 
late president anastasio somoza in july 1979 the united states 
supported the sandinistas initially but in 1981 began financing 
the contras

a leading governmentowned newspaper today 
criticized palestinian leaders in the israelioccupied territories 
for boycotting secretary of state george p shultzs efforts for 
middle east peace 
we would have preferred if they palestinian leaders revised 
their continued boycott and tried to give a chance for a dialogue 
with the american side an editorial in the daily alakhbar said 
the newspaper said shultz began talks with palestinians last 
month when he met in washington with american professors edward 
said and ibrahim abu lughud who belong to the legislative arm of 
the palestine liberation organization movement to establish a 
palestinian state on israeli territory 
it said shultzs shuttle visits to the parties of the 
arabisraeli conflict are indications of the seriousness of 
president reagans administration to reach a final settlemenmt of 
the regions problem 
it is true that the american initiative does not meet all the 
desires of the arab side in general and the palestinians in 
particular but this does not mean it is devoid of any positive 
elements that could be built on and promoted during the dialogue 
the newspaper said 
it said the initiative has for the first time recognized the 
right of the palestinians for selfrule and called this a turning 
point in washingtons policy 
the us plan calls for three years of selfrule but not 
statehood for the 15 million palestinians living in the occupied 
territories negotiations on an overall settlement would open in 
december 
israel captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war for the last four months 
antioccupation rioting by palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
strip has killed more than 135 arabs

the last major us military garrisons in southeast asia and the 
chief us negotiator said the outcome will affect usphilippine 
relations and regional security 
the significant soviet presence in the immediate area casts a 
shadow over expanding economic activity throughout the region 
us ambassador nicholas platt head of the 10member american 
panel said in opening remarks 
the review of a 41yearold agreement on us bases in the 
philippines comes amid a growing clamor by many filipinos for 
phasing out the garrisons which they see as a vestige of us 
colonialism 
about 500 people marched this afternoon from the philippine 
senate to the us embassy chanting slogans demanding the bases be 
closed police stood guard in front of the embassy compound but 
there were no incidents 
us and philippine officials described the opening session as 
cordial 
both sides expressed their desire for a successful review and 
pledged to work toward this end in a harmonious businesslike 
manner the two panels said in a joint statement 
foreign secretary raul manglapus chief filipino negotiator has 
called for substantial increases in the 180 million which manila 
receives annually for use of the six installations 
filipino officials say they will also press us officials for 
details of nuclear weapons that may be stored there and for 
expanding the right to try american troops charged with criminal 
offenses 
the outcome of the talks expected to last three months will 
determine whether the philippines allows the bases to remain in the 
nation after their lease expires in 1991 
under a new filipino constitution a lease extension must be 
approved by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to 
the bases is strong 
platt has refused to say whether washington will agree to a 
major increase in lease payments last month manglapus suggested 
us payments of 12 billion for the bases 
platt noted today the presence of american troops enables the 
philippines to spend scarce resources on economic development 
instead of defense 
an overnight shift in soviet intentions can transform this 
presence into a serious economic and military threat to the 
philippines and the region platt said 
he said the talks will lay the groundwork to create a positive 
atmosphere for discussions to come later on the future of our 
security relations 
the united states is the philippines chief weapons supplier in 
the governments 19yearold fight against communist rebels 
under the agreement the united states maintains clark air base 
subic bay naval base and four smaller installations about 20000 
us troops and defense department workers are stationed at the 
bases which the united states says are crucial for defense of the 
western pacific 
the bases are officially under filipino command but are 
effectively controlled by the united states 
president corazon aquino has promised to let the bases remain 
until 1991 but has refused to say whether she supports an extension 
us authorities say 40 percent of the warships that call at 
subic bay are nuclearpowered

burnt by a controversial services tax 
last year state lawmakers and gov bob martinez say they wont be 
talking taxes during the 1988 legislative session opening today 
martinez came under heavy fire for his original support and 
later flipflop on the services tax which would have raised 1 
billion by taxing lawyers lawn care accounting and other 
services the unusual 5 percent levy was repealed in december after 
much argument 
the controversy was fueled by the states plan to tax services 
such as advertising across state lines publishers broadcasters 
and the hotel industry raised an outcry and many groups threatened 
to cancel florida conventions before martinez backed off and pushed 
for alternatives 
itll be very helpful to talk about problems and not have that 
allconsuming issue martinez said monday 
the firstterm republican wont have to look far for other 
concerns shackled by budget and political restraints floridas 
leaders face overcrowded prisons congested highways and schools 
and an environment buckling under the pressure of 1000 new 
residents each day 
it will be a real competition for funds this year said 
education commissioner betty castor who wants nearly 1 billion in 
additional appropriations to meet her departments needs in the 
face of 67000 new students in 198889 
the state relies heavily on its sales tax on goods which the 
legislature increased by one percentage point to 6 percent after it 
repealed the services tax 
martinez said he hasnt found any of his gop colleagues or 
conservative democrats in favor of new taxes this year 
maybe its one of those situations where its going to have to 
get a lot worse before it gets better senate president john 
vogt a democrat said monday at the florida taxwatch annual 
meeting vogt said his travels around the state have convinced him 
that citizens dont want new taxes regardless of the ramifications 
of not raising more revenue

federal prosecutors have challenged the legality of 
millionaire victor posners sentence on taxfraud charges which 
involves a 3 million contribution to the homeless instead of a 
prison term 
laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be we 
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of 
justice and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for 
liberty while the poor cannot us attorney leon kellner said in 
a motion filed monday 
sadly we are compelled to observe that this sentence is 
illegal the prosecutor said of the unusual punishment imposed 
feb 12 by us district judge eugene spellman the law does not 
allow an exchange of money for jail time even for the benefit of a 
badly needed societal purpose 
spellman said monday he would have no comment on the motion and 
was awaiting a response by posners attorneys 
after posner pleaded no contest to 10 tax fraud counts for 
inflating the value of land donated to miami christian college 
spellman ordered the industrialist to perform a 3 million project 
to aid the homeless in south florida and to pay 4 million in back 
taxes penalties and interest 
spellman who also ruled posner could not take a tax deduction 
for the donation to the homeless and could not file for voluntary 
bankruptcy acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its 
legality might be questioned 
if for some reason the sentence is ever challenged this 
court will in fact incarcerate victor posner he said in 
february 
kellners fivepage motion noted that spellman said posner would 
go to prison if any of the sentencing conditions were violated but 
did not indicate what the sentence would otherwise have been 
in his motion kellner said he was dutybound to call to this 
courts attention the fact that this court does not have the power 
to order a criminal defendant to make charitable contributions as a 
condition of probation 
a hearing on posners plan for distribution of the 3 million 
was set for wednesday before spellman

officials of chinas inland provinces indicated 
today they are scrambling for development strategies of their own 
now that the central governments emphasis is on building up the 
coastal areas 
delegates from one western region suggested the first joint 
ventures in china with the soviet union since a bitter 1960 
political split 
if the coastal policies are only looking to exports how are 
we in the west going to modernize wondered huang baozhang vice 
chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region at a meeting of 
the regions delegates to the national peoples congress 
the congress chinas legislature began a 20day annual session 
march 25 foreign reporters were allowed today for the second time 
to sit in on delegate discussion groups in the great hall of the 
people 
many inland officials oppose the states new strategy of 
developing the coast into an exportproducing center fearing their 
already backward regions will stay mired in poverty while the coast 
becomes rich 
however coastal development is a pet project of communist party 
chief zhao ziyang 
huang said his solution for xinjiang was to increase inland 
trade across the border with the soviet union making xinjiang into 
an export center of its own 
xinjiangs chairman tomur dawamat invited the soviets to enter 
into joint ventures in his region the soviets have not had joint 
ventures in china since the 1960 political split between the two 
communist giants moscow then called home thousands of technicians 
and industrial experts who had been helping rebuild chinas economy 
from the devastation of world war ii 
although political differences remain strong china and the 
soviet union have concluded several trade agreements in recent 
years and an unofficial crossborder trade flourishes in xinjiang 
and other remote regions last month the two countries announced 
plans to turn a hotel in moscow into a joint venture 
we and the soviet people have the same hope although we have 
great political differences huang said the people of both 
countries hope to carry out many economic exchanges we need some 
soviet products and they need some of ours both nations could 
benefit 
delegates from heilongjiang province which borders the soviet 
union in northeast china pressed similar proposals and won support 
from zheng tuobin minister of foreign economic relations and trade 
the staterun xinhua news agency quoted zheng as saying trade 
with the soviet union and other east bloc countries will increase 
rapidly and that provinces will be allowed to make some trade 
arrangements directly without going through the central government

lawyers for a former state senator claimed 
he was suffering from the effects of being drugged and tortured 
when he made statements to authorities on his return to this 
country from foreign custody 
david friedland who disappeared just before he was to go to 
prison on a kickback conviction and spent two years on the lam was 
treated so badly by authorities in the maldive islands that he 
began hallucinating the night before he was turned over to us 
officials the attorneys say 
mr friedland hallucinated that the prophet mohammed told him 
to convert and he would be released said a motion filed by the 
lawyers last week 
the motion filed thursday before chief us district judge john 
f gerry seeks to suppress statements friedland made to us 
agents en route from the indian ocean islands to the united states 
in december 1987 
friedland does not remember being read his rights or waiving his 
rights to an attorney during the flight the motion said it also 
said the us agents manipulated friedland to obtain the statements 
defense attorneys also filed motions last week to dismiss 35 of 
the 90 counts in a federal indictment charging friedland with 
masterminding a 20 million swindle of a pension fund 
friedland 50 is scheduled to go on trial sept 7 on charges he 
set up a bogus mortgage company in florida to bilk the pension fund 
of teamsters local 701 in north brunswick 
court documents do not indicate the nature of the statements 
friedland allegedly made to us deputy marshal blair deem and 
special agent thomas g sommero during the flight 
first assistant us attorney michael chertoff declined comment 
on the statements monday but said they may be made public during a 
may 13 pretrial hearing before gerry 
friedland faked his death in a bogus scubadiving accident in 
september 1985 weeks before he was to be sentenced for a 1980 
kickback conviction involving the same pension fund an indictment 
alleges friedland a disbarred attorney engineered the second scam 
while working as a government informant 
in 26 months on the lam friedland traveled through europe asia 
and africa before settling in the maldives where he ran a 
scubadiving business for 18 months using an alias 
by the time he was placed in the custody of that countrys 
national security force on dec 12 friedland had been named the 
most wanted fugitive by the us marshals office 
while in foreign custody friedland was kept in a room with a 
board for a mattress and an overflowing toilet fed spoiled food 
injected with drugs and beaten when he tried to sleep his 
attorneys say 
officials there also gave him daily injections of talacen a 
mild narcotic and valium an antianxiety drug laced his tea with 
hallucinogenics and gave him other drugs the motion said 
after 12 days in custody due to complete lack of sleep 
substantial drug consumption exhaustion and pain mr friedland 
was mentally and physically exhausted the motion said 
while in this condition friedland was handed over to the us 
agents who escorted him back to the united states 
defense attorneys peter willis and john yacovelle did not return 
calls monday 
attempts to contact maldiven officials were unsuccessful calls 
to the maldiven consulate in new york were not returned 
friedland faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for 
his disappearance and up to 150 years in prison if convicted of 
charges stemming from the second pension fund case

prosecutors in the murder trial of an 
airline pilot accused of killing his wife and disposing of parts of 
her body with a woodchipper tried to prove the woman is dead by 
noting it was outofcharacter for her not to stay in touch with 
her mother 
helle crafts a flight attendant for pan american world airways 
was last seen nov 18 1986 when friends drove her to her newtown 
home after a flight from west germany her body has never been 
found and her husband richard b crafts 50 was charged with her 
murder 
mrs crafts mother elisabeth nielsen of horsholm denmark 
testified monday that her daughter had written letters to her every 
two to three weeks and called her once every week or two 
testifying through an interpreter mrs nielsen said her last 
contact with her daughter was a telephone call on nov 17 1986 
mrs nielsen was the first witness called by states attorney 
walter flanagan in a trial expected to last six to eight weeks 
the state also produced a revealing letter the womans daughter 
had sent mrs nielsen in october 1986 
in the letter read by the interpreter after the jury was 
ordered out of the courtroom mrs crafts told her mother she had 
informed her husband that she wanted a divorce and that he was 
seemingly not happy about the idea 
superior court judge barry schaller ruled that the part of the 
letter purporting to describe crafts reactions could not be 
admitted into evidence 
but a portion of the letter in which mrs crafts said she no 
longer trusted her husband apparently will be allowed into 
evidence and flanagan said he was pleased with the judges 
decision 
the prosecution was dealt a blow before the trial began when the 
judge ruled that a clump of wood chips and human tissue seized from 
crafts car could not be used against him 
the chief state medical examiner issued a death certificate 
based on the tissue found in the trunk and some body fragments 
including a dental cap and a finger tip police said they found 
along the housatonic river near newtown 
schaller held that authorities lacked the proper legal grounds 
to seize crafts vehicle 
defense attorney j daniel sagarin said he was disappointed the 
judge did not also order the suppression of evidence seized from 
crafts home which included carpet samples a comforter and a pair 
of mens shoes 
the judge also ordered the sequestering of all potential 
witnesses except the principal investigators for the state and the 
defense 
the ruling brought an objection from arthur herzog a new york 
author who has a contract to write a book on the case and a film 
script

the communist party newspaper pravda today accused 
opponents of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms of trying to bring back 
stalinism and told other publications that there are limits to what 
they should print 
in a major fullpage article the authoritative newspaper said 
papers should not print material that undermines gorbachevs 
efforts to reform the economy and to allow freer discussion of some 
issues 
pravda said the soviet union needs people who are dedicated to 
improving housing food supplies and services not people obsessed 
with uncovering suspected enemies as was stalin 
a patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged 
internal threat to socialism who joining with a few political 
extremists seeks internal enemies everywhere pravda said 
a patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country of 
the people without fear of any difficulty the newspaper said 
pravdas article appeared to be an effort to strengthen 
gorbachevs hand going into an unusual june communist party 
conference and an indication that the soviet leader still faces 
stiff conservative resistance the conference gives gorbachev the 
possibility of replacing opponents with his supporters to 
strengthen support for his policies 
the article was written as a criticism of a letter by leningrad 
teacher nina andreyeva defending stalin and published by the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya on march 13 
the soviet press in the last year has sharply criticized 
stalins excesses and gorbachev in november said the dictators 
guilt for the purges in which millions died was enormous and 
unforgivable however he defended stalins rapid 
industrialization and collectivization of agriculture 
pravda echoed gorbachevs criticism but said his opponents 
wont let the issue rest either because they feel more comfortable 
with stalins repressive ways or because it serves their personal 
interest 
in one person this may be directed at taking more and giving 
less in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts 
to claim a monopoly in science personal innocence or something 
else pravda said 
it criticized stalins system as thoughtless execution of 
orders and suppression of initiative it said the soviet union 
cannot hide from the fact that many thousands of party workers 
economic and military officials scientists and cultural figures 
were exiled or killed by stalin 
gorbachev embarked on perestroika his effort to 
restructure soviet society at a meeting of the central committee 
in april 1985 pravda said his opponents are concerned that the 
reforms will undermine the principles of the soviet system 
not all realize fully that the administrativecommand methods 
have exhausted themselves all who pin hopes on those methods or 
their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact that we 
have had that more than once but it did not bring about the 
desired results pravda said 
pravda said the letter in sovietskaya rossiya was an attempt 
little by little to revise party decisions 
at meetings at the party central committee it has been said 
more than once that the soviet press is not a private shop and that 
the communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware 
of their responsibility for the articles and the publications 
in this case the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya has 
departed from this principle pravda said 
it said the press should publish criticism that will help 
supporters of the restructuring to unite their forces rather than 
articles that encourage disunity

former president carter says he never 
heard of a plan to swap military parts for the 52 americans held 
hostage in iran during the last year of his term 
no one that i have talked to had heard of it he added at a 
news conference monday night following a speech at fresno state 
university 
newly declassified documents revealed in a house judiciary 
subcommittee investigation showed the carter administration 
considered offering 10 million in military spare parts to iran for 
the hostages captured in november 1979 during an attack on the us 
embassy in tehran 
carter advisers scuttled the plan after determining arms dealer 
houshang lavi didnt have the backing of theniranian president 
abolhassan banisadr according to documents obtained by the miami 
herald 
one cia memo said lavi offered to make a hostage exchange and 
handed over a sevenpage list of f14 parts the cia officer who 
wrote the memo recommended against pursuing the deal 
carter said he never saw any of the memos and that the plan was 
never seriously considered 
the documents include cia memos to carters national security 
council chief david aaron and state department memos by thendeputy 
assistant secretary harold saunders 
the papers surfaced during a hearing being held by rep john 
coyers dmich into attempts by the reagan administration to 
trade arms with iran for hostages seized by iranbacked shiite 
moslems in lebanon 
during his speech carter said the united states doesnt always 
use its power as it should to promote human rights 
when there is a silence from washington there is a worldwide 
silence he said what the oppressed fear most is a silence 
from washington 
carter whose policy as president was to publicly criticize 
nations that abused human rights told the crowd that the reagan 
administration has been on the wrong side of human rights issues 
in almost every case 
he urged that the next president develop a foreign policy that 
would alleviate suffering by the use of american influence

officers shot to death a man they said was a 
suspect in a gangrelated driveby killing and two men were wounded 
in still another driveby incident as violent gang confrontations 
continued police said 
mondays fatal shooting took place on the same day police chief 
darryl gates unveiled plans to have 1000 officers work four hours 
of overtime each to fight gang warfare and mayor tom bradley said 
he would support whatever measures are needed to take back control 
of the citys streets 
police said a 19yearold man whose name was withheld pending 
notification of relatives was shot to death when he allegedly 
reached for his waistband as two officers attempted to take him 
into custody 
the officers believed the man was reaching for a handgun but no 
gun was found lt william hall who heads the police departments 
officerinvolved shooting unit said monday he would not say if 
officers harold moberly 33 and larry maillet 31 were under 
investigation 
police said the man was suspected of participating in a driveby 
shooting earlier monday in which a 27yearold man whose name also 
was withheld was killed by a shotgun blast while standing with a 
group of people on the citys gangridden southwest side 
gennaire harris 19 who was with the man killed by the 
officers was arrested for investigation of murder hall said 
two other young men were listed in stable condition at area 
hospitals today after being shot monday night in another 
gangrelated driveby shooting police said the gunmen escaped 
meanwhile the police department will ask for 150000 to 
200000 from the city council this week to pay for overtime 
salaries gates said at a news conference monday 
we are determined to take back the streets of los angeles and 
restore them to the decent lawabiding citizens of this 
community bradley said in support whatever that takes i am 
prepared to back the police department and the chief of police in 
that effort 
gang violence has long been a problem but a driveby shooting 
on good friday that killed one person and wounded a dozen 
including a 4yearold boy triggered new calls for action 
the assault may have been the citys worst in terms of the 
number of victims police said five people were killed and five 
others injured in a gang shooting outside a home in october 1984 
a police task force converged on gang areas saturday night and 
early sunday arresting 175 people for investigation of a variety 
of alleged offenses and interrogating 619 people 500 of them 
believed to be gang members 
in nine sweeps since february 1203 people have been arrested 
of which 996 were gang members gates said 
gates declined to say which day the expanded force would be 
deployed saying he didnt want to tip his hand to the gangs 
well do it long enough that they get the message gates 
said 
gates also proposed the use of wiretaps against gangs which 
bradley said he supported 
gates said he did not believe the city needed the national 
guards help now but he added maybe sometime down the road it 
will become necessary los angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn 
has called on gov george deukmejian to dispatch the guard 
in a separate move the mayor monday also proposed a plan for 
spending 28 million to hire unarmed rangers and improve 
facilities at 66 parks mostly in the inner city where gangs have 
forced out park users

americans eat too much animal fat and the 
government should rewrite its regulations to encourage the 
production of leaner meats and dairy products the national 
research council said today 
the council in a report on a 2year study said that despite a 
decline in fat consumption in recent years americans dietary 
habits still center too heavily on meat and dairy products rich in 
animal fats which can cause a variety of health problems 
the nutritionrelated health problems experienced by a large 
segment of the us population today arise from overconsumption of 
fat saturated fatty acids and cholesterol the report said 
for other americans the report added dietary problems center 
on not getting enough calories iron or calcium overall the 
report said the incidence of nutritionrelated health problems 
is significant affecting either directly or indirectly nearly 
every american family 
among the dietrelated health problems cited are 
about 34 million americans are overweight 
nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease 
that may be related to the consumption of highcholesterol foods 
osteoporosis a disease caused by the leaching of calcium from 
bone strikes 15 to 20 million adults 
from eight and 12 million children are hungry due to inadequate 
diets 
iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia 
the study said that the present system of government regulations 
in the meat industry tends to put more animal fat on american 
tables 
the present grading system for retail meats is not only costly 
and inefficient but it encourages the overfattening of beef and 
lamb the report said trimming of fat at slaughter or at 
purchase is only a partial shortterm response the real solution 
lies in the production of leaner animals 
among the recommendations made in the study were that the 
agriculture department permit the removal of fat from carcasses 
immediately after slaughter a system called hot fat trimming 
this in effect would penalize meat producers for additional 
fat in the carcasses the report said 
an agriculture department spokesman said that hot fat 
trimming has been proposed and now is under study by the industry 
the study also recommended that ways be found to reduce the 
cholesterol in animal products to identify the fat and protein 
content of live animals and carcasses and to reduce the fat and 
fatty acid ratios of meat milk and eggs through breeding or 
feeding programs ways also should be found the report said to 
reduce the amount of salt contained in prepared meats and meat 
products 
additionally the study said that the food and drug 
administration should establish standards for such terms as 
natural and that the usda restrict use of the terms light 
lite and lean to some objective standard for cuts of 
meat the terms then would apply to specific nutrient content and 
identify levels of fat in meat and other products

a fisherman rescued a newborn 
from a plastic trash bag floating on a river after hearing the baby 
crying police said today 
the baby whom police called moses was wrapped in newspaper 
with his umbilical cord still attached when he was found monday 
according to police 
he was in satisfactory condition today at newcastle hospital 
about 180 miles southeast of johannesburg 
the air in the sealed bag had kept it afloat and saved the life 
of the baby born about an hour before it was rescued according to 
police lt pieter van straaten 
officials said the child had a light complexion brown hair and 
could be indian or mixedrace 
jan bekker 27 and anton venter 19 were fishing on the shore 
of the ncandu river on the outskirts of newcastle when they saw the 
trash bag floating downstream they heard cries but thought at 
first they came from the opposite bank the south african press 
association reported 
when the bag got stuck in reeds near shore about 30 yards from 
the fishermen they realized the cries were coming from inside the 
news agency said 
venter a bank clerk with an artificial leg took off his 
clothes and swam across the swiftly flowing river opened the bag 
and found the baby van straaten said 
the news agency said venter tied off the umbilical cord with 
catgut and cut it the two men then rushed the child to the 
hospital 
the agency quoted police as saying the baby could have been 
dropped into the river from a bridge along the main 
johannesburgnewcastle highway

a 17yearold high school student who 
shot through a window and killed a man he thought was breaking into 
his bedroom has been charged with murder 
james ronald sutton remained in spartanburg county jail for the 
second night monday without bond city authorities had recommended 
a low bond but a circuit judge was not in town monday to set bond 
as required in a murder charge 
sutton a 10th grader at spartanburg high school with no 
previous record called police late sunday night to report he had 
shot a man he believed was trying to break into his house 
spartanburg police lt charles wolfe said 
sutton told police a man came to the house while he was asleep 
and rang the doorbell for about four minutes at 1140 pm but the 
youth did not answer wolfe said 
a short time later sutton told police he heard the screen being 
taken off his bedroom window he then loaded a 20gauge shotgun 
looked through the window and saw someone wolfe said 
sutton then sat on the bed and fired a shot through the window 
wolfe said 
he said he was very afraid the officer said 
coroner jim burnett identified the dead man as freddie edward 
dawkins jr 22 of spartanburg dawkins who was unarmed was shot 
once through the neck burnett said 
police records showed dawkins had several prior convictions and 
a charge of common law robbery filed in october was pending when he 
was killed 
suttons arrest angered his mother irene jones who said 
monday i feel they shouldnt have arrested him like that and 
charged him with murder he was frightened he was afraid in his 
bedroom 
she said the charges against her son contrasted with the 
treatment given an 11yearold youth in switzer 10 miles south of 
spartanburg who shot and killed two intruders in the family home 
last month officials in that case didnt charge the youth 
wolfe wouldnt comment on the switzer case except to say the 
intruders in that case were inside the home 
we charged him sutton for technical reasons wolfe said 
any time a life is taken the normal procedure is to charge 
somebody even if its a police officer who did the shooting 
wolfe said the action would allow the courts to clear the youth 
of any wrongdoing

a hunter suspected of illegally shooting 
a mother bear and leaving her three cubs in a trash bin has agreed 
to turn himself in authorities said 
an arrest warrant was issued monday for the 27yearold bay city 
man who agreed to appear today for arraignment crawford county 
prosecutor john huss said 
the twocount warrant accuses the man of illegally killing a 
bear and of unlawfully possessing a bear or parts of a bear 
the man has said he killed the black bear in selfdefense but 
department of natural resources law enforcement chief herb burns 
said thats unlikely 
our evidence points to this being a deliberate shooting and 
not the result of a bear attack on the individual he said in a 
statement monday 
the parts he possessed were the head and the paws said 
huss adding that he didnt know the reason they were taken i 
guess its like a bullfighter they take the ears right 
the head and claws were found in the suspects residence after 
the dnr received a tip on its poaching hotline said lt jay larson 
of the dnr office in mio 
killing a bear illegally is a misdemeanor which carries fines 
ranging from 200 to 1000 a mandatory fiveday jail sentence 
extending to up to 90 days 1500 in restitution for the animal 
and a threeyear loss of hunting privileges illegal bear 
possession carries the same penalties huss said 
last week the suspect led wildlife officials to the bear 
carcass in a swamp in the au sable state forest in the northern 
lower peninsula he said he found the bears cubs after he shot her 
and left them in a trash container according to the department 
a conservation officer rescued the two male and one female cubs 
march 24 after someone called a wildlife office and said he found 
the three bears in the trash container in rural crawford county 
the caller told officers he would leave the cubs in a telephone 
booth 
barb rogers who is taking care of the 2monthold cubs at the 
wildlife recovery association in midland has said they cannot 
survive in the wild because they have been handled by humans 
tom monaghan owner of the detroit tigers baseball club and 
dominos pizza has offered to adopt the cubs and give them a home 
on a dominos retreat on drummond island in the upper peninsula a 
dnr official said he hoped the department would be able to turn the 
cubs over to the retreat within a week

more than any other democratic candidate foreign commentators 
are focusing more and more attention on jesse jacksons drive for 
his partys presidential nomination here is some of what they had 
to say most recently 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the herald of harare governmentcontrolled a black 
american the reverend jesse jackson has for the first time in 
united states history emerged a frontrunner 
some see it as a divisive force weakening his partys bid for 
the presidency and ultimately if jackson does win the democratic 
ticket reducing the choice of president to a black versus white 
affair exacerbating old racial wounds and very probably opening 
new ones 
it would be starryeyed to give jackson anything but an 
outside chance of the white house but it would be remiss of the 
next administration to ignore the significance of his challenge 
jacksons dreams are those of many americans black and white 
they want new direction and while domestic issues are bound 
to dominate the call extends to a foreign policy so confused that 
while rushing to impose sanctions on panama it stubbornly refuses 
to back full economic sanctions against apartheid 
it is how far jacksons challenge eventually goes towards 
reshaping americas dealings with others that has the worlds 
attention as the presidential race progresses

south african broadcasting corp governmentcontrolled in a 
commentary predicting the election of vice president george bush in 
november as it did in the last election the democratic party 
seems intent once again on contesting the presidency with a man who 
has virtually no chance of winning against the republican 
candidate this year they seem determined to nominate in mr 
jesse jackson a candidate who even democratic party leaders admit 
is unelectable 
nobody likes to say it out loud but the jackson phenomenon 
and the dilemma it has created for the party are almost entirely a 
matter of racism in america both his present leadership position 
in the party primaries and the impossibility of his being elected 
president are due first and foremost to the fact that mr jackson 
is black 
</TEXT>

carl noffke director of the institute for american studies at 
rand afrikaans university speaking to the south african institute 
of international affairs as quoted in the citizen of johannesburg 
progovernment the elevation of the rev jesse jackson to a 
position of leadership presents a considerable crisis to the 
democratic party because of the color of his skin his opponents 
will do everything humanly possible to try to prove that they are 
not racists 
one can therefore expect an increase in antisouth african 
sentiments in the coming months in the same way in which south 
africa became the political whipping boy of the 1984 presidential 
elections when the democrats were divided

the financial times of london independent mr jacksons 
strength could transcend racial boundaries more than any other 
candidate from either party he is talking about issues that affect 
the common man and woman the reagan years may have created more 
wealth for many americans but they have not much reduced the 
underclass which cuts across color lines this constituency no 
longer the automatic fiefdom of the democrats and now poorly 
represented by the trade union movement is there to be galvanized 
 
so if it is up to george bush to prove in the wider arena 
that he is not ronald reagan it is up to the democratic party to 
find room for jesse jackson and he has not yet begun to bargain 
it is debatable which challenge is the more daunting

shirley a 25pound male 
lobster with claws as big as baseball mitts returned to the ocean 
today saved from a dinner plate by animal rights activists a 
seafood vendor and state officials 
lifting the giant crustacean by its claws and tail seafood 
dealers from portland and philadelphia gently swung him over the 
side of a maine marine patrol boat into 22feetdeep water near 
fogshrouded portland head light in this portland suburb 
bob a companion lobster weighing in at 19 pounds was dropped 
into the water moments later 
dana neuts retail manager of harbor fish market in portland 
said he wasnt used to the idea of returning potential seafood to 
the sea but in the case of shirley and bob he had no complaints 
it feels great it really does neuts said i like the 
idea of the whole thing 
these are welltraveled lobsters said kevin hill the 
philadelphia seafood vendor who accompanied shirley and bob on 
their flight to portland on monday we shouldnt be catching 
lobsters this size maine is the only state thats doing anything 
to protect them and thats why were here 
the two lobsters spent the night in a 12by4foot tank in 
neuts market along the portland waterfront before being placed 
aboard the 35foot boat for the halfhour ride through choppy seas 
to a protected cove off cape elizabeth 
shirley whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old 
and her smaller companion were rescued from a philadelphia man who 
wanted to serve them for easter dinner 
this is symbolic of what were trying to do and what citizens 
are trying to do for a natural sustainable resource said col 
robert fogg chief of the bureau of marine patrol of the state 
department of marine resources by protecting these large 
lobsters theres more of a chance of them reproducing and 
perpetuating the industry 
it shows theres a lot of concern about our natural resources 
out there fogg added 
maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five 
inches covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds 
the marine patrol said the two lobsters appeared to be in 
excellent shape after their flight and enjoyed a seafood dinner 
in their tank at the portland fish market 
they were real frisky said officer donald k lockhart jr 
they put a quahog in there and the big one just snapped it up 
like it was butter they left a crab in there overnight and it was 
gone this morning 
the lobsters had been trucked from long island ny to 
philadelphia where they were sold to a customer for 287 
animal rights activists took up the lobsters cause when they 
heard that art miller a retired carpenter planned to use them for 
a feast 
hill owner of hills main line seafood co in the philadelphia 
suburb of ardmore persuaded miller to take 45 pounds of smaller 
lobsters instead 
hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their 
visit to philadelphias main line acknowledging that saving 
lobsters from dinner was something new for him 
its been very good for business he said thousands of 
people dropped by for a look at shirley if they dont buy now 
at least they know where we are said hill 
pity not cruelty inc a small animal rights group made 
arrangements with maine officials to turn the creatures loose and 
assumed the 40 flight cost 
it may seem a lot of trouble for a couple of lobsters but group 
vice president gloria felschercohen makes no apologies 
why not she asked these two lobsters have survived 
hazards particularly shirley over 100 years why should she need 
to succumb to the cruelest predator of all man

sen paul simon of illinois said today he will 
look at the wisconsin primary results and decide whether to 
continue his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination 
simon aides said many options already have been discussed 
including suspending the campaign rather than quitting in order to 
hold onto the national convention delegate he has won 
were going to do well tonight if we dont do well we have 
to make a reevaluation simon told reporters outside an 
unemployment office in downtown milwaukee well take one step at 
a time 
preprimary polls put simon a distant fourth in the democratic 
primary race here where massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson were the frontrunners sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee is in third place in the polls 
simon spokesman terry michael said that simon would have no 
statement on the wisconsin results tonight or wednesday if simon 
makes a statement on his campaign it will come on thursday 
michael said 
the chicago suntimes reports in todays editions that simon 
would suspend his campaign but not withdraw in order to hold onto 
his delegates a key to such a decision would be the 47 atlarge 
delegates simon has won in the state but which will not be 
selected until the state convention in may 
if simon withdraws before the convention jackson the 
secondplace finisher in illinois would win all 60 atlarge 
delegates not just the 13 he is currently allocated 
anybody can see thats an option said michael even as he 
firmly denied it was the course simon had chosen to take 
simon has won only one contest his homestate primary on march 
15 he skipped the super tuesday primaries to focus on illinois and 
then said he would make a major effort in wisconsin to revive his 
campaign 
but simon failed to catch on in wisconsin although he has 
campaigned hard around the state his aides talked privately only 
of coming in third ahead of gore a finish far short of anything 
strong enough to keep simon in the race

three convicted killers who escaped 
from the west virginia pententiary are probably several states 
away by now a state prison official said today 
theres been no news on them whatsover said corrections 
commissioner av dodrill were not searching any areas around 
the prison 
information has been given to other police agencies in the 
area and they are checking that out what it boils down to is 
routine police work 
authorities in ohio and pennsylvania also reported no trace of 
the three who broke through an elevator shaft and used bolt 
cutters to escape sunday night 
police immediately gave protection to those who helped convict 
one of the three bobby stacy including a columbus ohio woman 
who testified against him the woman a former friend of stacys 
received death threats and her car was burned during his trial 
stacy 35 was convicted of killing a police officer and accused 
of shooting another authorities say he had vowed to kill the 
prosecutor and circuit judge who had put him behind bars 
he is educated and coldblooded thats the worst combination 
there is said charles hatcher an assistant cabell county 
prosecutor and one of those stacy threatened to kill my fear is 
that some police officer is going to get killed because thats 
this guys method 
hatcher said he had no plans to ask for protection for himself 
but cabell county circuit judge alfred e ferguson asked that an 
extra bailiff be assigned to him 
stacy david williams 28 and tommie mollohan 45 were 
discovered missing from the maximumsecurity prison during a 
routine check sunday night officials said 
state police searched west virginia ohio and pennsylvania for 
the three and roadblocks were set up on routes leading into ohio 
and pennsylvania which borders marshall county where the prison 
is to the east 
mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a brounland 
grocer in 1973 after he escaped from a florida prison he also was 
wanted in georgia and north carolina on armed robbery charges 
williams serving a life sentence for felony murder arson and 
robbery was convicted in the december 1980 slaying of a marytown 
resident who was found bludgeoned in the rubble of his burned home 
warden jerry hedrick told reporters monday that evidence 
indicated the escapees had outside help he said bloodhounds 
tracked their scent across the street to a museum parking lot 
where the trail disappeared 
hedrick said the three all maintenance workers knocked a hole 
in the wall of an elevator shaft in the prison infirmary to gain 
entrance to a shed where equipment including bolt cutters is kept 
then they climbed through another elevator shaft to the second 
floor of an unused building where they used pipe and a cord to 
lower themselves to the ground he said 
the escapees hid behind ventilation equipment then used the 
bolt cutters to cut through a lock on a gate and flee he said 
something wasnt right with security hedrick said 
something was overlooked 
stacy formerly of columbus ohio was serving a life sentence 
without chance of parole for the 1981 slaying of huntington police 
officer paul harmon who was shot several times in the head with 
his own service revolver harmon had been investigating another 
officers report of a suspicious person 
at the time of the killing stacy was free on bond after being 
charged with shooting a huber heights ohio police officer with a 
sawedoff shotgun 
stacy was a successful businessman who used the money from his 
crimes for business ventures when he was arrested he owned a bar 
at least two houses and several automobiles 
huntington police officers who usually patrol traffic alone 
teamed up in pairs monday its always better to have two people 
a suspect is less likely to shoot that way said lt toby shy

more potential jurors were questioned today 
in the cocaine trial of john zaccaro jr with attorneys asking 
panelists about the defendants mother former vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro 
questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order monday that 
restricted media coverage of jury selection news organizations 
protested and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a 
pool of six reporters 
all three panelists questioned this morning said they had read 
newspaper accounts of the case since zaccaro was charged in 1986 
with selling onequarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police 
agent zaccaro was a senior at middlebury college 
one potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had 
picked on ferraros family while the former congresswoman was 
the democratic nominee in 1984 and she thought the attacks had 
carried over to the son after his arrest 
however the unidentified woman said her views would not 
interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case 
the press is not trying this case she said the issue is 
did this gentleman sell drugs 
zaccaro faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted 
the longdelayed trial began monday questioning of potential 
panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on 
the impact of drugs on society 
zaccaro 24 was accompanied in court by his parents ferraro 
and john zaccaro sr 
judge francis mccaffery imposed the gag order at the request of 
defense attorneys who were concerned that too many reporters in 
the room could intimidate potential jurors but he lifted it after 
a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among 
lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings 
robert hemley a lawyer representing media organizations 
including the associated press told the judge there would be 
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was 
public 
lawyers on monday completed initial questioning of at least 
seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20 more than 150 
people could be interviewed 
several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the 
role of drugs in society one man who was dismissed said id 
probably be the one going to jail if i catch someone selling drugs 
to my kid 
none of those questioned said ferraros place on the 1984 
democratic party ticket would affect their judgment of her son 
the trial comes more than two years after zaccaro was arrested 
outside the middlebury restaurant where he worked 
the charge involves allegations that zaccaro sold cocaine to 
undercover agent laura manning after she came to his offcampus 
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs 
the case has wound its way slowly through the vermont courts 
zaccaros attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and 
claimed unsuccessfully that zaccaro was singled out for prosecution 
because of his mother 
but the vermont supreme court refused to dismiss the case

a judge has set aside a 300000 jury award 
to an 11yearold girl who sued her father for hitting her in the 
face saying the amount was excessive 
i was shocked at the verdict circuit judge william g 
plummer said monday thats the simplest way i can put it 
he ordered a new trial to decide what compensation samantha 
baskin should receive from her father peter baskin a prominent 
lawyer but he cautioned that the girls emotional health must be 
considered before another trial can begin 
the lawsuit stemmed from an incident jan 19 1985 during which 
samantha was hit in the face after she interrupted an argument 
between her parents 
according to testimony at the threeday trial in january baskin 
and his wife heidi were arguing at the familys falls church home 
when samantha then 8 years old repeatedly told her father to stop 
shouting because she was trying to sleep 
baskin 45 told the jury that he followed his daughter upstairs 
to her bedroom and while he was trying to spank her on the 
buttocks she flipped over cursed him with a word she had been 
reprimanded for using before and he slapped her on the face 
this is a slapintheface case maybe too hard but 
nonetheless parental chastisement for repeated use of profanity 
said leonard s sattler one of baskins attorneys 
sattler argued monday that the award which included interest 
dating to the incident was out of proportion to the injury which 
he described as a temporary bruise 
samanthas attorney david l duff agreed there was limited 
physical injury to his client he argued however that she 
suffered extensive emotional injury duff maintained that 
samanthas bond with her father was absolutely destroyed that 
night 
in a separate court proceeding baskin was acquitted of a 
criminal charge arising out of the incident

results of a polygraph test administered at the request of the us 
drug enforcement administration evidence the defense said would 
prove owens innocence 
owen will be eligible for parole after serving half the 
sentence the year he has served in prison will be subtracted from 
his term 
we dont know what were going to do whether well appeal 
said owens father ernest in a telephone interview its a 
catch 22 how long does an appeal take here maybe a prison 
transfer would be shorter anyway you know hes innocent 
ernest owen and his wife raquel arrived in barcelona on march 
24 
conan owen testified he had been contacted in the united states 
by jorge barahona about a fourday job taking photographs in chile

which he was told contained tourist brochures 
he said he carried the same or a similar suitcase from santiago 
to barcelona

when movie stars mariel hemingway and 
ben cross were filming in the occupied west bank they checked to 
make sure sounds of explosions were coming from the set not from 
battling arabs and israelis 
israeliborn producer yoram benami bought war insurance for 
10000 from the israeli government and hired extra guards to 
protect the actors and crew 
the insurance means that the moviemakers are covered for up to 
2 million if production on their television movie is affected by 
arabisraeli strife 
the 4monthold palestinian uprising interfered in another way 
several arab villages chosen for filming had to be crossed off the 
schedule because we just couldnt take the risk said 
production designer keith wilson 
but actors and crew in steal the sky said during their five 
weeks of filming in israel they were largely untouched by the 
nearly daily violence that has left more than 135 palestinians and 
one israeli soldier dead 
we have been incredibly lucky cross said in an interview on 
a tel aviv set we have filmed in arab quarters and jewish 
quarters and have been in no danger 
at a time when the unrest has caused tourism to decline tennis 
star chris evert to cancel plans to appear in a tournament in 
israel nd roman catholic church officials to call off a palm sunday 
procession the presence of actors and a film crew in the west bank 
is cause for some surprise 
the home box office inc film is the first movie to be made in 
israel since the uprising began dec 8 said benami 
in a way i wanted to make a statement by doing this film here 
now said benami an american citizen who lives in los angeles 
steal the sky is based on a true story and deals with an 
aspect of the arabisraeli conflict 
hemingway plays an israeli mossad secret agent who persuades an 
iraqi pilot portrayed by cross to defect and fly to israel in 
august 1966 aboard one of the coveted sovietbuilt mig21 
airplanes the west wants to examine 
the plane studied by the united states and israel is today in 
the israeli air force museum the agent and the defector vanished 
their identities protected 
scenes that were to take place in iraq were filmed in the 
israelioccupied west banks biblical town of jericho and nearby 
anatot 
the west bank shooting took about two weeks in the disputed 
hills crew members could be heard shouting in english and hebrew 
quiet on the set please sheket bevakasha 
in one scene a military jeep was blown up 
when we were filming and heard shots or special effects i 
often wondered if it was real or not said hemingway 
in israel where politics is interwoven with daily life cross 
said it was impossible to avoid conversations about the current 
debate over what should be done to end the palestinian rioting 
everyone wants to talk about the arabisrael conflict he 
said but because its an emotional subject it is very dangerous 
for me to get caught up in it 
benami said he got the idea to make the film about three years 
ago and got approval from hbo for the 55 million movie last 
year three days of filming in rome and additional days in reno 
nev are also scheduled 
benami said he understood other producers had canceled plans to 
film in israel although he had no specific details 
i am extremely sad that people are so much afraid of suffering 
that they are missing wonderful locations here he said 
the production of steal the sky was a model for coexistence 
said benami we had arabs working as extras he said and 
both arabs and israelis on the crew and our guards are druse 
members of a mystical sect which is an offshoot of islam 
benami said the dialogue in his movie is uptodate its a 
film that shows things that were an issue in israel and the middle 
east 25 years ago are still an issue today 
the israelis have to be strong you cannot make peace with a 
scared people he said we are in a marathon race with the 
arabs whoever is strong will win

the first of 1300 additional 
american troops flew to panama today in what gen manuel antonio 
noriegas military regime called an invasion 
with the first cargo plane scheduled to arrive late this 
afternoon the panamanian health ministry issued a communique 
calling the additional soldiers potential aids carriers 
meanwhile neighbors and aides said state security agents 
surrounded the home of ricardo arias calderon the head of the 
christian democratic party and a leading government opponent 
luis camacho an aide who was in arias calderons home said in 
a telephone interview the house was surrounded monday night by four 
carloads of plainclothes police who continued their vigil early 
today 
camacho said arias calderon was not at home but declined to 
disclose his whereabouts the aide said the party leaders wife and 
other family members were in the house and are virtually 
incommunicado except for the phone 
the health ministry statement said the growing number of 
american soldiers not only constitute an armed threat to our 
sovereignty and independence but a real danger to the health 
of our people 
the ministry maintained that tests showed us military 
personnel show a high rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
a fatal disease that can be transmitted by sexual contact 
knowing their clinical history we can do no less than exhort 
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with 
these soldiers the statement said 
the united states has begun screening military personnel for 
exposure to the virus that causes aids the pentagon reported in 
february that about 3000 of some 2 million active duty personnel 
tested positive for the virus 
the pentagon said last week it was sending the additional 
soldiers to bolster 10500 us troops and installations used to 
protect the panama canal 
the decision followed five weeks of unrest and an opposition 
attempt to oust noriega as head of the 15000member panamanian 
defense forces noriega is the power behind the civilian 
government he is under indictment in the united states on federal 
drug trafficking charges 
la republica a militaryrun newspaper told its readers sunday 
panamanians must prepare themselves to reject the invasion 
the united states contends the troop buildup is within the 
bounds of the 1977 treaties that gave the panama canal zone back to 
panama in 1979 and will give panama the canal at the end of 1999 
the united states which supports the opposition move to oust 
noriega has cut off panamas flow of dollars virtually paralyzing 
the bankrupt government and leading to closure of the nations 
banks 
the us government said on monday it does not plan military or 
further economic actions against panama 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington that 
even though it might take more time than anticipated noriega will 
eventually step down 
opposition leaders insisted on monday that the strike officially 
remained in effect but their call appeared to be generally 
unheeded by retailers 
many factories which are more directly under the control of the 
strike organizers remained closed 
monsignor marcos antonio mcgrath the roman catholic archbishop 
of panama city had offered to mediate panamas dispute between 
noriega and opposition groups but governmentcontrolled television 
stations on monday quoted unidentified government officials as 
saying the government never received a formal written invitation 
from the church 
monsignor oscar brown the auxiliary bishop of panama city said 
in an interview on the channel 2 television station we didnt 
make the invitation in a formal written fashion to each of the 
parties involved 
the invitation was made through our public press conference 
he said we made this public open invitation to all the parties 
involved 
the government held its own national dialogue monday at a 
downtown convention center without the presence of either the 
catholic church or the national civic crusade the main opposition 
alliance

a fired teaching assistants abilities 
werent marred by the native african head wrap she wore in class 
and she cant be denied unemployment benefits for that reason a 
judge has ruled 
the mississippi employment security commission improperly 
witheld compensation from deborah v mcglothin hinds circuit court 
judge frank banks ruled recently 
the 34yearold mcglothin was dismissed as a teaching assistant 
at whitfield elementary school on march 17 1987 principal kisiah 
w nolan recommended the firing because mcglothin refused to stop 
wearing head wraps court records show 
mcglothin went to court because she was refused unemployment 
compensation a commission referee said her firing was based on 
misconduct and that disqualified her from benefits 
there was absolutely no showing that mcglothins dress in any 
way affected her performance or caused a disruption banks said 
in the ruling last week such practices are protected by the 
first amendment to the united states constitution and cannot be 
misconduct within the meaning of the unemployment compensation 
statute so as to deny unemployment benefits 
i hope the case will set a precedent for seriousminded people 
of our culture and religion mcglothin said id like to 
commend judge banks 
mcglothin who hopes to become a certified teacher testified 
the head wrap is a form of cultural and religious expression 
mcglothin said she follows the beliefs of the african hebrew 
israelites of ethiopia 
her religion doesnt force her to wear the head dress but 
members of her faith wear it on occasion especially during times 
of spiritual growth she said at an unemployment commission 
hearing 
nolan had sent her a memo telling her to stop wearing the head 
wrap or be fired court records show 
all children need positive role models but especially do 
elementaryaged children because of their very impressionable young 
minds i am concerned that your appearance is giving them a 
distorted view of what is appropriate nolan said in the memo

san diego police are reevaluating procedures 
that allow vice officers to disrobe and engage in sexual foreplay 
during prostitution investigations a highranking police official 
said 
the probe was prompted by local news accounts of the san diego 
police departments use of such tactics in contrast to metropolitan 
police departments elsewhere in the state said deputy chief norman 
stamper 
we are very carefully evaluating our enforcement posture 
said stamper who recently was assigned to head the forces 
26member vice unit 
according to court records san diego vice officers stripped 
naked and allowed themselves to be fondled last year while 
soliciting for sex during investigations into massage parlors and 
escort services 
the tactics are allowed under state law but police departments 
in los angeles and san francisco and other cities have outlawed 
such activities because they were considered embarrassing to the 
force or entrapment 
the san diego review could take between a few weeks and several 
months stamper said 
any time youre dealing with prostitutes gambling or 
drunkenness one thing is clear vice enforcement is different 
than other types of enforcement stamper said if you want to 
judge it its a dirty messy job 
we pride ourselves on being a professional organization whose 
officers act in a professional manner stamper said

a law firm billed the state department 
of transportation 1593 an hour for the equivalent of 25 days work 
its attorneys spent fighting a land condemnation case 
the department was billed 325000 for 204 hours by the law firm 
of greene greene falck and coalson and two courts approved the 
fee 
the law firm which is now disbanded also collected 1372 an 
hour 280000 from landowner david m foster under a 
contingency fee agreement 
the combined bonanza for the law firm came to 2965 an hour 
the trial judge and the appellate court must have thought it 
was a difficult case when they awarded the fee said william l 
coalson who was a partner in the firm 
the 1593 hourly rate approved by the court was four times 
greater than the previous record of 340 per hour awarded in a 
condemnation case in 1978 according to a memo from the agencys 
lawyers 
the department of transportation is considering taking its case 
to the florida supreme court in part to discourage other lawyers 
from asking for similar fees in cases where the agency takes land 
to build or improve a highway transportation officials said 
the case started when the state offered foster 582000 for nine 
acres to improve an intersection in jacksonville said ken 
towcimak the agencys rightofway chief 
foster argued that the land was far more valuable because it was 
behind a shopping center and therefore ripe for retail development 
at a december 1986 trial the 12member duval county jury said 
the parcel was worth 19 million 13 million more than the 
original offer by the road department 
to fulfill its legal obligation to pay attorney and appraisal 
fees for landowners the road department was ordered by the court 
to pay 325000 although coalsons firm disclosed the contingency 
arrangement by which it had already earned 280000 
what our client pays us with his eyes wide open is none of 
their the states business coalson said

an expert parachutist apparently fell to 
his death when he jumped from a plane without realizing that he 
wasnt wearing a parachute officials say 
the federal aviation administration is investigating the death 
saturday of ivan lester mcguire to learn if pilot mark luman had 
checked to see if mcguire was wearing a parachute walter l 
rigsbee airworthiness inspector for the faas district office in 
raleigh said monday 
mcguire 35 of durham was carrying video equipment to film a 
student and an instructor from the franklin county sports parachute 
center when he jumped to his death from an altitude of 10500 feet 
investigators have ruled out suicide and say mcguire who had 
made more than 800 jumps may have made his fatal mistake because 
he was tired or preoccupied with filming 
we havent gotten all the facts yet but there is a 
regulation no 105 that states that the pilot must check well 
no one may jump unless the pilot checks the parachutes rigsbee 
said 
the video equipment mcguire was carrying may have been mistaken 
for a parachute the faa official said

had escaped from the house after being held for five days in a 
basement tortured and sexually assaulted the owner of the house 
robert berdella was arrested saturday

1985 as well as other unsolved cases to see if there is a 
connection sgt troy cole of the kansas city police departments 
homicide unit said monday 
berdella 39 was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy 
one count of felonious restraint and one count of firstdegree 
assault he pleaded innocent to the charges but remained in custody 
in lieu of 500000 bond 
a skull believed to be that of a human was found sunday buried

computer literacy is low among us students 
because few have adequate access to the machinery according to a 
firstever nationwide survey released tuesday which also found 
minorities falling behind white students 
a majority of the 24000 third seventh and 11th graders 
tested by the national assessment of educational progress knew what 
a joystick and a keyboard were but most had little or no working 
knowledge of computer functions or programs 
despite the muchballyhooed decadeold classroom computer 
revolution most schools have yet to make effective use of 
computers to teach reading math or science according to the 
82page naep report entitled computer competence the first 
national assessment 
among 837 school computer coordinators surveyed naep found 32 
percent of thirdgrade coordinators 23 percent of seventhgrade 
coordinators and 10 percent of 11th grade coordinators did not 
feel adequately prepared to teach computer science 
more than 90 percent of third graders and 86 percent of seventh 
graders said they liked using computers and more than half said 
they wished they used them more 
however a majority said they lacked adequate access to 
computers at school or at home the report also found school 
curricula havent changed to make effective use of computers and 
most teachers arent adequately trained 
the difference is between knowing a little about the computer 
and being able to use it effectively few american school children 
can do the latter said marc tucker president of the national 
center on education and the economy in washington who called the 
naep results disappointing 
naep is a project established 19 years ago by the us congress 
to conduct national surveys of various educational skills it is 
administered by the educational testing service in lawrence 
township nj 
naep examined grade schoolers across the country during the 
spring of 1986 it used multiple choice questions to test student 
knowledge about computers and to gather information about their 
feelings toward computers and how much exposure they have to them 
among the reports findings 
white students scored 5 percent to 8 percent higher on average 
than blacks and hispanics mainly due to greater access to 
computers at home and in school boys also outperformed girls 
slightly private school students had an edge over public 
schoolers and northeastern students knew more about computers than 
those in other regions 
most third graders could identify the main parts of a 
computer such as the keyboard floppy disk and joystick by 
seventh grade nearly all could 
but only three out of ten 11th graders knew what an algorithm is 
a step by step process for solving a given type of problem 
only 323 percent of third graders 343 percent of seventh 
graders and 46 percent of 11th graders could correctly answer 
what is the main role of a computer program answer to tell 
the computer what to do 
except for word processing students generally scored poorly 
on questions dealing with computer applications making graphics 
or working with databases for example because students said they 
hardly ever got a chance to practice 
more than eight of 10 seventh and 11thgraders said they 
never used computers to make a database slightly over half said 
they never used them to write letters stories or reports and 
roughly threequarters said they never used them to make graphs 
student knowledge of three common computer languages logo 
basic and pascal was also found to be poor largely because only 
about 10 percent of students said they had written computer 
programs more than once a week about twothirds of those surveyed 
said they had never written computer programs 
the grim assessment suggests that schools have only dented the 
ignorance most students and teachers have of computers despite the 
huge purchases of equipment by many schools during the 1980s in 
1980 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of high 
schools offered computer instruction by 1985 82 percent of 
elementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so 
although some schools offer excellent computer curricula many 
other schools apparently do not provide effective instruction at 
least in computer applications and programming to a large 
proportion of pupils the survey concluded

democratic candidate jesse jackson today 
complained that the slow count of caucus results in colorado was 
beyond explanation and suggested it may have been delayed to 
give the appearance of a lead for rival michael dukakis 
jackson said colorado state democratic party chairman buie 
seawell had appeared biased and politically unethical for 
remaining in control of the party apparatus while endorsing dukakis 
the state chairman endorsed mr dukakis jackson said you 
cannot very well be a fair referee and coaching another player 
jackson said colorado democrats had changed 30 caucus sites as 
late as friday or saturday without telling the jackson campaign 
jackson said his campaign manager gerald austin had been 
trying to reach democratic party chairman paul kirk to protest the 
colorado situation 
it comes very close to obstructing justice jackson said he 
said the changing of caucus sites goes to the heart of the 
preclearance provisions of the voting rights act 
as an example of unfairness jackson said one of the caucus 
sites was in the governors mansion 
a caucus site in the governors mansion does not appear to be 
proper he said the caucus sites should be in very public 
places mutually agreed upon by the candidates and the party 
jackson said he did not publicly protest the changing of caucus 
sites while campaigning in colorado over the weekend because he 
wanted to avoid creating conflict 
he said austin had protested to seawell whose response jackson 
described as not one that was rationale 
jackson spoke to reporters after appearing before auto workers 
in kenosha the last stop of his campaign in wisconsin as voters 
were going to the polls for the state presidential primary 
this long and slow count represents a certain ineptness it 
heightens suspicions jackson said 
jackson said the point was underscored by the fact that missing 
precincts were in denver and boulder not remote areas as of this 
afternoon only a quarter of the denver vote had been counted 
to report selectively certain precincts today could be a way 
of feeding the media on a timetable that favors a candidate you 
favor and of course the state chairman favors a candidate 
its controlling the process jackson said 
the fact is the count should have been in now it is 
unthinkable in 1988 with all this technology that denver and 
boulder would come in last he said 
the state democratic party early this morning called off 
counting for the night with dukakis in the lead with 44 percent of 
the precincts reporting the massachusetts governor had 46 percent 
to jacksons 40 percent 
its beyond explanation the returns are this slow and this 
late jackson said 
he said seawells endorsement undermines credibility and makes 
the process look to be less than just 
but jackson added that he wasnt trying to impugn anyones 
character 
jackson was hoping in wisconsin to demonstrate broad support 
beyond minorities who make up a small portion of the voting 
population in the state and repeat the success he scored with a 
landslide victory in neighboring michigan 10 days earlier 
jackson was runing behind dukakis in the latest wisconsin 
polling but the race was considered a close twoway contest with 
democrats albert gore jr and paul simon also running 
jackson hoped as in colorado a day earlier that the large 
enthusiastic and racially mixed crowds that greeted him were a 
harbinger of the primary outcome 
as he campaigned however jackson was dogged at every stop by 
questions about his appeal to panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega to leave and offering to do whatever i can to help 
alleviate the suffering an appeal that he made two weeks ago 
but that burst back into view with noriegas response on the eve of 
the voting 
faced with a suggestion from the state department that he was 
interfering jackson telephoned top state department officials from 
a campaign stop and told reporters he and the administration were 
in agreement on the need for noriega to leave and for humanitarian 
aid to panamas poor 
our positions in fact overlap jackson said our position 
that he should go is the same 
jackson said he was not warned to tone down his efforts but the 
suggestion of a foreign policy misstep was not what the jackson 
campaign wanted just at the time it was seeking a breakthrough in 
substantial white support

a convicted marijuana smuggler told congress 
today of an offer eight years ago by thenpanamian ruler omar 
torrijos and an aide manuel antonio noriega to use an island 
off panama for drug shipments 
but the smuggler michael p vogel said he and an associate 
rejected the offer because the two panamanian leaders were being 
extremely extremely greedy 
vogel said he traveled to panama in late 1979 or early 1980 with 
a cuban associate who was interested in establishing a shipment 
base for drugs they met with torrijos and noriega who now is 
panamas military ruler and under us indictment on drug charges 
for about three hours he testified 
they wanted x amount of dollars for each pound of 
marijuana or about 100000 per trip vogel said an amount out 
of proportion for the small shipments he had planned 
vogel also described for the senate foreign relations narcotics 
subcommittee the elaborate methods he and other smugglers developed 
over his 14year career to evade us drug interdiction efforts 
the methods included intelligence collection sometimes using 
officials inside federal agencies and electronic countermeasures 
to detect law enforcment vessels smugglers would obtain the radio 
frequencies officials used for communications and even had the 
frequency of air force one the presidents plane at one point he 
testified 
vogel now is serving a 12year sentence for his activities and 
testified under oath on the second day of a weeklong continuation 
of the panels probe of the drug trade 
on monday a former us ambassador told the panel that reagan 
administration officials helped a honduran general involved in a 
drugfinanced plot to assassinate that countrys president get a 
lighter sentence 
francis mcneil former us ambassador to costa rica told a 
senate subcommittee monday that top us officials interceded on 
behalf of honduran gen jose bueso rosa because he had helped the 
administrations program of aiding the nicaraguan contra rebels 
among those who interceded on bueso rosas behalf was assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams the administrations top 
official in charge of interamerican affairs and a prime architect 
of the contra policy mcneil said 
mcneil said bueso rosa was charged in the united states with 
taking part in a plot financed by drug trafficking profits to 
assassinate honduran president roberto suazo in 1984 
two others involved in the unsuccessful plot received long 
sentences but bueso rosa got off with a fiveyear term after the 
us officials interceded for him said mcneil 
at least one reason for the intervention was the generals 
past usefulness to the contra program he said 
the state department censored part of mcneils testimony which 
detailed how abrams at one point in 1986 urged that noriega be 
pressured from power because of his drugrelated activities but 
later changed his mind after apparently becoming convinced noriega 
was essential to the contra policy 
while the testimony was blacked out on copies of mcneils 
statement sen alfonse damato rny referred to it and read 
part of it in open session 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley today denied that 
abrams had sought to help bueso rosa get a lighter sentence or a 
pardon saying he simply went along with a judges recommendation 
that the general be allowed to serve his time at a minimum security 
prison and she said mcneil because he did not formulate 
panamanian policy was not in a position to comment credibly on 
any change of heart by abrams toward noriega 
the subcommittee also heard testimony monday that noriega 
probably has evidence of us officials complicity in central 
american drug trafficking and is using it to buy time 
jose i blandon a former intelligence official and consul 
general for panama who defected last year produced a document 
noriega sent to the countrys us diplomatic offices in february 
saying he has proof that american officials knowingly established 
policies that supported people involved in the drug business 
general noriega says he has proof of the involvement of us 
government authorities in drugs in central america blandon said 
in spanish through an interpreter at the hearing of the 
subcommittee on narcotics blandon mentioned trafficking in panama 
guatemala and costa rica 
asked by the subcommittee chairman sen john kerry dmass 
whether he believes noriega actually has such proof blandon 
answered yes 
later kerry said he too believes that noriega has potentially 
embarrassing information about us officials and is using it to 
try to maintain himself in power in panama 
kerry said he did not pursue the matter more extensively in the 
public hearing because he is still awaiting corroboration of that 
and other information about alleged use of airstrips used to 
resupply the usbacked contra rebels in nicaragua to handle drug 
shipments as well 
its significant enough that its going to create a stir 
kerry said noting that the information involves an israeli 
citizen michael harare who used airstrips in the region to help 
resupply the contras 
while congress is in recess kerry scheduled a full week of 
hearings on us antidrug efforts in central america he said a 
series of witnesses would piece together a mosaic that portrays 
us foreign policy interests in the region such as support for 
the contras as frequently taking precedence over the war on drugs 
one thing that leaps out is that despite all the rhetoric 
and the talk about a war on drugs there has not been a real war 
kerry said

romanian officials have spelled out plans 
to erase 7000 villages and form big agriculturalindustrial 
centers by the year 2000 a move that critics of the regime say 
will ruin traditional country life 
the huge project unveiled last month by romanian communist party 
leader nicolae ceausescu calls for radical cuts in the number of 
villages from 13000 to only 5000 or 6000 
a statement published march 4 in the party daily scinteia said 
the move aims to eradicate basic differences betweeen villages 
and cities and ensure the harmonious development of all areas of 
the country 
romanian officials writing in the government press say the 
program is intended to gain about 765600 acres of land for use by 
stateowned collective farms 
they say this will be achieved by banning construction of 
onefamily homes and concentrating several families in citystyle 
apartment blocks 
thousands of such apartment blocks many with only rudimentary 
amenities have been built since 1986 when a new systematization 
law on getting more farmland was passed 
families put into such apartment blocks lose their traditional 
small plots which are regarded as a staple provider of food in the 
shortageplagued communist nation and they must use communal 
facilities to grow food and raise livestock 
about 8300 apartments were built in 15 rural communities around 
bucharest last year according to official figures 
the entire project amounts to the destruction of villages the 
traditional family cell of romanians said mihnea berindei a 
romanian emigre living in paris in a telephone interview with the 
associated press on tuesday 
berindei who is spokesman of the parisbased league for the 
defense of human rights in romania said thousands of churches also 
were threatened with demolition under the systematization 
plans the official title for the project to reduce the number of 
villages 
this project has no equivalent in eastern europe he said 
in 1981 ceausescu launched a new agricultural revolution 
aimed at boosting disappointing cereal outputs the source of 
widespread food shortages and rationing 
romanian agriculture has been plagued by lack of incentives 
fodder shortages for private livestock and a system of contracting 
which forces farmers to sell their produce to the state under 
obligatory contracts against low prices 
despite official promises in december to enable each romanian to 
buy about 13 pounds of meat a month on average meat is still 
rationed to a little more than two pounds per capita a month and is 
in short supply romanian sources say 
addressing a conference of local government officials in 
bucharest on march 3 ceausescu announced the villages project will 
entail the merger of scores of villages and communes into 558 
agriculturalindustrial centers viewed as communities linking 
rural and town life 
the nationwide undertaking is likely to lead to the relocation 
of hundreds of thousands of villagers from old family homes to 
twoor threestory apartment blocks with communal kitchens and 
sanitary installations 
ceausescu urged in his speech that doctors teachers and farm 
engineers who live in nearby towns and commute daily to the 
villages where they are employed should move into the rural 
apartment blocks starting this year 
some apartments destined for the village intelligentsia have 
already been built and officials say the program will be completed 
by 1989 
half of romanias population of 23 million resides in the 
country according to official figures the collectivized 
agriculture is almost fully stateowned except for 9 percent of 
farmland permitted to peasants as small private plots around their 
homes or in hilly areas where collectivization was not possible

presidential contenders michael dukakis and jesse jackson headed 
into battle in todays wisconsin primary on the heels of an 
inconclusive contest in colorado jackson blasted the colorado 
state chairman for biased and politically unethical actions in 
the slowmoving count 
monday nights colorado caucuses were a seesaw battle that saw 
first one and then the other gain the upper hand when the state 
democratic party quit counting early this morning dukakis had 46 
percent to jacksons 40 percent with just under half the precincts 
reporting 
however when the counting resumed today jackson gained ground 
lagging behind dukakis 42 percent to 44 percent 
dukakis had grabbed an early lead monday night in the colorado 
contest but jackson quickly caught up and even passed him when 
denver results began coming in then dukakis pulled ahead again 
today in kenosha wis jackson complained that the dribble of 
caucus results from colorado could have been delayed to give the 
appearance of a lead for dukakis colorado democratic chairman buie 
seawell a dukakis supporter directed the count 
this long and slow count represents a certain ineptness it 
heightens suspicions jackson said you cannot very well be a 
fair referee and coaching another player 
tennessee sen albert gore jr lagged far behind with 4 percent 
and sen paul simon didnt get enough votes to count 
simon his campaign fading said he hoped to score with 
wisconsins voters today but he added if we dont do well we 
have to make a reevaluation well take one step at a time 
preprimary polls put simon a distant fourth in wisconsin 
on the republican side vice president george bush sailed to a 
strong lead in colorados gop straw polls 
while voters were calling the shots in wisconsin today the 
candidates scattered to regroup for bigstate contests coming up in 
new york pennsylvania and ohio in the next month 
dukakis sounded upbeat as he awaited the verdict in wisconsin 
it looks good he said as he arrived home in boston monday 
night we worked hard 
the four democratic presidential hopefuls campaigned monday 
across wisconsin with jackson getting heat from rivals for his 
contact with panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
dukakis joined the criticism of jackson but that didnt stop 
gore from saying the massachusetts governor gives the impression 
of being scared to death to take on jackson 
dukakis in turn icily suggested gore spend more time 
campaigning for votes and less time criticizing other candidates 
although bush has the gop nomination wrapped up former 
television evangelist pat robertson still contested colorado with 
its 36 delegates at stake 
jackson and dukakis made weekend campaign swings to colorado 
trying to rally support for 2784 precinct caucuses that began the 
states delegateselection process 
jacksons enthusiastic crowds on saturday and sunday were taken 
as an indication of his strength but dukakis had the backing of 
colorado gov roy romer and state democratic chairman buie seawell 
the democratic frontrunners are locked in a close delegate 
battle nationally meaning colorados 45 national convention 
delegates were a prize well worth pursuing 
before colorado dukakis had 67155 votes and jackson 66555 
gore had 3818 and simon 1705 a total of 5086 were uncommitted 
at the atlanta convention in july 2082 votes are needed to win 
todays wisconsin primary was the weeks big prize 
not only are at 81 democratic delegates at stake but the state 
offered a chance for each of the candidates to make a crucial point 
dukakis sought a win in a big midwestern primary to demonstrate 
his campaign is back on track after losses in illinois and 
michigan jackson looked to demonstrate that he could keep his 
momentum going and win a big state with a small black population 
on the strength of major white support 
gore made major television buys to try to make a splash before 
the new york primary on april 19 the doordie contest for him 
and simon needed a victory or something close to it to avoid 
withdrawing from the race later this week 
mondays campaigning was marked by quarreling among the 
democrats about who had said what and who had done what 
much of the attention focused on jackson who made public 
noriegas reply to his march 22 letter asking the panamanian 
strongman to give up power noriega refused and jackson restated 
his plea 
i remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the 
panamanian people for gen noriega to leave today i reiterate my 
public moral appeal for him to depart jackson said 
jacksons actions drew criticism inside the campaign and outside 
i think its a bad idea for a private citizen to try to inject 
himself into a delicate international situation dukakis said 
but he said he believed jacksons intentions were good 
thats more than gore gave jackson credit for i seriously 
doubt if he would help in panama the tennessee senator said 
and the state department added its criticism as well 
in our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that noriega 
likes to use to buy time said department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley 
but gore didnt make jackson his only target 
michael dukakis gives the impression of being scared to 
death to criticize jackson and appears absolutely timid gore 
said 
dukakis was clearly irritated 
sen gore ought to start campaigning for the presidency he 
retorted pointing to gores lack of success since super tuesday

demonstrated tuesday that the video version of the national 
newspaper will mirror the publication that spawned it 
at a news conference at the newspapers offices just outside 
washington the executive producer and four hosts of the program 
discussed a show they said will offer segments that people find 
interesting and understandable graphics that will glitter and 
stories that will supplement not compete with the network news 
if we cant do it better or different were not going to do 
it the shows executive producer steve friedman said once

the newspaper it will have segments devoted to news lifestyle 
sports and business focusing on articles that will appear in usa 
today the next morning 
friedman said the producers so far had 118 firm contracts with 
television stations across the country to broadcast the program

americans are eating too much animal fat and 
government regulations make it difficult for the food industry to 
market leaner and more healthful meats and dairy products a 
scientific panel said tuesday 
although consumption of animal fat has gone down many americans 
still are eating their way to poor health with too much 
cholesterol fatty acids and salt and not enough foods that 
provide the needed calcium and iron said a report by a committee of 
the national research council 
it said the incidence of nutritionrelated health problems is 
significant affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every 
american family 
among the dietrelated health problems cited 
about 34 million americans are overweight 
nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease 
that may be related to the consumption of highcholesterol foods 
osteoporosis a disease caused by leaching of calcium from 
bone strikes 15 to 20 million adults 
between 8 million and 12 million children are hungry because of 
inadequate diets 
iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia 
the chairman of the panel david l call of cornell university 
told reporters that animal products are a mixed blessing 
nutritionally in the american diet 
in our food supply they animal products provide about 36 
percent of our food energy and between 36 percent and 100 percent 
of certain nutrients he said 
at the same time however animal products contribute more 
than half of the total fat nearly threefourths of the saturated 
fatty acids and all of the dietary cholesterol 
a change in some government regulations along with education of 
consumers and technological advances by manufacturers of animal 
food products could correct the problems relatively quickly said 
timothy hammonds of the supermarket industrys food marketing 
institute a member of the committee 
in the future the consumers could have it all with more 
healthful meats and dairy products that provide the needed 
nutrition without excess fats and cholesterol hammonds said 
the key he said is changes in the government regulations that 
would provide an economic incentive to producers to change their 
products 
among the changes recommended 
permitting packers to trim fat from animal carcasses at the 
slaughter plant this system called hot fat trimming would 
encourage meat producers to grow beef and lambs that are leaner 
because they no longer would be rewarded for the fat added to the 
carcasses through heavy feeding and feed supplements 
packers would like to trim the fat but they cant do that 
because government regulations wont let them said committee 
member gary c smith of texas aampm university 
the agriculture department which controls meat grading has 
issued proposed hot fat trimming rules for comment by the 
industry 
reducing what call said is fuzziness in marketing terms 
identifying meats and dairy products that have reduced fats or 
other nutritional changes the current system approved by the food 
and drug administration bases product identification in some cases 
on fat content call said some frozen desserts for example 
cannot be called ice cream because of a reduced fat content 
bologna sausage and mayonnaise also must have certain levels of 
fat or else be labeled as imitations call noted 
as another example hammond of the food marketing institute said 
dairies can reduce the amount of salt in cheeses but when the 
product is marketed it cannot be called cheese because its 
reduced salt content does not meet the fda standard 
the committee also asked for more precise standards for the use 
of such meat marketing terms as lite light and lean 
developing technology to determine the leantofat ratio of 
food animals while they are still on the hoof or shortly after 
slaughter the committee suggested this might be done with 
electronic sensors now are used in medicine 
encouraging research in genetics or feed supplement technology 
that would produce leaner meats 
smith of texas aampm said the industry has made remarkable 
progress in producing leaner meats during the last two decades 
pork producers he said have made the most progress because a 
meat grading system for swine has provided incentives to reward 
leanness similar incentives would contribute to changes among beef 
and lamb producers he said 
committee member scott m grundy a nutrition scientist at the 
university of texas said that despite the potential health 
problems animal products consumed in appropriate portions are 
essential parts of the diet 
meat and dairy products are important sources of such nutrients 
as calcium and iron and the primary source of some proteins he 
said 
the national research council is an arm of the 
governmentsupported national science foundation

new yorks primary with its prize of 255 
delegates and its reluctant governor takes on even more importance 
in the next two weeks as the democratic presidential race staggers 
out of the midwest without a leader 
tomorrow its really going to get crazy said john marino a 
top new york party official on tuesday 
at stake for the democrats in new york is a national convention 
delegation second in size only to californias 336member entourage 
and looming over the primary is gov mario cuomo reluctant to 
run for president himself but equally reluctant to anoint any other 
democrat 
cuomos coyness has fueled speculation for months about the 
prospect of a deadlocked convention and desperate democrats turning 
to him with the nomination as the primaries and caucuses unfolded 
and the democrats remained without a frontrunner cuomos refusal 
to endorse a candidate or rule out a convention draft prompted a 
new round of rumors 
there is also a republican primary on april 19 in new york with 
102 delegates at stake but it is considered little more than a 
formality as vice president george bush rolls toward the gop 
nomination 
the outcome of the new york primary for democrats however 
could provide answers to questions raised by the earlier primaries 
including 
can massachusetts gov michael dukakis get his campaign rolling 
enough to again convince party leaders that he deserves the 
nomination he campaigned in new york tuesday even before the 
wisconsin polls closed 
can jesse jacksons solid support among minority voters and the 
backing of several prominent new york labor leaders overcome jewish 
uneasiness and produce a new york victory 
will tennessee sen albert gore jrs decision to put most of 
his remaining eggs in the new york basket prove to be anything more 
than a nice posteaster gift for some television stations and one 
wellknown political consultant 
along with cuomo most of the states other major democrats 
such as new york city mayor edward koch and sen daniel patrick 
moynihan are remaining neutral koch has said he wants to go to 
the national convention as leader of a draftcuomo movement 
while some democrats have said they want cuomo to get into the 
race now his top political advisers insist thats not about to 
happen 
he is as staunch as hes ever been said cuomo political 
adviser meyer frucher of the governors reaction to such 
entreaties the more you argue with him the more adamant he 
gets 
the new york primary ballot will include a procuomo uncommitted 
delegate slate arranged by a group of elected upstate democratic 
county clerks who want to see the governor in the race cuomo has 
disavowed any connection with the effort 
for his part cuomo has said he and other party leaders should 
round up enough extra votes after the last primaries to guarantee 
the nomination to the frontrunner at that point whoever it is 
at the moment marino said the edge in new york has to go to 
jackson because of his strong support among blacks and hispanics 
i dont care what any poll says jackson has the strongest 
base said the cuomo political operative 
recent polls among new york democrats have dukakis leading the 
field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent depending 
on the poll jackson has been consistently second at just under 30 
percent while gore and simon have yet to crack double digits in any 
of the polls 
while marino says new york is important to all the candidates 
the state partys executive director said al gore has to win this 
state outright to remain viable 
gore has hired new york political consultant david garth who 
runs kochs campaigns and who occasionally advises cuomo gore will 
spend more than 1 million in new york much of it for television 
advertising 
gore striving to make an impact with new yorks politically 
important jewish community has been attacking jackson and dukakis 
on the issue of support for israel if gores message has an impact 
it could hurt dukakis most jacksons support among new york jews 
is minimal following his hymietown gaffe in 1984 
jackson is relying on his strong minority support coupled with 
a growing acceptance among white voters to win more than the 26 
percent he garnered in 1984 
jackson plans a big television purchase in new york a tool he 
hasnt used much in other states he also has the support of 
influential labor leaders such as stanley hill executive director 
of the 120000member new york city municipal workers union and 
jan pierce a top official with the communications workers of 
america 
according to marino jackson and dukakis have the best 
organizations dukakis also has the most money to spend possibly 
as much as 3 million for the new york effort

sen alfonse m damato and defense secretary 
frank carlucci disagreed today on whether damato had called 
carlucci a coward because he is not doing enough to get rid of 
panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega 
damato rny released a letter from carlucci that referred 
to a telephone conversation the two had last week in the letter 
carlucci wrote 
you charge that i and the joint chiefs of staff are 
cowards and that we are supporting a drug dealer 
carlucci said he had been reflecting on your emotioncharged 
telephone call and that the senators charges are unwarranted 
and insulting 
the defense secretary wrote i hope you can indicate to me 
that you did not mean them as stated i have shown this letter to 
the joint chiefs of staff 
in releasing carluccis letter damatos spokesman jack 
kinnicutt said that damato apparently called carlucci a 
coward in the telephone conversation i wasnt sitting in on 
the phone call but from what i hear boy it was hot kinnicutt 
said 
hours later damato said through another spokesman i did not 
call carlucci a coward my recollection of the conversation was 
that i said the inaction would be perceived as cowardly 
damato in a subsequent letter sent to carlucci today said he 
did not believe that the joint chiefs of staff are cowards there 
is no doubt however that the lack of us action in panama has 
made us appear weak in many peoples eyes 
at a news conference today damato said he had told carlucci 
we are being perceived as cowards lacking the resolve to deal 
with a drug dealer a tinhorn drug dealer by the name of noriega 
its not a question of questioning anybodys particular manhood or 
the patriotism of the joint chiefs as a matter of fact i never 
mentioned the joint chiefs in that matter 
kinnicutt said that during the phone call damato complained 
that carlucci was willing to send 3200 soldiers to honduras but 
would not send a senior military officer to panama to tell noriega 
to get out 
carluccis letter did not address the substance of damatos 
complaint that the us government had sent a mere deputy 
assistant secretary of state to panama to impress this thug 
meaning noriega 
the assistant secretary william walker visited noriega who 
is under a us drug trafficking indictment on march 21 and told 
him according to damato that noriegas continued presence in 
panama is untenable 
noriega laughed at him damato told the buffalo ny 
news we should have sent somebody with military authority 
somebody who represents military power thats the only thing 
noriega understands

arab hijackers armed with pistols and 
hand grenades today commandeered a kuwaiti airways jumbo jet with 
112 people aboard forced it to land in iran and threatened to blow 
it up 
irans official media said the hijackers demanded the release of 
17 proiranian prisoners held in kuwait that is the same demand 
made by iranianbacked shiite moslems holding foreign hostages in 
lebanon 
three members of kuwaits royal alsabah family and one 
passenger with an american passport reportedly were aboard the 
boeing 747 which was hijacked to mashhad in northeastern iran on a 
flight from bangkok to kuwait 
irans official islamic republic news agency said the hijackers 
allowed a jordanian passenger with a heart condition off the 
aircraft after it was surrounded by iranian security troops 
it quoted the passenger business executive mustafa issa 42 as 
saying five or six hijackers armed with pistols and hand grenades 
seized the plane three hours after it took off from bangkok 
kuwait urged iran to handle the incident wisely and 
requested that the aircraft not be allowed to take off but irna 
quoted issa as saying the hijackers were insisting on flying on to 
an undetermined destination 
it quoted him as saying he heard them say they hijacked the 
aircraft in order to vindicate their denied rights from the kuwaiti 
government 
iran first denied the plane permission to land but reversed its 
decision when the pilot said the jet was running out of fuel irna 
said 
the agency said the hijackers demanded fuel and threatened to 
blow up the aircraft if any person should attempt to approach 
it 
prime minister hussein musavi of iran told tehran radio he was 
trying to resolve the incident peacefully to save the lives of 
the people on board 
he sent his deputy for political affairs ali reza moayyeri to 
mashhad said the broadcast monitored in nicosia 
kuwaiti airways said flight 422 was carrying 97 passengers and 
15 crew members 
elias h shiber the airlines manager in bangkok said the 
passenger list included 30 kuwaitis 22 britons eight thais 
various other nationalities and one person with both an american 
and egyptian passport the airline identified him as r 
attiaallaali 
shiber said the three members of kuwaits ruling family aboard 
were ibtesam khaled alsabah fadil khaled alsabah and the wife of 
khaled anwar alsabah hundreds of kuwaitis are related to kuwaits 
emir 
irna said the aircraft landed in mashhad at 730 am midnight 
edt and completed refueling three hours later 
the iranian agency said the hijackers spoke in arabic and 
identified themselves as arabs 
the kuwait news agency quoted a spokesman for the airline as 
saying contact was lost with the aircraft while it flew over 
muscat oman and an iranian foreign ministry spokesman said the 
plane flew into iranian airspace from the direction of the gulf of 
oman 
in kuwait a government spokesman said the foreign ministry 
summoned iranian charge daffaires mohammed faroughy and told him 
kuwait is confident that the concerned iranian authorities will 
handle the issue wisely in a manner that ensures the safety of the 
passengers the crew and the plane 
the unidentified kuwaiti government spokesman told the kuwait 
news agency kuwait also asked the iranian government not to 
allow the airliner to take off from iran and to take all measures 
necessary to prevent such takeoff 
diplomatic relations between iran and kuwait have been strained 
since august when iranians stormed the embassies of kuwait and 
saudi arabia in tehran kuwait closed its embassy in tehran and 
brought its diplomats home later kuwait limited the number of 
iranians at irans embassy in kuwait to two 
proiranian gunmen hijacked a kuwaiti airways jetliner to tehran 
in december 1984 they killed two american passengers before 
iranian commandos stormed the aircraft ending the sixday ordeal 
at the time the hijackers demanded the release of kuwaitis 
jailed in the 1983 bombings that targeted us and french embassies 
in kuwait the kuwait government refused to negotiate shiites 
holding foreign hostages in lebanon also have demanded the 17 
prisoners release 
dozens of shiite terrorists most of them either of iranian 
descent or loyal to its islamic revolution have been arrested and 
convicted of sabotage in the past five years the overwhelming 
majority of irans population is shiite 
in the persian gulf arab states sunni moslems dominate the 
government 
kuwait is the closest arab nation to iran and iraq which are 
locked in a 7yearold war iran has often accused kuwait of 
actively aiding iraqs military effort

michael dukakis and jesse jackson locked in a 
grinditout struggle for the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination faced off tuesday in the wisconsin primary dukakis led 
his rival narrowly in a slow count from the colorado caucuses 
sen albert gore jr spent heavily in wisconsin and sought an 
elusive breakthrough outside his native south sen paul simon 
struggled for survival with several big industrial states still to 
come beginning with new york on april 19 
vice president george bush won colorado handily and faced only 
nominal opposition in wisconsin as he continued his grand march 
toward nomination at the republican national convention this summer 
with returns compiled from 51 percent of colorados precincts 
massachusetts gov dukakis was winning 44 percent of the vote 
jackson the man with momentum in the race since his smashing 
michigan landslide 10 days ago had 42 percent gore had 3 percent 
dukakis had 3035 county delegates to jacksons 2915 
jackson complained that party officials who favored dukakis were 
manipulating the slow count it heightens suspicions he said 
its beyond explanation 
early republican straw poll numbers from colorados caucuses 
monday night showed bush with 1288 votes or 78 percent and 
former television evangelist pat robertson with 136 or 8 percent 
but wisconsin loomed as a far more important test than colorado 
in the seesaw democratic struggle partially because it offered 
more delegates 81 compared with colorados 45 democratic rivals 
invested heavily in time and money in their bid to claim the 
support of wisconsins large blue collar vote and gain fresh 
momentum for the rest of the primary season 
dukakis held a shaky lead over jackson in preelection surveys 
in overwhelmingly white wisconsin with tennessee sen gore a 
distant third illinois sen simon lagged with singledigit support 
in the polls and seemed likely to suspend his campaign if he fared 
poorly 
for the democrats wisconsin turned out to be a surprisingly 
important test in their nominating wars a gauge of a struggling 
dukakis campaign and of jacksons surprising momentum it was a 
prelude as well to delegaterich primaries in new york 
pennsylvania and ohio just ahead 
dukakis looked for a victory to silence the critics who said 
defeats last month in illinois and michigan called into question 
his ability to attract the blue collar votes a democrat needs to 
win the white house in the fall election 
jackson aimed for a win in a state where only 4 percent of the 
voters were black reckoning that would give him dramatic new 
stature in the race 
gore spent heavily in television advertising in hopes of 
sneaking up on his rivals or at least winning 20 percent of the 
popular vote he needed that much to requalify for federal 
matching campaign funds 
simon said a poor finish would force him to reassess his 
candidacy a decision to suspend rather than withdraw was one 
possibility aides said a move designed to gain additional 
delegates from his homestate of illinois to be used in any 
backroom brokering at the party convention this summer 
for republicans there was no suspense at all 
bush ran a television advertising campaign in wisconsin but it 
was hard to see why following sen bob doles withdrawal a week 
ago robertson was his only active rival and he didnt bother 
campaigning in the state 
wisconsin had 81 democratic delegates at stake with the bounty 
parceled out on the basis of popular vote by congressional district 
republicans had 47 
bush began the day with 841 delegates out of 1039 needed for 
the nomination robertson had 17 
dukakis led jackson 67155 to 66555 gore had 3818 delegates 
and simon had 1705 it takes 2081 to claim the democratic 
nomination 
so unpredictable was the democratic race that campaign aides 
said it might hinge on factors entirely beyond their reach 
milwaukee picked a new mayor for the first time since 1960 and 
the forecast was for an unusually heavy vote in the states biggest 
city 
under state rules republicans were permitted to cross over and 
vote in the democratic contest when gop gov tommy thompson made 
complimentary remarks about jackson last week some democrats 
feared that republicans might do just that mischievously voting 
for the former civil rights leader in the belief that he would be 
an easy victim for bush in november

dukakis and jackson competing frontrunners in the democratic 
race approached wisconsin and its large blue collar vote in 
markedly different ways 
dukakis used the week following his connecticut primary victory 
to retool his campaigns message and style as he sought to erase 
the impression of poor showings in the illinois primary and 
michigan caucuses he vowed that he would summon chrysler corp 
chairman lee iacocca to the white house and jawbone him into 
abandoning plans to close a plant in kenosha i dont want to be 
known as the great communicator he said in a shot at the 
departing president reagan i weant to be known as a great 
builder 
he revamped his style as well serving lunch to senior citizens 
one day and visiting a childrens hospital on another as he bid to 
shed his image as an aloof technocrat 
he also began gingerly criticizing jackson hoping to stall the 
former civil rights leaders momentum in the democratic race when 
jackson wrote to panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega and 
urged him to leave his country dukakis said that was a bad 
idea 
jackson owner of campaign momentum after his surprise victory 
in michigan spread his message of hope to the outofluck and 
sought to cash in on the time he spent on picket lines when other 
contenders were nowhere to be seen 
i have stood with you now stand with me he implored the 
outofluck chrysler workers in kenosha meatpackers in cudahy and 
paper mill strikers in depere 
to win farmer and worker rural and urban black and white 
must come together jackson told more than 2500 farmers in 
amery a dairy farming community in northern wisconsin 
as evidence of the building interest in jacksons campaign 
aides disclosed that he raised 22 million in contributions last 
month more than he raised in all of 1987 
gore criticized jacksons views on the mideast in a speech 
seemingly aimed more at the new york electorate that will vote in 
two weeks than at wisconsin voters then he criticized dukakis for 
failing to criticize jackson enough 
michael dukakis gives the impression of being scared to 
death to criticize jackson gore said near the end of his 
wisconsin campaigning that is the opposite of bold leadership 
gore spent heavily in television advertising and claimed at the 
end that the undecided vote was breaking his way 
simon winner so far only at home in illinois staked his 
chances on wisconsins proud progressive tradition 
in the style of underdogs everywhere he urged voters to send a 
message that said were not going to follow the pollsters were 
going to elect the man best qualified to be president

rose mofford one day after becoming 
governor upon evan mechams conviction on impeachment charges 
today took the oath of office as the states chief executive 
mrs mofford as secretary of state served as acting governor 
since mecham was impeached by the state house in february 
let us purge our hearts of suspicion and hate mrs mofford 
said in a statement issued monday i did not ask for this burden 
but i do not shrink from the job before me 
she was given the oath during this mornings brief private 
ceremony in the governors offices by arizona supreme court chief 
justice frank x gordon jr who presided over the impeachment 
trial justice william a holohan held the bible 
mechams removal from office monday climaxed 15 months of 
turmoil stirred up by what critics called his insensitivity to 
minorities and the disorder and corruption that plagued his 
administration 
i feel relieved that this nightmare is over republican sen 
greg lunn said monday after mecham a firstterm republican became 
the first us governor in 59 years to be impeached and stripped of 
his office 
despite his ouster mecham said today hes doing fine 
mecham 63 showed no emotion as the arizona senate voted 219 
to convict him of trying to obstruct an investigation of a alleged 
death threat and 264 of misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund twenty votes were required for conviction 
minutes later he smiled and told reporters well they dont 
like my politics so we finished a political trial its as simple 
as that 
reached by telephone at his home this morning mecham said i 
dont know why people keep asking how ive been bearing up ive 
never had any trouble bearing up ive got a clear conscience and i 
havent done anything wrong 
this job wasnt the end of the world for me he added i 
didnt need it in the first place my main concern is for the 
people of arizona 
the 30member senate defeated 1713 a motion to bar mecham 
from holding any public office again making it unclear whether he 
will be permitted to run in a may 17 recall election to regain the 
governors post there is no precedent and the matter probably will 
be decided by the courts said attorney general bob corbin 
mecham faces an april 21 criminal trial on a charge he concealed 
a 350000 campaign loan the senate dropped a charge on that issue 
last week 
mecham said he did not know what he will do next including 
whether he will appeal to the us supreme court well know in a 
couple three days he said 
mecham was removed less than a week after his family announced 
the mecham pontiac dealership which he has owned since 1950 was 
being sold because of declining sales his son blamed on an 
avalanche of bad publicity 
ladies and gentlemen governor mecham has struck out 
democratic sen jesus chuy higuera said as he voted for 
conviction on the two counts 
the only defense that we have heard is ignorance of the law 
higuera said the citizens of this state will not tolerate this 
evil insensitivity to the arizona constitution and the laws of 
the state 
following the vote some legislators received police protection 
because of threatening phone calls said department of public 
safety spokesman allan schmidt 
theyve been all types of intimidatingtype threatening 
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate he said 
the vote ended 15 tumultuous months that shook this staunchly 
republican state and brought ridicule and criticism from 
politicians comedians and the comic strip doonesbury 
on his fifth try for governor mecham was elected in 1986 in a 
threeway race with 40 percent of the vote he made national 
headlines seven days after his inauguration by canceling a martin 
luther king holiday for state workers on the grounds it was 
illegally created by his democratic predecessor bruce babbitt he 
subsequently offended blacks jews women and homosexuals with 
offhand remarks and official actions 
on feb 5 the house impeached mecham making the 65yearold 
mrs mofford who had been secretary of state acting governor 
mechams supporters and opponents gathered all day outside the 
senate building and listened to the proceedings over the radio 
each group cheered as votes favorable to their side were announced 
afterward mesa resident millie pratt said i feel betrayed by 
our legislature i had more faith in them 
barry gabriel who carried a sign saying guilty guilty 
guilty said he was happy and relieved because i think hes 
a menace 
the senate convicted mecham of ordering department of public 
safety director ralph milstead not to cooperate with corbins 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a mecham confidant 
against former mecham aide donna carlson at the time ms carlson 
was about to testify before a state grand jury about the 350000 
loan 
mecham maintained he did not intend to obstruct justice 
although he admitted telling milstead the attorney general is 
out to hang me and im not going to help him in any way the 
governor also insisted he was not informed of the alleged threats 
seriousness 
he was convicted of misusing the 80000 in protocol money by 
loaning it to his suburban glendale auto dealership the 
prosecution contended the fund was public money and that the 
dealership desperately needed the funds to make a payroll 
mecham testified that he was told he could use the protocol fund

a supreme court justice on tuesday refused to 
free a prominent new jersey lawyer and his firm from having to 
defend an alleged mobster whose previous attorney became seriously 
ill 
justice william j brennan rejected an emergency request by 
matthew p boylan and his firm to suspend a court order holding 
them in contempt for refusing to defend an alleged organized crime 
boss 
us district judge judge harold ackerman in newark held boylan 
in contempt on feb 29 after the original defense lawyer became 
terminally ill with cancer and had to leave the case ackerman is 
presiding over the trial 
boylan is a former director of the new jersey division of 
criminal justice and a former assistant us attorney for new 
jersey 
ackerman also issued a contempt citation against boylans law 
firm lowenstein sandler kohl fisher amp boylan of roseland nj 
for its refusal to assist boylan he fined boylan 2500 a day 
until he accepted the assignment and the firm 10000 a day 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld the contempt 
citations on march 9 
boylan balked at representing anthony accetturo allegedly the 
leader of the lucchese organizedcrime family in new jersey 
ackerman said he selected boylan because of his pretrial work 
for the defendant 
milton m ferrel sr had been accetturos lawyer until cancer 
forced him to leave the case

neglect obligations to five other clients 
he and his firm noted that the trial of accetturo and 20 others 
on extortion gambling and narcotics charges began in november 
1986 has produced more than 27000 pages of transcripts and is 
likely to continue for another six months

of accetturo 
the case is us vs accetturo a735

contra leaders said tuesday they would not continue 
peace talks with the sandinistas unless their delegation is allowed 
to travel and speak freely inside nicaragua during next weeks 
negotiations 
the sandinistas had told the contra leaders they must remain 
confined to an airport hotel said rebel director adolfo calero 
named tuesday as chief negotiator 
it is a virtual imprisonment calero said at contra 
headquarters here it is not in keeping with the idea of 
reconciliation with the idea of democratization 
the contras said they will not go to managua for the next round 
of talks unless they are permitted to travel freely around 
nicaragua and speak with opposition groups 
the contras who expect to arrive in nicaragua april 12 with a 
60member delegation plan meetings with domestic opposition 
leaders roman catholic bishops antidraft groups business 
leaders and reporters 
they will also demand the right to place ads in both government 
and opposition newspapers announcing their agenda and meetings 
we are demanding that we be free when we are in nicaragua 
said calero he said the contras were awaiting a reply to their 
counterproposal which was sent tuesday morning to the sandinista 
foreign ministry 
director pedro joaquin chamorro said he had been informed that 
la prensa the principal opposition newspaper had run out of 
newsprint tuesday and insisted the sandinistas supply it under 
terms of the agreement negotiated last month in sapoa nicaragua 
the contras sidestepped the possibility of a public rally inside 
nicaragua during their stay saying that would be decided by local 
opposition parties 
the rebels expect to meet six times with the sandinistas before 
leaving april 15 and will concentrate on steps toward 
democratizing the country said calero 
it will become the sandinistas acid test said calero it 
will be very difficult for the sandinistas to keep the agreement 
and hold on to power 
the contras dismissed several very minor truce violations by 
both sides in recent days 
overall the ceasefire is holding said chamorro he said 
despite initial resistance to the pact by rebel field commanders 
they have come to accept the truce arrangement 
chamorro denied suggestions made in testimony before a 
congressional committee that there were links between the contras 
and panamas strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
we have no links with gen noriega absolutely said 
chamorro he said reports contras had been trained in that country 
were absolutely false and said it was the sandinistas not the 
rebels who received aid through panama

where does a bengal tiger sleep 
anywhere it wants to heh heh heh 
but thats no joke for ramelle rockhold and her husband who 
ceded their kingsize bed to a 100pound 7monthold tiger named 
reena 
i havent had the heart to make her sleep outside yet 
rockhold said 
reena also eats on the bed she wont eat anywhere else and 
turns up her nose even at her favorite raw chicken unless shes 
handfed 
shes a little spoiled acknowledges rockhold who was given 
the big cat four months ago by a friend in texas 
it was reenas kittenish nocturnal playfulness rather than a 
territorial demand that pushed her owners out of their bed 
rockhold said 
the only reason we moved into the guest bedroom is because if 
we got up at 2 in the morning to get a drink of water wed wake 
her up and then like a puppy shed be ready to play and shed 
crawl under the covers and play with our feet said rockhold 
rockhold said she and her husband have to lock the bedroom door 
because reena can turn doorknobs 
the cat also loves the rockhold hot tub and made a playpen out 
of the bathtub the rockholds had to take the handles off the tub 
because reena learned how to turn the water on herself 
rockhold who lives in the country north of zachary said its 
legal to own a tiger but she doesnt expect to keep it 
reena is destined for a home at louisiana state university 
which has a 14yearold bengal tiger named mike iv as its mascot 
reena will be going to school at age 3 and chancellor james 
wharton said she might be used to breed mike v 
rockhold is in no hurry to lose a pet or regain a bedroom 
ill just cry my eyes out when that kittycat is gone just like 
any mother would she said

michael dukakis held onto a narrow lead over rival 
democrat jesse jackson in colorados precinct caucuses today with 
the resumption of a slowmoving counting process that jackson said 
heightens suspicions 
the fact is the count should have been in now jackson said 
today in kenosha wis the long count is unfair 
with 57 percent of the precincts in colorado reporting the 
massachusetts governor had 45 percent of the vote while jackson had 
41 percent sen albert gore jr of tennessee who made little 
effort in the state trailed with less than 3 percent 
dukakis had 3626 county delegates to jacksons 3276 according 
to figures supplied by the colorado democratic party 
calculations based on the incomplete returns indicated dukakis 
would win 21 national convention delegates if he maintained his 
lead in later returns and the results held up at the congressional 
district and state conventions in the next few weeks jackson would 
win 17 delegates and another seven would be uncommitted 
vice president george bush dominated straw polls taken at 
republican caucuses cornering nearly 80 percent of the vote and 
staving off a feared ambush by pat robertson 
dukakis and jackson had hoped to use the caucuses which are 
the first step in selecting 45 colorado democratic delegates to 
gain stature for todays wisconsin primary 
but with the results trickling in and the candidates within a 
few percentage points of one another it appeared neither would be 
able to claim a big victory 
state democratic chairman buie seawell a colorado super 
delegate and dukakis supporter said he believed the massachusetts 
governor would be the winner however he said jackson has done 
one hell of a job in a state that is not jackson country 
in return jackson criticized the slow counting process 
supervised by seawell 
the state chairman endorsed mr dukakis jackson said you 
cannot very well be a fair referee and coaching another player 
this long and slow count represents a certain ineptness it 
heightens suspicions he said 
seawell responded today that jackson is just wrong and said 
he took personal offense at the candidates remarks he said 
his staff reported every precinct where results were available 
monday night 
to the best of my knowledge it was run fairly and well 
dukakis said today of the colorado contest 
as expected bush who stands almost alone in his quest for the 
nomination dominated the scant returns reported to republican 
party officials bushs chief rival bob dole dropped out last 
week 
early republican straw poll results showed bush with 1288 straw 
votes or 78 percent and robertson with 136 or 8 percent at 201 
gop precinct caucuses 
dukakis had picked up endorsements several weeks ago from gov 
roy romer and seawell but jackson made his presence felt with a 
series of strong campaign appearances over the easter weekend 
while no delegates to the democratic or republican national 
conventions were chosen monday the caucuses began a complicated 
delegate selection process that will culminate at the state 
conventions in may and june 
colorado will send 51 delegates to the democratic national 
convention six of them super delegates including romer and 
seawell thirtysix colorado republicans will attend their partys 
national convention 
the state democratic party had planned to provide results by 
1230 am today from colorados 13 most populous counties which 
account for 80 percent of the states 2784 precincts but the 
party was able to report less than 20 percent of the states 
precincts by its selfimposed deadline 
some caucuses delayed their start in order to allow sports fans 
to watch the end of the kansasoklahoma ncaa basketball 
championship one precinct took a recess so participants could 
watch the game 
dukakis campaigners were pleased with the initial caucus 
results 
we had hoped to hold our own in denver and we are doing better 
than we expected said david villarino dukakis state director 
we are doing well among the hispanics jackson had hoped to 
seal the hispanic vote but we have done well there he said 
mike veit gores campaign director said his campaign had spent 
only 17000 in colorado i think people in colorado still have a 
sort of a gary hart hangover he said refering to the states 
former senator who twice entered and dropped out of the race and 
noting the large number of uncommitted delegates 
theyve been on sort of a rollercoaster

potential jurors questioned tuesday in the 
cocaine trial of john zaccaro jr said their judgment would not be 
influenced by the fact that the defendants mother is former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
one potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had 
picked on ferraros family while she was a candidate in 1984 
and she thought the attacks had carried over to zaccaro after his 
arrest 
the questioning was watched by six reporters one day after judge 
francis mccaffrey imposed and then lifted a gag order 
most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper 
accounts of the case since zaccaro was charged in 1986 with selling 
onequarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent zaccaro 
24 was then a senior at middlebury college 
the offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and 
a 10000 fine 
i cant say i dont feel the press picked on these people 
said joanne cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how 
ferraro has been treated 
but she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if 
she is chosen to hear the case 
the press is not trying this case she said the issue is 
did this gentleman sell drugs 
ferraro a lawyer sat behind her son and his lawyers taking 
notes intently but she stopped when cillo spoke about the 
treatment her family received rested her head in her hands and 
looked down 
john zaccaro sr accompanied his wife and son on the second day 
of questioning 
none of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would 
be influenced by the fact ferraro is zaccaros mother it 
wouldnt matter one way or another who she was ellen daly of 
rutland said 
at the noon break ferraro declined to comment telling one 
reporter its nothing against you personally were just not 
answering anything for anybody 
mccaffery had imposed the gag order monday in response to 
complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many 
reporters could intimidate potential jurors news organizations 
protested and it was rescinded later that day when all sides 
agreed to permit a pool of six reporters 
prosecutor john quinn said he was not sure how long it would 
take to pick a jury 
pretrial publicity seemed less of a problem than the jurors 
opinions about drug use 
one man who was dismissed said id probably be the one going 
to jail if i catch someone selling drugs to my kid 
the trial comes more than two years after zaccaro was arrested 
outside the middlebury restaurant where he worked 
the charge involves allegations that zaccaro sold cocaine to 
undercover agent laura manning after she came to his offcampus 
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs 
the case has wound its way slowly through the vermont courts 
zaccaros attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and 
claimed unsuccessfully that zaccaro was singled out for prosecution 
because of his mother but the vermont supreme court refused to 
dismiss the case

percent 
northwest airlines which operates largely in the northern tier 
of states had the worst ontime record among the 14 airlines with 
617 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule

while nearly 50 percent of 
reported rape victims are adolescents many pediatricians are 
illequipped to treat them the american academy of pediatrics says 
in urging better training to handle sexual assault victims 
in a policy statement published in the april issue of its 
monthly journal pediatrics the academy notes that pediatricians 
frequently serve in emergency rooms as the primary healthcare 
provider in adolescent rapes 
pediatricians need to be sensitive to the acute emotional 
problems not to do things that might cause further psychological 
trauma dr s kenneth schonberg chairman of the academys 
committee on adolescence said tuesday 
doctors should avoid accusatory questioning or forcing 
testing on somebody who really doesnt want to be tested that 
becomes another assault he said 
one has to find a sensitive balance between the need to 
accumulate evidence and the need to protect the young person from 
yet another assault he said immediately after the assault 
might not be the best time to do an internal examination he 
said 
it still does occur that young people are dealt with 
insensitively and their medical contact therefore is not helpful to 
them said schonberg director of the division of adolescent 
medicine at montefiore medical center in new york 
citing us justice department figures schonberg said nearly 50 
percent of rape victims are young people under the age of 21 
we would urge that every pediatric training program include 
instruction in how to deal with the emotional and physical problems 
associated with rape he said 
most pediatricians have had little prior experience or 
training in managing such problems members of the committee 
wrote in the journal residency and continued medical education 
programs should assist the pediatrician in developing the necessary 
skills and techniques for treating these patients in a sensitive 
and supportive manner 
the article included a sample sexual assault data sheet that is 
widely available to pediatricians with guidelines on what an exam 
of a rape victim should include 
it urged discretion in the use of pregnancy prevention drugs 
noting that they can produce nausea vomiting and other side 
effects that could add to the victims trauma 
the incidence of pregnancy after rape is extremely low so 
the wisdom of using these drugs is questionable the authors 
wrote the practioner who chooses to use those drugs should be 
fully informed about these factors and should share these facts 
with patients 
tom birch legislative counsel for the national child abuse 
coalition in washington dc said he advocates better training 
for physicians and others who deal with victimized youths 
i think generally theres a feeling that professionals 
whether theyre physicians or attorneys or teachers whose jobs 
bring them into contact with children are not prepared to deal 
with the kinds of situations that children find themselves in 
where are they are victimized he said by telephone tuesday from 
washington 
unfortunately these professionals are the ones in our 
communities who have the contact with the children that should 
require them to be the best prepared he said 
i think that it may be a factor of our educational system 
that has not recognized the extent to which children are victims of 
abuse or exploitation birch said because certainly its only 
been in the last 15 to 20 years that social services and medical 
professionals have even been able to identify the numbers of 
children who are victims

americans abroad were arrested at a rate of 
eight per day last year more than 40 percent of them on narcotics 
charges the state department said tuesday 
in an annual report designed to frighten tourists thinking of 
taking drugs on vacation the department said as we approach the 
busy travel season many americans are getting ready for that long 
awaited trip abroad for some the trip will become a nightmare 
those americans who assume there is no real danger in buying 
or carrying just a small amount of drugs on their overseas trip 
may be in for a very unpleasant surprise the report said 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the seriousness 
of the problem was underscoreourts conviction and 
sixyear jail sentence tuesday of conan owen a 23yearod by a spanish 
cld 
virginia photographer who said he unwittingly brought cocaine into 
spain in an acquaintances suitcase 
the justice department has said it believes in owens innocence 
and the report said travelers should be particularly wary of 
persons who ask them to carry a package or drive a car across a 
border they might unknowingly become narcotics traffickers 
last year 3041 americans were arrested abroad 41 percent of 
them on drugrelated charges it was a 10eral 
penitentiaries in oakdale la and atlanta ga the report said 
the largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from 
americans abroad came from the inmates of the san luis rio colorado 
prison in northern mexico 
about onefourth of the 164 americans arrested in the area 
covered by the consulate in hermosillo mexico complained of 
mistreatment and us officials found such reports credible and 
made a vigorous formal protest in august the report said 
since then no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been 
received the report said 
the number of american incarcerated in saudi arabia declined 
mostly because that country has become more lenient toward 
foreigners accused of breaking such islamic laws as possession of 
alcoholic beverages 
people found guilty of having liquor are generally deported a 
few days after arrest rather than sentenced to jail terms the 
report said 
in honor of the 60th birthday of the king of thailand several 
american were freed from prison last year and a few others had 
their sentences reduced still 30 americans remained in thai 
prisons at the end of the year 
the united states spent more than 46000 for medical assistance 
and food for us prisoners about 20000 of this was spent in 
thailand where prison conditions are substandard the report 
said

the lack of political progress toward 
substantially cutting the budget deficit and reforming federal 
market regulation threatens to cause another stock crash the 
chairman of the american stock exchange said tuesday 
the conditions that created the atmosphere in which a market 
meltdown nearly occurred are still present creating a kind of 
economic time bomb that threatens the whole system arthur levitt 
jr told a national press club luncheon 
levitt said the budget deficit has not been satisfactorily 
addressed and he complained that regulatory solutions have 
been debated but not enacted 
however he declined to single out either congress or the reagan 
administration for blame both are about equally responsible for 
failure to reduce the budget deficit he said 
on regulatory reform levitt said congress is hampered by 
committees jockeying for jurisdictional control and he said 
although the administration has spent the past seven years trying 
to reduce regulation it must now recognize the protection of the 
public must be the foremost consideration 
if the congress and the administration continue to be 
paralyzed in a political deadlock i have great concerns about 
the future of the markets as we know them he said 
levitt called for the creation of a special study commission 
that without delaying congressional and administration efforts at 
finding shortterm solutions would focus on reform for the next 
decade 
levitt who heads the thirdlargest stock trading system in the 
nation ranking behind the new york stock exchange and the 
overthecounter market also said the securities industry must 
move to reform itself before individual investors return to the 
market in force 
he said the current system for recruiting training and paying 
brokers has made the public suspicious of brokers he said 
brokerage firms should stop raiding each others staffs a practice 
he called demeaning piracy and instead spend more to train 
brokers 
the current commission system of compensation encourages brokers 
to make as many trades as they can and raises customers fears 
that their brokers are doing business when the best strategy might 
be to sit tight levitt said 
he suggested commissions based on an acrosstheboard percentage 
of assets managed rather than on the number of transactions

the richest 1 percent of americans paid more 
than onefourth of all individual income taxes in 1986 due in 
large part to an extraordinary increase in investment income the 
treasury department said tuesday 
the portion of taxes paid by those with incomes of less than 
50000 a year dropped from 668 percent in 1981 before enactment 
of acrosstheboard tax cuts to 457 percent in 1986 the 
department said during the same period the share borne by those 
making over 100000 more than doubled from 152 percent of the 
total to 306 percent 
those whose incomes placed them among the wealthiest 1 percent 
saw their share of the tax burden rise from 181 percent in 1981 to 
261 percent five years later 
the treasury analysis is based on internal revenue service 
sampling of returns filed last year which reflected 1986 earnings 
treasury said the increasing share of taxes paid by the very 
rich is part of a continuing trend that began with enactment of the 
1981 tax cut which slashed the maximum tax rate on the wealthy 
from 70 percent to 50 percent it since has been cut to 33 percent 
the 1986 increase also reflects the extraordinary level of 
capital gains realized in 1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate 
increase on capital gains the analysis said while capital gains 
represented only 11 percent of the income of the richest americans 
in 1981 the share rose to 15 percent in 1985 and nearly 25 percent 
in 1986 
capital gains are profits from the sale of stocks real estate 
and other investments the top tax rate on these profits was 20 
percent in 1986 knowing that rate would climb to 28 percent in 
1987 upperincome taxpayers unloaded billions of dollars worth of 
assets in the closing days of 1986 
capital gains represented less than 2 percent of income for 
other americans in each of the three years treasury said 
about 12 of every 1000 couples and individuals have adjusted 
gross incomes over 100000 a year the analysis found those 
taxpayers paid 43 billion in taxes in 1981 77 billion in 1985 
and 115 billion in 1986 
part of that increase is attributable to the fact that the 
number of people with incomes at that level has increased 
significantly in recent years treasury provided no estimate of how 
many people earned over 100000 in 1986 but irs figures show the 
number in 1985 more than 12 million was 63 percent higher than 
in 1982 the number earning over 1 million a year more than 
doubled to 17312 in 1985 from 1981 
between 1981 and 1986 taxes paid by those with incomes between 
50000 and 100000 increased from 51 billion to 89 billion the 
burden on those under 50000 dropped from 190 billion to 172 
billion 
about half of americans have incomes under 35000 a year 
including those who are too poor to pay taxes they paid 75 
percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 64 percent in 
1986

a senior vietnames official said tuesday 
the united states should help rebuild this country if it wants a 
full accounting of 1700 americans still listed as missing 13 years 
after the wars end 
nguyen dy nien a deputy foreign minister made the comment the 
day before vietnam was to turn over what it says are the remains of 
27 missing americans its largest delivery so far 
he repeated charges that washington by merely encouraging 
private aid to vietnam has not done its part under an agreement 
reached in august between us envoy john w vessey and vietnams 
foreign minister nguyen co thach 
the agreement calls for vietnam to end a long deadlock on 
accounting for americans missing in the war which ended in april 
1975 and the united states to address vietnams own humanitarian 
concerns 
washington has sent investigative medical teams to vietnam and 
encouraged private aid but has not lifted an embargo on official 
aid imposed to protest vietnams decadelong occupation of 
neighboring cambodia 
we dont care what the private groups are doing we think 
the government should participate nien said it must show its 
concern its direct commitment 
he spoke to sen larry pressler a south dakota republican who 
arrived tuesday to discuss issues including the fates of 1767 
americans still officially missing in action pressler is a member 
of the senate foreign relations committee 
nien said the us government has done nothing since the war 
ended to help vietnam recover from american bombing that destroyed 
thousands of schools and has not aided vietnams disabled veterans 
or the halfmillion orphans created by the conflict 
he said it was unfortunate that the agreement was not fully 
implemented and it sometimes was wrongly interpreted both sides 
recognized the humanitarian issues of each other and both must be 
resolved 
wednesdays delivery is the fourth since the vessey agreement 
if us army laboratories identify the 27 sets of remains it 
would mean substantial progress because vietnam has repatriated 
only 152 confirmed remains the largest previous transfer aug 
14 1985 involved 26 remains and at least 24 were confirmed 
pressler told nien his constituents often say they believe hanoi 
returns the remains gradually and still holds some living american 
prisoners nien called the charges unthinkable 
nguyen can head of the special vietnamese office on resolving 
the mia issue denied charges that the skeletal remains of us air 
force pilot edwin b tucker were kept for years at a medical school 
or hospital before being returned to the united states on nov 25 
the atlanta journalconstitution has reported that tuckers 
remains were used as a teaching tool he was shot down over the 
northern city of hon gai in april 1967 
can deputy director of the foreign ministrys north american 
affairs department told the associated press the charge has 
aroused indignation on the part of our people and proves there is 
no good will on the part of the united states

president reagans national 
security adviser said tuesday he would not rule out the possibility 
of sending more american troops to panama as the united states 
considers new steps to force the ouster of military strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
we have no immediate plans to send more forces but i would 
not eliminate that possibility lt gen colin l powell said 
at the same time a senior administration official said the 
15000member panamanian defense forces which noriega heads should 
remove him or ask him to step aside i think it would be a good 
thing for them to do said the official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
as the military chief noriega is the power behind the 
panamanian government the united states has been seeking his 
removal since he was indicted earlier this year in florida on drug 
trafficking charges 
meanwhile some 1300 american troops began arriving at us 
military installations in panama to augment the 10000 troops 
stationed at the us southern command there 
the pentagon says the deployment is only to protect us lives 
and interests in panama 
with the additional forces being brought in today i think 
there is a reasonable degree of security of american installations 
and i see no increased immedate threat to the american citizens 
living in panama powell said 
reagan vacationing at his mountaintop ranch near santa barbara 
was briefed on developments in panama in a telephone conversation 
with powell later the national security adviser answered 
questions from reporters at an oceanside hotel 
we continue to examine a full range of diplomatic options 
economic options military options and political options to put 
pressure on noriega powell said 
the national security adviser said the united states was 
considering steps that would require american companies to withhold 
taxes and fees from panama but he suggested there would be 
problems implementing such actions 
he said the sanctions imposed by the united states 3 weeks ago 
have had a telling effect on panama but obviously have not been 
enough to force out noriega 
whether it will be enough over a period of time whether we 
can wait an extended period of time is what were examining 
powell said 
he repeatedly refused to say what options the united states is 
considering 
as you examine a situation like this you look at all options 
that might be realistic and proper to consider on the economic 
side on the military side on the political side and were doing 
that powell said we are acting prudently and realistically 
powell also said he was aware of reports that cuban forces had 
joined an international marxist brigade to assist noriega but said 
he had no information to substantiate such a story 
the senior administration official speaking after powells 
ontherecord briefing said there was no evidence of any massive 
cuban involvement 
suggesting that the military force out noriega the official 
noted there had been one coup attempt but that noriega is still 
firmly in control 
to the extent that members of the military are 
dissatisfied the official said i think it would be in their 
best interests to remove general noriega or ask him to step aside

a federal judge on tuesday refused to stay his 
order that the reagan administration broaden its standard for 
determining whether certain illegal aliens qualify for amnesty 
under the 1986 immigration law 
us district judge stanley sporkin denied the justice 
departments motion for a stay pending appeal of his ruling that 
overturned a regulation for processing amnesty requests from aliens 
who had legally entered the country but overstayed tourist or 
student visas 
the regulation which sporkin said violated the plain language 
of the immigration law required that the illegal status of 
nonimmigrant aliens be known to the immigration and naturalization 
service as of jan 1 1982 for them to qualify for amnesty 
sporkin said the law merely required that any federal agency 
have documentation such as a tax or social security form from 
which officials could conclude an aliens status was illegal as of 
that date 
groups that counsel illegal aliens who brought the suit 
estimated that as many as 50000 nonimmigrant aliens were being 
denied legalization under the disputed regulations 
more than 1 million illegal aliens have sought naturalization 
under the amnesty program that expires may 4 congress is 
considering legislation to extend the deadline by six months 
sporkin who had issued a preliminary injunction last week made 
the ruling permanent

the reagan administration is 
weighing whether to invoke a law authorizing the seizure of tax 
payments made by us businesses operating in panama national 
security adviser colin powell said today 
saying that economic sanctions applied so far have not yet 
created enough pressure to force the ouster of strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega powell said we are examining additional 
pressure that might be brought to bear 
he briefed reporters not long after giving the vacationing 
president reagan an update on the panamanian problem 
a senior administration official disussing panama on grounds he 
not be publicly identified said the united states would encourage 
any move within the panamanian defense forces to oust noriega 
he still is firmly in control but not as in control as he 
was perhaps a month ago and every effort we can take to foster 
that discontent in the pdf i can assure you we are taking he 
said 
if the pdf after examining the situation think it would be 
useful to remove general noriega i think that would be a very 
sound decision for them to take the official said 
powell acknowledged that some corporations operating in panama 
have balked at having their tax payments placed in an escrow 
account because of a concern that it could hamper their operations 
for this reason he said white house advisers and other 
administration officials are studying the implications of invoking 
the international emergency economic powers act which would 
authorize the government to seize these payments 
we have to be cautious before you invoke because it is a 
very powerful tool and the staff back in washington is examining 
the pros and cons of invoking the act powell said 
and if it is a sensible thing to do to continue to apply 
pressure on general noriega we will provide that for the president 
for his consideration 
powell refused to discuss any military options being weighed 
except he indicated there would be no immediate dispatch of troops 
beyond the 1300 deployed to the central american country early 
this week 
powell an army lieutenant general said he believes there now 
is a reasonable degree of security for americans living in 
panama and the us installations there 
meanwhile the administration was taking a dim view of jesse 
jacksons contacts with noriega despite jacksons diplomatic coups 
in the past during visits to cuba and syria 
following jacksons disclosure that he had sent a letter to 
noriega two weeks ago asking him to resign state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said monday that such communications 
could prolong noriegas grip on power 
the proliferation of channels is a tactic noriega uses to buy 
time ms oakley said we have available channels of 
communication with noriega if and when they are needed we think it 
would be best to continue to use these channels exclusively 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with reagan in 
california also criticized the democratic presidential candidates 
involvement in panama we have a bipartisan coordinated plan for 
dealing with noriega he said thats why its important to 
congress and the public and we believe its been working 
jackson has dealt successfully in the past with other us 
adversaries in 1984 he traveled to cuba and persuaded president 
fidel castro to release 26 political prisoners 
he later went to syria and during talks with president hafez 
assad won freedom for an american military pilot detained there 
his efforts earned him an enthusiastic white house welcome 
jackson said he has no plans to travel to panama to try to help 
resolve the 6weekold crisis in that country 
about 1300 army soldiers and marines were headed to panama 
today joining the 10000 troops stationed at the us southern 
command in panama the pentagon said the soldiers are being sent to 
increase security for americans and us facilities in panama 
in a related development a former panamanian official told the 
senate foreign relations committee on monday that noriega probably 
has evidence of complicity by us officials in central american 
drug trafficking 
jose i blandon produced a document noriega sent to the 
countrys us diplomatic offices in february saying he has proof 
that american officials knowingly established policies that 
supported people in the drug business 
blandon a former intelligence official and consul general who 
defected last year mentioned panama guatemala and costa rica 
jackson says he agrees with the reagan administration that 
noriega should step down but he has accused us officials of 
overkill in trying to achieve that goal through economic sanctions 
that have contributed to economic paralysis in panama 
jackson appearing monday in milwaukee renewed his call for 
noriega to leave panama and released a letter in which noriega 
rejected any political and economic program that will be dictated 
from washington dc 
my duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is 
governed by the panamanian constitution and law of the defense 
forces noriegas letter said 
while releasing the letter jackson renewed his call for noriega 
to go into exile 
i remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the 
panamanian people for general noriega to leave jackson said 
today i reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart

soldiers fired at suspicious shadows 
tuesday in south lebanon and fought palestinian guerrillas trying 
to cross the border killing two the army said four israelis were 
reported wounded 
in the gaza strip soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters 
putting out the left eye of a 16yearold palestinian the army 
said it was among the few violent incidents in a relatively quiet 
day in the occupied west bank and gaza where an arab rebellion 
began dec 8 
fortyone high school students about to be drafted wrote defense 
minister yitzhak rabin saying they would would not take part in 
acts of oppression and occupation in the west bank and gaza 
strip the number writing such letters now stands at 107 
secretary of state george p shultz went to jordan and syria 
promoting the us peace plan he got an inconclusive response from 
king hussein of jordan whose approval is considered essential 
the attempted penetration tuesday was the ninth infiltration 
effort since nov 25 when a guerrilla in a hang glider flew into 
israel from lebanon and killed six soldiers before being shot to 
death 
that attack was thought to have made the israeli army seem 
vulnerable and violence in the occupied territories began two 
weeks later at least 138 arabs and an israeli soldier have been 
killed during the 4monthold rebellion in the lands israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said violence in the west bank 
and gaza has emboldened guerrillas 
the fact that the events in the territories are the focus of 
world attention obligates them to prove again that terrorism 
has to be the main tool for achieving political goals he said on 
army radio 
theyve increased their attempts and certainly they will 
continue to try as often as possible to attack israeli targets 
israel radio said fatah the main palestine liberation 
organization guerrilla group led by plo chief yasser arafat took 
responsibility in a statement at sidon in south lebanon a 
anonymous telephone caller made the claim to a journalist in sidon 
but fatahs beirut office denied knowledge of such a claim 
another guerrilla group the prosyrian popular front for the 
liberation of palestine claimed responsibility in a typewritten 
statement distributed in sidon it said the purpose was to 
emphasize rejection of the imperialist plans carried by shultz 
an army spokesman said troopers saw suspicious shadows early 
tuesday at the edge of israels selfdeclared security zone an 
area just north of the border with lebanon that varies in depth 
from six to 10 miles it is patrolled by israeli troops and a 
surrogate militia called the south lebanon army 
the soldiers fired the shadows disappeared and blood and 
abandoned weapons were found on the ground in the area he said 
several hours later soldiers encountered guerrillas within a 
mile of israels border north of the kfar yuval farming settlement 
and exchanged fire with them according to the army report 
it said the palestinians were armed with assault rifles a 
rocketpropelled grenade launcher and about a dozen grenades 
army spokesmen said the encounters took place more than two 
miles apart and it was not clear whether they were related 
the soldiers seized positions a unit commander identified 
only as col motti said on israel radio we were 10 meters apart 
we spoke to them called upon them to surrender they responded 
with fire 
an additional force was positioned behind the terrorists at 
530 am the commander of the region ordered the soldiers to 
storm the guerrillas 
army spokesmen did not say how many guerrillas there were or 
whether any were captured or escaped 
helicopters and armored vehicles searched the area after the 
battle the radio said indicating the army thought some 
palestinians may have escaped

residential natural gas rates will increase if 
interstate pipelines are permitted to serve large industrial users 
directly a group of gas distribution companies and others said 
tuesday 
an industry organization the process gas consumer group 
disputed the claim 
the distribution group led by southern california gas co and 
associated gas distributors an east coast trade association 
presented the summary of a study of 14 unidentified gas 
distribution companies 
the summary said that if all industrial customers on 13 of these 
systems who could be served directly by interstate pipelines were 
to shift to the pipelines rates to other customers would have to 
rise by 1 percent to 21 percent the median rate increase was 57 
percent 
the increases would occur because the fixed cost of the 
distribution system would be spread over a smaller number of 
customers an earlier study by the consumer federation of america 
estimated that distribution companies could lose 2 billion in 
revenues if industrial customers could switch to direct service by 
the interstate pipelines 
there are only a few such direct service customers now 
often a factory that years ago chose to locate itself in an 
isolated area directly on a pipeline route or was already there 
when the pipeline was built 
the distribution group held a news conference to call attention 
to its support of a bill introduced last month by rep edward 
markey dmass he wants to prevent the federal energy regulatory 
commission from approving socalled bypass service over the 
objections of state regulators 
a markey aide cathy hurwit said he introduced the bill because 
when large customers can get off the system and come back on at a 
later date you do have some concerns that the remaining customers 
are paying more than their fair share 
rep philip sharp dind chairman of the subcommittee with 
jurisdiction over the bill has said he does not want to deal with 
natural gas issues this year nonetheless rufus mckinney lobbyist 
for southern california gas said he was optimistic that backers 
could at least win hearings on the issue 
jan vlcek counsel to the process gas consumer group said his 
group opposed the markey bill because there isnt a great deal 
of confidence in public service commissions in a lot of states to 
protect industry who he said often is paying more more than its 
share of distribution company costs 
this is cast as industry vs residential customers i dispute 
that theres a third party in these transactions the shareholders 
of the distribution company who vlcek said were earning in 
some cases 16 percent to 17 percent on their investment

gov henry bellmon signed a controversial 
resolution tuesday requiring the confederate flag be flown over the 
state capitol but said the flag pole would remain empty until he 
knows which kind of confederate flag to display 
during debate on the bill black legislators urged colleagues 
not to adopt the resolution saying the confederate flag was an 
offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by 
organizations such as the ku klux klan 
bellmons announcement came at a news conference the day after 
the author of the resolution state sen herbert rozell said he 
would refuse the governors request to recall the bill and change 
it 
in asking for the recall bellmon said the bill did not 
stipulate which of the three flags used by the confederacy between 
1861 and 1865 should be flown 
rozell said monday the resolution was written in a way so 
bellmon could fly the flag that is the least offensive 
but bellmon said tuesday if i chose any one of the three im 
going to be criticized for it 
the flag has sparked controversy in several other southern 
states recently opponents say the confederate flag is a symbol of 
oppression and slavery supporters say it is historic not a racial 
symbol 
in georgia legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the 
state flag which incorporates the design of the confederate 
banner and in alabama black lawmakers were arrested for trying to 
remove a confederate flag from atop the capitol dome 
for years the stars and bars flag used by the confederacy until 
1863 was part of a 14flag display south of the capitol steps the 
display was removed during recent reconstruction and office of 
public affairs director helen arnold said she did not plan to have 
it restored 
rozell then introduced the resolution to require the flag 
display be resurrected

vice president george bush plans fundraising 
stops in texas florida and new york during the next week even 
though his wellheeled campaign is nearing the federal limit on 
contributions aides said tuesday 
bush is close to collecting the maximum allowed by federal law 
for spending on primary campaigns and may reach that level in 
another few days bush aides said he would be the first 1988 
candidate to do so 
once the cap is reached the candidate cannot raise any more 
money for his campaign under federal election law the law permits 
27 million to be raised and spent for direct campaign expenses but 
exempts from the limit legal and accounting costs 
the campaign had set a goal of 33 million 
once you get to the max thats it you cant pull in any 
more dollars said bush spokesman peter teeley 
however teeley said we could raise money for other 
candidates we could raise money for the party or state 
organizations 
exactly what would be done with money that comes in after the 
limit is reached hasnt been decided the spokesman indicated 
however the campaign must budget carefully from now on to avoid 
spending over the 27 million cap 
with more than four months to go to the gop convention bush has 
the republican nomination virtually in the bag his only major 
rival sen bob dole withdrew a week ago although former 
television minister pat robertson technically is still a candidate 
bush has won 841 delegates so far of the 1139 needed for 
nomination 
bush was spending most of this week in washington cleaning up 
a lot of paperwork catching up teeley said and hell be 
thinking of the future 
the vice president flies to texas on friday for a fundraising 
event in fort worth then goes to florida where he will make 
appearances in st petersburg and miami

antiapartheid activists in the united states 
say they have been warned by the fbi they might be targeted by 
south african government hit teams 
the warnings have taken on special importance in the face of 
last weeks assassination in paris of dulcie september a 
representative of the african national congress which is fighting 
to topple the white minority south african government the 
activists say 
the anc blamed the south african government for ms septembers 
shooting death but south africa denied the allegation police 
sources in paris said the killing appeared to be the work of a 
professional and french president francois mitterrand said he 
would ask south african authorities about the attack 
the washington representative of the anc dumi matabani said he 
was contacted last september by fbi agents who told him they had 
a strong suspicion that a south african hit squad might be in the 
united states 
they said they would try and stop it and told me to be 
careful matabani said the fbi did not offer any protection but 
they told me that if i was followed i should take the car number 
and call them matabani said 
an anc representative in new york themba ntinga said his 
office had also been warned by the fbi 
nomonde ngubo a south african employee of the united mine 
workers in washington and an antiapartheid activist said she too 
had been contacted by the fbi several times in recent months 
ngubo said the fbi agent had declined to discuss anything on the 
phone and that her lawyer would probably be setting up an 
appointment soon for her to meet with representatives of the agency 
a spokesman for the fbi gregory jones declined to comment 
about the activists claims but he added that any information 
that comes to the fbis attention about possible loss of life or 
violence were obliged to pass on to the interested party 
in recent months south africa has increased its attacks against 
guerrillas of the anc mounting a crossborder raid into botswana 
last week and killing four people over the past few years anc 
representatives in brussels mozambique and zimbabwe have been 
targeted for violent attacks

defense secretary frank carlucci charged that 
sen alfonse damato called him and the joint chiefs of staff 
cowards for not doing more to oust panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega but the new york republican said tuesday he didnt 
phrase it that way 
i did not call carlucci a coward damato said through a 
spokeswoman my recollection of the conversation was that i 
said the inaction would be perceived as cowardly 
carlucci made the allegations in a letter to damato that 
followed an emotional telephone conversation the two had last week 
after learning damato had denied the alleged namecalling defense 
department spokesman col arnold williams said i think the 
letter probably speaks for itself 
in the phone call damato had complained that the defense 
secretary was willing to send 3200 soldiers to honduras but would 
not send a senior military officer to panama to tell noriega to 
leave said jack kinnicutt a spokesman for damato 
the new york senator was disturbed that the us government had 
sent deputy assistant secretary of state william walker to panama 
on march 21 to speak to noriega kinnicutt said 
you dont send a deputy assist secretary of state to ask him 
if hes going to kindly leave damato said at a news conference 
tuesday thats not the kind of messenger or message that noriega 
understands 
writing to damato carlucci said he had been reflecting on 
your emotioncharged telephone call during which he saidyou 
charged that i and the joint chiefs of staff are cowards and that 
we are supporting a drug dealer 
i hope you can indicate to me that you in fact did not mean 
the charges as stated carlucci said 
carluccis letter did not address the substance of damatos 
original complaint 
at the news conference damato released a letter he sent to 
carlucci in which he said i certainly do not believe that the 
joint chiefs of staff are cowards there is not doubt however 
that the lack of us action in panama has made us appear weak in 
many peoples eyes 
damato said he told carlucci on the phone we are being 
perceived as cowards lacking the resolve to deal with a drug 
dealers a tinhorn drug dealer by the name of noriega its not a 
question of questioning anybodys particular manhood or the 
patriotism of the joint chiefs 
damato called on the us government to ask for noriegas 
extradition and said the use of military force may be necessary to 
ensure his ouster 
i am not in a position to say what kind of action with 
specificity should be taken but ill certainly tell you this he 
said 
if its the use of force to remove a drugdealing dictator who 
poses a threat to the united states to our security to the canal 
why then i think we have to use all measures including force to 
bring about his removal

china has been given approval to buy an 
additional 2 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized 
prices the agriculture department said tuesday 
acting undersecretary thomas o kay said china has already 
bought more than 49 million tons of us wheat under previously 
announced authorizations under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under eep arrangements exporters to can sell us commodities 
at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
the subsidies have ranged from less than 20 to more than 40 
per ton of wheat or in the range of 54 cents to 109 per bushel

a littleknown massachusetts republican went to 
one of the kennedy familys early strongholds tuesday to formally 
launch a challenge to the reelection of us sen edward m 
kennedy 
joseph malone the 33yearold former executive director of the 
massachusetts republican party made his announcement in front of 
the north end home of another massachusetts longshot paul revere 
the heavily catholic neighborhood first went for a kennedy in 
152 when john f kennedy upset henry cabot lodge in a senatorial 
election 
malone invoked his italian heritage and the ethnic diversity of 
massachusetts as he launched his campaign the waltham native and 
1978 harvard graduate also invoked the name of revere who fought 
for freedom from unfair taxation and freedom from an overly 
intrusive government 
kennedy malone said represents an older outofdate 
generation in american politics that solves problems by spending 
money 
malone said his candidacy would highlight not the me 
generation the we generation its a generation that believes in 
the power of the individual not the power of an everexpanding 
government its a generation that seeks real economic opportunity 
not a government jobs program 
malone is a close ally of the last republican to challenge 
kennedy ray shamie the retired walpole businessman who is 
currently chairman of the republican state committee shamie was 
among the 30 supporters standing behind malone and holding a green 
campaign sign 
malone ran shamies 1982 run against kennedy and another losing 
bid by shamie against john kerry in 1984 
shamie acknowledged that malone is an extreme long shot against 
the veteran senator who has held office since 1962 but he said 
politics is the most unpredictable business ive been in

president reagan on tuesday signed 
legislation that gives the agriculture department greater leeway to 
distribute surplus food commodities to poor nations 
under the amendments to the agriculture act of 1949 agriculture 
secretary richard lyng can now measure how much foodstuffs will be 
sent against available supplies rather than having to meet a 
strict quota set forth in law 
the law allows lyng to disburse these foodstuffs subject to 
the availability of commodities 
the legislation also requires the secretary to make private 
voluntary organizations in addition to agencies of foreign 
governments eligible to take part in the distribution of surplus 
food commodities 
it imposes for the first time a 45day deadline for the agency 
for international development to approve surplus food shipments 
and it extends until 1990 a farmertofarmer program in which 
american farmers travel to foreign countries to give technical 
assistance

the role of the news media in setting the 
agenda for the 1988 presidential campaign is overrated three 
leading journalists suggested tuesday 
i dont think im the finger of god every night on the nbc 
nightly news said anchorman tom brokaw during a panel discussion 
sponsored by the gannett center for media studies 
i dont think its so much the media setting the agenda 
said louis d boccardi president of the associated press as it 
is the media having become almost the centerpiece of the process 
the question is is anyone setting the agenda said nancy 
hicks maynard vice president of the oakland calif tribune if 
it is the press it certainly isnt because of the campaign 
coverage 
boccardi said the media have done well covering campaign issues 
but he said there also is a need for horse race coverage 
stories on who is winning where 
i dont think we ought to particularly apologize for trying to 
track and keeping our eyes and hopefully keeping the audiences eye 
on where the race is going he said 
brokaw said voters set an agenda based on information from a 
wide variety of sources including paid political advertising and 
the political climate 
the nbc anchorman said one of the most striking aspects of the 
campaign was the continuing strength of ronald reagan in most 
regions of the country 
boccardi said jesse jackson has established himself now as a 
credible candidate and that has brought him more intensive 
coverage 
hes hotter now than he was a few weeks ago said boccardi

the federal communications commission on 
tuesday warned consumers about new companies that are charging 
telephone callers up to 10 times the rates of the major carriers 
for operatorassisted longdistance calls 
the fccs warning was prompted by a recent surge in complaints 
about these new alternative operator services known as aos 
companies said greg vogt chief of the fccs telephone enforcement 
division 
the agency is trying to determine whether the companies are 
acting legally he said but it is premature to conclude whether 
there should be any action at the federal level 
the fcc has begun an inquiry to find out about the companies 
operations and the rates they charge he said 
we dont want to have a kneejerk reaction that could kill an 
industry he said 
the businesses are competing in a 7billionayear market that 
until recently was dominated by american telephone amp telegraph co 
they emerged within the past two years to fill the void left when 
atampt stopped paying commissions to hotels and motels on the 
longdistance calls made by their guests 
aos companies serve mainly the transient public in hotels 
motels and at pay phones as well as hospitals and universities 
handling credit card collect and thirdparty billed calls 
since january the fcc has received about 260 complaints from 
people who said they were given no indication that an aos company 
was handling their call or that they would be billed at rates other 
than those of the company whose longdistance credit card they were 
using in most cases the aos company has refunded the disputed 
amount the fcc said 
at an establishment served by aos company callers who dial 
0 for an operator are routed to the aos an operator gets 
billing information and then sends the call over a line the aos 
leases from one of the longdistance carriers like atampt or mci 
communications corp 
many of the callers who get connected to an aos company are 
those using a credit card issued by a local bell phone company or 
atampt since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing 
a 0 other companiess cards require callers to dial a local or 
800 number to place their call 
most of the aos companies have billing contracts with the bell 
companies which means callers receive the aos charges along with 
their monthly local bell phone bill some aos companies also accept 
payment by other major credit cards such as mastercard and visa 
the fcc advises that callers ask an operator what company they 
work for what rates they will be charged and how they will be 
billed before placing the call if they are dissatisfied they 
should find another phone the fcc says 
several states have begun considering regulation of aos 
companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer 
alerts 
aos companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which 
consumers havent yet become accustomed the major aos companies 
say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers 
before placing their calls 
vogt said however that some aos companies can place automated 
calls which substitute bong tones for a live operator to 
instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card there is no 
federal requirement for aos companies to identify themselves he 
said 
the problems aos companies present are complex vogt said 
addingweve never seen a situation quite like this addressed by 
the commission

the soviet union is issuing evacuation permits 
for afghan communist party and government officials to use if they 
must flee their country after a soviet troop withdrawal a human 
rights organization said tuesday 
the new yorkbased group freedom house released a copy of a 
blank 3by5inch pass that it said was among 20 captured by afghan 
moslem guerrillas who have battled the afghan government and 
soviet troops since 1979 
ludmilla thorne of freedom house said the united states issued 
similar passes to south vietnamese government officials when they 
were evacuated by air from saigon in 1975 as the south vietnamese 
capital fell to the communists 
the copy of the russianlanguage afghan permit bears the emblem 
of a red star with a hammer and sickle and the words permit for 
special evacuation 
after the word comrade there is a blank line for the name 
of the card holder followed by is granted the right for special 
evacuation by air and land transport with the retention of all 
housing and food privileges after arrival at the new site 
that is followed by a place for the signature of an authorized 
person and the date the stamp of the soviet embassy in 
afghanistan appears at the bottom 
on the reverse side instructions in pushtu the afghan language 
inform the bearer that he can bring only one suitcase and no 
weapons or food 
a map of kabul attached to the document pinpoints two evacuation 
points one near the soviet embassy 
earlier reports from south asia have spoken of the existence of 
such evacuation passes in afghanistan 
the soviet union has reportedly begun preparations to remove the 
first of its 115000 soldiers from afghanistan despite an impasse 
in united nationssponsored peace negotiations in geneva 
those talks began this year but ms thorne said the permit 
obtained by freedom house was found in october in the briefcase of 
an afghan intelligence officer who was attacked by afghan 
guerrillas 
she said it could not be learned when the permits were first 
printed or how many had been prepared 
the evacuees destination was not specified on the permit but 
ms thorne said it was presumed they would be taken to the ussr 
if the soviet withdrawal led to the downfall of the communist 
government in kabul

a top us official will go to central america 
on wednesday to discuss the possibility of opening regional talks 
that would bring about usnicaraguan diplomatic contacts for the 
first time since 1985 administration sources say 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley confirmed 
tuesday that us special envoy morris busby will visit guatemala 
el salvador honduras and costa rica to discuss the changed 
situation in nicaragua 
other officials speaking only on condition they not be named 
said busby also will discuss the timing and appropriateness of 
a new diplomatic initiative for the region in which both the united 
states and nicaraguas leftist government would take part 
the two countries had direct talks during the latter half of 
1984 mostly in the mexican resort city of manzanillo but the 
united states broke off the discussions in early 1985 contending 
that the sandinistas were intransigent and saying that the central 
american peace process then under way was a more appropriate forum 
for dealing with regional issues 
since then except for exchanges of pleasantries at social 
gatherings officials from the two countries have not had serious 
contact this is consistent with the reagan administrations view 
that the sandinista governments principal adversaries are the 
contra rebels and not the united states 
the sandinistas meanwhile have espoused the opposite view 
contending that the usbacked contras are a us creation and 
that there can be no solution to the nicaraguan conflict without an 
accommodation betwen washington and managua 
echoing a policy that dates back to 1985 nicaraguan foreign 
minister miguel descoto wrote last week that the united states 
should open bilateral negotiations with nicaragua to deal with 
security issues and to normalize relations between our two 
countries 
last november president reagan indicated new flexibility in his 
attitude on negotiations with the sandinistas he said secretary of 
state george p shultz would be ready to meet with delegations from 
nicaragua and other central american countries once serious 
negotiations between the sandinistas and the contra rebels were 
under way 
that condition appears to have been satisfied by the temporary 
ceasefire agreement reached march 23 between the two sides 
the us officials said they do not believe that arrangements 
for regional negotiations will be completed by the conclusion of 
busbys visit 
one official said the administration wants to proceed slowly on 
this issue in order not to undercut the direct negotiations the 
sandinistas and the contras have planned for next week in managua 
we dont want to create a competing forum the official 
said in their managua talks the warring parties will attempt to 
work out a final settlement to the nicaraguan conflict now more 
than six years old 
a senior administation official in california with the 
vacationing president said conditions for regional talks have not 
been met 
what we have right now is a truce and ceasefire negotiations 
begin next week and were still working out the ceasefire zones 
so the conditions are not yet present for regional discussions 
said the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
ceasefire discussions have to get started and we have to see 
some progress in those ceasefire discussions to make sure that 
theyre not just discussions leading to a complete surrender of the 
freedom fighters and the total abandonment of their interests 
the official added 
busby is making the trip just a week after taking over as 
special envoy a post that had been vacant since ambassador philip 
habib stepped down last august because of an internal dispute over 
administration policy in central america 
busby has made several trips to the region since then while 
serving as principal deputy to assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams but abrams decided that a fulltime special envoy for 
central america was needed and busby was assigned that duty giving 
way to career diplomat michael kozak as principal deputy

martoche now an assistant secretary in the labor department also 
had rejected a request from meese to take the job of assistant 
attorney general in charge of the criminal division 
martoche decided not to take the job because of the taint 
factor said the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
martochi said through an assistant at the labor department that 
he would have no comment on the report 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and assistant attorney 
general william weld who headed the criminal division abruptly 
resigned last week out of concern that the nearly 11monthlong 
criminal investigation of meese was hurting the justice 
departments operations and image department sources have said 
the turndown by martoche represents the second unsuccessful 
attempt by meese to fill welds position in two days 
on monday the white house blocked another planned replacement 
for weld james ik knapp said a justice department source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity knapp 45 is a deputy assistant 
attorney general in the departments tax division 
meese had planned to announce knapp as his choice to succeed 
weld last friday justice department sources said but the white 
house held up meeses plan pending completion of fbi background 
checks on his choices 
department sources on monday declined to specify why knapps 
name was being withdrawn 
in his statement adams said he was unable to take the post 
offered to him by meese because of a heavy caseload at his 
philadelphia law firm where he took a job last year after stepping 
down from the 3rd us circuit court of appeals after 17 years on 
the bench 
in a brief interview after issuing the statement adams said 
that with such a short time frame its literally impossible to 
take the position 
if i had more time perhaps i could work it out said adams 
he was referring to the fact that the reagan administration has 
slightly more than nine months remaining in office and that meese 
must fill the position quickly 
adams said in his statement that he strongly wanted to take the 
job 
he said that in turning down the offer he had expressed to 
meese a pledge of support to the extent that i can assist the 
department of justice in the months ahead with informal advice 
i assured the attorney general that he need only call on me 
adams said 
meese wanted to fill the positions vacated by burns and weld 
plus the no 3 spot in the department that of associate attorney 
general before leaving wednesday on a weeklong trip to south 
america to speak to officials there on drugrelated matters 
the job that keating is to fill is being vacated by stephen 
trott who was confirmed by the senate last month to become a 
federal appeals court judge 
asked monday night whether he had any qualms about serving under 
meese adams said that i look at the job as serving the united 
states government and the department of justice and that the 
investigation of meese is not dominating my decision 
in a brief interview today at the justice department weld said 
the resignations of last week and the criminal investigation of 
meese were intertwined he refused to be more specific except 
to say that the pendency of the mckay investigation was a 
factor weld was at the justice department today for the first time 
since resigning a week ago

a study at one new york city high school found 
that television may help break down racial and ethnic stereotypes 
researchers said tuesday 
the study was conducted at a high school in the howard beach 
section of queens which gained national attention as the site of a 
racially motivated killing in 1986 
the good news is that the kids like the ethnic characters on 
television and they identify with them said robert lichter a 
political scientist who conducted the study for the center for 
media and public affairs the bad news is that they like the bad 
characters too 
the survey found that black characters are the most popular on 
television and that cliff huxtable portrayed by bill cosby in 
the cosby show is the most popular character of all 
both italianamerican students and nonitalians said that 
italian characters such as tony micelli on whos the boss were 
most typical of their ethnic group 
jewish students responded the least favorably to ethnic 
characters across the board but also were the least likely to view 
them as realistic portrayals 
in general the study found that the more students liked 
television characters the more likely they were to regard them as 
typical of their racial or ethnic group 
huxtable was one exception although black students 
overwhelmingly regarded him as a typical black man nonblacks were 
evenly split on whether he was typical 
the choice of john adams high school in howard beach was 
coincidental lichter said he said he and his wife sociologist 
linda lichter conducted their research several weeks before the 
1986 incident in which a group of white youths attacked three black 
men one of whom died 
the study was cosponsored by the american jewish committees 
institute for american pluralism

aboveaverage temperatures and 
belowaverage rainfall and snowpack are producing conditions in 
nevada reminiscent of the dust bowl weather of the 1930s state 
climatologist john james says 
james chairman of a newly formed governors committee on 
drought commented tuesday as the panel met here to review weather 
information and discuss possible water conservation steps 
james said western nevada had the driest february and march on 
record and has had only 02 inch of rain in more than 2 months 
national weather service representatives told the committee that 
snowpack in the sierra nevadas is about 2540 percent of normal and 
reservoirs in the in northern nevada and eastern california are at 
only half their average levels 
temperatures have run above normal in 12 of the past 14 months 
in nevada james said adding that such a pattern of high 
temperatures and lack of precipitation happened only once before in 
the state during the 1930s 
state engineer pete morros who oversees nevadas groundwater 
resources said he already has received reports of some shallow 
household wells in the reno area and elsewhere starting to dry up

south floridas coral reefs are making a rapid 
recovery from a mysterious illness that bleached them white last 
summer marine scientists say but now those reefs are threatened 
by another potentially fatal disease 
dr walter jaap a researcher for the florida department of 
natural resources said hes worried about the spread of whiteband 
disease which affects elkhorn coral the branching type thats 
common on shallow reefs off the florida keys 
jaap said he has seen evidence of whiteband disease off 
biscayne national park and near the grecian rocks off key largo 
the rocks are on the fringe of a coral reef sanctuary adjacent 
to john pennekamp coral reef state park a spectacular preserve 
that draws more than a million divers each year 
in some cases off grecian we were seeing entire colonies that 
had succumbed to it jaap said of the disease 
he said whiteband disease appears to be caused by a bacteria 
jaap said the disease could be getting a foothold in areas where 
coral has been weakened by turbid water though thats not always 
the case 
jaap found evidence of whiteband disease last month while 
surveying reefs to determine the extent of coral bleaching caused 
by another sometimes fatal affliction the study funded by the 
national science foundation covered reefs off biscayne national 
park key largo national marine sanctuary looe key national marine 
sanctuary and at the eastern dry rocks off key west 
he said the coral has made a remarkable comeback from the 
bleaching illness 
only 1 to 2 percent were still severely bleached jaap said 
they seem to be starting to regain their color the reefs in the 
shallow waters are almost back to normal i think that in another 
few weeks youll see most of the coral completely back to normal 
the bleaching disease struck coral last summer from the 
caribbean to palm beach some experts believe the condition was 
caused by the unusually long period of high sea temperatures last 
summer the hottest on record 
the temperatures caused the dark algae covering the coral to 
disappear whitening the coral the coral eventually dies because 
the algae is its source of food 
areas killed by the bleaching phenomenon should restore 
themselves in two to three years 
the cooler temperatures have had a beneficial effect if they 
are given a reprieve this summer theyll recover quite well 
jaap said

haitian gen jeanclaude paul tried to import 
some 900 pounds of cocaine into the united states in a 1986 deal 
which went awry a cubanamerican who was involved in the plan told 
congress on tuesday 
paul commands the most feared army unit in haiti and is 
considered one of the leaders of the troubled caribbean nation 
according to testimony from osvaldo quintana to the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics 
quintanas testimony in heavily accented english was part of the 
panels ongoing investigation of drug smuggling from latin america 
earlier tuesday a convicted marijuana dealer told the 
subcommittee that us law enforcement officials were paid to look 
the other way while huge amounts of marijuana were shipped to the 
united states from colombia 
quintana a native of cuba who came to the united states in 
1967 had headed ocean seafood international a miamibased 
company he detailed how he became involved with paul two years ago 
through a business deal offered by pauls wife marie marielle 
delinois 
she originally interested quintana through an offer to sell him 
seafood quintana testified but once he went to haiti to 
investigate the deal it turned into a plan to sent 412 kilograms 
about 906 pounds of cocaine into the united states through miami 
the deal fell through when the people hired to fly the cocaine 
from pauls haitian farm to miami stole the drugs quintana said 
pauls henchmen have tried twice to kill him since then including 
one attempt that occurred near the miami offices of the drug 
enforcement administration quintana said 
quintana is now under dea protection and paul has been indicted 
for conspiracy in the case also indicted march 10 in the same case 
was his brother antonio and mrs delinois 
sen john f kerry dmass chairman of the subcommittee noted 
that quintanas testimony shows yet another country polluting 
the streets of our country with drugs previous testimony before 
the subcommittee has centered on central and south american nations 
earlier michael p vogel testified that marijuana was moved 
aboard planes as large as a dc6 along with shrimp boats and on 
one occasion in 1983 a barge which carried 150 tons of the drug 
into a louisiana port 
law enforcement officials were paid off when it had to be 
done vogel said usually they were given 50000 or 60000 
to do nothing he said they were paid to look the other way 
vogel did not name any of the officials he said received 
payments 
on one occasion in 1979 or 1980 vogel said he and several 
other members of his drug smuggling organization met in panama with 
omar torrijos then that nations leader and manual noriega to 
discuss using a small island off the panamanian coast for 
transshipping drugs 
torrijos was killed in a 1981 plane crash and eventually was 
succeeded by noriega who has been charged in florida with 
involvement in the drug trade noriega has denied the charges and 
is resisting us efforts to push him out of office 
the two panamanians were being extremely greedy said vogel 
since they were seeking payoffs of up to 100000 per planeload of 
drugs 
vogel 37 pleaded guilty in 1986 to charges arising from his 
14year career as a drug smuggler he told the subcommittee he is 
now serving a 12year prison term 
vogel a native of detroit said he became involved in the drug 
business while he was a student at the university of miami he 
brokered a sale for a friend and i made a good amount of money 
and lo and behold i was off and running 
vogel told the committee he only dealt in marijuana because i 
have moral problems with cocaine 
vogel declined to say how much money he had personally made from 
his drug business but said the organizations in which he was 
involved made hundreds of millions of dollars 
for example the barge load of marijuana was worth 90 million 
and his organization only paid 30 million for the drug meaning a 
60 million profit vogel said 
vogel described one occasion in 1979 or 1980 in which he said a 
plane loaded with marijuana was flying from indiana to florida but 
had to turn back because the destination was fogged in the planes 
operators dumped their cargo bales of marijuana by pushing them 
out the door of the plane while flying over northern georgia in the 
middle of the night 
the emergency plan had been to dump the drugs in the the 
chattahoochee national forest in northern georgia but instead 
vogel said he later was told that some of the bales had fallen on 
the streets of a nearby town vogel said he did not know either the 
name of the town or the exact date of the incident 
vogel said his organization developed detailed elaborate 
methods of evading us efforts to halt the drug trade 
those tactics included intelligence collection and electronic 
countermeasures he said in addition smugglers obtained the 
frequencies used by us officials for communications and at one 
point they even had the frequency of air force one the 
presidents plane

a presidential advisory commission on 
recreation held 34 closed meetings in violation of the law 
congressional investigators said in a report released tuesday 
however the general accounting office report released by rep 
don young ralaska also concluded that the violation may not 
have had a material impact on the commissions operations and its 
final report and recommendations 
the commission chairman said he never realized so many minor 
gettogethers like informal lunches would count as meetings 
the 15member group in question the presidents commission on 
americans outdoors was organized in september 1985 under an 
executive order issued by president reagan and made its report in 
december 1986 
the gao report appeared to uphold many complaints by a group 
opposed to the commissions recommendations the national inholders 
association an inholder is an owner of private property 
surrounded by public land such as the owner of a home in a 
national park 
a lawsuit filed by the group to overturn the report got nowhere 
when a judge ruled that it could not sue because it had failed to 
protest when the alleged violations were occuring 
the commission was formed as a government advisory committee 
which meant that it had to hold its meetings in public with a 
15day notice a designated federal official had to attend each 
meeting and detailed minutes had to be kept permission had to be 
sought from the host agency head to close a meeting and reasons 
for closing it had to be submitted 
the interior department committee management officer thought 
that responsibility for the acts requirements was being handled 
by the commission but commission officials were unaware that such 
a transfer of responsibility had occured the gao report said 
as a result and despite an extensive campaign to generate 
public advice the commission published notices for only 18 of its 
60 meetings and only 10 were published in time proper procedures 
for closing 34 of the 60 meetings were not followed minutes were 
kept for only 27 of 60 meetings and the department employee 
designated to attend commission meetings attended only 11 
lamar alexander a former governor of tennessee who was chairman 
of the commission said in written comments i did not ever 
imagine that a meeting could be a lunch among a few of the 
commission members where no decisions were reached or a staff 
working session which some commission memebrs briefly attended if 
such an unusual definition of meeting is what congress really 
intended then perhaps gao officials could visit commissions like 
ours when they begin and say that 
rick ventura assistant secretary of interior for policy budget 
and administration wrote that the department was reviewing its 
procedures and would make sure that similar presidential 
commissions assigned to it would be served by staff familiar with 
the law 
charles cushman executive director of the national inholders 
association said the commission operated in a vacuum and made 
silly recommendations that it might not have made if the 
requirements had been met 
but derek crandall president of the american recreation 
coalition a trade association said cushman could not be more 
wrong we had an extraordinarily open process and did nothing 
in camera

new york realestate magnate donald trump 
agreed tuesday to pay a 750000 civil penalty to settle an 
antitrust lawsuit stemming from his attempted takeovers of holiday 
corp and bally manufacturing corp 
trump agreed to pay the penalty to settle a suit filed by the 
federal trade commission alleging that his 1986 stock purchases in 
the two companies violated the notification procedures required by 
the hartscottrodino act 
the law requires that buyers must notify the government before 
purchasing more than 15 million worth of voting stock in a company 
and wait 30 days before completing the transaction 
the ftc complaint filed in us district court along with the 
proposed settlement agreement charged that trump violated the law 
by failing to notify the government of holiday stock acquisitions 
made between aug 22 1986 and oct 17 1986 
the complaint also charged that trump committed the same 
violation when he acquired more than 15 million in shares of bally 
stock between nov 13 1986 and dec 1 1986 
the settlement is the second in two days by the ftc involving 
the socalled parking of stock with a brokerage house 
on monday the belzberg family of canada agreed to pay a 
400000 penalty to settle a similar suit arising from its attempt 
to buy a controlling interest in ashland oil co 
both cases involved the purchase of stock options through bear 
stearns amp co which in turn bought actual shares the ftc 
contends that the subsequent exercise of the stock options was 
covered by the notification procedures of the hartscottrodino act 
in a statement trump said he decided to settle the case to 
avoid protracted litigation within the federal government over a 
highly technical disagreement between the ftc and the business 
community 
trump said i firmly believe that i was in full compliance with 
the hartscottrodino act reporting restrictions 
trump said the most respected lawyers in the business told 
him the law exempted the purchase of stock options bear stearns 
also gave me the same assurance trump said i assume bear 
stearns will reimburse me for the expense 
a bear stearns spokeswoman said the company had no immediate 
comment 
wickes cos agreed last month to pay a 300000 civil penalty to 
settle a similar complaint bear stearns also served as the broker 
for wickes cos

public comments are being sought on how to 
define a person for purposes of determining federal limits on 
payments to farmers the agriculture department said tuesday 
there are limits on federal payments to individuals including 
benefits paid under commodity price support programs the 
conservation reserve program and some other programs where direct 
payments are made 
additionally the proposed rule would determine whether 
foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments 
in budget legislation late last year congress included a number 
of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in usdas farm payment 
regulations beginning with 1989 crops 
the law provides for example that to qualify for payments a 
person must be actively engaged in farming by providing a 
significant amount of capital equipment or land and personal 
labor or management to the enterprise 
a basic limit of 50000 per person annually is set on direct 
deficiency payments but this can be ballooned to as much as 
100000 maximum depending on a persons interest in other 
entities 
the term person can include individuals corporations 
associations charitable organizations or other entity as 
determined by usda and thats what the rulemaking procedure is 
seeking to determine the other entities 
a recent study by the departments economic research service 
says the law requires the secretary of agriculture to give fair 
and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries 
thereof and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their 
farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and 
continue to be operated separately 
written comments can be sent by may 6 to director cotton 
grain and rice price support division ascsusda po box 2415

an experienced parachutist filmed his own 
twomile death plunge after he fell from an airplane while carrying 
a video camera but apparently without realizing he had no 
parachute investigators said tuesday 
officials declared the death saturday of ivan lester mcguire 
35 of durham an accident 
franklin county sheriffs capt ralph brown said there was no 
foul play and no indication of suicide although a man who has 
jumped 800 times ought to remember his parachute 
the videotape shows mcguire leaving the plane apparently 
without problems brown said other parachutists then jump and free 
fall but disappear when they pop their parachutes and mcguire 
plunges on toward the ground at 150 mph 
mcguire who was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet 
was filming a student and an instructor at franklin county sports 
parachute center about 20 miles from raleigh 
the planes pilot mark luman couldnt be found for comment and 
had no telephone listing brown said the pilot wasnt in any 
position to see what happened in the back of the plane 
there was no answer tuesday at the parachute center nancy 
fayard wife of club owner paul fayard who was the instructor on 
mcguires last jump was quoted in tuesdays raleigh news and 
observer as saying no one was aware that he got on the plane 
without a parachute of course no one knew or they would have 
stopped him 
the videotape showed the divers making preparations around the 
planes door then the camera went out with mcguire 
with the camera aimed up toward the plane the tape then shows 
the instructor and the student jump and freefall somewhat above 
mcguire 
the jump appeared to be proceeding normally until the instructor 
and student opened their parachutes and receded rapidly from view 
as mcguire hurtled below them 
it kind of appears he reached for his parachute and didnt 
have one brown said but the release for his mcguires 
parachute is on his right hip and when that right hand goes down 
the left hand comes forward and it comes into camera view 
after several seconds of jerky motion the tape shows the ground 
approaching then the pictures get to moving real fast because 
hes approaching the ground at 150 mph brown said 
mcguires body was found in woods about 1 miles from the 
airfield footage of the final stage of the plunge was destroyed on 
impact and what tape remained had to be spliced in places 
officials said 
brown said blood samples will show whether mcguire had alcohol 
or drugs in his system and test results should be ready in about a 
week 
although an expert jumper mcguire could have forgotten to put 
on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video 
equipment mrs fayard was quoted as saying 
a federal aviation administration investigator said monday he 
was checking to see if the pilot knew whether mcguire was wearing a 
parachute when he entered the airplane as faa regulations require 
sheriff arthur johnson said tuesday the investigation showed the 
pilot thought mcguire was wearing a parachute but walter l 
riggsbee the faa investigator said the video equipment may have 
been mistaken for a parachute

people out to express their outrage about poverty said the rev 
joseph lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference a civil rights organization founded by king 
the combination march and motorcade through mississippi alabama 
and georgia was scheduled to begin monday following a memorial 
service on the 20th anniversary of kings death 
the trek was delayed a day however because two mules that were 
to pull a farm wagon on the marching portions of the trip failed to 
arrive on time 
the two animals trucked in for the trip tuesday turned out to be 
small yellow work horses but were strapped up to the wagon as the 
procession got under way 
today theyre mules lowery said as he climbed aboard the 
wagon 
lowery said sclc marches often use a muledrawn wagon as a 
symbol of poverty 
the 30 or so marchers walked about a mile and a half from the 
lorraine before loading the wagon on a rental truck putting the 
horses on a trailer and climbing aboard three vans for a trip to 
marks miss the first stop on the tour 
the group plans to ride in the vans for the rural parts of the 
trip and stage marches and rallies at towns along the way 
the pilgrimage is scheduled to arrive in atlanta on april 29 
lowery said his group will hold several public hearings on the 
trip for a report on poverty to be given to the republican and 
democratic parties at their conventions this summer 
most poor people are working people he said they simply 
dont earn enough to carry them out of the pits of poverty 
in recent years particularly during president reagans 
administration the nation has lost the urgency it once felt to 
help the poor lowery said 
youre not going to get the private sector where most jobs 
are to respond until you get public policy that encourages them 
that requires them and offers the incentives for them to provide 
job training and job opportunities for those who need it he said 
lowery said the crosscountry trek was begun at the lorraine 
because king was assassinated there while helping the working poor 
by leading a strike by sanitation workers 
we will not let any commemorative service for dr king end 
with a benediction lowery said thats why we closed the april 
4 event with a pilgrimage as part of the poor peoples campaign

portauprince haiti ap a committee appointed to 
investigate killings that caused the cancellation of national 
elections said it had identified the assailants collectively 
but named no individuals a radio station reported 
more than 30 people were killed on nov 29 as gangs of armed men 
rampaged through the streets of portauprince shooting at 
civilians who fled in panic police and military units patrolling 
the capital did not intervene 
the election was stopped after the polls had been open for 
several hours governmentcontrolled elections subsequently were 
held on jan 17 but they were boycotted by opposition groups and 
the voter turnout was low 
the military junta in power last fall appointed four civilians 
and two army officers to determine who was responsible for the nov 
29 violence and submit a report by jan 15 
contents of the report were not made public but radio metropole 
in a broadcast monday gave some details 
it said the committee reported it could not identify individuals 
responsible for the election day violence or for numerous 
preelection killings and cases of arson but the committee report 
said it had identified those responsible collectively so that the 
government can prosecute them radio metropole said it did not 
list any groups 
the radio station said the committee report criticized various 
agencies saying they had contributed to the collapse of order 
during the election which would have been haitis first free 
balloting in 30 years 
the broadcast said the committee accused the police of not 
providing adquate security claimed the ministry of information had 
not properly informed haitians about their civic duties and said 
the courts failed to document the electionday events as required 
by law 
an independent electoral council that organized the balloting 
failed to accomplish its constitutional mission and allowed 
foreign powers to become involved in national affairs the 
report said according to radio metropole 
it said the committee recommended payment of compensation for 
victims of the violence and their relatives strengthening the 
police force and intensified searches for illegal weapons 
after the balloting was canceled the threemember junta 
dissolved the independent electoral council and appointed its own 
council to oversee the january election

the war over saturday car sales in the 
heart of the nations automaking industry is opening up again with 
shotgun blasts and shattered windows 
leo jeromes suburban detroit oldsmobile and nissan dealership 
lost two 7by4 foot panes apparently for opening on the weekend 
i would either say its a couple of competing salespeople 
who took it in their own hands or they hired somebody jerome 
said tuesday in detroit you can hire something done pretty easy 
with the right contacts 
the saturday opening controversy has been bubbling in detroit 
for 20 years and there have been several reports of vandalism 
jerome said his business received a telephone call last week he 
quoted a male voice as saying other salesmen are excited its 
starting off with a bang measure your glass 
his dealership has been open on weekends intermittently in 
recent years closing each time after incidents of violence or 
harassment he said we come out and retreat he said 
he resumed the saturday hours about six months ago but didnt 
begin advertising the weekend hours until a month ago 
its getting around that it wasnt a shortterm deal he 
said were going to sell cars even if other dealerships are 
not they didnt like that 
the detroit auto dealers association has taken no formal stand 
on the saturday sales issue said dada executive vice president dan 
hayes he said he didnt know how many of the associations 
approximately 240 members are open on weekends but said those were 
in a small minority 
jerome said detroit is the only major market he knows of where 
dealerships are closed saturdays 
im not trying to be a hero said jerome who opened key 
motor mall in 1965 im not overjoyed to pay for glass im not 
trying to be a cause either 
but jerome said his business needs all the help it can get 
to cover my overhead ill do anything it takes to sell a 
car he said 
jerome estimated that car sales on a normal saturday amount to 
about half of any single weekdays sales but a few good saturdays 
in a row can turn loss into profit 
if we can pick up a halfdozen sales a weekend thats 25 a 
month it can be a difference between us being profitable or being 
at a loss jerome said 
key employees reporting to work thursday found two shattered 
glass panes and two others riddled with birdshot police discovered 
evidence that five or six shots had been fired 
no one was injured and no one including the dealerships 
overnight security guards heard shots jerome said the guards 
were at the back of the property keeping an eye on the 300 cars 
jerome keeps in stock 
in 1981 and 1982 jerome said cars on his lot suffered about 
300000 in damage caused by vandalism ranging from interiors 
being set on fire to body paint being badly scratched 
no one has been arrested in any of the incidents 
last july in washington administrative law judge james timony 
of the federal trade commission turned aside government charges 
that detroit auto dealers illegally conspired to close showrooms on 
weekends and most weeknights 
timony said the agreement to limit hours stemmed from a labor 
dispute dating to 1959 when dealers agreed to close on weekends to 
keep salesmen from joining labor organizations in the heavily 
unionized detroit area since it was a labor dispute the judge 
said it was exempt from antitrust action 
a veteran salesman at another detroitarea dealership that is 
closed on weekends said most weekend customers are tire kickers 
interested mainly in browsing 
when i first got in this business in 1967 we were open on 
saturdays and quite frankly business was pretty good john 
hillman said from bill brown ford in livonia then it just died 
we said to each other hey guys were not paid by the hour 
we just sit here and talk to each other its kind of silly 
hillman said 
hillman said bill brown ford closed on weekends after he and 
other salespeople picketed to protest weekend hours 
i like spending time with my family if they went to a sixday 
work week id quite frankly look for another line of work said 
hillman

with the flick of a tail and the 
wave of a claw two huge lobsters were freed monday in the atlantic 
ocean safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour 
of the northeast 
shirley a 25pound male lobster and bob his 19pound 
companion went down into the sea off foggy portland head light 
they had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild 
and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept 
before their release 
they were real frisky marine patrol officer donald k 
lockhart jr said they put a quahog a large clam in there and 
the big one just snapped it up like it was butter they left a crab 
in there overnight and it was gone this morning 
the two behemoths almost became a very expensive easter dinner 
in pennsylvania before an unlikely combination of animal rights 
activists seafood dealers and state officials came to the rescue 
a 30minute boat ride from portland marked a storybook ending to 
the rescue mission 
dana neuts retail manager of harbor fish market in portland 
and kevin hill owner of main line seafood co in the philadelphia 
suburb of ardmore had the honor of putting the monster crustaceans 
into the water 
neuts grabbed shirleys baseball mittsized claws and hill took 
the tail and the two gently lowered the lobster over the side of 
the 35foot maine marine patrol boat bob went into the same 
protected cove moments later 
the two men who make their living from selling seafood agreed it 
seemed strange to be returning it to the sea but in the case of 
shirley and bob they had no complaints 
it feels great it really does neuts said i like the 
idea of the whole thing 
these are welltraveled lobsters hill said with his wife 
vickie he accompanied the two lobsters on their flight monday from 
philadelphia to portland 
we shouldnt be catching lobsters this size maine is the only 
state thats doing anything to protect them and thats why were 
here hill said 
maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five 
inches covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds it is the 
only state with a legal limit on the maximum size of lobsters 
shirley whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old 
and the smaller companion were rescued from a philadelphia man who 
wanted to serve them for easter dinner 
col robert fogg chief of the bureau of marine patrol of the 
state department of marine resources said the lobsters had 
apparently gotten snagged in the nets of a dragger and were landed 
in rhode island 
the lobsters had been trucked from long island ny to hills 
store where retired carpenter art miller bought them for 287 
after animal rights activists took up the lobsters cause hill 
persuaded miller to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead 
pity not cruelty inc an animal rights group arranged to turn the 
creatures loose and assumed the 40 flight cost

a senior official said tuesday the reagan 
administration is pushing ahead with plans for speedy delivery of 
humanitarian aid to nicaraguas contras but the sandinistas claim 
us assistance to the rebels would be illegal 
alan woods administrator of the agency for international 
development said plans are being prepared for air drops of the 
food and other aid approved for the rebels last week by congress 
the temporary ceasefire agreement signed by the leftist 
sandinista government and the contras allows for deliveries of 
humanitarian aid to the rebels 
woods acknowledged at a news conference that sandinista 
cooperation is required and said the issue is being discussed 
between government and rebel negoitators 
we would strongly hope that the nicaraguan government would be 
sensitive and prepare to allow humanitarian assistance food 
medical supplies clothing and shelter to move without 
interruption woods said 
but nicaraguan president daniel ortega on monday called the us 
aid package that was approved by congress illegal saying we 
cannot accept any type of aid to the contras because it would be 
legitimizing the interventionist policy of the united states 
woods said preparations are being made for deliveries to rebels 
deployed outside nicaragua presumably in honduras within the 
next few days contras based inside nicaragua will receive aid once 
they move to ceasefire enclaves agreed to in ongoing negotiations 
the 497 million aid package calls for 177 million to be sent 
to the contras and a similar amount to be allocated to help 
children who are war victims 
woods said private contractors will be hired to carry out 
shipments to the rebels by air while private voluntary 
organizations are being contacted to send experts trained to help 
children in need 
he said aid will abide by a provision in the sandinistacontra 
agreement that only neutral organizations be allowed to take 
part in delivery of the assistance

the american envoy at the opening of 
talks on the future of us military bases in the philippines said 
tuesday the facilities are needed in the face of a soviet buildup 
ambassador nicholas platt said the six bases where about 20000 
us military personnel and defense workers are stationed are 
critical to security in southeast asia 
many filipinos have called for an end to the garrisons which 
they see as a vestige of colonialism 
platt said that while us troop strength in the region has 
remained constant the soviet military presence has grown from an 
essentially zero base to one of substantial proportions 
it only requires an overnight shift in soviet intentions 
given their current capability to transform this presence into a 
serious economic and military threat to the philippines and to the 
region he added 
us and philippine officials are reviewing a 1947 agreement 
under which the united states operates the bases the last major 
us military installations in southeast asia they technically are 
under command of the philippines but are effectively controlled by 
the united states 
as the talks got under way at a seaside convention complex in 
manila about 500 people staged a peaceful march to the us 
embassy protesting the bases eight imprisoned communist rebels 
issued a statement demanding the bases be closed 
the government has been fighting a 19year war against communist 
guerrillas 
spokesmen for the two countries said tuesdays closeddoor 
meeting was devoted to drawing up an agenda and agreeing on 
procedures for the talks which are expected to last three months 
the leases for the bases expire in 1991 under the new 
philippine constitution a lease extension must be approved by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to the bases 
is strong 
philippine negotiators were expected to press the united states 
for an increase in the 180 million manila receives each year for 
the bases 
platt indicated washington would resist such demands 
for decades we have borne the main financial burden for the 
defense of the free nations he said now the resulting 
serious deficits and imbalances must be addressed as a matter of 
top priority 
he said the presence of the us bases allows the philippines to 
use its resources on economic development and battle the communist 
rebels platt also predicted more foreign investment in the country 
if the bases remain 
philippine officials have said they also will press for 
information on whether the installations which include the clark 
air and subic naval bases and four smaller facilities are used to 
store or transport nuclear weapons 
the new constitution states that the country opposes such 
weapons consistent with the national interests 
foreign secretary raul manglapus said the talks will be held in 
an atmosphere of candor and friendship but suggested the 
philippine negotiators will be sensitive to growing opposition to 
the us bases 
president corazon aquino has not said if she supports an 
extension of the leases

secretary of state george p shultz discussed 
the us peace plan with two arab leaders at length tuesday and 
said the going is very tough 
meeting with reporters on the flight back to jerusalem he 
reported no convergence with israel on mideast negotiations 
during talks with king hussein of jordan in amman and president 
hafez assad of syria in damascus 
shultz said he brought with him questions from hussein to 
present on wednesday to prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign 
minister shimon peres 
husseins approval of the plan is considered essential a senior 
israeli defense official said monday that israel might be nudged 
into acting on the plan if hussein accepts it in principle 
among points at issue is how negotiations on palestinian 
selfrule which shultz hopes will begin may 1 would link with 
talks on a final settlement shultz would like the second stage to 
begin in december 
he will take answers from the israelis to hussein later 
wednesday after a stop in cairo to see president hosni mubarak of 
egypt 
i cant report any particular sense of convergence on the 
intiative at this point the secretary told reporters on his us 
air force jet people are raising questions and expressing 
reservations 
shultz added however we continue to think what has been put 
forward is basically what can potentially work so we stick with 
it 
all sides urged him to continue in his effort for negotiations 
he declared but i dont want to give any big plus sign because 
that would not be warranted by the facts 
shamir and peres are prepared to negotiate with the arabs on an 
overall settlement but there are all sorts of questions on the 
israeli side including a connection between palestinian selfrule 
and talks on an overall agreement shultz said 
israels cabinet is deadlocked over whether to accept the us 
proposal shamir leads those holding out while peres and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin favor it 
in amman shultz and hussein met for 75 minutes then had lunch 
in damascus the secretary spent two hours and 45 minutes with 
assad and said they had sharply different views on how to hold 
the negotiations 
we think we made a reasonable amount of headway however 
shultz said april glaspie head of the state departments 
jordanlebanonsyrian desk remained in damascus for further 
discussions 
in an interview with jordanian newspaper editors in amman 
shultz ruled out participation in peace talks by the palestine 
liberation organization how do you talk to someone who says we 
want to exterminate you israel he asked 
he also said we dont think an independent palestinian state 
on the west bank makes sense 
the interview was videotaped but not shown on early evening news 
programs by jordans staterun television network a senior 
government source said privately the shultz comments were 
considered very much proisraeli 
jordanian television usually can be seen in israel and syria 
and by palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip which have been torn by four months of violence 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington 
that hussein had not dropped his insistence that talks with israel 
be held at a peace conference in which the soviet union and united 
states would take active roles israel prefers direct negotiations 
with the arabs 
shultz made clear in the jordanian interview that plo 
partricipation in peace talks is impossible until it accepts 
israels right to exist and renounces terrorism 
israel is here its here to stay he said 
several of the editors questioned whether the united states 
could be a fair mediator between arabs and israel the secretary 
said washington is a friend of both sides

a day after he was convicted and removed 
from office by the state senate former gov evan mecham said 
tuesday he is doing fine but has not decided whether he will try to 
get his job back 
however mecham warned that those who ousted him may not realize 
they have awakened a sleeping giant in the arizona electorate 
i know that they are aroused i know that they are incensed i 
know that they are right down angry said mecham a firstterm 
republican convicted in an impeachment trial that ended monday 
mecham who described himself as the recent former governor 
appeared relaxed as he spoke to a kiwanis club and said i have 
no rancor in my heart for anybody 
he was removed from office monday when the senate convicted him 
of obstructing justice and misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund 
i havent yet determined what my course will be mecham 
said i havent yet said that im not going to be a candidate in 
the recall 
earlier in a telephone interview from his surburban glendale 
home he said im doing fine ive got a clear conscience 
and i havent done anything wrong 
this job wasnt the end of the world for me i didnt need it 
in the first place mecham said 
several weeks ago mecham had said that if the senate convicted 
him he might go to the us supreme court to claim that his rights 
had been violated he said tuesday he had not decided whether he 
will do so 
two senate leaders republican majority leader robert usdane 
and minority leader alan stephens said there was talk among 
senators about reconsidering their vote against excluding mecham 
from holding office again the two said they opposed reopening the 
issue when the senate meets wednesday 
mecham faces a criminal trial april 21 on charges of concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan if convicted he would be barred from 
holding office again 
meanwhile mecham attorney jerris leonard told ktar radio he 
does not believe mecham can run in the may 17 recall because the 
senate removed him from the fouryear term he began in january 1987 
my understanding is that he cannot run again until 1990 
leonard said 
the recall election remained scheduled despite the vote removing 
mecham from office and the installation of democrat rose mofford 
the secretary of state who until monday was acting governor 
mecham told the kiwanis group he expects lawmakers and mrs 
mofford to adopt a 10 percent tax increase to make up for a 198889 
budget deficit estimated at 349 million such a tax hike is 
unnecessary he said although in january mecham proposed a tax 
equity plan that amounted to a 90 million hike 
mecham said he disagreed with mrs moffords decision to sign 
legislation allowing a second weekly lottery game and another 
measure allowing new state buildings to be funded through 
leasepurchase 
leonard said he planned to ask the senate on wednesday to 
require the state to pay mechams attorney fees which leonard said 
were in the range of 300000 
officials still must decide what to do with the protocol fund 
which leonard said is in the bank mechams auto dealership repaid 
the 80000 loan that was the subject of one impeachment charge

mayor edward i koch charged tuesday that the 
other presidential candidates have not challenged jesse jacksons 
position on vital issues for fear of being labeled as racist 
we have seen the other candidates up until now dance around 
jesse jackson and the media dance around jesse jackson as though 
they were afraid they were either going to insult him or his 
supporters koch said i think it would insult him and his 
supporters by not treating him equally 
koch maintained that the other presidential candidates have been 
afraid to insult jackson the black candidate or his supporters by 
questioning his positions on aid to the palestine liberation 
organization and on cutting back on defense in favor of vast social 
programs 
although koch said jackson was the smartest of all those guys 
running he maintained that this didnt mean hed make the best 
president 
but he knows how to answer he can defend himself koch 
said he doesnt need presidential security from questions and 
so when the candidates wouldnt take him on and the media wouldnt 
take him on i decided i would 
the mayor was critical of jackson last friday saying jews would 
be crazy to vote for him since he embraced plo leader yasser 
arafat 
he said jacksons domestic social programs would break the 
bank in three weeks and his proposed defense cutbacks would 
leave the united states defenseless in six weeks 
it seems to me everybody whos running for president ought to 
be subject with respect to their public behavior and their public 
statements and their philosophy under a microscope the mayor 
said 
arent you patronizing jesse jackson by saying he shall be 
spared from having to defend his positions koch said when asked

gov henry bellmon signed a controversial 
resolution tuesday requiring the confederate flag be flown over the 
capitol but said the flag pole would remain empty until he knows 
which confederate flag to display 
during debate on the bill black legislators urged colleagues 
not to adopt the resolution saying the confederate flag was an 
offensive symbol of racism and slavery and had been used by 
organizations such as the ku klux klan 
bellmons announcement came at a news conference the day after 
the author of the resolution state sen herbert rozell said he 
would refuse the governors request to recall the bill and change 
it 
in asking for the recall bellmon said the bill did not 
stipulate which of the three flags used by the confederacy from 
1861 to 1865 should be flown 
rozell said monday the resolution was written so bellmon could 
fly the flag that is the least offensive 
but bellmon said tuesday if i chose any one of the three im 
going to be criticized for it 
the flag has sparked controversy in several other southern 
states recently opponents say the confederate flag is a symbol of 
oppression supporters say it is historic not a racial symbol 
in georgia legislators have introduced a bill to redesign the 
state flag which incorporates the design of the confederate 
banner and in alabama black lawmakers were arrested for trying to 
remove a confederate flag from the capitol dome 
for years the stars and bars flag used by the confederacy until 
1863 was part of a 14flag display south of the capitol steps the 
display was removed during recent reconstruction and office of 
public affairs director helen arnold said she did not plan to have 
it restored 
rozell then introduced the resolution to require the flag 
display be resurrected 
the flag display represents the countries that have claimed a 
portion of oklahoma territory in the past including france and 
spain bellmon has said the existence of the confederacy and its 
control over a portion of oklahoma are undisputed facts and the 
display is in historical context

the first of an extra 1300 us 
troops arrived tuesday to increase security for american soldiers 
and citizens during panamas political and economic crisis 
a c141 starlifter carrying the first contingent of soldiers 
from fort bragg nc landed at 430 pm 530 pm edt at 
howard air base outside panama city nearly 50 flights are expected 
by the time the deployment is finished friday 
reinforcements and a squadron of 26 helicopters are intended by 
the reagan administration as a signal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega the de facto ruler washington has been urging to step down 
the buildup ordered last week to counter what the pentagon 
called noriegas heavyhanded tactics will raise us troop 
strength along the 50milelong panama canal to 11800 officers and 
men noriega commands the 15000member defense forces 
the reinforcements were sent after reports that us citizens 
were harassed by panamanian soldiers and the brief arrests of 
several american reporters during a police raid on opposition 
headquarters in a panama city hotel 
panama has repeatedly accused the reagan administration of 
preparing to invade 
the first flight was from pope air force base nc officials 
said they expected at least one heavy cargo plane each hour from 
pope and travis air force base calif 
a statement from the office of panamas roman catholic 
archbishop marcos gregorio mcgrath said the government told him 
it would hold discussions with the opposition mediated by mcgrath 
mcgrath was asked to mediate by president oscar arias of costa 
rica prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain and former presidents 
daniel oduber of costa rica and carlos andres perez of venezuela 
the civilian government which noriega controls has accused 
mcgrath of siding with the opposition staterun newspapers have 
called the archbishop who was born in philadelphia a tool of 
the yankees 
police halted two opposition demonstrations before they started 
tuesday sealing off the site of one and appearing in force at a 
park where another was to take place 
the us national security adviser lt gen colin l powell 
said tuesday in santa barbara calif that the united states had no 
plans to send more forces to panama but would not eliminate that 
possibility 
us sanctions imposed in february have produced the gravest 
economic crisis in the history of panama which uses the us 
dollar as its currency banks closed more than a month ago the 
government has been unable to pay its employees 
tuesdays editions of government newspapers carried a statement 
from panamas health ministry ridiculing the new american troops 
and calling them potential aids carriers 
it said tests by the centers for disease control in atlanta 
showed us military personnel have a high rate of infection 
with the aquired immune deficiency syndrome virus 
knowing their clinical history we can do no less than exhort 
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with 
these soldiers the statement said 
a spokesman for the centers for disease control said it does not 
test military personnel the defense department began doing so in 
1985 and reported these figures sept 30 at the end of the 1987 
fiscal year 5890 tests positive in a total of 396 million 
including 3336 positive among 218 on active duty 
the us southern command with headquarters near panama city 
had about 600 security people among its 10000 personnel before the 
reagan administration stepped up its campaign to oust noriega early 
last month 
in midmarch the pentagon sent 670 more security personnel to 
panama to help protect military facilities 
the primary task of all us personnel in panama is to safeguard 
the canal until it is handed over by treaty to the panamanian 
government dec 31 1999 
about 13000 military dependents also live in panama along with 
1300 us employees of the panama canal commission and their 2600 
dependents 
on monday night panamanian security agents monday night 
surrounded the home of ricardo arias calderon president of the 
christian democratic party and one of noriegas chief opponents 
they remained there tuesday 
luis camacho an aide who was in the house told the associated 
press by telephone arias calderon was not at home 
arias calderon returned to panama two weeks ago from a month in 
the united states he had been refused permission to return from a 
business trip feb 25 
on that day federal courts in florida unsealed grand jury 
indictments charging noriega with drug trafficking and money 
laundering the following day noriegas figurehead president eric 
arturo delvalle tried to fire the general as defense forces 
commander but lost his own job instead 
the united states still considers him panamas legitimate 
president and has frozen all panamanian bank funds in the united 
states

gunmen laughed and screamed kill 
everyone you can as they massacred 28 villagers at a rural 
easter festival newspapers in the capital reported tuesday 
the hooded killers shot dead an elderly onelegged man as he 
struggled to get on the donkey and flee the bogota daily el tiempo 
quoted an unidentified survivor as saying 
a 10yearold boy oscar sierra who was among those ordered to 
lie face down in the dirt and not look up was shot in the head at 
pointblank range by one of the killers when he lifted his head 
another survivor was quoted as telling an el tiempo reporter 
one other child a 14yearold boy was also killed in the 
sunday bloodbath 
there were conflicting reports on the number of wounded ranging 
from 10 to 15 a death toll of 33 given monday was revised downward 
to 28 tuesday by gov jose gabriel amin manzur of northwest cordoba 
state 
the governor said police and the army suspect the massacre was 
the work of leftist guerrillas el tiempo said 
however the murders had all the earmarks of the work of a 
rightwing death squad 
el tiempo and another bogota daily el espectador sent 
reporters to the scene a thatched roof hut in remote mountains 
where about 200 people were celebrating the end of holy week 
the area know as mejor esquina lies 280 miles west of the 
capital city of bogota and has about 50 families with no house 
closer than 1500 feet to its neighbor 
here is what happened according to the accounts given reporters 
the traditional partying started saturday afternoon with an 
eightpiece band of guitars and accordions playing the songs dear 
to colombian peasants ballads of hardworking cowboys lost love 
and happiness amid poverty 
a pig was slaughtered for the feast and chickens were killed 
sunday started off with horse races in the afternoon there was 
a dance for the children in the small farmhouse made of mud bricks 
women cooked stew in huge pots throughout the afternoon and the 
men drank beer and aguardiente a colombian liquor with a faint 
taste of licorice 
in the evening the peasants danced and shouted to each other 
over music blaring from large speakers only a few noticed vehicles 
park about 150 feet away with lights out 
some people said there were about 10 gunmen others said there 
were as many as 20 some said they wore military jungle clothing 
others said they wore police uniforms 
one thing all survivors agreed on was the gunmen laughing 
crazily as they fired repeatedly into the crowd amid shouts 
screams the hysterical crying of children 
some people ran into the hut and gunmen followed firing as 
they entered 
jose llorente said he survived because the bodies of dead 
friends lay atop him as the killers fired into the room 
no one in the band was killed one gunman smashed an accordion 
and whacked the musician across his backside with the flat part of 
a 2footlong machete 
the shooting lasted about 20 minutes and the gunmen became more 
selective in choosing victims eight people were shot in the back 
of the head as they lay face down in the hut 
the gunmen left warning survivors to keep their faces in the 
dirt for five minutes 
then you can look up and cry over what you find you sons of 
bitches one attacker shouted 
that is when the 10yearold boy was shot for lifting his head 
the sound of the vehicles died out and the village was filled 
with the groans of the wounded cries of people calling for loved 
ones the agonized whinnying of injured horses 
the next day in nearby planeta rica someone painted on a wall 
the magnificient ones are here to clean things up 
there are a dozen rightwing death squads in colombia with names 
like the vampires and the crickets this the first time the 
magnificient ones had been heard of 
death squads have killed about 600 people in the last three 
years 
the left says the army is behind killings the army denies it 
the government says it has been unable to find out who organizes 
the death squads 
so far no one from any death squad has been caught 
leftist guerrillas draw combatants from rural areas and mejor 
esquina may have been one of them 
at the school a guerrilla slogan long live the popular 
liberation army has been painted near the entrance 
the schoolmaster tomas berrios wilches was among those killed

mikhail s gorbachev lashed out tuesday at 
foreigners he said were trying to aggravate an ethnic dispute in 
the southern caucasus 
they are trying to interfere in our internal affairs to 
exacerbate problems from the outside and are engaging in 
provocations he said at present this is particularly visible 
in connection with the events around nagornokarabakh 
his comments were similar to recent remarks in the official 
press condemning purported outside interference in the dispute over 
nagornokarabakh a region in azerbaijan that armenians want 
attached to their republic 
the soviet leaders remarks came at a kremlin meeting with willy 
brandt head of the socialist international and a former chancellor 
of west germany the official news agency tass reported on the 
meeting 
gorbachev singled out broadcasters for criticism 
various radio stations including official ones have joined 
in the subversive activity he said especially active is 
deutsche welle west german radio 
tass did not say how the radio stations were purportedly being 
subversive but other soviet reports have accused western 
journalists of sharpening tensions between armenians and azeris 
the dominant ethnic group in azerbaijan 
gorbachev told brandt we will handle problems that have 
accumulated including on the nationalities issue within the 
framework of the democratic process we have firmly chosen 
soviet newspapers reported tuesday that four businesses have 
gone bankrupt in stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh 
because of a strike but that workers have been returning to their 
jobs in increasing numbers 
the first reports that workers were returning to their jobs came 
friday the government newspaper izvestia reported tuesday that 
workers were continuing to go back to work to their jobs because of 
repeated appeals by communist authorities 
workers began striking in stepanakert on march 24 to protest 
government refusal to turn the city and the surrounding region 
nagornokarabakh over to the armenian republic most of the 
regions 160000 residents are ethnic armenians but since 1923 it 
has been part of the neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
the presidium of the supreme soviet the national parliament 
announced a plan on march 23 for 690 million in economic social 
and culture improvements for nagornokarabakh which some armenians 
say has suffered under the control of azerbaijan 
izvestia said that in stepanakert on tuesday all workers of the 
building materials plant showed up as did more than half of the 
employees of the electrical engineering works and silk mill about 
a third of the workers of the shoe and furniture factories reported 
for work it said 
the annexation issue touched off demonstrations and strikes in 
nagornokarabakh on feb 13 and the unrest spread to the armenian 
captial yerevan the dispute led to ethnic rioting feb 28 in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait that left at least 32 people dead

the dalai lama tibets spiritual leader in exile 
said tuesday he may be willing to meet chinese leaders in beijing 
to discuss the future of his homeland 
i feel the more time goes on there may be more room to 
develop human understanding he said in a television interview 
we need more patience more determination i am trying to find 
some way a middle way or some kind of compromise 
if circumstances really became more favorable and more 
positive i would have no hesitation to go to the chinese capital 
to discuss tibetan independence he told britains commercial 
channel 4 network 
the 52yearold dalai lama arrived monday on a 12day private 
visit 
he chided britain for not being more openly critical of chinas 
control of tibet the dalai lama fled tibet to exile in india in 
1959 after an abortive tibetan uprising against the chinese 
he said monday that prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government had asked him to refrain from making 
political statements during his visit which he said will be mainly 
devoted to buddhist teaching 
published reports have suggested britain does not want to upset 
china in the period leading up to the transfer of britains hong 
kong colony to china in 1997 
china which claims tibet has been an integral part of the 
nation for centuries moved troops into the remote mountain region 
in 1950 many tibetans resent the beijing government because of 
opression of tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of 
temples during the ultraleftist cultural revolution in 196676

a jury deliberated a second day tuesday 
without deciding the fate of 13 people nine of them accused of 
conspiring to violently overthrow the us government and establish 
an aryan nation 
at midafternoon the jury asked us district judge morris 
arnold for a trial transcript arnold sent jurors a note saying a 
transcript would be about 7000 pages and would not be ready for 
three or four months 
he told jurors that recordings of long portions of testimony 
could not be played for them and they should rely on their memory 
and notes the jury was to resume deliberations wednesday 
the case went to the jury on monday after a trial that began 
feb 16 and included 192 witnesses 
defendant richard g butler told reporters tuesday that the 
trial is a move by the government to snuff out views that do not 
meet its approval he said he expects to be acquitted but added 
in any case they win they break us financially 
butler and defendants robert e miles and louis ray beam jr are 
considered among the leaders of the whitesupremacist movement in 
the united states 
one of beams lawyers kirk lyons said acquittal would slow the 
movement more than a guilty verdict because it would show that 
white supremacists can get a fair trial in american courts if 
acquittal comes back in this case it will go a long way toward 
neutralizing the right wing if theyre convicted the right wing 
will think theyve been shanghaied 
besides the nine people accused of seditious conspiracy which 
carries a maximum of 20 years in prison and a 20000 fine five 
defendants are accused of conspiring to kill federal officials and 
two of transporting stolen money across state lines the murder 
plot could be punished by life imprisonment the transporting 
charge by a term of 10 years plus a 10000 fine 
a key government witness was james ellison who is serving 20 
years for racketeering he led a whitesupremacist group named the 
covenant the sword and the arm of the lord his group carried out 
bombings in furtherance of a conspiracy he testified that was 
made in july 1983 at hayden lake idaho at a convocation of 
butlers group the aryan nations 
defendants at that meeting have said that there was no 
conspiracy and that ellison made up the story in hopes of getting a 
sentence reduction

sales of strategic exports to communist countries 
paul freedenberg undersecretary of commerce for export 
administration said tokyos reported crackdown on two japanese 
firms accused of violating export regulations in the sale of 
electronic measuring equipment to china demonstrates japans

ltd and shinseki koeki co ltd 
the japanese ministry of international trade and industry said 
the companies sales to china occurred in 198586 prior to the

the search for three killers who 
escaped from the west virginia penitentiary focused for hours 
tuesday on what turned out to be a false sighting at a restaurant 
state police said 
at first check it seemed to be them said state police sgt 
de cook but after further checks we couldnt make a positive 
id 
we retraced all the people who saw them they werent the 
three cook said adding that the investigative effort had taken 
six hours 
state police had said four workers at a fast food restaurant in 
cross lanes 11 miles west of charleston and about 170 miles south 
of the prison had made a positive identification of the escapees 
based on mug shots 
convicted murderers bobby stacy tommie mollohan and david 
williams used stolen bolt cutters in their sunday night escape from 
the moundsville prison 
earlier a prison official blamed the escape on antiquated 
facilities and the need to use inmate labor 
corrections commissioner av dodrill said at least one of the 
escapees was probably familiar with every nook and cranny of 
the 122yearold prison which dodrill says can be kept running 
only with the help of the inmates 
as a result he said inmates often become familiar with the 
institutions weaknesses 
this prison is in terrible shape the plumbing is especially 
bad it needs constant renovation dodrill said 
mollohan 45 was convicted of robbing and killing a grocer in 
1973 
at the time mollohan had escaped from a florida prison and also 
was wanted in georgia and north carolina on armed robbery charges 
mollohan was the ringleader dodrill said he is an 
excellent plumber and probably knew every nook and cranny 
stacy 35 was convicted of killing one police officer and 
accused of shooting another authorities said he had sworn revenge 
on those who had put him behind bars 
police have assigned protection to those who helped convict 
stacy including the judge in his case and a columbus ohio woman 
who testified against him 
williams 28 was serving a life sentence for felony murder 
arson and robbery dodrill said authorities are trying to determine 
whether the three were aided in their escape by correctional 
officers that possibility does exist the commissioner said 
the last escape from moundsville was in february 1983 when two 
inmates climbed over a wall behind the prison they were recaptured 
within 24 hours 
in 1979 15 inmates including convicted cop killer ronald 
williams escaped from the massive stone block prison killing an 
offduty state trooper who was driving past all 15 eventually were 
recaptured

the communist party newspaper pravda on tuesday 
denounced soviets who are nostalgic for dictator josef stalins 
rule and say mikhail s gorbachevs reforms are damaging socialism 
pravda also lashed out at publications that praise stalinism and 
said gorbachevs glasnost policy of more openness on some 
issues does not include criticizing principles of the economic 
reforms the soviet leader calls perestroika 
we need disputes helping to advance perestroika and leading to 
the consolidation of forces and cohesion around perestroika rather 
than to disunity pravda said in a fullpage unsigned editorial 
it said the soviet union needs people dedicated to improving 
housing food supplies and services rather than those obsessed with 
uncovering suspected enemies of socialism 
a patriot is not he who cries out loudly about an alleged 
internal threat to socialism who joining with a few political 
extremists seeks internal enemies everywhere pravda said a 
patriot is he who acts in the interest of the country of the 
people without fear of any difficulty 
in a kremlin meeting tuesday with willy brandt the head of 
socialist international and former chancellor of west germany 
gorbachev acknowledged that his reforms have generated controversy 
the official tass news agency quoted gorbachev general 
secretary of the soviet communist party as saying there are 
people who think everything is collapsing just as in the beginning 
of this century matter vanished in the perceptions of some people 
as a result of new discoveries in physics now it seems to some 
that socialism is vanishing 
gorbachev said that what is really happening is that socialism 
is ridding itself of everything that had deformed it in the past 
and is demonstrating tremendous dynamism the wealth of its social 
and humanistic content 
pravdas editors said they felt compelled to address the issue 
of stalinism because another newspaper had raised it improperly 
sovietskaya rossiya official daily of the russian republics 
party and government carried a letter from a leningrad teacher who 
defended stalin it was published march 13 just before gorbachev 
left for yugoslavia and his chief of propaganda alexander n 
yavovlev went to mongolia 
in the past year soviet publications have criticized the 
excesses of stalin who ruled for three decades and died in 1953 
gorbachev said in november the dictators guilt for the purges 
in which millions died was enormous and unforgivable but 
defended stalins policies of rapid industrialization and 
collectivizating of agriculture 
the pravda editorial appeared to be an attempt to draw the party 
line on stalinism 
it repeated criticisms of stalin but said gorbachevs opponents 
wont let the issue rest either because they feel more comfortable 
with stalins repression or because it would serve their own 
interests 
in one person this may be directed at taking more and giving 
less in another in wrapping in respectable clothes their efforts 
to claim a monopoly in science personal innocence or something 
else the paper said 
pravda criticized the system under stalin as thoughtless 
execution of orders and suppression of initiative the soviet 
union cannot hide from the fact that many thousands of party 
workers economic and military officials scientists and cultural 
figures were exiled or killed it said 
gorbachev launched his effort to restructure soviet society 
three years ago and pravda said there are those who feel 
widespread changes could undermine the soviet system 
not all realize fully that the administrativecommand methods 
have exhausted themselves it said all who pin hopes on those 
methods or their modifications would do well to wake up to the fact 
that we have had that more than once but it did not bring about 
the desired results 
people should get rid of the nostalgia for the past when some 
people said things and others were supposed to heed and 
uncomplainingly fulfill the orders pravda advised 
it said statements in the letter published by sovietskaya 
rossiya are an attempt little by little to revise party 
decisions 
at meetings at the party central committee it has been said 
more than once that the soviet press is not a private shop and that 
the communists writing in the press and the editors should be aware 
of their responsibility for the articles and the publications it 
declared 
in this case the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya which has 
done much for perestroika has departed from this principle

feuding moslems and christians joined in 
a nationwide strike tuesday to demand 300 percent wage increases to 
counter inflation and the economic chaos brought on by 13 years of 
civil war 
in southern lebanon rival moslem factions engaged in a gun 
battle that left one man killed and four wounded 
police said the fight near the town of nabatiyeh was between the 
syrianbacked shiite amal militia and the proiranian shiite 
hezbollah or party of god 
they said amal militiamen had raided several villages and 
rounded up 10 hezbollah members in a search for gunmen who fired at 
the car of amals militia commander in nabatiyeh mahmoud faqih on 
monday police said faqih was not in the car at the time 
the oneday general strike was the latest in a series of 
demonstrations that began nearly two years ago to protest the 
economic situation 
banks schools shops gasoline stations government offices and 
other businesses closed in both christian east beirut and moslem 
west beirut and cities and towns throughout the country 
but some lebanese were sceptical 
weve tried this before and nothing happened said adel 
bohsali an employee at a pastry shop in west beirut 
the general confederation of labor unions which claims 300000 
members said beirut airport hospitals pharmacies bakeries and 
newspapers were exempt from the strike 
in 1975 when the civil war began the annual inflation rate was 
9 percent it is now 225 percent 
the lebanese pound once the soundest currency in the middle 
east exchanged at 25 to the us dollar before the civil war and 
the rate last week was 360 per dollar 
the pounds collapse sent prices soaring in a country that 
imports more than 85 percent of its needs 
in its strike call the labor confederatin said tuesdays action 
was a warning and an indefinite work stoppage would begin april 15 
if the demand for the 300 percent increase retroactive to january 
was not met 
a government source speaking with the condition he not be 
identified said cabinet ministers were considering a compromise 
that would approve wage increases but they would be limited to 100 
percent

an education official on tuesday denied reports 
that china will drastically reduce the number of students it allows 
to study overseas especially in the united states 
huang xinbai a member of the state education commission who is 
in charge of chinese students abroad called the reports 
groundless the official xinhua news agency reported 
it quoted huang as saying china has a longstanding policy of 
sending students abroad and the policy had not changed and will 
never change he said the numbers of both statefinanced and 
privately financed students were expected to stay the same 
according to huang the government has sent about 3000 students 
abroad each year since 1980 
the number sent by their employers or by academic institutions 
has increased steadily and in 1987 topped 5000 he said 
huang estimated that an additional 3000 students are financing 
their own overseas education 
since china began sending students overseas in 1979 as part of 
its general opening to the outside world more than 40000 
statefunded students have gone to study in 70 countries huang 
said according to xinhua 
china last summer announced new regulations tightening controls 
on students going abroad and said they must be ideologically and 
morally sound many of the students have not returned home 
because of better jobs and living conditions overseas 
huang said 20000 students have completed their studies abroad 
and returned to china 
of the other 20000 statefunded students still overseas 10000 
are studying in the united states he said 
news reports said the united states has 27000 chinese students 
10000 paying their own way and 7000 on scholarships 
some students who returned from abroad have said their skills 
and knowledge are not put to full use in china and they have 
trouble readjusting to chinas rigid political and social norms 
recent western news reports said china changed its overseas 
study policy cutting the number of students going abroad to 3000 
some reports said only 600 new students would be allowed to go 
to the united states because china was concerned that students were 
becoming too americanized and were bringing back capitalist and 
bourgeois attitudes 
it is utterly groundless to say that the numbers of students 
to be sent abroad particularly those sent to the united states 
shall be cut substantially huang said 
he said 4600 statefunded students would be sent to the united 
states this year 
but xinhua reported huang said some adjustments were made in 
chinas studyabroad program 
under the new guidelines students in applied fields of study 
are more likely to be sent overseas and more students will be sent 
to countries where there are few chinese students already studying 
china also will cut back the number of undergraduate and 
graduate students going overseas and send abroad more scholars 
engaged in advanced research huang said

police using helicopters raided 
tuesday the luxurious home of a honduran wanted on drug trafficking 
charges and then turned him over to us custody his lawyer and 
american officials said 
authorities did not give details of the predawn arrest of juan 
ramon matta 43 he has lived openly in honduras since escaping in 
1986 from a colombian prison where he was held on charges of 
involvement with the notorious medellin drug cartel 
this arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on 
illegal drug trafficking said stanley e morris director of the 
us marshals service in washington 
honduran government sources said privately that president jose 
azcona hoyo met with top civilian and security officials to discuss 
the case of matta who is wanted in the united states on drug 
charges 
the us marshals service announced in washington late tuesday 
that matta had been taken into us custody 
spokesman stephen boyle said matta was at an undisclosed 
location in us jurisdiction and would be taken to a federal 
prison in the united states before dawn wednesday 
morris said matta was placed on a commercial airliner destined 
for the united states at approximately 7 pm edt 
a us law enforcement source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said authorities also want to question him about the 
death of enrique camarena salazar a us drug enforcement 
administration agent who was kidnapped tortured and killed in 
guadalajara mexico in 1985 
the marshals service said matta is believed to have become a 
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of 
illegal drugs from mexico 
carlos lorenzana mattas lawyer said in a telephone interview 
about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at his 
clients home at 545 am 
he claimed matta as a honduran citizen could not be extradited 
to the united states because the constitution forbids it 
asked later tuesday about matta being in us custody the 
lawyer said i dont know anything yet but if matta is found in 
the united states thats a kidnapping not an extradition because 
he is a honduran and protected by the political constitution 
a source at the us embassy speaking on condition of 
anonymity said extradition was legal and our government 
maintains its position of taking matta to our country where he 
will face trial in five courts for drug trafficking 
lorenzana said matta was taken to a special police facility at 
la venta 12 miles east of the capital 
us authorities link mattas return to honduras to an increase 
in transshipment of colombian cocaine through this central american 
country 
allegations have been made of involvement by top honduran 
military officials 
the government denied the reports in february azcona said 
critics were trying to discredit the armed forces and my 
government which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug 
traffickers 
matta told the associated press in february he makes his living 
in cattle ranching construction and the tobacco spice and coffee 
trade his wealth has been estimated at up to 2 billion but he 
puts it at about 5 million 
he said the charges against him were a lie a story and 
claimed us agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap 
him 
matta said then he never again would leave honduras if i 
appear in the united states it is a kidnapping by american agents 
if i am killed it is the dea he said at the time 
it apppeared that after fleeing colombia he went to the 
dominican republic but was expelled after officials determined he 
was wanted in the united states 
the marshals service said this expulsion was based on a us 
warrant for matta after he escaped from elgin federal prison camp 
in florida in 1971 he was serving a fiveyear sentence for 
illegally entering the united states and using a fraudulent visa 
warrants charge him with escape from federal custody conspiracy 
to smuggle cocaine possession with intent to distribute coccaine 
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other charges

democrat jesse jackson narrowly lost the votes 
of wisconsins blue collar workers to michael dukakis and attracted 
only a quarter of the white vote exit polls said 
jackson drew huge crowds at strike sites and hardpressed 
manufacturing communities in wisconsin but that enthusiasm did not 
translate into primary votes dukakis beat jackson solidly among 
white blue collar workers and edged him in that category with 
blacks included abc news and nbc said 
dukakis won 41 percent of blue collar democratic voters abc 
said to jacksons 37 percent among white bluecollar voters only 
dukakis had 47 percent jackson 27 percent nbcs numbers were 
similar with 43 percent of the overall blue collar vote going for 
dukakis and 37 percent for jackson 
as in previous contests the black vote went overwhelmingly for 
jackson among whites abc and cbs said jackson won 23 percent 
support while nbc put the figure slightly higher at 28 percent 
jackson won just 7 percent of the white vote in wisconsin in 
1984 abc polls said he won 22 percent in connecticut last week and 
32 percent in liberal vermont on march 1 said abc poll analyst 
doug muzzio we may be looking at his ceiling here 
were seeing a dual electorate a black electorate and a white 
electorate muzzio said jackson does extremely well among 
blacks and dukakis does substantially well among whites 
electability may have been an issue with twothirds of all 
democrats saying they think dukakis will be the presidential 
nominee nbc news found even four in 10 jackson voters expected 
dukakis to win the nomination 
while support for dukakis was spread widely among demographic 
groups cbs news poll analyst pama mitchell said it looks to me 
from our numbers that dukakis support is softer than jacksons 
or sen albert gore jrs 
the cbstimes poll found that dukakis supporters were split 
evenly between those who backed him strongly and those who liked 
him with reservations while jacksons strong supporters far 
outnumbered his weak ones 
in another measure nbc said four in 10 dukakis supporters 
wished other candidates were in the race nonetheless more than 
six in 10 wisconsin democrats said he would be the strongest 
nominee of the current candidates 
dukakis also scored well in the goodwill category the cbstimes 
poll said 74 percent of democrats expressed a favorable view of 
dukakis with 22 percent unfavorable jackson was rated favorably 
by 55 percent and unfavorably by 40 percent 
it isnt that jackson isnt liked said kathleen a 
frankovic a cbs pollster its just that dukakis is liked 
better 
sen paul simon of illinois had the greatest unfavorable rating 
more than five in 10 and a favorable rating of about four in 10 
gore was viewed favorably by better than five in 10 but unfavorably 
by about four in 10 
the abc and the cbstimes polls found no evidence of a movement 
by republicans to cross over into the democratic primary and vote 
for jackson as the democrat most likely to lose to george bush the 
cbstimes poll found that of the 14 percent of democratic voters 
who said they were republicans 42 percent voted for dukakis 28 
percent for gore and 20 percent for jackson 
the exit polls all had a margin of sampling error of about 3 
points

la prensa nicaraguas only opposition 
newspaper suspended publication indefinitely tuesday saying the 
sandinista government had not provided newsprint 
a frontpage story said with this edition we exhaust our 
supply of paper so we will not be able to circulate as long as the 
sandinista government the only supplier doesnt sell us paper 
antisandinista rebels have charged that the government by not 
providing newsprint violated a recent promise to allow a free 
press 
tuesdays la prensa article rejected government suggestions that 
la prensa ran out of newsprint because of mismanagement of its 
limited supply saying publishers had reduced the dailys size from 
12 to 8 pages and taken other steps to conserve 
deputy publisher cristiana chamorro said earlier tuesday 
we have no paper to come out tomorrow or on the following 
days because the government claims there is no newsprint in the 
country but we know there is 
in a telephone interview she noted the countrys two other 
daily newspapers the official sandinista publication barricada and 
progovernment nuevo diario have been coming out normally with 
eight full pages barricada and nuevo diario are morning papers 
and la prensa is an afternoon daily 
the ministry of industry said in a statement it could not solve 
la prensas problem because a shipment of newsprint scheduled to 
arrive in march had not reached nicaragua it said the government 
is not expecting another shipment until april 17 
once this shipment is received the ministry of industry will 
proceed to distribute paper proportionally according to the 
established mechanisms the statement said 
it added that the government had advised the three newspapers to 
take precautions against using up their stockpiles of newsprint la 
prensa last published on april 29 then announced it would take its 
traditional holy week break 
nicaragua does not manufacture newsprint and the leftist 
government controls imports and distribution 
la prensa was shut down from june 1986 until last oct 1 
reopening as part of the governments efforts to comply with a 
regional central american peace plan 
pedro joaquin chamorro a rebel leader told a news conference 
in miami tuesday that the sandinistas should supply la prensa with 
newsprint under a ceasefire agreement reached last month by the 
rebels and government 
he is a brother of christiani chamorro and was a copublisher of 
la prensa until going into exile to join the rebels known as 
contras 
the government originally informed us that an agency of the 
interior ministry could supply us with 70 rolls enough for one 
week but at the last moment they told us the newsprint wasnt 
there anymore ms chamorro said we have taken steps to find 
out if they can provide us with paper and we will know tomorrow if 
we will be coming out after midday 
she said the government told la prensa it was expecting some 
newsprint to arrive on a soviet freighter april 17 
the soviet union and cuba provide the sandinistas with military 
equipment food and other supplies 
a letter from defense minister humberto ortega to rebel leader 
adolfo calero said it is clear that in nicaragua there exists 
total and unrestricted freedom of expression for any political 
group of sector of the population 
the problem of the lack of paper that is an editorial business 
is not the responsibility of the government

the government plans to hire undercover 
courtesy agents to root out rudeness among civil servants 
the latest twist in a 10year campaign to make singaporeans mind 
their manners will see private investigators snooping at counters 
in government buildings where the public is served 
seven research and public relations agencies have bid for a 
contract to measure courtesy in the civil service said richard 
tan deputy director of the psychological defense division of the 
ministry of communications and information 
a private company is sought for the job to ensure objectivity 
in the exercise tan told the straits times newspaper 
the courtesy audit is not a witch hunt to pinpoint 
individuals he said its purpose is to investigate causes of 
rudeness and see what can be done to correct them 
systems which dont allow people to be flexible can affect 
their behavior or cause others to think they are rude tan said 
the first part of the survey will attempt to rank government 
ministries and statutory bodies in terms of their impact on 
peopless lives 
civil servants work under constraints tan said customers 
may demand that they bypass the system and when they dont it 
comes across as rudeness the check on government workers who 
deal with the public is in addition to the annual nationwide 
courtesy drive banners and signs a courtesy hotline 
television announcements and lapel badges appear each july to drive 
the message home 
courtesy it makes life better is the slogan for 1988 
the courtesy campaign is only one of a long series of official 
efforts to raise civic consciousness in singapore unlike most of 
the others such as the antilittering and dont jaywalk drives 
the discourteous are not threatened with fines 
public concern about rudeness started in 1978 when the tourist 
promotion board urged those who dealt with visitors to be polite so 
they would spend more courtesy is our way of life was the 
original slogan 
make courtesy our way of life was adopted the following 
year when prime minister lee kuan yew got involved in national 
etiquette 
to be courteous to freespending tourists and to be rude to 
fellow singaporeans is to demean ourselves he said then we 
become a despicable people moved only by the thought of profit 
lee set 1990 as the deadline to file down the ragged corners 
of our social behavior which can grate on each other 
the year 1990 was chosen because by then more than 75 percent of 
the citystates 26 million people will be living in 
governmentbuilt apartments 
lee said neighbors would likely be lifelong ones and everone 
would have a stake in smooth relations 
courtesy campaigners confirm that much remains to be done to 
polish what is called social responsibility for public housing 
parks and toilets

benazir bhutto political foe of 
president mohammad zia ulhaq is still queen of pakistans 
political opposition but she reigns over a party in disarray 
the pakistan peoples party ppp which she inherited from her 
late father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto has been racked in 
recent months by political infighting an ideological shift and a 
poor showing in local elections 
nevertheless ms bhutto says she is determined to pull her 
grassroots movement back together for national elections scheduled 
for 1990 in which she could face zia headon zia has indicated he 
will run 
millions turned out in april 1986 when ms bhutto now 34 
returned from two years of voluntary exile in london the adoring 
masses likened her to the philippines corazon aquino who would 
ride to office on a wave of people power 
two years later however ms bhuttos critics say her policies 
are hard to discern from those of the zia government they call her 
leadership autocratic her lifestyle patrician and claim her 
overtures toward the united states run counter to the ppps 
traditions 
zia overthrew her father in a 1977 military coup bhutto later 
was convicted of complicity in the killing of a political opponent 
and he was hanged in 1979 
zia an army general and chief of the army staff ruled by 
martial law until the end of 1985 when a civilian government was 
voted into office in an election that barred political parties zia 
retained the presidency 
since then zia and his prime minister mohammad khan junejo 
have restored a number of fundamental civil rights and lifted most 
censorship of the press 
in an interview with the associated press ms bhutto attributed 
the recent criticism of her to the government 
in the first years of overmilitary rule the name of the 
bhutto family was not allowed to appear in the press she said 
the new target since the last two years is to flood 
newspapers with stories on benazir and flood them with distorted 
stories attacking my capabilities attacking my leadership 
but many of her critics are current and former ppp members 
ms bhutto is a complete mistress unto herself seldom 
considering it necessary to consult the partys central committee 
on major issues wrote ppp member ayaz amir in the herald a 
pakistani magazine 
the critics say the ppp is still a party of the bhutto family 
built around the charisma of zulfikar ali bhutto and perpetuated by 
what followers view as his martyrdom 
ms bhutto takes more seriously the criticism of her changing 
policies especially her proamericanism and her shift away from 
her fathers socialist ideals 
pakistan is in a period of transition she said we dont 
have a direct military rule we have an indirect military rule or 
we have the iron fist in the velvet glove in this new situation 
the party and the party workers must also make the mental 
transition and the necessary adjustments that come from conforming 
to the new circumstances 
she said her warming toward the united states which she once 
accused of helping cause her fathers downfall is a pragmatic 
recognition of washingtons role in the region 
it is a country that gives tremendous economic and military 
aid to pakistan one cannot ignore that reality 
along with the united states and zias government her party 
supports the moslem resistance against the sovietbacked government 
in neighboring afghanistan 
as for her economic policies which are described as moderate 
ms bhutto said she has deviated no more from the ppps founding 
principles than her father did 
this is nothing new they the left wing would like to 
transform the ppp which is a populist socialdemocratic party in 
the moslem context into a marxist party she said we may not 
agree but we respect them for having their views and expect them 
to respect our views 
upon her triumphal return to pakistan in 1986 ms bhutto called 
for elections within months but the demand was not met she then 
called for mass protests on july 5 of that year the anniversary of 
zias coup and the turnout was far less than expected 
the following month she and 400 opposition leaders were 
arrested for defying a government ban on rallies 
she was released but her problems were compounded this past 
november when her party won only 20 percent of some 75000 seats at 
stake in local elections 
although candidates officially were banned from declaring their 
party affiliations in the election those of junejos pakistan 
muslim league campaigned openly 
the deafeat led to a series of firings and resignations within 
the ppp 
in december ms bhutto was back in the limelight with her 
muchpublicized marriage arranged in the islamic tradition to a 
karachi businessman this year she has been making a series of 
barnstorming trips into the pakistani hinterlands 
she also has managed to rally her party around a new cause the 
fate of about 400 pakistanis still in prison for violations of 
martial law in 197785 
although prime minister junejo has promised to review some of 
the cases a constitutional amendment at the time of the 
restoration of civilian rule blocks the judicial review of 
decisions made during martial law

be thankful for the low spots and the dull 
narration in family reunion a gospel music celebration 
without the low points the voltage from this musical blowout 
might leave viewers writhing on the floor television sets might 
explode and fires break out across the land 
family reunion appearing saturday on the cbn cable network 
offers two hours of hits from some of the biggest names in gospel 
music including the rev james cleveland the clark sisters 
andrae crouch sandra crouch jessy dixon edwin hawkins thelma 
houston billy preston bebe and cece winans and the mighty clouds 
of joy 
whats wrong with the packaging can be summed up in two words 
dick clark 
the ageless recordspinner planted beside a fireplace has 
little to say about the history or the meaning of gospel music his 
role seems to be to assure the uninitiated that its ok to listen 
because the beatles did too 
he might have said more about the history of gospel because a 
lot is implied by the songs and the singers precious lord 
sung here by della reese was written in 1931 by thomas a dorsey 
the man who invented gospel 
cleveland was a boy soprano in dorseys choir at the pilgrim 
baptist church in chicago in the 1960s as the crown prince of 
gospel cleveland worked with such young people as billy preston 
jessy dixon and aretha franklin 
dixon hits one of the programs high points with a bluesy 
rendition of professor alex bradfords im too close to heaven 
and i cant turn around 
cleveland whose growling voice and dabbing handkerchief recall 
louis armstrong comes up next and steals the show with peace be 
still 
the song was a huge hit in gospel terms selling 800000 albums 
in the 1960s its a dramatic piece in which cleveland sweats 
shouts sings and preaches turning down the volume with a 
peremptory shhh and then building to another plateau 
family reunion covers some of the same territory covered 
last year with paul simon in the cinemax special everybody say 
yeah andrae crouch jennifer holliday the hawkins singers and 
the mighty clouds of joy appeared on both shows 
theres even the same quotation from james baldwin there is 
no music like that music which if you think about it applies 
to lawrence welk and a lot of other styles too but you get the 
point 
high follows high sometiomes in unexpected places hawkins 
familiar hit oh happy day is given some needed rough edges by 
the fiery strutting solo work of thelma houston 
tramaine hawkins wife of edwins brother walter lights up 
the place with changed 
finally the crouch who wrecks the house isnt andrae but his 
sister sandra this regal lady a hardworking choir director 
through much of the show takes the solo part as she whips a 
quartet and chorus through a rousing performance of hes worthy 
amid all the stars the shows last high point is hit by an 
unidentified young woman who steps out of the choir in hes 
worthy and shes ready 
not only has she picked up a couple of microphone moves from joe 
ligon of the mighty clouds but she has a huge voice that lifts the 
roof it bodes well for the future of gospel

susan and ted blew are having fun 
these days growing vegetables on their 160acre farm making some 
money and raising three children in wide open spaces only 45 
minutes from the smokestacks of industrial newark 
things werent always so good 
for five years they struggled saddled with a sixfigure 
mortgage and a floating interest rate that reached 16 percent 
theirs was a catch22 situation to make more money to pay the 
mortgage the blews rented 1000 more acres and grew wholesale 
grain they considered it drudgery and worse the new loans only 
added to their debt 
then about two years ago they found a way to pay off their 
mortgage keep their hunterdon county farm for their children and 
make money growing what they wanted they sold development rights 
to their land to the state of new jersey as part of a farm land 
preservation program 
more and more state and local governments are giving top 
priority and tens of millions of dollars to farm land 
preservation programs efforts to save rapidly vanishing open space 
from developers the trend is spreading from the northeast where 
it started to the south and west 
the government assesses the lands value for farming and 
compares that to its higher worth for housing or commercial use 
such as a mall the farmer is offered the difference in dollars in 
return for an agreement that the land can never be sold for 
development the farmer keeps the property and can still sell it 
but its deed will be restricted to farming or open space use 
the blews received almost 900 an acre or 143500 from the 
state and county which split the cost that same day dec 19 
1985 they turned the check over to the bank paying off their 
mortgage on which they had been making payments of close to 
10000 every six months and an outstanding business loan 
we had 10 left to go to lunch ted said they celebrated 
at a ponderosa restaurant with steaks and chocolate milk it came 
to 1012 said susan smiling 
the blews can afford to smile now the pressure is off 
it relieved the pressure of that exploding interest rate 
ted said you enjoy working when youre making some money when 
youre able to pay your bills and have something left over 
new jerseys share of the money came from a 50 million bond 
issue voters approved in 1981 
other states with similar farm land and open space preservation 
programs include connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new 
hampshire pennsylvania rhode island and vermont 
local programs exist in boulder county colo forsyth and 
mecklenburg counties in north carolina whose respective seats are 
winstonsalem and charlotte king county wash around seattle 
and northern californias marin and solano counties in collin 
county texas north of dallas officials are trying to raise funds 
for land preservation 
over the last decade almost 100000 acres of working farm land 
have been saved said jim riggle director of field operations for 
american farmland trust in washington dc a nonprofit 
organization that works to conserve agriculture 
the success of preservation programs however doesnt mean 
development is being slowed 
riggle estimated that since world war ii some 70 million to 100 
million acres of us agricultural land has been converted to 
commercial or residential use or has been used for highway or 
other public works projects that leaves no more than 12 billion 
acres of privately owned open land nationwide of which 575 million 
are being farmed or have a high potential for farming while the 
rest remains unused for crops because of its lesser quality 
roughly 3 million acres of farm land are being lost every year 
he said 
six out of 10 of the most productive agricultural counties are 
either already classified in metropolitan areas or adjacent to 
them he said thats where the action is taking place there 
is a general degrading of the quality of our land in this country 
development pressure in massachusetts remains strong even though 
the state has already spent 45 million to buy up rights and 
preserve nearly 20000 acres the legislature last december 
approved an additional 35 million for the program 
why youre preserving the economic fabric of the rural area 
it has an additional benefit its a working landscape replied 
august schumacher jr massachusetts commissioner of food and 
agriculture 
ron allbee vermonts commissioner of agriculture agreed 
we sell vermont to tourists for the pristine open space for 
the small villages allbee said i think theres a broader 
concern if we lose our agriculture were going to lose what 
people identify as vermont 
even in big cities such as philadelphia voters are 
overwhelmingly approving bond issues to buy up the rights there 
are many reasons 
in pennsylvania which is just beginning its program after 
voters approved a 100 million bond issue in november agriculture 
is the no 1 industry 
pennsylvania has 56500 farms that produce crops worth 32 
billion a year and generate 35 billion in related business but 
since 1960 the state has lost 50000 farms and 38 million acres 
of land that went out of production most of it believed to be for 
development 
along with economics sentiment helped the propreservation 
forces state sen noah w wenger said 
even people that live in the cities can remember their 
grandfather or their uncle living on a farm he said and they 
have a certain affinity to that and i think that was in its favor 
but even more wenger said was the realization that about 20 
percent of all the jobs in the state are related to agriculture 
its just good business sense to take care of your no 1 
industry he said you would spend 100 million to keep a basic 
industry intact so that that industry can continue to pay taxes and 
provide jobs so that we will have funds available to support our 
social programs our research programs 
other referendums approved last november included a 652 
million bond issue to help preserve open space in rhode island 
and new jersey voters in their second referendum on the issue 
in six years overwhelmingly approved raising the states share for 
farm development buyouts to 80 percent making it easier for 
counties with limited funds to become partners

arthur r brown jr secretary of the new jersey department of 
agriculture considers farm land preservation his top priority 
since such land in new jersey has dropped from 2 million acres to 
850000 acres in the past 20 years 
were protecting a nonrenewable resource which is land he 
said the citizens of new jersey are behind keeping 
agriculture here in the garden state and theyre willing to pay 
for it 
the trend toward preservation of farm land appears to be gaining 
priority beyond the northeast the idea has begun to catch on 
said american farmlands riggle 
californians will vote june 7 on a referendum for 776 million 
to preserve open space including farm land greenbelts and parks 
the bond issue is the first in 74 years to be placed on the ballot 
by voter petition rather than by the legislature underscoring the 
growing enthusiasm 
in florida a state law requires every county to develop within 
the year a program to limit incursion into rural areas more than 
90 percent of all open land outside urban areas in florida is farm 
land 
people are beginning to recognize the finite resource that we 
have said ralph grossi president of american farmland good 
farm land is worth protecting in many communities it is the buffer 
zone between the next city the open space people like to drive 
to 
riggle said the preservation programs are concentrated in the 
northeast because it is the oldest settled region and the states 
are small and often mountainous limiting the amount of arable 
land 
the northeast states have had to confront the issue of urban 
growth and development versus open land resources sooner than the 
rest of the country he said 
david meade is one of the northeasts concerned farmers he sold 
the development rights to 70 acres of his farm land in howell 
township nj near freehold to the state for about a half 
million dollars last september developers had offered him more 
than a million 
i would only have to take that money and go out and buy 
another one farming isnt an occupation its a way of life he 
said its not necessarily something you get into with the idea 
of getting rich its something you get into because its a matter 
of the heart

stanley barons argument for preserving 
farm land is right outside his picture window which frames a view 
of sheep grazing on alfalfa hay under ash and hemlock trees 
i cant think of any explanation better than asking you to 
look out that window baron told a visitor to his sheep farm 40 
minutes from new york city if you could preserve something like 
that wouldnt you do so 
baron has been a leader in saving farm land and yet he 
illustrates a dilemma posed by new programs compensating farmers 
who agree to deed restrictions that keep their lands forever 
undeveloped 
last october he sold to the state of new jersey the development 
rights to a second farm he owns an 85acre site in nearby neshanic 
on which he grows alfalfa to feed his sheep 
but he doesnt plan to sell the state the development rights to 
the 86acre sheep farm in whitehouse when he dies he said his 
five children can decide 
my heirs dont think highly of the program he said theyd 
rather see the land unencumbered so they can do with it whatever 
they like after i die theyve never said that i should only 
say that my heirs have different circumstances one of my heirs has 
two children hes out earning a living and he says hey 
whats going on why give it to the state you can sell it 
differently 
under new jerseys farm land preservation program the farmer is 
paid the difference between the assessed value of the land for farm 
production and its worth for development into housing or commercial 
use the state and counties share the cost 
baron stumbled into farming as a second career at age 50 he had 
owned a paper bag manufacturing plant in new jersey but lived in 
new york and became fed up with the traffic jams on his commute 
one day while driving with his wife nancy he made a wrong turn 
and ended up in the farm land of hunterdon county 
i said why dont we find a place right here she went out 
and shopped and then found this place this had been a dairy farm 
before we took over it was empty of equipment and empty of 
animals i was wondering what we were going to do to keep the grass 
down nancy said sheep i can handle sheep theyre small enough 
for me 
they moved to the whitehouse farm in 1970 baron sold his paper 
business in 1979 and became a fulltime farmer now with a herd of 
1000 
i love it he said i tell you the best years of my 
life

nebraskas longrunning dispute over a 
constitutional amendment created to protect family farmers has just 
two points of agreement its the toughest corporate farm 
restriction in the nation and the fights far from over 
each side claims to be working in the best interest of nebraska 
and its farmers 
the question according to a leading supporter marty strange 
is whether nebraskas ag future will develop on its family farm 
base whether farms in the future will be owned and operated by 
people who live on them and are part of the community that those 
farms are the economic base of 
john decamp a lobbyist and former state senator is an 
outspoken opponent 
its a handicap to normal business and commerce as conducted 
in the the united states he said a corporation is a 
normal tool for doing business just like a combine is a normal 
tool for processing and harvesting corn 
the battle over what became initiative 300 began in the early 
1970s as irrigation development and corporate interest in 
agriculture burgeoned 
the dispute peaked when corporate farming foes frustrated by 
years of legislative inaction gathered enough signatures to place 
a constitutional amendment on the 1982 general election ballot 
the amendment ran about 1100 words but its basic provisions 
were 
nonfamily farm corporations with a few exceptions cannot 
own agricultural land or engage in farming and cannot own or feed 
livestock except for livestock purchased for slaughter and a few 
other kinds 
the majority of voting stock in family farm and ranch 
corporations must be held by family members at least one of whom 
must live on the farm or be actively engaged in the daily labor and 
management 
individuals and groups can seek enforcement if the secretary 
of state or attorney general fails to enforce the amendment 
an emotional campaign preceded the vote opponents said the 
proposal would paralyze economic growth and stifle competition 
supporters argued that corporate farming threatened rural economic 
and social foundations 
voters approved the amendment 290377 to 224555 but the issue 
remained unsettled 
legislators have tried unsuccessfully to pass laws clarifying 
the amendment and to get voters to abolish it 
a court challenge ended when the nebraska supreme court ruled 
the amendment constitutional however opponents say the court test 
was decided on too narrow a question of law and talk of staging 
another petition drive to return the issue to the ballot 
strange senior associate for the center for rural affairs in 
walthill contends the amendment has done exactly what it was 
designed to do protect family farmers from unfair corporate 
competition 
it is the nations only truly effective family farm 
legislation because it is in the state constitution and restricts 
corporate farming activities as well as land ownership he said 
opponents argue that initiative 300 restricts business scares 
many companies away from investing in nebraska prevents farmers 
from selling land to whomever they choose and affords protections 
that are unfair unnecessary and unrealistic 
the only way that family farms will be saved is 
economically said state sen dennis baack a vocal foe who farms 
about 2000 acres and raises wheat and sunflowers we need prices 
for our products those are the kind of things that will save 
family farms its not going to be words in our constitution 
another state senator ernie chambers said initiative 300 
hasnt been on the books long enough to assess whether it is 
restricting business or helping farmers 
the people are the ones who put it there and they did it 
because the legislature chose not to act said chambers who 
favors the measure 
a us district court case filed earlier this year by 
opponents is the first federal test of the amendment a hearing is 
scheduled april 18 
the federal lawsuit filed by sunrise ventures inc a custom 
cattlefeeding operation seeks to stop attorney general robert 
spire from enforcing initiative 300 on the grounds it violates the 
commerce equal protection and due process clauses of the us 
constitution 
sunrise may be in violation of the amendments prohibitions on 
ownership of livestock spire said but the company appears to be 
exempt under a provision that allows ownership of animals 
purchased for slaughter on that ground spire has asked that 
sunrises suit be dismissed 
amendment opponents hailed spires action as a kind of 
concession and a victory decamp and baack said it opened up the 
issue because all cattle ultimately are slaughtered there are 
very few cattle in my district that live to be retired baack 
said 
strange called spires action irresponsible but said it 
doesnt affect the foundation of the family farm amendment at all 
decamp agreed the dispute isnt over if the sunrise case is 
dismissed opponents will challenge the issues of land ownership 
and engaging in farming he said 
this is just the beginning he said im sure the next 
stage wont be so easy

more than one farmer having trouble keeping ahead of his bills 
has called on amaranth arrowroot cipolines daikon and manzano 
theyre not bankruptcy lawyers theyre exotic vegetables 
fruits and seeds 
these and others from fava beans to purple potatoes are being 
grown by gourmet farmers to meet an increasing demand for 
specialty foods in some cases they are more profitable than 
conventional crops 
frieda caplan owner of friedas finest produce specialties 
inc a los angelesbased company that markets unusual fruits and 
vegetables to stores nationwide said her sales had increased by 
nearly 20 percent a year for the last four years to 15 million 
currently 
there has been an explosion in unusual foods she said 
one reason is the increased interest in health markets are 
allocating more space to fresh produce smart retailers are putting 
in a great deal of variety they want the consumer to know they 
have everything they want 
some farmers she said are getting into specialty crops because 
they are not making a living on the big conventional crops like 
wheat alfalfa and cotton 
theyre looking to find more profitable items to be grown 
she said theyre beginning to learn that bigness does not 
necessarily mean profitability sometimes you make more by growing 
less 
george b holcomb an official with the us department of 
agriculture said people today have higher living standards and 
want more variety in their food 
he said there is a growing demand for ethnic vegetables in most 
of the larger cities exotic foods are being brought to this 
country by immigrants from the pacific basin africa latin 
america the caribbean and europe 
this is not to say that kansas wont be corny in august anymore 
after democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
suggested crop diversification and mentioned potentially lucrative 
belgian endive a farmers group the american agriculture movement 
surveyed 800 people around the country and found twothirds had 
never heard of it 
so some definitions 
amaranth is a seed with a mild nutty flavor that can be ground 
into flour popped like popcorn or sprinkled on cereals and ice 
cream 
arrowroot is a chinese potato 
cipolines are baby round onions 
daikon is a giant white oriental radish 
a manzano is a small banana 
fava beans come in large pods and are tastier than lima beans 
and purple potatoes cook them and they just get purpler

aided by the stronger yen sales of usbuilt 
motor vehicles in japan are expected to triple this year but still 
will hold only a marginal share of the worlds secondlargest auto 
market 
sales of usbuilt cars could reach 12000 this year out of a 
6 millionvehicle market that includes minitrucks and minicars 
but us automakers should not be overjoyed at such growth 
because much of it will come from japanese automakers who export 
their usbuilt cars to japan says kunihiko ono an official at 
the japan automobile importers association 
ono said the impetus for the surge would not come from the big 
three us automakers chrysler corp ford motor co and general 
motors corp but from imports of the honda accord designed by the 
whollyowned us subsidiary of japans honda motor co and 
assembled at its plant in marysville ohio 
the expected surge in us motor vehicle sales underscores the 
efforts made by the governments of the united states japan 
britain france and west germany since september 1985 to reduce 
trade imbalances by driving down the value of the dollar and 
improving the export competitiveness of us manufacturing industry 
ono also said foreign car makers should be more encouraged to 
export to japan because of the governments recent move to remove 
tariffs on imported cars and relax elaborate import inspection 
procedures 
but japanese government and industry officials criticize the 
us big three automakers for failing to capitalize on the dollars 
decline which should make us autos more competitive against 
local models 
recent japanese import statistics indicate only the west germans 
have been able to seize on a growing japanese consumer preference 
toward luxury cars fueled by the stronger buying power stemming 
from the rising yen 
of the 97750 foreign motor vehicles sold here last year only 
4006 or 41 percent were us made west german makers accounted 
for sales of 74289 units or 76 percent 
analysts say sales of usmade motor vehicles in japan have 
been less than impressive since peaking at 16739 vehicles in 1979 
this week honda will become the first japanese automaker to 
import its usmade cars when 540 accords are unloaded from a 
usflagged ship at narashino port near tokyo 
mazda motor co a ford affiliate has announced that this 
summar it will begin sales of the 22 literengined ford probe 
built at mazdas new plant in flat rock michigan a mazda 
spokesman noboru hosoya says his company is hoping to handle 
3000 to 4000 probes annually in the future after selling 800 
units this year 
many observers see the big threes problems as stemming from a 
lack of commitment to japan not necessarily from current japanese 
business conditions 
honda executive vice president koichiro yoshizawa said that 
even accounting for export costs it should cost as much to build 
cars in the united states as it does in japan as long as the dollar 
remains near current levels 
takamori matsuda a vice president at prudentialbache 
securities japan ltd says detroit is suffering from an image 
problem as evidenced by deeprooted japanese consumer distrust 
toward the big threes overall product quality as well as by 
commonly held views about poor aftersales servicing bad fuel 
economy and high sticker prices 
other factors include the unsubstantiated association between 
their cars and japans underworld the yakuza gangsters the 
yakuzas are said to prefer driving large luxurious usmade cars 
ono reports that parking lots in western japanese cities where 
certain powerful yakuza clans are based refuse to admit foreign 
cars including volkswagens claiming they are a cause of trouble 
to increase its market share in japan an official at a leading 
japanese automaker argues detroit should adopt a longterm 
commitment that can withstand shortterm losses 
if they want a bigger slice of the market theyd have to 
first create japanese sales subsidiaries and set up decent 
distribution channels and reduce their reliance on smallscale 
importers and second market righthand drive cars he said 
analysts see recent moves by gm and ford to team up with mazda 
and suzuki motor co respectively as a step in the right 
direction 
one of mazdas two dealer networks early this year added the 
ford taurus to its product lineup and expects to sell 1000 cars 
this year 
gms joint operations with suzuki which is 5 percent controlled 
by the us automaker will market two gm subcompacts starting in 
april or may suzuki officials hope to sell 500 cars the first 
year and to boost sales to 3000 units annually in three years

fw woolworth co faced with the prospect of 
becoming dart group corps latest takeover target is shoring up 
its defenses 
woolworth said monday that a partnership controlled by dart 
chairman herbert haft who is fresh from an unsuccessful raid 
against stop amp shop cos had disclosed it planned to acquire 15 
million or more of the retailers stock 
the nations 13th largest retailer which built its reputation 
running a national chain of fiveanddime stores before expanding 
into specialty retailing said its board approved a poison pill 
takeover defense after darts disclosure 
woolworth issued a statement that its board adopted the defense 
to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics 
wall street indicated it expected the hafts to make a bid soon 
for woolworth the retailers stock shot up 887 to 5412 in 
new york stock exchange composite trading 
based on mondays closing stock price and the companys roughly 
657 million common shares outstanding woolworth had a market 
value of about 36 billion 
less than a month ago dart terminated a 103 billion bid for 
bostonbased stop amp shop after its target agreed to a leveraged 
buyout by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
landover mdbased dart owns and operates trak auto inc and 
crown books corp 
the hafts repeatedly have said they were serious about buying 
and operating a retailer but doubts linger about their actual 
intentions darts string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover 
moves against such retailers as dayton hudson corp supermarkets 
general corp and safeway stores inc in recent years has given 
haft and his son dart president robert haft reputations as 
corporate raiders 
dart has made millions of dollars from its takeover forays by 
acquiring stock and later either selling it back to the target 
company or to another suitor 
robert haft was not available when a reporter called for comment 
monday 
a source close to dart confirmed the partnership had disclosed 
in a march 18 filing with the federal government of its intentions 
to acquire a woolworth stake the source declined to say whether a 
takeover bid was in the offing 
joseph carroll a woolworth spokesman declined to comment when 
asked what steps the company might take if and when the hafts make 
a takeover bid 
woolworths poison pill would make a hostile takeover more 
expensive by allowing the companys shareholders to buy its stock 
at a steep discount it becomes effective when an investor acquires 
20 percent of woolworths stock on the commencement of a tender 
offer for 30 percent or more of the retailers shares or when a 
hostile bidder acquires at least 15 percent of the companys stock 
edward johnson a retail industry analyst with prescott ball amp 
turben inc said that if faced by a hostile buyout attempt 
woolworth might consider going private under a leveraged buyout 
other options open to the retailer include acquiring another 
company itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders 
johnson said woolworths low stock price and the companys 
lowrental properties and successful specialty store formats make 
it an attractive target woolworth founded 109 years ago by frank 
w woolworth as a fiveanddime store has grown to an empire of 
more than 6300 general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide 
in recent years the company has shifted its focus from its 
wellknown woolworth stores to its specialty operations which 
include kinney shoe stores and foot locker and lady foot locker 
athletic footwear stores 
for the fiscal year ended jan 30 woolworth earned 251 million 
on sales of 714 billion

japan will attempt to widen foreign access to its 
agricultural market while also securing basic domestic food 
supplies the government affirmed today in approving its annual 
policy statement on agriculture 
but a senior official said the rise in food imports will be kept 
slow despite increased us pressure on japan to open up its 
agricultural market 
negotiations between us and japanese officials on access to 
local markets broke down last week after japan refused to terminate 
stringent import quotas for beef and citrus fruits 
an earlier fouryear agreement on us food imports expired 
march 30 japan has maintained it only will increase its quota 
figures while the united states has demanded total liberalization 
us officials say they will petition the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade an international forum that oversees trade rules 
agreed upon by member nations this week to convene a panel and 
have the quota system deemed illegal under international trading 
rules 
soshichiro nakagawa director of the research division of the 
ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries said japan could 
not drop all food import quotas without causing widespread 
disruption but he said the government expects to decrease its 
present beef selfsufficiency rate of 70 percent to between 55 and 
60 percent by 1995 
because domestic beef supplies are growing slowly most of the 
increasing demand for beef must be accounted for by imports 
nakagawa said 
we will try to open our markets and improve access but at the 
same time try to strengthen the structure and constitution of the 
competitiveness of the japanese agricultural industry nakagawa 
told reporters at a briefing on the agricultural white paper or 
policy document 
while less than 10 percent of japans population is engaged in 
farming farmers provide a strong backbone for the ruling liberal 
democratic party attempts to open up any section of the 
agricultural market traditionally have met with strong resistance 
the white paper said the governments first major task in coming 
years will be to establish a selfsupporting highly productive 
agricultural industry 
we are not saying that there should be selfsufficiency in 
food at any or all costs nakagawa said but the first priority 
or task is to make sure that there is a stable supply of food 
the director said government will combine domestic production 
with an appropriate level of imports from overseas so thatfood 
supply will be secured on a stable basis 
nakagawa also said the government will reduce its price supports 
for some products such as eggs because of the intense price war 
that has sprung up between domestic and foreign foods because of 
the sharp appreciation of the yen against the us dollar since 
september 1985 
but he added the yens upward swing would have slow impact on 
products from landbased farming such as rice 
therefore some price gap between domestic and imported foods 
would have to remain and we must gain the understanding and 
convince the public that the gap is inevitable nakagawa said 
and to the extent that some gaps remain some protective measures 
will have to be kept in place for such commodities as rice and 
beef 
nakagawa declined to comment on how japan would react if gatt 
ruled against the import quotas that are under fire from the united 
states the trade body ordered japan in february to lift import 
curbs on 10 types of farm products to get into line with 
international rules following a 1987 probe sparked by an american 
complaint 
while japan accepted the ruling on eight of the products it 
refused to lift curbs on starch and dairy products and to date has 
not stated any clear measures on eliminating the import barriers on 
the eight products which include tomato ketchup glucose and 
caramel 
but nakagawa said japan was obligated to implement the findings 
of the report and will have to work with the united states to map 
out the specifics and substance of what should be done

mexico was the cheapest country last year and 
norway the most expensive for us employers who measure labor 
costs in dollars according to figures compiled by the us labor 
department 
in dollar terms costs in mexico were 137 an hour in 1987 
compared with 149 in 1986 and a us average of 1346 wages 
more than doubled when measured in mexican pesos but the pesos 
foreign exchange value fell so quickly that labor costs in dollars 
actually declined 
norways average hourly compensation totaled 11852 kroner or 
about 1758 
the figures released monday take into account of the drop in the 
value of the dollar changes in local pay rates the cost of social 
insurance and other benefits the calculations do not include the 
relative efficiency of workers in different countries 
wages and other benefits for workers rose in terms of brazilian 
cruzados but in dollar terms there was a decline to 149 from 
160 an hour because of the low value of the cruzado against the 
dollar 
brazil and mexico are the third worlds two biggest debtors 
which tends to depress the foreign exchange value of their 
currencies they were the only two nations where dollardenominated 
labor costs dropped last year 
low wage rates in developing countries are considered a key 
competitive advantage for those nations in exporting goods to the 
united states 
labor in the newlyindustrialized countries of asia and latin 
america remained less than a fifth as costly as in the united 
states costs in asias four tigers hong kong south korea 
singapore and taiwan rose by only 1 to 4 percentage points 
relative to those in the united states 
of 22 countries eight had costs higher than the 1346 us 
hourly average 
they were in addition to norway switzerland 2546 swiss 
francs or 1706 west germany 3026 marks or 1683 sweden 
9607 krona or 1514 netherlands 3061 guilders or 1511 
belgium 56337 belgian francs or 1508 and denmark 9920 
kroner or l449 
all 23 countries for which the labor department had statistics 
including the united states showed higher labor costs in terms of 
their own currency 
japans relative cost level in 1987 of 84 percent greatly 
exceeded the previous peak of 72 percent reached in 1986 said 
the report from the bureau of labor statistics 
the increase in japans labor costs was due largely to the rise 
of the yen against the dollar that also was the reason for most of 
the rise in european costs although they also were affected by 
declines in working hours by norway and denmark the report stated

american companies soon will have access 
to a new computer database offering information about millions of 
products made by their foreign competitors according to the head 
of the university of tennessee project 
it is the only one of its kind in the country david faulds 
assistant professor of international marketing said monday its 
kind of surprising given the emphasis on product quality now 
the international product quality database uses various consumer 
reports to come up with product quality rankings from on an item 
and on up to 48 specific product features said faulds it also has 
marketing information on the products he said 
were still compiling entries and trying to develop 
offcampus computer capabilityso us companies can tap into 
this by phone faulds said 
c warren neel dean of the universitys college of business 
where the database was created said the computer bank would give 
us manufacturers an edge in knowing the strengths and weaknesses 
of their international competition thereby helping them improve 
their own positions in the marketplace 
so far the database has nearly a million brand names and 
rankings on products sold in australia belgium canada denmark 
france west germany great britain japan the netherlands new 
zealand norway sweden switzerland and the united states 
faulds said the database should be available to american 
companies in less than two years but the university had not 
decided whether to let foreign businesses have access 
were kind of debating that right now he said there is a 
political side 
faulds said he has spent five years collecting the product 
quality rankings and comments by such groups as automobile testers 
government bureaus engineering associations independent and 
consumer product testing groups

chrysler corp workers anxious to receive the 
same benefits that general motors corp and ford motor co workers 
received in new contracts last fall are preparing contract demands 
for talks beginning april 18 
members of the united auto workers unions 140member national 
chrysler council were to begin arriving in kansas city mo today 
for a meeting with national uaw leaders and elected union 
bargainers 
by friday the council planned to have discussed and approved 
demands that will guide how the industry pattern contract 
established at the two larger companies can be installed at the 
smallest big three automaker 
the chrysler contract covering 59500 active and 8000 laidoff 
workers expires sept 14 talks are scheduled to begin april 18 
instead of midjuly as usual 
the two sides agreed to early talks to stem damage inflicted by 
friction over chryslers closing of an assembly plant in kenosha 
wis and the abortive sale of its 28000worker acustar inc parts 
subsidiary 
chrysler was stunned by the speed and severity of the unions 
opposition to the proposed acustar sale angry workers at locals 
across the nation began preparing strike packages lists of 
grievances over locally strikeable issues and stopped cooperating 
in crucial managementunion programs aimed at improving quality and 
production efficiency 
uaw vice president marc stepp who will lead negotiations with 
chrysler told workers at the time that he would give local unions 
with grievances permission to strike immediately 
a few strikes at key assembly and parts plants could have 
crippled chrysler as quickly as a national strike 
chrysler quickly backed down from the proposed sale in early 
march and agreed to early contract talks a request it had refused 
last fall after the union wrapped up contracts at ford and gm 
negotiators on both sides are limited to working within the 
pattern contract which forbids layoffs except during declining 
sales of a particular product and requires automakers to continue 
paying workers whose jobs are lost to productivity improvements 
new technology or transfer of work to outside suppliers 
the pattern contract also includes joint sixmonth 
plantbyplant studies that will examine ways to strengthen 
operations and keep work inside each company the uaw hopes the 
studies will make it harder for automakers to pit plant against 
plant in competition for a shrinking number of jobs 
the uaw is expected to seek a twoyear contract instead of the 
usual threeyear pact so that its contracts with all big three 
makers will expire together in 1990 
the union also will seek more representation on the chrysler 
board of directors uaw president owen bieber has a board seat but 
the union believes holding more seats will give it more control 
over chrysler decisions 
bargainers will work against an artificial target deadline 
instead of a strike deadline so chrysler faces no risk of a 
companywide strike if talks fail industry analysts expect a quick 
settlement 
but a failure at the table would sour relations and make talks 
more difficult when the two sides were forced to resume bargaining 
in the summer

the day to close at 12 a share on the new york stock exchange 
the offers will be studied by a special committee of directors 
which was to be created at a scheduled board meeting today 
we have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters 
said lee rich mgmuas chairman and chief executive 
rich declined to identify the suitors but analysts suggested 
kerkorian who owns 79 percent of the companys 501 million 
shares may be seeking to take mgmua private 
other possible suitors they said are investors marvin davis 
and burt sugarman whose separate bids for other companies are 
stalled and considered unlikely to succeed davis had no comment a 
spokesman said and sugarman was traveling and unavailable for 
comment 
the company said it announced the proposals when the new york 
stock exchange expressed concern over an unusual increase in 
trading of the companys stock 
kerkorian had been majority owner of the old metrogoldwynmayer 
and united artists studios then sold them in 1986 to media 
entrepreneur ted turner for 15 billion plus assumption of some of 
its debt as part of that deal kerkorian immediately bought back 
the ua segment 
later turner sold off all of the mgm unit except its film 
library which he retained for use on his atlantabased 
superstation wtbs kerkorian purchased the studio and lorimar 
telepictures corp bought some other assets 
kerkorian paid a total of 730 million to buy back the two 
segments 
the new mgmua has had spotty success 
its recent film moonstruck is a boxoffice hit and has been 
nominated for six academy awards 
its new film bright lights big city starring michael fox 
ranked third in boxoffice gross for its debut weekend ticket 
sales still were being tallied last year the company scored a hit 
with the james bond thriller the living daylights 
but mgmua also has had boxoffice flops including its 
critically acclaimed but poorly attended masquerade as well as 
fatal beauty real men and dead of winter 
for its first quarter ended nov 30 earnings dropped 19 percent 
to 21 million from 26 million although revenue rose 39 percent 
to 182 million from 131 million 
the company cited continuing high startup costs as well as an 
unspecified writedown on the film real men

million on revenue of 4276 million 
davis who has been seeking to get back into the entertainment 
business since selling 20th century fox film corp three years ago

us auto importers have issued a study 
attempting to refute a big three review that found japanese 
automakers were dumping compact pickup trucks on the us market 
the importers study found japanese automakers continued earning 
profits averaging 1000 per vehicle sold in the united states 
compared with the 100125 profit on each vehicle they sold in 
japan 
japanese companies were earning an average 2000 per vehicle 
sold here when the yen began appreciating against the dollar in 
1985 leaving a cushion that let them raise prices by less than the 
yen had appreciated while preserving profits the study indicated 
the study was prepared by icf inc a fairfax va research 
firm for automobile importers of america in anticipation of a 
motor vehicle manufacturers association study released last week 
the import associations members include toyota motor corp 
honda motor co mazda motor corp mitsubishi motors corp nissan 
motor co ltd isuzu motor co ltd and suzuki motor co ltd 
the mvma study prepared on behalf of general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp was conducted by a washington law 
firm and found that japanese makers were charging 10 percent to 48 
percent less at the factory for small pickups destined for the us 
market than for the same vehicles destined for their home market 
the mvma study also argued that the big three us automakers 
were being injured by the dumping because they were not able to 
make full use of factories and japanese undercutting had hurt their 
profits 
the importers study looked mostly at cars because of the 
strength of the domestic truck market john reilly the analyst who 
prepared it said monday 
one reason we werent concerned about doing a dumping 
calculation on trucks was because the domestics makers market 
performance was so strong in terms of growth in sales and growth in 
market share reilly said 
in 1987 sales of small pickups by general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp grew by about 10 percent or 135000 
trucks while japanese makers sales fell by about the same in a 
steady market he said 
truck buyers are motivated strongly by price reilly said so if 
the japanese makers were pricing unfairly low they would have held 
or gained sales 
the study completed march 14 also indicated 
about 25 percent of japanese makers costs including 
advertising marketing distribution and freight are incurred in 
dollars and are not affected by the currencys weakness against the 
yen 
japanese companies have countered some of the pressures of the 
strong yen by improving productivity and transferring parts 
production from japan to lowercost countries such as south korea 
and thailand 
a us industry charging foreign competitors with dumping or 
selling products in this market for less than in their home market 
or for less than the cost of production must prove it has been 
harmed by the practice before the us government will impose 
punitive import duties 
in the study reilly stated domestic makers held their share of 
the us car and truck market in 1987 despite a 1 millionvehicle 
drop in their sales and a 115 millionvehicle overall drop in the 
market 
much of the decline was borne by gm whose share of the domestic 
market fell nearly five percentage points in 1987 as its lost sales 
to domestic competitors rather than to foreign makers the study 
found

the investor partnership pursuing a hostile 
17 billion tender offer to acquire koppers co is appealing a 
federal judges order blocking the takeover attempt 
judge manuel real in los angeles on monday granted a preliminary 
injunction to succeed his march 25 restraining order which 
temporarily halted the 60 a share bid by bns inc a partnership 
headed by british industrialist brian beazer and the investment 
firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
koppers a construction materials and services company that also 
manufactures chemicals has resisted the takeover attempt and 
sought to block it in federal court on antitrust grounds beazer is 
chairman of beazer plc a general construction and construction 
materials company 
bns immediately appealed the preliminary injunction to the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals 
koppers stock declined 50 cents to 5725 a share monday on the 
new york stock exchange 
separately in pittsburgh gov robert p casey asked a federal 
judge to allow his administration to intervene on behalf of koppers 
in another company lawsuit aimed at thwarting the takeover 
koppers had filed a federal lawsuit in pittsburgh accusing the 
unwanted suitors of violating securities laws 
in a brief to us district judge maurice cohill casey said the 
potential loss of 1100 pittsburgharea employees of koppers 
chemical businesses would hurt the local economy it also said the 
takeover could jeopardize agreements koppers entered to reduce 
pollution from its facilities 
these environmental obligations could seriously impair the 
ability of the buyers to obtain financiang for the offer and 
impair the sale of the chemical assets caseys general counsel 
morey m myers said 
koppers also contended the companys stock was worth more than 
the 60 a share offered by the beazer group 
beazer attended the pittsburgh hearing but declined comment 
afterward

a record 3 million libel award against cbs 
that the supreme court has refused to disturb is not likely to have 
widespread impact on the news media says an authority on libel law 
henry kaufman of the libel defense resource center in new york 
city said the case does not establish a significant precedent 
because the facts involved are unique 
but kaufman did say that the case stemming from a broadcast on 
a cbsowned television station in chicago changes the 
psychological landscape 
this is the first libel award that has broken through the 
psychological 1 million barrier on appeal the first that has been 
able to make it through the process intact he said 
kaufman whose organization is funded by the news media 
expressed disappointment along with cbs officials that the supreme 
court on monday left the libel judgment intact 
news organizations had hoped the case could be used to mount a 
first amendment attack against punitive damages in libel cases 
kaufman said that opportunity has passed for the time being 
he said 
were disappointed said doug jacobs associate general 
counsel for cbs inc we believed these issues were important 
enough for review 
the case stems from a suit by brown amp williamson tobacco corp 
of louisville ky which makes viceroy cigarettes it accused cbs 
and wbbmtv anchorman walter jacobson in chicago of libeling it in 
a nov 11 1981 broadcast 
jacobson in a nightly feature called walter jacobsons 
perspective said there was a viceroy advertising strategy to 
attract young people to smoking by relating cigarettes to pot 
wine beer and sex he said the idea was to present cigarette 
smoking as an initiation into the adult world as an illicit 
pleasure 
a federal jury awarded the cigarette company 5 million the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals upheld 3 million of the award 
against cbs and 50000 against jacobson 
the 3 million award plus some 400000 in interest is about 
four times the largest previous damage judgment against a news 
organization upheld on appeal awards upheld on appeal average 
between 100000 and 150000 
in the cbs case the appeals court rejected arguments that the 
broadcast was intended as opinion and thus could not be libelous 
the appeals court said the remarks about viceroy were intended 
to be factual even if the tone of the broadcast made it sound like 
something else 
the appeals court also rejected cbss claim that the broadcast 
was truthful 
there was insufficient evidence that the cigarette company 
actually adopted a strategy of attracting young smokers by relating 
cigarettes to pot wine beer and sex the appeals court said 
finally the appeals court ruled that jacobson and cbs acted 
with actual malice in broadcasting the commentary 
for a public figure to win a libel suit it must be shown there 
was actual malice that statements were made with knowledge they 
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth the cigarette 
company was held to be a public figure

japanese automakers will fall short of their 
quota for car exports to the united states in the fiscal year ended 
march 31 an industry trade journal says 
lagging sales by nissan motor co ltd will account for most of 
the shortfall automotive news predicted monday 
the japanese government limits its automakers car exports to 
the us to 23 million a year automotive news predicted that a 
final tally of shipments will indicate a shortfall of 70000 to 
100000 cars 
nissan shipped about 475544 cars to the united states for the 
1987 fiscal year about 66200 below its allocation from the 
japanese government automotive news said citing high inventories 
and slow sales of nissan cars here 
the japanese government divides the total quota among exporting 
automakers preventing companies that use their full allocation 
from shipping additional cars to take up the slack left by 
companies with slow sales 
nissans 1987 us import sales were off 172 percent from 1986 
and had dropped a further 322 percent in 1988 as of february 
analysts have said nissan sales have slipped recently because the 
automaker has introduced relatively few new products 
automotive news said honda motor co toyota motor corp mazda 
motor corp mitsubishi motors corp chrysler corp which imports 
mitsubishi cars and fuji heavy industries which makes subaru 
cars were expected to have used their entire 1987 allocations 
robert mccurry senior vice president for toyota motor sales 
usa has said that his company easily could sell more cars if it 
were allowed to use the leftover allocations of companies such as 
nissan 
while honda and toyota had few unsold cars in their inventories 
other makes had more than 50 days worth high for japanese 
companies and nissan had an estimated 206 days supply the trade 
journal said 
the japanese ministry of international trade and industry which 
sets the quota is expected to maintain the 23 million level for 
fiscal 1988 despite pressure from us automakers 
the big three have called for a lower export quota to 
incorporate the growing number of japanese cars built in the united 
states honda toyota nissan and mazda build cars here mitsubishi 
will begin production this year in bloomingtonnormal ill 
toyota also will begin production this year at a new factory in 
georgetown ky where it will build the toyota camry sedan while 
subaru and isuzu motor co ltd are building a jointventure plant 
in lafayette ind 
these plants will have a combined capacity to build up to 25 
million cars a year by 1990 at a time when the big three are 
closing plants because they have too much capacity

directors of resorts international inc 
spurned the latest takeover offer from entertainer merv griffin 
but formed a special panel to meet with griffin to decide if an 
acceptable offer could be made 
although the action monday appeared to open the door slightly to 
griffin resorts chairman donald trump who holds 88 percent of the 
companys voting power also renewed his pledge not to sell his 
stock to the entertainer or to terminate a lucrative fiveyear 
management contract with the company 
trump also vowed to block efforts by griffin to get the company 
to sell him 12 million new shares of class b stock which carries 
100 votes per share such a move would give griffin more voting 
strength than trump 
trump owns 95 percent of the companys current 572000 class b 
shares 
the company also has 57 million shares of class a stock which 
carries one vote per share 
griffin has said in the past that he wouldnt be interested in 
becoming partners with trump 
griffin is offering 36 a share for resorts class a common 
shares and for the 12 million class b shares that would be newly 
issued 
trumps holdings could be sold under the offer only if they were 
converted to class a stock trump bought his stock a year ago for 
135 a share but it has since lost much of its value 
last week trump abandoned his own tender offer to buy the stock 
he doesnt already own for 22 a share 
resorts said a special committee comprised of trump and a trump 
ally plus two outside directors would engage in discussions with 
the griffin co to explore whether an acceptable offer would be 
made 
this is the first time that resorts has indicated any 
willingness to hold talks with the entertainers privately held 
investment company 
earlier in the day griffin said he and the president of his 
company are to meet with new jersey gaming officials next week on 
griffins takeover bid for resorts 
the meetings are the start of a licensing process that usually 
lasts a few weeks

the seven japanese automakers plants in the 
united states may cause 45000 jobs to be lost in the domestic 
industry far fewer than the number estimated by the united auto 
workers a government study says 
the general accounting office study said that its estimate for 
job losses from 1985 through 1990 was based on worstcase 
assumptions and the number of jobs actually lost could be less 
the gao study requested by reps john dingell dmich marcy 
kaptur dohio and edward madigan rill placed the job loss at 
slightly less than a quarter the 200000 lost jobs expected by the 
uaw 
imports increased productivity and use of foreign parts will 
shrink the number of autoindustry jobs by 1990 according to the 
study released monday 
the operations of japaneseaffiliated automakers in the united 
states could result in even more losses because they use fewer 
workers and more foreign content than us automakers the study 
said 
japanese auto plants in the united states were established in 
part to forestall protectionist legislation in congress by giving 
us workers a chance to work in japanese assembly plants 
japanese automakers have invested more than 5 billion in us 
assembly plants since 1980 besides the seven japanese auto 
manufacturers more than 100 japanese auto parts suppliers operate 
in the united states 
the gao estimate was based on what the study called unprovable 
assumptions about the extent to which usmade japanese autos cut 
into domestic manufacturing rather than displace imports 
the worstcase estimate assumed 85 percent of japans us 
production displaced production by the domestic automakers a level 
the agency called relatively high 
at a 70 percent displacement rate the job loss shrinks to 
17000 and from 60 percent down the japanese production creates 
more jobs than it eliminates the study said 
the gao study also assumed half the japanese makers parts would 
be bought in the united states and that us production by japanese 
makers would total 18 million vehicles in 1990 
the uaw study produced a higher jobloss estimate because it 
assumed the japanese manufacturers would build 22 million vehicles 
in the united states all of which would cut into domestic 
production and would buy only 30 percent of their parts in the 
united states

ruled in favor of st marys buckeye power and the affiliated

7yearold dispute with dayton power amp light

regulatory commission ruling that dpampl is bound by terms of a 1968 
contract to deliver the buckeye powergenerated electricity over 
dpampls power network to the city of st marys dayton power amp light 
had disagreed and appealed the commissions ruling

tandy corps success in retailing home 
computers is not carrying over easily into the bigbusiness market 
the parent company of the radio shack chain of electronics 
stores announced its big push into the fortune 1000 last august and 
has relatively little to show for it so far 
general electric co and wells fargo bank are the only big 
customers that have so far allowed tandy to mention them by name 
the radio shack name a magnet in shopping malls does not 
impress people who run corporate data centers and some analysts 
believe the company lacks the technical and sales savvy to make it 
against industry giants like international business machines corp 
tandy has about 8 percent of the overall us computer market 
but only 2 to 3 percent of the fortune 1000 according to future 
computing inc a dallasbased market researcher 
the old radio shack quality issue still hurts them said 
john c mccarthy an analyst with forrester research in cambridge 
mass its one thing to buy a tape deck that doesnt work but 
its another thing to have the computer that youre running your 
company on break down 
the knock on quality may be unjustified based on independent 
evaluations but tandy still strikes some corporate buyers as a 
company for electronics hobbyists 
computers made up only about 30 percent of tandys business last 
year outweighed by its sales of electronic parts and equipment 
radios telephones video equipment tape recorders toys and 
communication equipment 
playing to its strengths tandy continues to focus most of its 
efforts on selling to small and mediumsized companies ed juge 
the director of market planning said in a recent interview 
we have not claimed to have made large inroads into the big 
corporate market what we have said is that our level of 
penetration is much greater juge said its never been our 
intention to unseat ibm 
juge said members of the sales force are told that for every 
call they make on a fortune 1000 company they should be making 
about 70 calls to smaller companies 
tandys push to move in on ibms established bigbusiness market 
began in august 1987 it centered on creating tandy computer 
centers separate from the radio shack stores spending 80 million 
to refurbish many of the 8500 outlets and improving training for 
sales people 
that sales force has encountered some resistance but most 
companies are willing to try tandys systems said bob myers vice 
president of tandys business products division 
it hasnt proven too difficult to have most of them take a 
unit for evaluation myers said if we can get them to compare 
our systems with ibms we compare very favorably 
some analysts say there is a perception in corporate america 
that tandy lacks equipment to connect its computers to each other 
in the very large corporate market connectivity becomes a 
very large issue said joe cross an analyst with future 
computing when you think of networking or office integration 
tandy is not the first name that pops to mind 
last month tandy announced plans to license its deskmate 
interface to software developers hoping to establish the look and 
feel of its personal computer screen as an industry standard it 
said its computers can be easily hooked together in networks 
but eugene glazer an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
new york said he thinks tandys problem has more to do with 
marketing than technology 
everything thats available in networking tandy has access 
to tandy has systems as good as any out there but it needs to 
convince the large companies that it has quality products to 
offer he said 
selling connected solutions in the next couple of years will 
be our thrust said john roach tandys chairman and chief 
executive noting the companys sales force has been successful in 
other areas 
sales at recently refurbished stores have risen about 4 percent 
faster than sales at stores that have not been refurbished the 
company reported 
overall tandy sales meanwhile improved to 366 billion in 
calendar year 1987 compared with 332 billion in 1986 and net 
income in 1987 improved to 2898 million compared with 2164 
million in 1986 
company executives also believe fortune 500 companies concerned 
about quality and value will look at tandy products on an equal 
footing with other computer systems 
the problem is simply one of penetration and presence 
future computings cross said ibm when it came out with a 
personal computer already had contacts with every company in the 
country with its mainframes 
industry rumors have it that tandy plans this month to unveil 
the first computer compatible with ibms personal system2 
computer which was introduced in april 1987 
juge wont confirm or deny the rumor the company has called a 
news conference for april 21 to introduce two products one a 
computer product and the other an invention that will have 
impact on multiple areas in the electronics field 
roach said tandy waited to introduce highend personal computers 
rather than put an inferior product on the market 
we have a very broadbased distribution network and many 
repeat customers he said often we will elect not to carry a 
product because we feel like some percentage of the market will not 
be happy with it 
tandy also has begun fighting for a share of the market in 
portable laptop computers that can perform many of the same 
functions as an ibmcompatible desk unit 
to help the company compete in the tough laptop market tandy 
recently purchased grid systems corp of fremont calif for 55 
million grid which designs manufactures and markets rugged 
magnesiumcased portable microcomputers will become a wholly owned 
subsidiary of tandy

corporate raider t boone pickens may not 
have hit pay dirt when prospecting for targets among gold 
companies but that doesnt necessarily mean hes lost his midas 
touch 
last month pickens mesa limited partnership ditched its bid 
for homestake mining co after the company rejected a 188 billion 
buyout offer an earlier pickensled run for newmont mining corp 
also failed to pan out 
the environment for takeovers and some of the rules have 
changed but dont ever shortchange this guy bob hill vice 
president for ag edwards in amarillo said of pickens hes 
plenty savvy 
that savvy helped pickens parlay a 2500 investment into one of 
the nations largest independent oil companies it also earned the 
takeover artist who champions shareholder rights a reputation for 
making top executives squirm in their boardroom swivel chairs 
chief executives who themselves own few shares of their 
companies have no more feeling for the average shareholder than 
they do for baboons in africa pickens once said 
but executives arent the only people who bristle at pickens 
residents here sometimes dislike pickens dealings in his hometown 
where his moniker is attila of amarilla 
pickens was a behindthescenes mover in a group attacking the 
amarillo globenews for negative coverage after the group rallied 
and pulled advertising from the paper last autumn the newspapers 
general manager jerry huff announced his departure 
pickens forces celebrated their victory by draping a yellow 
banner that read goodbye jerry on the side of mesas downtown 
building 
pickens multimilliondollar endowment to west texas state 
universitys business school and position as board of regents 
chairman havent won him many friends at the canyon college either 
some students and faculty have called for the ouster of 
president ed roach a pickens candidate and of pickens himself 
the two have been lampooned repeatedly in an underground newsletter 
published by faculty members 
after the newspaper controversy and amid unrest at wtsu reports 
surfaced that pickens may move his 3153 million company from this 
panhandle city of 195000 to a larger texas city 
pickens righthand man david batchelder announced last week 
he is making his own move to california where he will start his 
own consulting firm 
its a significant sacrifice to live in amarillo batchelder 
told the wall street journal comparing the city to a large truck 
stop 
analysts meanwhile say that although the 59yearold pickens 
hasnt made stock market killings on the order of those past he 
hasnt lost his touch 
most of these recent takeover attempts for one reason or 
another have been unsuccessful and that has i think created this 
image of mesa and boone pickens being unsuccessful investors 
said dean witter reynolds inc vice president philip kehl who 
estimated mesa racked up 10 million in market profits last year 
but i think theyve had a lot of small nice gains which over 
the course of time will add up he said 
both pickens and batchelder failed to return more than a dozen 
telephone calls from the associated press 
nevertheless pickens 1987 dealings pale in comparison to his 
earlier conquests in the oil industry 
in 1982 he reaped 315 million for mesa after launching an 
attack on cities service co that resulted in a buyout by 
occidental petroleum corp he followed that with a string of 
unsuccessful but profitable bids for gulf oil corp from which he 
gleaned more than 500 million phillips petroleum co and unocal 
corp 
pickens 1986 bid for dallasbased diamond shamrock corp forced 
a drastic restructuring of the company splitting it into a 
refining and marketing company diamond shamrock rampm and an 
exploration company maxus energy corp pickens and mesa still made 
several million dollars on that deal 
last year ivanhoe partners a pickensled investment group 
made a 2 billion hostile bid to control new yorkbased newmont 
mining a gold and uranium mining concern with interests in oil and 
natural gas 
a delaware court thwarted the bid when it refused to rule 
illegal a market sweep in which newmonts biggest shareholder 
britains consolidated gold fields plc bought enough shares in a 
twoday september binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent 
of newmont and stave off the hostile bid 
san franciscos homestake one of the countrys largest gold 
producers recently rejected mesas offer to negotiate a buyout for 
20 a share in cash 
admittedly he hasnt made a major killing in the stock market 
since phillips but they mesa have been very active investors 
kehl said mesa is sort of two companies its a gas producer 
and its an investment company and theyve been in and out of many 
different stocks in the last year 
among his ongoing interests pickens has thrice tried to buy kn 
energy inc a lakewood colo gas pipeline company and he could 
take an active role in new jerseybased singer corp the former 
sewing machine makerturneddefense electronics firm 
mesa helped finance corporate raider paul bilzerians postcrash 
takeover of singer by chipping in the last 150 million needed for 
the buyout fortune magazine reported that pickens conditions 
dictate that bilzerian must repay mesa within 15 months or pickens 
may take control of singers board 
analysts say mesas investments in singer and other companies 
have enhanced the limited partnerships financial picture but mesa 
may be stretching to pay its cash distributions this month 
mesas dividends have exceeded its operating cash flow with the 
difference coming from the partnerships sizable investment 
holdings and lines of credit kehl said 
but other analysts say that cash distributions may be cut soon 
to ease the burden for mesa which had 1987 earnings of 319 
million down 12 percent from 1986 on revenues of 3153 million 
while pickens is still acknowledged as a wily investor 
companies have learned to fight back and market conditions have 
become tougher for speculators like pickens market experts contend 
after the stock market broke the stock market players began 
to realize that you can win and lose at this game said 
warren shimmerlik an analyst with merrill lynch amp co

boom times went bust here in the 1980s yet 
glitzy upscale shopping malls keep popping up along the 
mississippi river in the suburbs and in the shadow of the 
louisiana superdome 
some might say its crazy to build retail developments in a city 
going through a slump often compared to the great depression but 
charles peterson says its good business 
peterson is the regional development director for the edward j 
debartolo corp which is building the 8000squarefoot 100 
million complex that will open next to the superdome in august 
it will compete for attention with the new galleria in suburban 
metairie the yearold riverwalk on the riverside site of the 1984 
worlds fair canal place at the foot of the citys major 
thoroughfare and at least five other shopping developments that 
have been constructed or expanded in the area since 1980 
peterson said the failure of the oil economy in louisiana which 
hit just as debartolos new orleans centre was being planned did 
not give his company second thoughts about the project 
frankly this has seemed like a very solid idea all along we 
have a great location and were bringing in macys and lord amp 
taylor two stores that people from this area have always traveled 
to other cities to shop in peterson said 
for years new orleans residents planned trips to houston 
atlanta new york and other cities to shop according to stella 
schramm the director of the chamber of commerces economic 
development department 
new orleans was grossly underretailed in the past she 
explained in 1980 our percapita income surpassed the national 
average that sent up a red flag that got a lot of attention from 
national retailers who had previously ignored new orleans 
as retailers began to plan and build new shopping facilities in 
the area however the oilbased economy began to falter the price 
of oil plummeted oilrelated businesses failed and louisianas 
unemployment rate soared above 14 percent 
in 1985 when the first phase of the esplanade mall opened the 
economy was still in good shape but by the time the second phase 
opened in 1986 mall general manager andre grondin said things had 
changed radically 
i wondered for a while if id be looking for another job 
myself he said we had a slow period which is normal for a 
new mall but i was reading all the negative economic news in the 
papers at that time and i was worried 
mall managers and developers remain resolutely confident 
however while the local economy is still slow most feel there are 
definite signs of recovery 
the important thing about economic forecasts schramm said 
is expectation expectation was very bad while oil prices were 
fluctuating now that theyre fairly stable even though theyre 
not as high as people would like things are improving 
another factor thats helping the local economy is tourism and 
for the new shopping centers in the area thats a twoway street 
definitely we see people making trips here just to shop 
beverly gianna of the greater new orleans tourist and convention 
commission said we also see the effect of the new shopping 
opportunities on our convention trade new orleans is now no 1 for 
spouse attendance at conventions in the united states im sure 
having all these great stores is one reason for that 
peterson agrees saying now that national merchants are opening 
here local folks are shopping at home and tourists are in those 
same stores 
thats not only keeping that money in the local economy its 
bringing it into the city from other areas lets face it if you 
live in jackson miss or pensacola fla and you have a chance 
to go to houston or new orleans for a weekend of shopping its an 
easy choice new orleans can now offer both the french quarter and 
the stores people want where do you think people are going to be 
going

grain and soybean futures prices weakened this 
morning after a sharp rally in beans monday on the chicago board of 
trade 
prices were undermined partly by an increased movement of corn 
and soybeans out of country storage said jerry gidel an analyst 
with gh miller amp co 
wheat futures were lower too despite improved export news 
including an agriculture department announcement that it had 
targeted the soviet union for 1 million tons of subsidized wheat 
while soybeans were on the retreat losses were limited by new 
estimates that brazils bean crop will not be as large as 
previously been expected said gidel 
on the opening wheat was cent to cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 299 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents lower with may at 207 a bushel oats were cent lower 
with may at 163 a bushel and soybeans were 1 cents to 2 cents

the stock market moved higher today as a 
technical rally took hold but light volume indicated market 
participants may be halfhearted in their enthusiasm for equities 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 1310 to 199370 
at noon on wall street 
gainers outnumbered losers by about 13 to 9 in the overall tally 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 773 up 525 down and 
52 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 6378 million shares at midday 
the dow pierced the 2000 mark at midmorning but then met with 
considerable resistance 
this is the fourth time in the last week or so that the dow 
has tried to get up above the 2000 level and has not made it 
said ronald f daino a technical analyst at smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
the internal market is not showing much enthusiasm he said 
adding that the light volume indicated traders remain cautious 
the market drew strength from a firming dollar and stabilizing 
bond prices but traders said big institutional investors were not 
willing to commit themselves to equities and remain on the 
sidelines 
analysts expect the dow to remain in the narrow range as trader 
sentiment swings from recession fears to inflation paranoia 
much of the excitement centered on woolworth which remains on

subsidiarys illegal sale of sensitive machines to the soviet 
union an official said 
hajime tamura minister of international trade and industry 
handed mansfield a letter to the administration of president reagan

of the house and senate

of strategic items to communist nations effective enforcement of 
export controls is the responsibility of each member nation

corporate raider carl c icahn has 
filed an appeal of a federal bankruptcy judges approval of 
texacos reorganization plan 
but texaco attorney harvey miller said the filing done late 
friday in us bankruptcy court here will not stop the 56 
billion plan set to begin thursday 
icahn texacos largest shareholder said he still opposed to 
two key parts of the plan 
one was the release from any legal liabilities of all the 
participants in texacos illfated 1984 acquisition of getty oil co 
he also opposed a default provision in a loan of up to 3 
billion which texaco will use to help fund the reorganization 
under a provision of texacos agreement with a consortium of 
banks providing the money the loans would be callable if more than 
half of its 14member board is replaced by new directors or if an 
investor obtains 30 percent of the companys stock 
twothirds of the banks must vote to force texaco to pay back 
the money however 
texaco entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on april 12 last 
year claiming it was forced to do so to avoid having to pay a 
potentially ruinous multibilliondollar security bond while 
appealing a 103 billion judgment held against it by pennzoil co 
houstonbased pennzoil won the judgment when a houston jury 
ruled that texaco had improperly interfered with a pennzoil attempt 
to acquire part of getty oil co and bought getty itself

a 15 billion reorganization plan for troubled 
first city bancorporation of texas inc is crucial to the companys 
survival documents filed with the securities and exchange 
commission indicate 
the bailout plan is being held up by debtholders who are 
refusing to tender their securities for less than face value first 
city has extended its tendering deadline for a fourth time and 
lowered the participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent 
first citys board of directors are convinced that the company 
has no realistic alternative to the reorganization and that the 
plans failure would eventually mean the banks failure 
in an accompanying letter to the sec the accounting firm of

new college graduates this spring will face a 
tight job market with competitionconscious companies less willing 
to offer extended onthejob training a veteran placement 
professional says 
employers especially small and mediumsize companies which 
represent the areas of greatest job growth today have neither the 
time nor inclination to bring somebody along gradually said 
james e challenger president of chicagobased challenger gray amp 
christmas inc which descibes itself as the nations oldest 
outplacement firm now you either sink or swim right away 
an increasingly competitive marketplace is facing all companies 
challenger said in an analysis of the 1988 college graduate job 
outlook released monday 
as a result many of the larger firms have instituted 
corporate downsizing to pare their overhead and operating expenses 
which has not only eliminated or combined many existing jobs but 
also prevented the creation of many new entrylevel jobs 
the twoyear training programs for beginners are among 
casualties of world market competition he said companies want 
results now not in two years 
challenger 62 founded his firm in 1962 and says it has helped 
more than 20000 people who have lost jobs find employment the 
firm has 14 regional offices in cities including los angeles 
boston dallas and milwaukee 
challenger said the job market wont favor most graduates 
because companies are more selective he said early indications 
suggest that fewer than the usual onethird of students getting 
fouryear degrees will have jobs lined up when they receive 
diplomas 
college placement officials say that just 20 percent to 25 
percent of students graduating have jobs set but things could 
change by the end of may challenger said in a telephone interview 
the graduates likely to have the most luck finding positions are 
the a students and those with specialty degrees such as 
engineering or accounting or those going into sales challenger 
said 
companies are always willing to take on sales trainees 
because many sales jobs are lowsalary or operate on commission he 
said 
some students are taking unpaid internships to obtain good jobs 
challenger said others may have to take parttime work as they 
search for permanent positions 
some placement experts disagree with challengers assessment 
victor lindquist director of placement for northwestern university 
in evanston said his survey of employers indicates a better 
employment year spring graduates 
he said in a telephone interview tuesday that the universitys 
survey last fall forecast a 10 percent increase in newgraduate 
employment over the previous year 
lindquist agreed that takeovers and corporate restructurings 
have heightened competition for new jobs 
if you were making 35000 and youre offered 30000 you 
might not like it but its better than unemployment said 
lindquist 
but at the same time he said many companies are very very 
heavily in the market for new employees and have made a big 
commitment to training 
not having a job by commencement is not necessarily the end of 
the world lindquist said therell be more kids hired in june 
july august and september than there probably were in the previous 
four months and theres nothing at all unusual about that

wheat futures rallied sharply and most other 
grain and soybean contracts also were higher tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade 
wheat showed a little early enthusiasm reflecting coming export 
business and an agriculture department announcement that it is 
targeting the soviet union for 1 million tons of subsidized wheat 
said jerry gidel an analyst with gh miller amp co 
but the market took a sharp turn upward when a professional fund 
manager bought a huge amount of wheat 
they probably bought a total of 20 million bushels said 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc they 
apparently were trying to get a positive trend going 
analyst said there was no fundamental news to justify the 
dimeabushel advance in wheat prices were trimmed a bit in late 
dealings 
at the close wheat was 6 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 307 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with may at 208 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with may at 165 a bushel and

took courage said charles a spence vice president of foreign 
exchange at first interstate bank of california in los angeles 
dollar buyers were also encouraged by news reports that federal 
reserve governor wayne angell expressed a strong desire to lower 
inflation said peter gloyne senior trader at first national bank 
of chicago

rates it would raise the yield of dollardenominated securities

two units of farewars veteran texas air corp fired a spring 
salvo tuesday by announcing price cuts on tickets purchased by 
april 14 
the subsidiaries eastern airlines and continental airlines may 
touch off a price skirmish only a few weeks after all the major 
carriers hiked fares steeply 
but the cuts limited by the purchaseperiod requirements and 
hemmed in by other restrictions stop short of a fullfledged 
price war although observers believe the reductions made by 
miamibased eastern and houstonbased continental are likely to be 
matched by other major airlines they dont see a major fare battle 
on the horizon 
its definitely not a fare war its barely a skirmish said 
edward starkman an airline analyst for investment firm painewebber 
inc 
if anything the current climate for the industry appears to 
favor fare hikes rather than reductions the major us carriers 
have posted an average increase in passenger traffic of 7 percent 
to 8 percent since new years day from the same period last year 
the robust demand prompted the big airlines to raise their 
firstclass economy and discount fares in midmarch by 15 percent 
to 85 percent depending on the destination the carriers also 
tightened restrictions on their popular maxsaver discount 
fares the cheapest available 
the big fare hikes came several weeks before they normally do 
as the airlines jumped the gun on the peak travel season that 
starts in april 
eastern and continental the nations sixthlargest and 
fifthranked airlines respectively said tuesday they were cutting 
some fares in anticipation of a slack period coming up for leisure 
travel 
the period between easter and the start of summer vacations in 
midjune is always a slack travel time and an early easter extends 
the offpeak period this year said george j brennan vice 
president of marketing communications for eastern 
we hope to give leisure travel a boost with fares so low that 
people will take a trip they might not otherwise plan 
with the new fares the airline said passengers will be able to 
fly midweek to more than 80 us cities on eastern for a maximum of 
99 one way based on a roundtrip tariff of 198 easterns 
roundtrip fare between miami and new york for example will fall 
to 178 under the program compared with the current maxsaver 
fare of 208 
although there are some minor differences eastern and 
continental introduced similar programs the nonrefundable tickets 
must be purchased by april 14 starting tuesday for eastern and 
wednesday for continental and used for travel from april 18 
through june 15 
passengers must travel between noon monday and noon thursday 
roundtrip travel and a saturday night stay are required 
those restrictions limit the program to eight travel days in 
april 18 days in may and nine in june 
and there are still more restrictions for eastern tickets must 
be bought within 24 hours after making reservations continental is 
even stricter it requires reservations and ticketing to be done at 
the same time 
both airlines prohibit schedule changes to be made the special 
fares and limit the number of available seats on each flight 
its pretty savvy of texas air corp said andrew geller a 
transportation analyst for provident national bank in philadelphia 
it very effectively cancels out every businessperson from using 
the new fares 
geller suggested that the reduced tariffs could encourage people 
who had planned vacations to take them within the specified time 
frames

acquire stock controlled by an investor group led by kaskel for 60 
a share on monday a premium of more than 1025 a share more 
than 20 percent over the market price at the time 
kansas city southern shares traded at 4975 at the time the 
buyback was disclosed the stock fell 137 a share on monday and 
dropped another 375 to close at 4650 a share tuesday on the new

kaskel had proposed a friendly buyout of the kansas city 
southern shares that his group didnt own for 5876 million or 
60 a share after the company spurned the offer kaskel threatened 
a proxy battle to name two of his group to the board of directors 
at kansas city southerns annual meeting may 3 
fred spar a spokesman for kaskel said the investor agreed to 
sell because he could not convince kansas city southern to accept 
his plans for gaining control of the company 
there were several discussions with management but we came to 
the conclusion that we would not be able to go forward on a 
friendly basis he said 
hallmarks purchase will make it kansas city southerns largest 
stockholder with 104 million shares or 94 percent of those 
outstanding the kansas citybased greeting card giant said it

officer of hallmark held a smiliar post at kansas city southern 
from 1981 until 1983 
jim wineland a stock analyst with waddell amp reed inc said the 
premium price paid to kaskel reflected the threat he posed to the 
company 
its called greenmail just on the face youd have to say it 
was worth that much to get kaskel out of the way wineland said 
jeffrey perry of the investment firm cj lawrence morgan 
grenfell inc in new york called the deal the most blatant case 
of greenmail ive seen in a long time he said the price hallmark 
paid for the stock was not justified by kansas city southerns 
expected earnings 
kcsis main holding is the kansas city southern lines the 
nations 14th largest railroad it also owns 873 percent of dst 
systems inc a financial record keeper based in kansas city

energy futures retreated tuesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange depressed by what are regarded as opecs ineffectual 
moves to stabilize the market 
among other commodities precious metals declined wheat futures 
rallied sharply and livestock closed on a firm note 
the oil market had a case of the jitters over a planned meeting 
saturday by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
pricing committee 
nauman barakat an analyst in new york with smith barney harris 
upham amp co said their had been speculation early in the day that 
the meeting would be called off 
this was quickly denied but the reaffirmation that the meeting 
was on didnt seem to put much inspiration into the market 
obviously if the meeting is not on this would be more 
negative for the market but the bottom line is what the meeting 
will accomplish essentially nothing but propaganda said 
barakat the perception is that whether the meeting is on or not 
its not really going to accomplish anything 
he said the opec committee probably will probably end up blaming 
nonopec producers for the turmoil in the market rather than 
making any moves to bring some firmness to prices 
itll take a little more than that to bring some stability 
he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 14 cents to 22 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in may at 1679 a barrel heating 
oil was 36 cent to 80 cent lower with may at 4520 cents a 
gallon and unleaded gasoline was 60 cent to 71 cent lower with 
may at 4864 cents a gallon 
precious metals prices gave back mondays gains and then some on 
the commodity exchange in new york 
events of the day defused inflationary expectations said 
bette raptopoulos an analyst in new york with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
the market weakened early on the strength of the dollar she 
said 
then she said federal reserve governor wayne angell 
talked about last weeks favorable unemployment data not really 
being that inflationary and he felt inflation should be lower 
angell referred to data released friday showing the jobless rate 
at 56 percent the lowest since 1979 
ms raptopoulos also noted that lower energy futures and a 
weakened crb index also pointed toward lower inflation 
gold settled 330 to 360 lower with the june contract at 
45620 a troy ounce and silver was 14 cents to 146 cents lower 
with may at 6685 a troy ounce 
wheat futures rallied sharply and most other grain and soybean 
contracts also were higher on the chicago board of trade 
wheat showed a little early enthusiasm reflecting coming export 
business and an agriculture department announcement that the soviet 
union was authorized 1 million tons of subsidized wheat said jerry 
gidel an analyst with gh miller amp co 
but the market took a sharp turn upward when a professional fund

the stock market spun into a late rally tuesday 
after seesawing in a directionless session marked by low volume and 
investor caution 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials gained 1691 points to 
199751 
advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 on the new 
york stock exchange with 911 up 585 down and 467 unchanged 
big board volume totaled 13529 million shares against 18224 
million in the previous session the nyses composite index rose 
112 to 14629 
the dow average dipped into negative territory at midday as 
traders moved to cash in on an early technical rally that pushed 
the key index up about 20 points in the first few hours of activity 
but analysts were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the 
markets overall tone because trading volume remained among the 
lightest levels so far this year 
the overriding issue is that the volume is not particularly 
convincing and thats leaving the market fairly directionless 
said hugh johnson senior vice president at first albany corp 
despite a firming dollar and stabilizing bond prices there was 
a lack of strong fundamentals to sustain a move in either 
direction he added 
analysts said professional traders were the main players in the 
market with individual and institutional investors remaining on 
the sidelines while they await clearer signals on state of the 
overall economy 
traders are more interested in capitalizing on shortterm 
movements while investors typically take a longerterm view of the 
market noted michael metz a market strategist at oppenheimer amp co 
this is one of those lowconviction markets where traders 
dominate the arena he said 
much of the sessions activity centered on fw woolworth a 
component of the dow average and the most active issue of the day 
woolworth finished up 2 at 56 after jumping 8 on monday when 
dart group said it was interested in acquiring a stake in the 
retailer 
woolworth had been up as much as 4 during the session but fell 
back amid profittaking analysts said the stocks movements had a 
fairly significant impact on the dow throughout the day

machines was unchanged at 107 general electric was up to 40 
and pillsbury rose to 44
