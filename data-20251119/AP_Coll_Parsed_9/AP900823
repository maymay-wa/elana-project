glass debris in columbias fuel line 
contributed to the shuttles hydrogen leak but the plumbing was 
flushed out and the craft is on track for liftoff sept 1 nasa 
says 
the leak had frustrated nasa for months and kept the shuttle 
grounded along with its 150 million astro observatory 
about 100 to 200 glass beads as fine as sand were found along 
with metal chips when the seals in a 17inchdiameter valve were 
taken apart william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
said wednesday 
the valve connects the orbiter and its big external fuel tank 
theres not much question in our minds that thats implicated 
in why did the seals leak lenoir said 
however he said officials havent pinned down the precise cause 
of the leak the seals might also have been improperly installed 
he said 
nasa officials said they do not know how the debris got there 
parker hannifin corp which makes the plumbing connections was 
using the beads for other projects in the building where it was 
making the shuttle parts lenoir said the beads are used for 
polishing and other tasks he said 
nasa plans no action against the company and will adopt more 
rigorous test procedures to prevent similar problems lenoir said 
the plumbing was flushed out with helium he said weve 
looked for contamination we dont see any lenoir said 
workers on wednesday replaced part of a faulty valve on one of 
columbias three main engines a problem not related to the fuel 
leak lenoir said 
were comfortable with the hardware we have on the pad 
lenoir said 
nasa scrubbed its attempt to launch columbia on may 30 when 
hydrogen leaks were detected during fueling atlantis also was 
found to have a hydrogen leak but in a different spot and the 
entire shuttle fleet was briefly grounded 
during the nine to 10day mission columbias sevenmember crew 
will operate the astro observatory from the shuttle studying 
ultraviolet light and xrays from stars supernovas and other 
celestial bodies

solidly built houses that hold in heat may raise 
the risk of childhood asthma by increasing exposure to dust mites 
a study today concludes 
has the modern world gone wrong about house design somewhere 
so we are doing something to make houses more of a risk to 
children asked dr thomas ae plattsmills 
his research found that housedust mites appear to be an 
important contributor to asthma in places with humid yearround 
climates in a survey in englands soggy south doctors discovered 
that babies who lived in homes with high levels of the bugs had an 
especially high risk of asthma as they grew older 
in house construction plattsmills said the critical 
offenses are carpets central heating and tight housing if you put 
these three together you raise the temperature and if you 
increases the tightness of the house without dehumidification you 
raise humidity and create ideal conditions for microbes 
the work supports the growing belief that a variety of proteins 
from common household creatures especially cats and cockroaches 
can trigger asthma 
plattsmills a researcher at the university of virginia is a 
coauthor of the study published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
he said that between 4 percent and 8 percent of americans 
youngsters have asthma the problem tends to go away as people get 
older but it can remain a lifelong problem 
his study was based on a survey of 67 children in poole 
england researchers check for housedust mites by testing samples 
of dust from their homes 
by age 11 17 children had asthma all but one had been exposed 
to high levels of housedust mites at age 1 
the tiny mites are an unseen but common inhabitants of houses 
everywhere they are especially common in places with humid 
yearround climates plattsmills said that places in the united 
states where they are likely to be a problem include such areas as 
florida seattle and galveston texas 
in the study children ran a higher risk of asthma if the house 
dust in their homes contained 500 or more mites per gram however 
houses can have high levels of mites and still look perfectly clean 
children whose asthma is triggered by housedust mites are 
allergic to a protein found in the mites gastrointestinal tracts 
and droppings 
walltowall carpeting is an especially cozy breeding ground for 
mites plattsmilles said vacuuming fails to pick up the bugs and 
their droppings shampooing the rugs aggravates the problem by 
increasing dampness 
he offered these tips for holding down levels of the creatures 
wash blankets and pillows every 10 days 
use hot water in washing avoid coldwater detergents which 
fail to kill the mites 
use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to keep humidity below 
50 percent 
dont vacuum rugs when children are in the room because this 
stirs up the mites

here are some questions and answers about the military reserves 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the reserves are made up of the army reserve the naval reserve 
the air force reserve the marine corps reserve the army national 
guard and the air force national guard 
national guard units have a dual role guard troops serve as a 
state militia under the command of governors but come under 
federal jurisdiction if called up by the president 
members of the guard and reserves attend regular meetings in 
their home communities and spend two weeks on active duty each 
year most guard units are trained for combat reserve units 
general serve in such support roles as supply maintenance 
communications and medicine 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under federal law reservists called out of civilian jobs must 
be treated as any worker on an unpaid leave of absence when they 
return their employers must give them back their jobs or jobs of 
equal stature with full seniority but a reservists job can be 
eliminated while he or she is away if the employer can show that 
the cut would have been made anyway 
reservists receive military pay while on active duty when they 
return to their civilian jobs they are due any increase in pay or 
benefits that other workers received while they were gone 
though employers arent required to provide medical benefits 
many allow reservists to continue coverage if they pay their own 
premiums reservists who serve more than 30 days are covered by the 
militarys medical plan

iraqs invasion of kuwait has triggered 
an astonishing shift in the arab world none more so than the 
syrian alliance with the united states egypt and saudi arabia 
before the iraqis conquered kuwait on aug 2 it was 
inconceivable that syrian president hafez assad would be seen 
cooperating so openly with the united states israels main ally 
to be sure assad has been locked in an ideological feud with 
iraqs leader saddam hussein for more than a decade and he 
backed iran in its eightyear war against iraq 
but for two decades assad has been one of the arab worlds 
leading hardliners an antiwestern campaigner and an implacable 
opponent of israel 
since seizing power in 1970 assad has repeatedly confronted the 
united states on its peace initiatives in the middle east 
us forces shelled syrian positions in lebanon in 1983 during 
the american intervention in beirut and the syrians were a major 
factor in forcing the united states withdrawal from that country 
by sending troops to saudi arabia to join an arab expeditionary 
force confronting iraq assad has come in from the cold 
on tuesday syria said it was sending troops to saudi arabia 
because the persian gulf region should not be left to the 
foreigners and arab troops should replace the foreign forces 
there 
officials in damascus said the syrian contingent was not going 
to saudi arabia to fight with the united states against iraq but 
would act as a buffer between the two sides 
syrias realignment with arab moderates has lent credibility to 
the campaign led by egyptian president hosni mubarak to cut saddam 
down to size 
the presence of a syrian contingent alongside the american 
forces in saudi arabia must be counted as one of the strongest 
cards in the hand of the saudiusegyptian axis and as one of 
the more outlandish spectacles to result from iraqs invasion of 
kuwait analyst charles snow wrote in the middle east economic 
survey 
syria is still on the us list of countries that support 
terrorism and ahmed jibril leader of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command is headquartered in 
damascus the syrian capital 
that group is believed responsible for the december 1988 bombing 
of pan am flight 103 over scotland in which 290 people were killed 
the british who have sent forces to saudi arabia have also 
been at odds with assad they broke off diplomatic relations in 
1986 claiming syria was involved in an abortive attempt to smuggle 
a bomb aboard an israeli jetliner at london 
assads motives for joining the confrontation against saddam may 
be opportunistic as much as ideologlical 
apart from the prospect of helping humble his main arab rival 
assad is likely to demand a price for allying himself with the 
united states and the conservative saudi arabian monarchy 
the united states aware of how much assads backing would 
strengthen the arab moderates began courting assad in early august 
president bush spoke with assad by telephone on aug 12 
syria has also been inching back into the arab mainstream over 
the last year propelled in part by superpower detente that has 
seriously undercut the massive military support it once received 
from moscow 
it is unclear what assads will demand in return for his support 
it would be surprising if he did not try to exact a commitment 
from bush to press israel to withdraw from the golan heights 
captured from syria in the 1967 middle east war and annexed several 
years later 
with syrias economy in poor condition assad is also likely to 
expect the united states and saudi arabia to reward him with hefty 
amounts of financial aid 
he would also like to see us and saudi backing for his 
policies in lebanon syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon and 
has declared that country vital to its defenses against against 
israel

the national endowment for the arts is 
creating a special watchdog panel to investigate complaints from 
any reliable source that grant recipients are violating the law 
by using federal funds to produce obscene art 
plans for the panel were disclosed in a letter from nea general 
counsel julianne ross davis to the lawyer for the american poetry 
review a philadelphiabased literary magazine that subsequently 
rejected a 10000 endowment grant over the obscenity issue 
the three editors of the 24000circulation publication said 
they found the neas obscenity guidelines restraining and 
damaging to the process of selecting material for the magazine as 
well as to poets and writers 
ms davis told the magazine in late july that the panel would 
include herself a deputy nea chairman and program specialists in 
theater literature and other arts disciplines the panel will 
make initial determinations with respect to allegations of 
obscenity based on a complaint from any reliable source she 
said 
ms davis was unavailable for comment wednesday but nea 
spokeswoman virginia falck said the term reliable source 
referred primarily to members of congress the major source of 
obscenity complaints she said it might also include individuals as 
well as such conservative nea critics as the rev pat robertson and 
the american family association 
since the obscenity ban was enacted last october ms falck 
said the endowment has fielded several dozen inquiries from 
members of congress about possible violations but none has 
resulted in withdrawal of grant awards 
ms davis said that if the panel determines there is a 
substantial basis for the allegations the grant recipient will 
be asked to respond if the recipient persists in violating a 
congressional ban on use of federal funds for obscene art the nea 
says it will demand return of grant funds 
ms falck said the committee patterned after a similar panel in 
the federal communications commission would be established soon 
she stressed that its primary function would be to investigate 
complaints and not to engage in an antiobscenity witch hunt 
this is not an attempt to roust out all obscenity she said 
its not big brother coming in 
in a related development nea chairman john e frohnmayer served 
notice that he will continue to require grant recipients to sign a 
controversial antiobscenity pledge until a new york federal judge 
rules on a lawsuit charging that the pledge violates the 
constitutions free speech guarantees 
frohnmayer instituted the pledge last fall after congress voted 
to prohibit federal support for works that may be considered 
obscene including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism 
homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children or individuals 
engaged in sex acts and which when taken as a whole do not have 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
the obscenity ban was tacked onto the neas current 171 million 
appropriation after sen jesse helms rnc and other 
conservative lawmakers complained that some images in 
endowmentsupported exhibitions of works by photographer robert 
mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano were pornographic and 
sacrilegious 
at a tumultuous meeting in early august the national council on 
the arts the presidentially appointed advisory body to the 
endowment urged frohnmayer to eliminate the pledge which has 
prompted widespread protests in the arts community 
frohnmayer wrote council members on friday that he will delay a 
decision on dropping the pledge until the federal court rules 
possibly within the next month on the suit filed against the nea 
by the new school for social research in new york 
frohnmayer said significant constitutional interpretation may 
be involved in the new york ruling a similar lawsuit has been 
filed by the bella lewitzky dance company in los angeles 
the american poetry review is the seventh artist or arts 
organization to reject an nea grant over the obscenity issue the 
magazines editors said they acted after several months of 
discussions with nea officials about how obscenity allegations 
would be handled 
coeditor david bonanno said in a telephone interview from 
philadelphia that ms davis letter of july 23 was the final 
straw he said the plan for a watchdog panel seemed to be one 
more unworkable aspect of all this and prompted the reviews 
decision on july 30 to reject its 10000 endowment grant

dilantin an epilepsy drug routinely prescribed 
for up to three years after a head injury to prevent seizures 
works well for a week but is ineffective after that a study today 
concludes 
the yearlong study of dilantin known generically as phenytoin 
was prompted by doubts over its longterm effectiveness 
the study of 404 patients found that 4 percent of those on 
dilantin suffered seizures in the first week after injury compared 
with 14 percent of those who got placebos thus dilantin reduced 
the risk of seizures 73 percent 
however over the next two years there was no significant 
difference in the two groups 
the study directed by dr nancy r temkin at the university of 
washington in seattle was published in the new england journal of 
medicine it was financed in part by warnerlambertparke davis 
which makes dilantin 
an estimated 500000 americans suffer head trauma that results 
in brain injury each year about 2 percent suffer recurring

charles v harrelson may owe his life to the 
united states supreme court hired to kill us district judge john 
h wood jr in 1979 harrelson was convicted of murder but never 
had to face the death penalty 
seven years before he shot wood the supreme court overturned 
death penalty statutes throughout the united states because they 
didnt safeguard defendants 
while three dozen states have passed new laws enabling them to 
resume executions there still is no death penalty for most 
civilian federal crimes 
if the death penalty had been there i would have sought it 
said assistant us attorney ray jahn who prosecuted harrelson in 
san antonio texas clearly he would have been entitled to death 
penalty treatment had there been a federal death penalty 
this year the full senate and the house judiciary committee 
have passed bills that would reinstate the death penalty for some 
federal crimes something president bush sought last year 
the senate version covers 34 crimes including killing any 
federal employee from the president to an egg inspector or 
committing murder to aid racketeering 
the house committees version is more limited if that version 
is approved by the full house differences with the senate bill 
would be resolved in conference committee 
just two years ago the death penalty was reinstated for very 
specific drugrelated murders but no one has been executed 
even if the federal death penalty is reinstated more broadly 
its not clear how often it would be used 
the last federal execution was march 15 1963 nine years before 
the supreme court decision when 28yearold convicted kidnapper 
victor h feguer was hanged at iowa state penitentiary 
from 1927 through 1963 there were 34 federal executions 
including six people electrocuted in 1942 for world war iirelated 
sabotage and julius and ethel rosenberg electrocuted in 1953 for 
espionage 
far more people are executed by states texas alone has executed 
37 people since it resumed capital punishment in 1982 thats 
because most people who are executed are convicted killers and most 
murder cases are prosecuted under state laws 
there are exceptions of course states cannot prosecute crimes 
that occur on federal property an inmate who kills a guard at a 
federal prison for example 
on oct 22 1983 two inmates killed two guards in separate 
incidents at the federal prison at marion ill which houses the 
most violent federal inmates 
since the guards were killed on federal property the state of 
illinois which has a death penalty had no jurisdiction said 
bureau of prisons spokesman greg bogdan the inmates remain at 
marion 
marion is basically the end of the line bogdan said 
theres nowhere else to go beyond there because there is no death 
penalty for killing a guard there is no deterrent at that 
point to keep them from doing this again a popular phrase we hear 
is what are you going to do lock me up 
the pending senate bill would reinstate the death penalty for 
crimes that were on the books before the supreme court decision 
mail bombing aircraft hijacking bank robbery treason espionage 
presidential assassination murder of a federal witness federal 
official or relative of a federal official to influence the 
official murder of a member of congress cabinet or supreme court 
and murder of a series of agriculture department inspectors 
capital punishment could be imposed for treason and espionage 
even when no death occurs and for attempted presidential 
assassination if serious injury is inflicted the bill says 
the senate bill also would increase the maximum penalty from 
life imprisonment to death for six crimes when death occurs murder 
for hire hostage taking murder in aid of racketeering 
kidnapping murder of a foreign official and genocide 
additionally it would create five new death penalty offenses 
murder by a federal inmate serving a life sentence drug kingpins 
in a continuing criminal enterprise even if no murders occur drug 
kingpins who try to kill to obstruct justice drug felons who 
unintentionally kill with aggravated recklessness and people who 
kill with a firearm during a violent or drugtrafficking crime 
the house committee version is more restrictive for example it 
would not allow capital punishment for such offenses as mail 
bombing bank robbery murder in aid of racketeering murder by a 
federal inmate serving a life term or murder of a federal 
officials relative 
the house panel also dropped from the list the killing of horse 
meat poultry and egg products inspectors 
some of the estimated 10000 federal agriculture inspectors do 
face danger said tony imhof usdas assistant general counsel for 
legislation 
though he recalled no recent killings he said inspectors 
sometimes are assaulted meat production and packing operations are 
a very tough business imhof said its not conducted by 
phds

republicans should press for tax cuts to head 
off a recession that democrats are helping to cause gop budget 
negotiator rep newt gingrich says 
parting with president bush over the need for new taxes but 
supporting the presidents push for a cut in the capital gains 
rate gingrich said wednesday his tax cut package would cost 10 
billion to 15 billion 
it will be clearly dramatically less expensive than a 
recession said gingrich rga the no 2 house republican 
gingrichs call for tax cuts contrasts with bushs concession in 
june that higher taxes would be needed to reduce the massive 
federal deficit details emerged earlier this month of an 
administration package that included more than 20 billion in new 
taxes among them higher levies on alcohol and a limit on the 
deductions allowed for state and local income taxes 
gingrich said his proposal may include reducing the capital 
gains tax rate providing tax breaks for firsttime home buyers 
and dramatically boosting the personal exemption allowed on income 
tax 
he also is considering proposing a cut in the social security 
payroll tax setting up new individual retirement accounts and 
providing more tax breaks for manufacturers he said 
gingrich stressed that his differences lie with democrats he 
singled out senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine a 
stalwart opponent of cutting the capital gains tax rate 
the country faces a recession which frankly i believe senator 
mitchell has frankly been planning for and which i think his 
behavior has clearly helped lead to gingrich said 
a spokeswoman for mitchell would not comment 
gingrich said he believed there is a real danger of a 
recession especially since the persian gulf crisis has boosted 
petroleum prices and sent other ripples through the us economy 
he said tax cuts are the only way to avert such an economic 
downturn 
i believe the number one goal of the republican party should 
be to help the country avoid a recession despite the democratic 
leadership of congress he said 
he also criticized democrats for not offering a 
deficitreduction plan at this years budget talks between 
congressional leaders and the administration 
theyre following a strategy of taking the risk that americans 
will be put out of work for the political advantage of the 
democratic party said gingrich 
the budget talks which began in may have produced no 
breakthroughs and are in recess during congress august break 
bargainers have been looking for 50 billion in new taxes and 
spending cuts for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 and 500 
billion over five years 
bargainers plan to resume their sessions next month with private 
sessions at andrews air force base in maryland just outside the 
capital participants say they believe the secluded location will 
help them work out a deal more quickly

out of service for safety inspections inspectors found no 
immediate visible damage said a railway official on condition of 
anonymity 
an official of the agencys seismic division said the quakes had 
little effect on land because the epicenters were relatively deep 
30 to 36 miles for the two largest ones 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by 
seismographs every increase of one means a tenfold increase in 
magnitude an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause

a member of the senate agriculture committee 
says canadian companies are sending tainted meat to the united 
states and should not be allowed to avoid inspection as the 
administration proposed 
sen thomas daschle dsd said wednesday he has received 
continued reports detailing canadian abuses of the us meat 
inspection law 
the agriculture department has proposed eliminating us 
inspection of canadian meat and poultry imports and wants to 
experiment with ending spot checks 
but daschle said us inspector william lehman from sweetgrass 
mont wrote him last week saying that 40000 pounds of meat he had 
inspected and rejected as sour and putrid on aug 10 
reappeared repackaged and partially frozen at pembina nd on 
aug 15 
lehman said in his letter to daschle that the canadian inspector 
said she was not surprised as this was the second or third time 
this load had been refused entry at the border 
us law makes it a felony to return a product to the united 
states that has been refused entry under any circumstances 
how can we even think of opening the uscanada border with 
no inspection of meat and poultry when canadian companies are 
admittedly sending bad meat from port to port hoping it will get by 
some us inspector i just cant understand said daschle 
he said many examples similar to that exposed by inspector 
lehman have surfaced since he held a hearing in july on the 
agriculture department proposal 
at the request of daschle and sen conrad burns rmont usda 
has said it will extend the comment period on the proposal until 
sept 5 the open border experiment could begin late this year 
or early next year if usda decides to proceed 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm 
released a report critical of the proposal the report recommended 
that if inspection is stopped the department must find another way 
to make sure consumers are protected

the united nationssponsored trade embargo 
against iraq could soon cause a critical food shortage for the 
persian gulf nation says the national food processors association 
iraq isolated because of its invasion of kuwait imports about 
80 percent of its food and stocks are running low the association 
says in its most recent newsletter 
the food processors organization says kuwait which also is 
subject to the embargo has enough canned goods to feed its people 
for several months but since kuwait imports about 96 percent of 
its food those supplies also will run out eventually 
the food processors newsletter quoted government statistics 
showing that american food processors sent about 350 million worth 
of processed foods and beverages to iraq in 1989 
they included 
90 million in fats and oils mainly soybean 
16 million in butter and condensed and evaporated milk 
9 million in great northern beans 
5 million in cheddar cheese in 1990 
6 million in preparations for beverages 
iraq was the 10th largest customer for american food last year 
accounting for about 1 billion of the 372 billion in us 
agriculture exports wheat rice and feed grains make up the 
largest portion of the exports

vegetable growers received an average 6 
percent less at market during the first seven months of 1990 
compared with last year at this time the agriculture department 
says 
the report released wednesday said the downturn occurred 
despite a weatherinduced 19 percent price increase in the first 
quarter 
the winters freezereduced output gave way to 
largerthannormal spring vegetable supplies particularly florida 
tomatoes said the report 
first quarter retail prices for tomatoes peppers and cabbage 
were especially high compared with a year earlier but fell back 
during the second quarter usda said 
processors contracted for more of the five principal processing 
vegetables this year because of strong demand and low beginning 
stocks 
tonnage of processing tomatoes for example was projected at a 
record 111 million tons this year 
given the increased processing tomato tonnage an 8 percent 
rise in green pea output and the 3year average yields for the 
other crops total tonnage for the five major processing vegetables 
will likely range between 15 million and 16 million up from 145 
million in 1989 said the report

americans with assets of at least 500000 
make up only 16 percent of the population but own nearly 285 
percent of the nations personal wealth the internal revenue 
service says 
the 33 million richest americans had holdings in 1986 of 43 
trillion the irs reported subtracting their 500 billion of debts 
left a net worth of 38 trillion almost enough to finance the 
entire federal budget for four years 
in the same study based on 1986 data the irs suggested the 
united states now has well over 1 million millionaires in 1976 
there were 180000 people with a net worth of 1 million or more 
that grew to 475000 in 1982 and 941000 in 1986 
the new report drawing on information from estatetax returns 
supports findings in other recent studies that rich people are 
increasing their numbers and their wealth the irs study offers no 
reason for the changes but other researchers credit seven years of 
growth in the economy and a major overhaul of tax laws 
a similar irs study found that in 1982 22 million americans 
with assets of at least 500000 held 23 percent of the personal 
wealth their net worth totaled 21 trillion 
the new study found that women held 43 percent of total assets 
owned by the 33 million wealthiest but only 29 percent of the 
debts thus their average net worth of 117 million was better 
than the 111 million of the rich men 
women were slightly more likely than men to favor real estate 
investments over corporate stock but among the wealthy in general 
the no 1 investment choice was real estate that was a departure 
from the past the irs said 
considering the relative performance of the real estate and 
stock markets between 1982 and 1986 this reversal was not 
unexpected wrote irs analysts marvin schwartz and barry johnson 
they noted bluechip stock values rose more than 103 percent from 
1982 to 1986 while the average value of new onefamily homes went 
up only 14 percent 
more than onequarter of the richest adults were in california 
558000 and new york 340000 texas battered by declining oil 
prices dropped from second to third place with 250000 florida 
had 238000 illinois 148500 
per capita the irs said connecticut had the largest 
concentration of wealthy people at 327 per 10000 adults 
california had 299 per 10000 the national average was 198 per 
10000 
for statistical reasons the irs did not count the 25100 people 
with net worths of 10 million or more when estimating the wealthy 
in each state although they are included among the 33 million 
they were worth nearly 538 billion an average of 214 million 
each 
average net worth of the rich ranged from 473510 in north 
dakota to 125 million in oregon 
other findings reported in the latest irs statistics of 
income bulletin include

us ambassador thomas r pickering on 
wednesday reported progress by the five permanent security council 
members in drafting a resolution allowing military force to back up 
un sanctions on iraq 
secretary of state james a baker iii called soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze to urge moscow to cooperate more fully 
in isolating iraq a state department official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said baker sought soviet endorsement for a security 
council resolution sanctioning at least minimal use of military 
force to stop iraqi shipping 
shevardnadze asked washington to go slow on seeking un 
blessing for any military action but did not threaten to veto any 
security council resolution to enforce a blockade the official 
said 
soviet un ambassador valentin lozinsky said the main 
obstacle is that force should be used very carefully and at due 
time 
another us official said privately in new york the talks 
between baker and shevardnadze were another reason for hope the 
kremlin will side with washington 
no formal council meeting has been called to discuss a 
resolution authorizing the use of military force 
but an informal private session was called late wednesday at the 
request of jordan and bulgaria who wanted to discuss the hardships 
they were suffering by honoring the trade embargo against iraq 
both countries said they have the right under the un charter 
to consult the security council with regard to a solution of 
those problems 
the meeting ended just before midnight and decided to compensate 
jordan however diplomats said no particular figures were 
discussed 
jordan has temporarily closed its border with iraq because it 
has been inundated with tens of thousands of foreigners since the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait iraq is a major trading partner 
and supplies most of jordans oil the jordanian port of aqaba has 
been hardhit by the cutoff in trade with iraq 
jordan has been allowing some food shipments into iraq on 
humanitarian grounds which is allowed under the sanctions 
resolution approved aug 6 
we are applying for relief because jordan in applying 
sanctions will face enormous economic problems said jordanian 
ambassador samir naouri they are so huge and difficult that we 
will require assistance in overcoming them 
he said it was up to the council to decide whether jordan should 
be compensated for its losses or exempted from the embargo 
bulgarian representatives at the united nations have said their 
country is also feeling the pinch from the sanctions 
bulgaria is a major transshipment point between the persian gulf 
and eastern europe they said while bulgarias total foreign debt 
is 104 billion iraq owes 12 billion to bulgaria and has been 
supplying oil as payment 
at a news conference in kennebunkport maine president bush 
praised the soviets for their superb cooperation with 
washington in dealing with the persian gulf crisis 
bush described differences between us and soviet positions on 
the proposed un resolution as mere differences in timing 
in baghdad senior un officials virendra dayal and kofi annan 
held long talks with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on the fate 
of the 2 million foreigners caught in kuwait and iraq by the 
invasion 
in four resolutions the security council has denounced the 
invasion declared an international economic boycott of iraq 
rejected iraqs proclaimed annexation of kuwait and demanded all 
foreigners be allowed to go home 
but it has not yet approved a blockade of iraqi shipping or 
sanctioned use of force by the usled multinational force in the 
gulf to stop ships 
the soviets the past week have wanted to revive the military 
staff committee before imposing a blockade the committee consists 
of military officers of the five permanent council members to 
coordinate un enforcement actions but it has never had an active 
role even in the 195053 korean war 
the united states britain and france were supportive of a 
unique resolution that would provide a un umbrella but not a 
un flag and command for international warships enforcing the 
embargo 
western diplomats say moscow has been unwilling to increase un 
involvement unless clear and demonstrable failure of the 
embargo is shown 
china had dragged its feet for the same reason but a kuwaiti 
official in beijing said wednesday that china promised not to block 
such a move 
the permanent security council members weighed a 
precedentsetting proposal that would authorize foreign naval 
vessels to use minimum force in policing the un embargo but 
reached no agreement 
the ambassadors of the united states britain and france met 
privately wednesday with the soviet and chinese envoys trying to 
work out language for a security council endorsement of a blockade 
on which all could agree 
on his way into the meeting at the french mission pickering was 
asked if the soviets were blocking progress pickering replied 
well i dont put my finger on anybody well wait and see 
the ambassadors broke off at midday then resumed later 
were making progress pickering saidwere going to 
continue our consultations 
under article 42 of the un charter the security council may 
call for a blockade and enforcement of its embargo through military 
force if sanctions have been violated this article has never been 
invoked 
iraqs president saddam hussein has said he will use the 
thousands of us and british citizens in kuwait and iraq as human 
shields at iraqi military sites and industries to ward off us 
attack

americans will spend a record 384 billion on 
schools and colleges this year yet education secretary lauro 
cavazos says money alone will not buy us superior schools 
cavazos released the department of educations annual 
backtoschool statistical forecast for the 199091 school year 
and noted the spending projection is a 69 percent jump from last 
years estimate of 359 billion the total includes local state 
and federal spending as well as dollars from private sources 
the total consists of current expenditures by local state and 
federal government interest and capital outlays 
this year as in recent years spending by educational 
institutions at all levels will amount to about 69 percent of the 
gross national product the report said 
we can take pride in our continuing investment in education 
but money alone will not buy us superior schools or the wisdom and 
security that education can provide said cavazos holding firm 
to the administrations position that education funding should not 
be increased 
we must keep our attention focused on results he added 
pointing to the national education goals adopted earlier this year 
by president bush and the nations governors 
the report said elementary and secondary schools will have the 
largest spending increase 72 percent over last year from 216 
billion to 231 billion adjusting for inflation this is a 34 
percent increase since 198081 
about 462 million young people will attend elementary and 
secondary schools more than 200000 over last years total the 
report projected 
spending for each student in kindergarten through 12th grade is 
expected to reach a record 5638 in 199091 354 more per student 
than last year after adjusting for inflation perpupil spending 
has risen about 33 percent over the last decade 
the average salary of public elementary and secondary school 
teachers is expected to rise to 33300 up 6 percent over last 
years average of 31304 
spending at public and private colleges and universities will 
total an estimated 1525 billion 65 percent above last year for 
each fulltime student the spending is projected at 15596 or 
833 more per student than a year ago 
the report said 136 million students are expected to enroll in 
public and private colleges and universities an increase of more 
than 100000 from fall 1989 
other highlights of the report were 
between 1980 and 1990 the states with the largest enrollment 
increases as a percentage of total enrollment have been alaska 
utah nevada florida arizona california and texas since 1985 
new mexico and new hampshire also have had large enrollment 
increases 
the high school graduating class of 1991 is expected to total 
about 25 million nearly 200000 fewer students than in 1990 
reflecting a decline in the 17 and 18yearold population 
this fall about 73 million people will be employed in the 
nations schools and colleges about 100000 more than a year ago 
nearly 28 million will be classroom teachers at the elementary and

the horrific fighting between 
rival black factions is part of a growing power struggle that 
threatens south africas stability and hopes of building a 
multiracial democracy 
the fighting that has raged in black townships around 
johannesburg since aug 12 pits zulu supporters of the conservative 
inkatha movement against xhosas most of them supporters of the 
african national congress 
more than 500 blacks have been killed in savage battles with 
guns spears knives and axes 
while the struggle between inkatha and the anc centers around 
ideological and leadership disputes the fighting is increasingly 
turning into a war between the countrys two largest black tribes 
some fear the fighting is the start of a war for control of the 
country 
has the descent into a beirutstyle apocalypse begun asked 
the sunday times the countrys largest newspaper in an aug 19 
editorial 
at a time when president fw de klerk is moving to end 
whiteminority rule many leaders fear blackonblack violence is 
spinning out of control 
a culture of violence is becoming part of south african 
life they say undermining efforts to establish a peaceful 
democratic society 
many political leaders fear the recent fighting around 
johannesburg will be worse than the conflict between anc and 
inkatha supporters in the eastern province of natal which has 
claimed about 5000 lives in the past five years 
white and black leaders are increasingly concerned that black 
violence could derail negotiations to end white rule many whites 
are reluctant to accept a black government saying it will usher in 
more violence 
the high incidence of unrest points to a revolutionary 
climate and that is dangerous at a time when restraint is 
necessary in order to negotiate said one official who declined 
to be named 
the divisions between the anc and inkatha are varied and 
complex tribal and leadership differences and a struggle for power 
are at the heart of the rivalry 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi is determined to play a 
national role in south africa if whiteminority rule ends many anc 
leaders appear equally determined to exclude buthelezi from any 
future black majority government 
anc leader nelson mandela has rebuffed buthelezis calls for a 
meeting to help end the violence anc leaders have rejected peace 
talks saying inkatha is responsible for the violence 
inkathas power base is in rural areas where tradition is 
strong zulus 7 million strong were the dominant tribe before 
white conquest in the last century and many still recall their 
nations power 
the anc draws much of its support from young city dwellers 
throughout the country though many of its top leaders are xhosas 
there are about 6 million xhosas in the country 
inkatha and the anc both oppose apartheid and were allies 
briefly in the 1970s but have become increasingly hostile toward 
one another during the past decade 
the two groups differ in their visions of a postapartheid south 
africa the anc leans towards socialist remedies to solve black 
poverty and wants to end tribal differences inkatha favors a free 
market economy traditional society and is largely based on zulu 
nationalism 
buthelezi participates in the homeland system created by the 
whiteminority government saying blacks must run their own affairs 
as an interim step on the road to black majority rule the anc says 
buthelezi has sold out to the apartheid system because he heads the 
kwazulu homeland in natal 
fighting between the anc and inkatha in the black townships also 
ignites random violence between other groups drawing in criminal 
gangs looters and terrified people simply trying to stay alive 
in the squalid black townships ringing south african cities 
violence has become a daily part of life for blacks competing 
desperately for survival caught by hopelessness and poverty 
violence is one of the few ways for blacks to vent their anger 
the causes of black violence are numerous and complex reasons 
cited include apartheid poverty school boycotts and lack of 
education political and ideological rivalries the collapse of 
authority in black townships gangs and corruption

skeptics about the wisdom of president bushs 
decision to risk war in the persian gulf are beginning to speak out 
and some of the sharpest criticism comes from conservatives who 
usually are in bushs corner 
the critics argue that the potential risk is not worth the 
potential gain that the fight is over no higher principle than 
cheap oil that bush is talking multinational response but acting 
unilaterally that the united states cannot afford this 
confrontation 
they argue that bushs comparison of iraqs saddam hussein with 
nazi germanys adolf hitler is overdrawn and closes the door on 
compromise they says that hitler threatened civilization itself 
while saddam threatens only to raise the price of gasoline and 
has replaced one autocratic regime in kuwait run by billionaire 
oil emirs with another autocratic regime run by himself 
thus while public opinion seems solidly behind the president 
bush is being challenged by some who think the deployment can only 
lead to longlasting trouble 
military strategist edward n luttwak a pentagon adviser and 
senior fellow at the conservative center for strategic and 
international studies for example cites both moral and strategic 
reasons in questioning bushs decision to defend saudi arabia from 
a possible iraqi attack 
saudi arabia luttwak said is a regime whose members are 
still gambling on the french riviera as radio baghdad says 
once people in the united states find out what were defending 
they will revolt against it 
but iraq cannot be blockaded into submission luttwak said some 
food will get through and anyway the iraqi government can 
increase the availability of food just by not supplying the kurdish 
areas 
even such a stalwart hardliner as jeanne kirkpatrick former 
us ambassador to the united nations seems reserved in her 
support 
the burden weve assumed the responsibility weve assumed 
she told interviewers last week is larger than our national 
interest 
the president was lucky in one respect the crisis arose just 
as congress was leaving on a months vacation lawmakers who might 
harbor misgivings are apparently content to let home sentiment take 
shape before they speak out 
senate minority leader bob dole a reliable bush ally suggests 
the broad support for the presidents massive commitment of force 
will soften if the troops stay for a long time 
what will it be in 30 days or 60 days or 90 days dole asked 
last week during a visit to portland ore 
a wall street journalnbc news poll conducted last weekend found 
7216 percent approval for bushs handling of the crisis but 
respondents split almost evenly 4342 percent on whether the 
united states should take military action if iraq refuses to 
withdraw from kuwait one of bushs stated goals is to force 
saddams withdrawal 
the rev william sloane coffin jr the former yale university 
chaplain who became nationally known for his leadership of the 
antivietnam war movement thinks bush moved too fast and too alone 
i dont see why we have to have an enormous buildup he 
said it is just asking for trouble it is provocational 
an invasion of kuwait or iraq itself would be moral folly 
coffin added when one side has chemical weapons and the other 
nuclear weapons as well fighting fire with fire could leave only 
ashes 
bushs goal is too fuzzy to command the sacrifice of the 
american people says one critic with a chestful of battle ribbons 
retired rear adm gene la rocque 
a veteran of world war ii and vietnam who has been active in the 
peace movement for 18 years la rocque said his own son in the navy 
anticipates being sent to the gulf region any day now 
there is no clarity of purpose in our action said la 
rocque head of the center for defense information we dont know 
if its for the oil or were trying to preserve world order or just 
trying to punish saddam hussein its just as unclear in our 
purpose as we were in vietnam 
la rocque joins those who fault bushs comparison of saddam to 
hitler this is about oil he said 
by using the hitler analogy wrote newspaper columnist 
patrick j buchanan who served in the reagan white house mr 
bush is virtually ruling out any negotiated settlement 
conservative tom bethell washington editor of the american 
spectator questions what principle is at stake 
it is hard to understand why americans are supposed to become 
outraged and pay more at the pump because kuwaits oil is now 
controlled by a tyrant in a military uniform rather than by 
oligarchs in traditional attire bethell wrote in the los angeles 
times 
luttwak added that american public opinion is not cynical and 
materialistic enough to support a military operation driven by a 
desire for cheap abundant petroleum 
bush comes under criticism too on more pragmatic grounds 
that he has created a policy dilemma 
leon hadar an israelborn american citizen and professor of 
international relations at american university worries about the 
fallout 
i think a military confrontation between the us and iraq 
will lead to tremendous chaos to the fall of king hussein in 
jordan to possible involvement of syria and israel in a war over 
jordan hadar said i see major antiamerican radicalization in 
the arab world that will lead to the fall of moderate regimes in 
morocco tunisia egypt and even saudi arabia 
are the american people really willing to have a permanent 
force of 50000 to 100000 troops in the persian gulf to keep these 
monarchies in power he asked 
take the best case scenario saddam hussein is overthrown 
hadar said who are you going to replace him with the idea that 
the united states is going to find some thomas jefferson in iraq is 
nonsense and for an iraqi jefferson to stay in power youd need a 
permanent american force to back him up

presence in saudi arabia the site of islams holiest shrines 
he urged the arab world to overthrow the saudi and other 
moderate arab royal families and to take back the holy cities of 
mecca and medina 
but fahds resistance to saddam quickly gained the blessing not 
only of most neighboring arab governments but also of the 
influential ulema the learned moslems of saudi arabia who have 
helped keep the alsaud dynasty in power 
the 67yearold monarch with the spadelike beard is publicly 
committed to arab causes and a scrupulous promoter of the islamic 
faith 
in 1986 he dropped his majesty insisting that his title be 
custodian of the two holy shrines the kaaba in mecca and the 
tomb of mohammed the prophet of islam in medina 
our king is amiable extremely generous but can be as angry 
as a volcano in dealing with crimes against religion or attempts to 
undermine the security of the kingdom the kings halfbrother 
prince sattam told the associated press in a recent interview 
fahd the head of the clan that includes 4000 princes has 
disclosed little about his personal life he is often listed as the 
secondrichest man in the world with 18 billion after the sultan 
of brunei 
aides portray fahd as a workaholic and builder who combines the 
traits of bedouin chivalry munificence and global political vision 
but while friends portray fahd as a desert ascetic critics 
speak more of a man who enjoys the good life they point out he 
owns a 3600ton yacht called the atlantis a private 747 jet and 
palatial mansions in riyadh jiddah taif dammam london 
marbella geneva outside paris and in the riviera 
in his bid to talk his opec partners out of seeking higher oil 
prices fahd said that oil prices are tied to the prices of food 
and manufactured products imported by the oilexporting countries 
the kingdom at the onset of fahds rule was exporting 93 
million barrels of oil a day which dropped in august 1985 to a 
mere 14 million fahd accepted the burden of absorbing the drop in 
revenues while other oil exporting countries were trying to outbid 
each other by exceeding their production quotas and offering price 
discounts 
fahd has harnessed oil resources to promote prosperity and build 
modern highways cities and armed forces 
fahd ascended to the throne shortly after the outbreak of the 
islamic revolution the advent of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
iran the iranians tried to turn mecca into a hotbed of political 
action and terrorism during the annual hajj pilgrimage seasons 
fahd decided to break relations with tehran in 1988 
arab diplomatic sources said arab oil countries mainly saudi 
arabia and kuwait together poured an estimated 34 billion into 
iraqs coffers to defray baghdads war costs with iran no one 
knows in precise terms the breakdown but indications were the 
kuwaitis paid about 11 billion and saudi arabia about 18 billion 
the saudis on several occasions offered to help iraq and iran 
with billions of dollars for reconstruction and development if they 
halted their protracted war which ended with a ceasefire in 1988 
but the offer went unheeded by both sides 
fahd is credited for his efforts to try to end 15yearold 
lebanese civil war and for a 1982 plan for a comprehensive 
arabisraeli peace 
the plan envisaged a comprehensive peace treaty between israel 
and the arabs based mainly on israels withdrawal from all arab 
territory seized during the 1967 middle east war in return for 
secure and recognized borders for all countries of the region 
it also called for an independent palestinian state in the west 
bank of jordan and the gaza strip with the arab sector of jerusalem 
as its capital 
israel rejected the plan

federal health officials want to know why 
black americans must wait nearly twice as long as whites for a 
kidney transplant 
it is clear that this is a problem that needs to be 
confronted health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
said wednesday in calling for an investigation following release of 
an inspector generals report 
the median waiting time for whites is 76 months compared with 
139 months for blacks a disparity not accounted for by age blood 
type or immunological factors the report said 
we in government need to do what we can to assure that the 
organ transplantation system works well for minority and 
nonminority americans alike said sullivan who is black 
the longer wait for blacks is particularly important because 
they have higher rates of kidney failure the report said while 
blacks account for 12 percent of the population they make up 34 
percent of dialysis patients 
blacks also are less likely than other groups to donate organs 
only 8 percent of kidneys transplanted in 1988 were from blacks 
the report noted it suggested one reason for this may be that only 
14 of an estimated 300 organ procurement organization coordinators 
across the country are black 
investigators from the health and human services inspector 
generals office analyzed the cases of 17556 people who were 
waiting for or received a first kidney transplant between oct 1 
1987 and march 31 1989 
they also visited organ procurement organizations in california 
florida wisconsin and pennsylvania interviewed transplant experts 
and reviewed other reports and documents on the subject 
though they found no explanation for the racial disparity in 
kidney transplants investigators said other medical factors 
economic status and availability of social supports none of which 
were assessed in the study might account for some of the gap 
the report also suggested that racial prejudice might be a 
factor 
as the number of individuals awaiting a transplant increases 
this disparity becomes an increasingly serious matter warranting 
national attention the report said 
the inquiry focused on kidney transplants because they account 
for 75 percent of organ transplants but the report said we 
believe that most of the basic issues addressed in the report are 
of equal significance to the distribution for transplantation of 
hearts livers and other organs 
the united network for organ sharing which runs the organ 
procurement and transplantation network established by congress in 
1984 is also investigating the disparity 
we realize that theres a problem we would like to understand 
why theres a problem said wanda bond a spokeswoman for unos 
the report recommended the system for allocating donor organs be 
made more equitable with more coordination and cooperation among 
the 250 transplant centers and 72 organ procurement organizations 
across the country 
the current system is heavily controlled by the individual 
transplant centers which are allowed to retain nearly all the 
organs they retrieve 
as of april 21308 people in the united states were on waiting 
lists for organ transplants

the venusorbiting magellan spacecraft 
back in radio contact with earth after twice cutting off 
communication sent flight data home today to help engineers figure 
out what went wrong 
its sitting there doing nothing but talking to us said 
steve wall a magellan scientist at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory were looking for a root cause of the failures 
nasa engineers restored steady radio contact with magellan on 
wednesday afternoon after a hairraising 21hour struggle to 
prevent the craft from becoming lost in space some 149 million 
miles from earth 
this is a nervous nellie ill tell you lab spokesman alan 
wood said 
the successful conclusion of magellans latest crisis averted 
at least temporarily another big setback for nasa the agency 
temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer because of fuel 
leaks and also discovered the 15 billion hubble space telescope 
had a flawed mirror that produced blurry images 
wall said he suspected there might be separate causes for 
magellans latest radio cutoff which started tuesday night and 
for the first communications breakdown which lasted 22 hours 
beginning aug 16 
but he said we do not believe anything like a massive failure 
occurred 
wall said that evidence suggests a cosmic ray or highenergy 
particle from the sun disrupted magellans electronics to cause 
last weeks problem while the latest failure raises suspicion of 
flaws in the ships hardware or computer programs 
ed sherry a magellan official said programs in the backup 
computer appeared to be corrupted and engineers will rewrite 
them to try to solve at least part of the problem 
magellans emergency systems also appeared to have 
malfunctioned complicating nasas efforts to make magellan call 
home so engineers sent computer commands to the spacecraft to 
disable some of the systems 
just as they did last weekend engineers also ordered magellan 
to unload its computer memory banks wednesday night the process 
continued today 
the patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy 
but needs an operation and we dont know which operation right 
now said tommy thompson magellan science manager 
wall said the start of magellans 744 million mission to make 
the most detailed pictures and maps yet of venus misshapen 
landscape will probably be postponed until the problem is solved 
scientists had hoped to use magellans radar to peer through the 
planets thick clouds during the first week in september 
the spacecraft was launched from the shuttle atlantis 15 months 
ago then looped around the sun 1 times traveling 948 million 
miles before it slid into orbit around venus on aug 10 
long considered earths twin gone bad venus is similar to earth 
in size mass and distance from the sun but it was turned into a 
hellish inferno with 900degree surface temperatures because of an 
outofcontrol greenhouse effect 
scientists want to know if the same geological forces that 
shaped earth also sculpted venus 
magellans first test pictures of venus were released hours 
before tuesdays trouble they show a landscape broken by quake 
faults giant solidified lava flows volcanic cinder cones 
collapsed craters and long ridges and valleys

puerto rico he is the only black agent in charge of a bureau field 
office 
the appointment by fbi director william s sessions was made

the new york times reported wednesday on the appointment 
rochon had charged in civil lawsuits that he was racially 
harassed by white agents when he worked in the fbis chicago 
office among other things he claimed his family received

agreement the week of aug 5 that settled the 3yearold legal 
battle the settlement brought rochon full pay and pension 
benefits possibly worth a total of more than 1 million kairys

the bush administration wants to supply 12 
million worth of training and equipment for the haitian army to 
provide security at the nov 4 election the state department says 
we believe the haitian army which has supported the electoral 
process and the provisional government of mrs president ertha 
pascal trouillot must guarantee security on election day 
department press officer david denny said wednesday 
he said congress has been notified of the administrations 
proposal for a 12 million package of nonlethal aid but no 
further action has yet been taken 
the us aim is to foster free and fair elections in haiti and 
the establishment of a democratically elected government that has 
the support of its people denny said our desire is to prevent 
violence at the thousands of polling places where haitians will 
cast their votes he added 
the proposal is considered controversial because the haitian 
army was blamed for bloodshed at the november 1987 election that 
prompted the united states to halt aid to the caribbean island 
nation 
a department official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the proposed 12 million package would come from funds not 
requiring appropriation by congress but serious opposition from 
lawmakers might prompt abandonment of the proposal

legislation to give california a major 
role in the 1992 presidential race by moving up its primary to the 
week after new hampshires has won a key vote in the legislature 
a conference committee wednesday decided 50 to send the 
proposal to the floor of the senate and assembly for a vote before 
the legislature adjourns aug 31 
the proposal would move the presidential primary now on the 
tuesday after the first monday of june up to the first tuesday in 
march supporters say that could transform it from an afterthought 
into the nations dominant early primary 
were trying to become a stronger player in national 
politics said sen ken maddy republican minority leader 
maddy declined to speculate on whether the measure would pass 
and assembly speaker willie brown a democrat said no such 
legislation would be approved without first getting support from 
all party leaders of both houses 
the proposal would leave all nonpresidential primaries in june 
but many republicans want to move those primaries to september 
because its june primary follows those of other states 
california hasnt had a role in choosing either partys 
presidential nominee since 1964 in the republican race and 1972 in 
the democratic race 
that is the case even though the state has the nations largest 
primary and picks more than 20 percent of the delegates needed for 
either partys nominationin 1988 the california primary had 368 
delegates at stake for democrats and 175 for republicans 
supporters of the bill say that because of the states late 
primary presidential hopefuls ignore california except for brief 
visits to raise money for their races in new hampshire iowa and 
other early primary and caucus states new hampshire has the first 
primary of the season 
opponents argued that it would stack the political odds even 
more against lesserknown candidates they said california is so 
big that the only way to compaign successfully is through expensive 
tv advertising meaning candidates who can raise early campaign 
contributions have an edge 
the other political ramifications of an early california primary 
are subject to debate california voters tend to be more liberal 
than those in new hampshire but the state is much closer to the 
national average than its image suggests 
a big early western primary could also focus more attention in 
presidential races on western issues such as trade relations with 
the far east and offshore oil drilling and other environmental 
issues 
the last time the state proved crucial in the primaries was 
1972 when george mcgoverns california victory over hubert 
humphrey gave him his narrow margin of victory for the democratic 
nomination 
barry goldwaters victory over nelson rockefeller in 
californias 1964 primary was the last time the state played a role 
in picking the gop nominee

a former military ruler is challenging a 
decision barring him from running for president this fall saying 
he will use all legal means to get on the ballot 
efrain rios montt a retired general said the ruling wednesday 
by the national election board is a decision by a group of 
citizens who are unaware of what the true rule of law is 
speaking to a news conference shortly after the ruling he said 
the conservative threeparty coalition fielding him will appeal 
by law rios montt has three days to appeal through the courts 
his coalition of the democratic institutional party national unity 
front and guatemalan republican front has until sept 12 the 
deadline to get him registered 
a bornagain christian rios montt was one of a long line of 
rightist military strongmen who ruled guatemala for more than three 
decades until vinicio cerezo a civilian christian democrat was 
elected for a fiveyear term in january 1986 
rios montt succeeded fernando romeo lucas garcia another army 
general in a march 1982 military coup until the army replaced him 
with gen oscar humberto mejia in august 1983 
election board officials at a heavily guarded news conference 
announced the decision to ban the candidacy of rios montt board 
chairman felix castillo milla said the ruling was based on 
provisions in the guatemalan constitution 
castillo milla cited legislation stipulating that neither the 
head and leaders of a coup armed revolution or similar movement 
that has altered the constitutional order nor those who have 
assumed the head of government as a result can run for president 
or vicepresident of the republic 
in a nonbinding opinion asked by congress last year the 
supreme court held that rios montt is barred from serving as 
president or vice president because of the constitutional ban 
in his 17 months as president rios montt cracked down hard on 
leftist guerrillas and common criminals and executed more than a 
dozen leftists by firing squad 
among these were five shot during a visit by pope john paul ii 
to guatemala despite a plea by the pontiff that he spare their 
lives 
in his bid for a comeback rios montt has been waging a tough 
lawandorder campaign 
this has given him a strong good showing in opinion polls among 
voters fed up with guatemala rising crime rate but has activists 
worried that he might win and his eyeforaneye brand of justice 
could lead to further abuses in a country already plagued with them 
guatemala citys mayor alvaro arizu irigoyen of the national 
advance party is the only candidate the board has approved so far 
it still has to rule on applications by jorge carpio nicolle and at 
least six other candidates 
carpio nicolle a journalist running for a coalition of the 
national center union and the national authentic central party 
lost to cerezo four years ago 
if no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast in the nov 11 
balloting the election will be decided by a runoff jan 6

president bush says he has no 
intentions of giving up vacation jaunts on his power boat but he 
does want americans to conserve energy and enjoy their summer 
vacations 
bush said during a news conference at his vacation home on 
wednesday that there is no reason to expect an oil shortage 
despite a reduction in world oil supplies cause by iraqs invasion 
of kuwait and a subsequent international embargo on iraqi trade 
im going to keep using my boat and i hope the rest of 
america will prudently recreate said bush who has taken 
excursions on his boat fidelity during his vacation 
i dont think weve reached the point where i want to call on 
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody 
thats taking a vacation in america to shut it down the 
president said 
persian gulf tensions have meant a 42 millionbarrel daily 
reduction in oil on the world market but there had been a supply 
glut and other oil producing nations are expected to make up much 
of the shortfall 
before iraq invaded kuwait the united states was importing 
between 600000 and 700000 barrels per day from the two nations 
about 4 percent of total us oil consumption there are 42 gallons 
of oil in a barrel 
bush declined to say what conservation measures he favors last 
week energy secretary james d watkins proposed boosting us oil 
production while asking drivers to trim their gasoline use by 
keeping tires properly inflated and obeying speed limits 
were doing everything we can to guarantee that we dont panic 
americans and that there will be an adequate supply of 
hydrocarbons the president said 
i think it is a good time to conserve so im glad you 
reminded me of that and i would call upon americans to conserve 
bush said in response to a question that doesnt mean that life 
screeches to a halt

kuwaits ambassador to the united states is 
accusing jordan of collaborating with the iraqis even offering to 
help them take airliners captured in his occupied nation 
i dont think that the credibility of his majesty king hussein 
is any longer of any value sheikh saud nasir alsabah told a 
washington news conference on wednesday hours after the monarch 
announced in amman he would embark on a new round of talks with 
arab leaders to defuse the crisis 
its quite evident to us now that he hussein is condoning 
the occupation of kuwait by iraq he is condoning the taking of 
hostages by the iraqi regime the envoy added 
sheikh saud said king hussein apparently fears that the iraqis 
will come out before the whole world and expose what i would term 
a regional conspiracy between iraq and jordan 
the envoy promised more details of this in the future but as an 
example of the collaboration of the jordanian regime with iraq 
he said only tuesday jordan volunteered to send pilots to kuwait to 
ferry kuwaits fleet of airbus airliners to iraq 
the iraqis dont have pilots so experienced in airbuses and 
the jordanians have volunteered to come and fly and take the loot 
out and take them to baghdad he said

the united nations has emerged from 
decades of coldwar paralysis to act with resolve in the persian 
gulf crisis fulfilling the mission envisioned by its founders 
keeping the peace 
the 15member security council which has the primary 
responsibility for preserving peace has acted with unprecedented 
decisiveness in taking action to counter the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait largely as a result of the recent ussoviet 
rapprochement diplomats say 
although the soviet union counsels caution and the united states 
urges swift approval of a resolution allowing military force to 
back up un sanctions against iraq the superpowers have largely 
acted in concert during the crisis 
since iraqi troops moved into kuwait on aug 2 the security 
council had adopted four resolutions with near unanimity 
the council has denounced the invasion declared an 
international economic boycott of iraq rejected iraqs proclaimed 
annexation of kuwait and demanded that all foreigners in iraq and 
kuwait be allowed to go home 
spearheaded by its five permanent members the united states 
the soviet union china britain and france the council also met 
abruptly monday night for informal consultations and successfully 
put pressure on yemen the councils only arab member to refuse to 
allow an iraqi tanker to unload 
we are seeing unprecedented cooperation within the security 
council us ambassador thomas r pickering said recently and 
we want to preserve consensus 
for the first time since the united nations was created 45 years 
ago the moribund military staff committee of the security council 
is showing signs of life the committee consists of military 
officers of the five permanent council members to coordinate un 
enforcement actions but it has never had an active role even in 
the 195053 korean war 
the big five council members are exchanging information 
about the naval situation in the gulf 
the soviets have said in recent discussions that soviet forces 
would be engaged in the gulf only in the context of an 
authorization from the united nations they want the military staff 
committee to play a role in overseeing any military action 
the united states has been less enthusiastic about this 
proposal preferring that us forces preserve their prerogative 
for independent military action 
the united states britain and france were supportive of a 
unique resolution that would provide a un umbrella but not a 
un flag and command for international warships enforcing the 
embargo 
china has joined the soviets in urging that enforcement go 
slowly and that any actions are taken in accordance with the un 
charter 
for nearly four years the big five have been meeting informally 
at least twice a month in what has been called a tea party a 
behindthescenes get together to shape the formal public council 
meetings 
in the current crisis the permanent members have been meeting 
almost daily and sometimes twice a day to coordinate strategy and 
resolve their differences 
with the easing of tensions between the superpowers the 
security council has found it easier to reach a consensus regarding 
other regional conflicts the iraniraq war namibia central 
america cambodia and the western sahara 
the move toward consensus first became apparent in july 1987 
when the security council adopted resolution 598 demanding a 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war but back then the five permanent 
members still found themselves divided over how to enforce the 
resolution and unable to move beyond rhetoric 
the soviet union was selling arms to iraq china was selling 
arms to iran and iraq and both were unwilling to stop 
iran finally agreed to the un ceasefire and peace plan 
because it was exhausted by the war not because of security 
council enforcement analysts say 
the first time the council acted with unanimity was in 1951 in 
korea when the council authorized the united states to command an 
international force after north korean forces invaded south korea 
however the soviet union was absent from the council meeting 
that approved the usled force 
in the cold war years the united states and soviet union both 
used their vetos in the security council to block resolutions 
considered detrimental to their interests and the united nations 
role in peacekeeping became less effective

jurors deliberating 14 drug and perjury 
charges against mayor marion barry were so divided on a possible 
verdict that they even argued over points not contested by either 
side a published report says 
examining evidence in the trial that resulted in barry being 
convicted on one misdemeanor cocaine possession count acquitted on 
another and in a mistrial on the other 12 counts the jury divided 
into a strong proconviction camp and an equally strong 
proacquittal camp the washington post reported in todays 
editions 
in the third day of deliberations the jury argued over whether 
the substance barry was videotaped smoking from a pipe was really 
crack cocaine or whether it was baking soda or sugar the 
newspaper quoted jurors as saying 
one bloc of five middleaged and older black jurors voiced a 
deep distrust of the governments case agreeing with barrys 
claims that he was set up by white government officials out to 
get black politicians 
the other bloc believed the evidence against barry was so 
overwhelming it had no choice but to convict 
during the debate over the white rocklike substance in an 
evidence bag that even barrys lawyer kenneth mundy did not 
dispute was crack cocaine one juror walked away in disgust the 
post said 
how do you change someones mind when they look at an evidence 
bag theres crack in and they say its not crack said one juror 
although barrys defense as well as the proacquittal block of 
jurors believed the mayor was on trial because of his race the 
proconviction bloc of jurors included four black women all 40 or 
younger the two whites voted predominantly for conviction the 
post said 
on the deadlocked counts the closest the jurors came to 
conviction was 10 to 2 the newspaper said the closest they came 
to acquittal was 9 to 3 the remaining undecided counts split 6 to 
6 and 7 to 5

the official iranian news agency quoting 
an informed source said thursday that a european hostage held 
in lebanon would be freed in the next few hours 
the islamic republic news agency said the hostage to be freed 
was likely to be brian keenan an irish national held since april 
1986 
the news agency carried a similar report on an imminent release 
in july which proved to be false 
keenan 39 an irish teacher of english at the american

next months asian games are expected to test 
iraqs ability to force international recognition of the baghdad 
governments claimed annexation of kuwait 
on wednesday kuwaits foreign minister ruled out any 
possibility of sending a joint kuwaitiraq team to the 11th asian 
games which open in beijing on sept 22 
that leaves open the chance that the governmentinexile will 
send one team and the iraqiinstalled administration in kuwait will 
send another 
the kuwait embassy in beijing which represents the 
governmentinexile said kuwaits soccer team was training outside 
kuwait at the time of the aug 2 iraqi invasion and could attend 
the games the whereabouts of other kuwaiti athletes however 
remain unknown 
according to the constitution of the olympic council of asia 
all 38 member nations are entitled to send athletes to compete in 
the asian games the spokesman for the games organizing committee 
wu zhongyuan said in an interview 
but if two teams claiming to represent kuwait show up the 
council not china would have to decide which team was 
legitimate wu said 
whoever the oca recognizes we will recognize he said 
adding that there has been no offical discussion of the issue yet 
the earliest a decision might be made would be sept 19 when the 
councils 12member bureau plans to hold a special meeting in 
beijing to select an acting president 
the councils president sheik fahad alahmed alsabah was 
killed aug 2 while defending the kuwaiti royal residence from 
invading iraqi troops the sheik brother of kuwaits ruler was to 
have presided over the asian games 
the chinese organizers so far are continuing to recognize the 
exiled government at a trial award ceremony a few days ago the 
kuwait flag was raised and national anthem played the embassy said

west african leaders have failed to 
arrange a truce in the liberian civil war with rebel chief charles 
taylor whose threats have kept a west african military force from 
intervening in the conflict 
taylor refused to attend the talks wednesday in banjul and 
reportedly told journalists in rebelheld liberian territory that 
the peace plan was a ploy to keep president samuel doe in power in 
monrovia the liberian capital 
taylors representative at the talks tom woeiyou vowed after 
the negotiations broke down that the rebel faction would try to 
repel with all the force we can muster a military unit 
organized by the west african leaders to halt the 8monthold war 
that has claimed more than 5000 lives 
the intervention force has been waiting to set sail from 
freetown in sierra leone another west african country for 
several days 
taylor threatens to attack any foreign troops who intervene in 
the conflict his forces invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 to 
oust doe who they call corrupt 
sources close to the negotiations said lt gen arnold quianoo 
of ghana commander of the west african task force was deciding 
whether his soldiers should fight their way into monrovia given 
the casualties and damage that would result 
president joseph momoh of sierra leone visited about 3000 
soldiers from gambia ghana nigeria and sierra leone in freetown 
on wednesday night official sources said the troops were due to 
leave on troop transports from freetown wednesday night but hours 
later the ships remained at anchor 
other countries contributing troops to the west african force 
are guinea and togo 
doe and taylors rebel rival prince johnson welcome the west 
african intervention they declared a ceasefire monday that would 
help the task force since johnsons men control monrovias port 
area 
west african leaders decided to intervene aug 6 they said the 
war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their 
citizens were trapped in monrovia and about 400000 liberian 
refugees were burdening neighboring states 
the sources spoke wednesday on condition of anonymity

government rebel gen michel aoun said wednesday the 
parliamentary session yesterday was the last chapter of a 
conspiracy against lebanon aouns radio lebanon quoted the him 
as saying it did not elaborate 
the reform plan approved tuesday was worked out by lebanese 
legislators under arab league auspices in 23 days of deliberations 
at the saudi arabian town of taif in october 
aoun has rejected the taif peace plan along with hrawis 
election as president with strong syrian backing nov 24

us district judge robert aguilar risks 
impeachment and up to 10 years in prison after being convicted of 
leaking a wiretap to a former mobster and lying to the fbi 
aguilar 59 on wednesday became the third federal judge 
convicted of a felony in the last decade 
he was acquitted of three other charges including the main one 
that he agreed to use his influence with a fellow judge on behalf 
of a former teamsters leader convicted of embezzlement 
the federal jury deliberated more than four days it was the 
second time aguilar was tried on the charges at his first trial 
in march a jury deadlocked on seven charges and acquitted him of 
one 
aguilar 59 who was appointed by president carter in 1980 
could get five years in prison and a 250000 on each offense at 
sentencing nov 1 
aguilar also could be impeached and removed from office by 
congress unless the convictions are overturned on appeal 
defense lawyer paul meltzer said he expected to appeal he 
refused to say if aguilar might resign to avoid impeachment 
i think it ends a long and distinguished career meltzer 
said of the verdict i dont think were going to see judge 
aguilar continue as a federal judge after his sentencing unless 
something happens at a later date 
in 1984 us district judge harry claiborne of nevada was 
convicted of tax evasion and in 1986 us district judge walter 
nixon of mississippi was convicted of perjury both were impeached 
and removed by congress the only way a federal judge can be forced 
out under the constitution 
us district judge alcee hastings of florida was acquitted in 
1983 of conspiring to solicit a bribe but he was removed from 
office based on a congressional finding of perjury 
aguilar was convicted of two coverup charges 
disclosing to abe chapman an exmobster and a former relative 
of aguilar by marriage in 1988 that chapman was the subject of a 
wiretap in an investigation of former teamsters leader rudy tham 
aguilar denied intentionally disclosing wiretap information and 
said he was only trying to warn chapman to stay away from tham 
attempting to obstruct a grand jury in 1988 by lying to fbi 
agents who asked him about the wiretap and his involvement in 
thams case 
aguilar was acquitted of charges that he disclosed wiretap 
information to chapman in 1987 and that he advised thams lawyer to 
lie to the grand jury by denying he had discussed thams case with 
aguilar 
aguilar of san jose one of 11 children of poor mexican 
immigrants had established a reputation as a liberal judge he 
ruled against the government in restricting immigration sweeps on 
factories and forbidding the exclusion of a homosexual from the 
country 
aguilar was freed without bail and left the court without 
speaking to reporters

scientists today reported finding a way to zero in 
on abnormal buildups of fibrous deposits and said the procedure may 
someday lead to a better test for alzheimers disease 
doctors in england used a natural blood protein joined with a 
radioactive isotope to find the buildups known as amyloid 
deposits the combination locked onto the fibers so they show up on 
pictures taken with a camera that is sensitive to radioactivity 
initially at least the procedure will be used to diagnose 
systemic amyloidosis in this disorder proteins fail to break down 
properly and slowly accumulate in tissues where they form damaging 
fibers 
though the disease is believed to be rare its incidence is not 
precisely known because it is so difficult to identify but 
diagnosing the disease has become important because researchers 
have developed treatments for it 
the new test is the first safe method of locating and fully 
diagnosing amyloid deposits without cutting the body said dr mark 
b pepys of hammersmith hospital in london a coauthor of the 
report in the new england journal of medicine 
until now the only way to diagnose systemic amyloidosis was to 
stick a needle into the body draw out tissue and look at it under 
a microscope however it is easy to miss the deposits and the 
biopsy does not reveal the extent of the disease throughout the 
body 
alzheimers disease the leading cause of senility is 
associated with amyloid deposits in the brain and can be difficult 
to diagnosis in its early stages 
pepys said that researchers have so far been unsuccessful in 
using the new test to diagnose this disorder probably because of 
the difficulty of getting enough of the radioactive material 
through the bloodstream into the brain 
that is one of our objectives pepys said i believe in 
principle it could be successful it is probably just a matter of 
getting the technology right 
in the test doctors bond a normal blood protein known as serum 
amyloid p component with iodine123 the blood protein together 
with its radioactive tag bind to the fiber deposits throughout the 
body 
when the researchers tried the test on 50 people with systemic 
amyloidosis it appeared to identify the extent of the deposits in 
all of them however it did not falsely suggest these deposits in 
36 people without the disease 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal drs alan s cohen 
and martha skinner of boston university school of medicine said the 
discovery appears to be a test of exquisite sensitivity 
while it probably will not replace biopsies they said it will 
be useful when biopsies turn up negative but doctors still suspect 
amyloidosis it also may be effective for checking the progress of 
treatment

a lebanese man arrested as a suspect in the 
1986 bombing of a west berlin discotheque that led to us air 
raids on libya has been released for lack of evidence officials 
said 
the suspect identified by authorities as ali mansur was 
arrested july 25 on a tip from a former east german secret police 
source linking mansur with the april 5 1986 attack on the la belle 
disco 
however west berlin officials issued a statement wednesday 
saying the tip from the former secret police was based on 
thirdhand information obtained from other sources 
under west german law the information was insufficient to 
justify the continued arrest of the suspect the statement said 
the united states blamed libya for the bombing of the disco 
which killed two us soldiers and a turkish woman and injured 229 
people 
the united states retaliated 10 days later by sending warplanes 
to bomb the libyan cities of tripoli and benghazi western 
diplomats say more than 100 people were killed in the air raids 
according to west berlin justice officials at least five other 
people are still being sought in the la belle disco case

a weed called feverfew causes itchy runny 
noses and watery eyes for millions just like ragweed a researcher 
says but unlike ragweed the newly recognized allergy has no cure 
yet 
worse the feverfew allergy is often misdiagnosed as that of 
ragweed meaning many patients pay for treatments that do no good 
said dr h james wedner 
feverfew also called the santa clara feverfew is a basically 
just ugly scrub plant that sprouts from cracks in pavement 
wedner said 
it grows in the same areas as ragweed at the same time of 
year and the symptoms are basically the same very unpleasant 
he said estimating the plants pollen causes problems for 2 
million people in the gulf coast states 
wedners findings were published recently in the journal of 
allergy and clinical immunology wedner is a physician with the 
division of allergy and immunology at the washington university 
school of medicine in st louis 
in the late summer and early fall feverfew spreads misery from 
southeastern texas across the gulf states to southern florida 
doctors said the plant has been found up to 300 miles inland 
wedner said it appears the plant originated in mexico and spread 
northward and eastward the plant also has spread to asia africa 
and australia he said 
the plant was identified as an allergen producer in the early 
1900s wedner said but the conventional wisdom then was that 
feverfew pollen was too sticky and clumpy to become widely 
scattered in the air 
either that assumption was wrong or the plant is changing 
there are plants and feverfew may be one of them that are 
evolving said dr jean chapman cochairman of the aerobiology 
committee of the american academy of allergy and immunology 
feverfew was thought to be insectpollinated and now we know it 
is airborne 
its definitely a significant allergen said dr gary n 
gross an allergist with baylor university in dallas its 
probably something that we just havent paid enough attention to 
wedner said it could take a couple years to produce a treatment

the wine bug phylloxera that devastated the 
worlds vineyards a century ago is back and experts say california 
vintners may have to spend about 500 million during the next 
decade to thwart the pest 
its costly but they will just have to bite the bullet 
jeffrey grannett an entomologist on the university of californias 
phylloxera task force said wednesday its the type of thing 
thats going to be widely felt over many years 
vintners in sonoma and napa counties californias premium 
winegrowing areas are getting ready to replant vineyards with 
vines resistant to phylloxera pronounced fihloxehrah a 
burrowing plant louse 
the cost of the replanting over the next decade could reach 500 
million said vic motto of motto kryla amp fisher a wine industry 
accounting firm 
motto partner mike fisher estimated that more than 13000 acres 
of vineyard will be replanted in the napa valley alone 
there have been 90 sightings of the pest in the valley and 12 in 
sonoma county fisher wrote recently in the trade publication wine 
industry update 
though the threat appears to be real its effect to date had 
been minimal with approximately 100 acres removed he said 
fisher said some growers have used an insecticide that slows the 
spread of the pest but does not eliminate it replanting costs up 
to 15000 an acre and means three to five years of lost production 
while the new vines reach maturity 
the winegrowing regions of france and california were ruined by 
phylloxera between 1870 and 1900 vineyard acreage dropped from 
20000 to 3000 in the fledging industry in napa county 
fisher said that while the cost of replanting is high it is 
unlikely that phylloxera will devastate the industry as it did a 
century ago 
in the 1890s the use of phylloxeraresistant root stock was new 
and the napa valley wine industry wasnt worldclass so many of 
the vineyards were not replanted

the official iranian news agency reported 
today that a european hostage held in lebanon would be freed in the 
next few hours 
the islamic republic news agency quoting an informed 
source said the hostage to be freed was likely to be brian 
keenan an irish national held since april 1986 
irna monitored in nicosia did not name the source but 
correspondents in both its beirut and damascus office said the 
report was accurate they said they did not know specifically when 
the release would take place 
the news agency carried a similar report on an imminent release 
in july which proved false 
in beirut a source close to the syrian command speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the syrian government was notified two 
days ago of the decision to free a european hostage probably 
keenan 
he said arrangements have since been discussed on where when 
and how the release will take place 
the source said he believes the hostage will be handed to the 
syrian authorities somewhere in lebanon and he will be delivered by 
the foreign ministry in damascus to the irish ambassador there 
in dublin the department of foreign affairs said we are 
aware of the report and would point to its speculative nature 
gerben meihuizen the dutch ambassador to syria said he had 
no confirmation of the report the netherlands handles irish 
interests in damascus while their nonresident ambassador declan 
connolly is based in riyadh 
a source at the ministry of information in damascus said they 
had no immediate information about the release 
keenans family in northern ireland reacted cautiously to the 
report 
keenan 39 was kidnapped on april 11 1986 in west beirut while 
walking to his job as an english teacher at the american university 
in beirut 
altogether 14 westerners are believed held by extremist moslem 
groups in lebanon in addition to keenan they include six 
americans four britons two west germans and an italian the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was abducted march 16 1985 
two swiss red cross workers were released separately earlier

biologists have documented the first catch 
of an atlantic salmon in alaska waters raising fears that escaped 
fish from commercial farms will introduce diseases dangerous to the 
states valuable native species 
a troller caught the atlantic salmon july 20 near cross sound 
about 75 miles west of juneau federal biologists confirmed the 
identification this week 
the biologists suspect the fish an immature female of less than 
3 pounds escaped from a commercial salmon farm in british columbia 
or washington state they concluded the fish was probably raised in 
a pen because of scale abrasions a fin that may have been clipped 
and its scale growth pattern 
the risk is based on how many of these fish have escaped and 
how many happen to carry a disease not indigenous to the 
northwest said biologist ken leon of the state department of 
fish and game its not a good situation if it happens in large 
numbers 
dale kelley executive director of the alaska trollers 
association said commercial fishermen also are worried about the 
possibility of disease the group will wait to see whether more 
atlantic salmon turn up she said 
biologist bruce wing of the national marine fisheries service 
said its unlikely a significant population of atlantic salmon 
could become established in southeastern alaska huge populations 
of native salmon would have an overwhelming advantage he said 
like their pacific salmon cousins atlantic salmon are born in 
fresh water spend most of their lives in salt water and then 
return to fresh water to spawn unlike pacific salmon they dont 
always die after spawning 
wing and leon said they did not know if atlantic salmon could 
mate with pacific salmon and produce viable offspring 
the legislature this year banned commercial salmon farming in 
the state commercial pens are common in southern british columbia

tens of thousands of chanting indian 
immigrants greeted their militant political leader todaqy after 
marauding gunmen opened fire on a similar gathering and killed at 
least 28 people 
police said they arrested at least 16 people in wednesdays 
shooting spree which injured at least 50 supporters preparing for 
the return of their leader altaf hussein 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack authorities have 
been careful not to place blame fearing it could set off another 
round of ethnic violence that has claimed more than 500 lives since 
may 
hussein 36 the leader of the militant mohajir qami movement 
refugee peoples movement was in london undergoing treatment for 
a kidney ailment during the last wave of violence 
an estimated 40000 supporters crowded into karachi 
international airport and blocked the surrounding streets to greet 
hussein 
all markets and businesses in karachi the countrys financial 
and industrial center closed hundreds of police and army troops 
in riot gear patrolled the streets 
the mohajir qami movment represents indian immigrants to 
pakistan following the 1947 partition that ended british colonial 
rule of the subcontinent it is demanding recognition as pakistans 
fifth nationality along with the pathans baluch punjabis and 
sindhis 
a planned procession from the airport to husseins home was 
canceled after wednesdays shootings gunmen on motorcycles opened 
fire on booths that were being set up across the city for husseins 
arrival 
everybody knows who was behind it hussein told a news 
conference but he refused to name anyone 
this was done to harass and destroy peace of the city that was 
returning after the dismissal of former prime minister benazir 
bhutto he said the mqm may be the target but all democratic 
forces will suffer 
for years this southern port city of 9 million people has been 
an urban battlefield between rival ethnic and political groups 
authorities estimate more than 2000 people have been killed and 
thousands more injured since 1985 
president ghulman ishaq khan dismissed ms bhuttos governnment 
on aug 6 one reason he cited was the inability to stop the 
killings in karachi ms bhuttos hometown 
the mqm was once ms bhuttos ally but after citing a litnay of 
alleged broken promises the mqm withdrew its support and joined 
her opposition 
the mqm and ms bhuttos leftofcenter party clashed several 
times and the army was called out in may to restore peace

another man she objected to the term lover 
i dont do any dedications with the word lover she said 
we want to keep the show romance not sexual 
asked why her show is called wish for lovers ms klocko

settlement 
were more than happy to say this song goes out from michael 
to michael said chris ackerman the stations general manager 
we wouldnt say from michael to his lover michael any more than 
we would say from bill to his main squeeze jane 
ackerman said the station did not discriminate against davies 
and will state in writing that it will not discriminate on the 
basis of sexual orientation

1973 supreme court decision establishing the right to an abortion 
applied with equal force and effect to guam 
the law signed by gov joseph ada on march 19 banned abortions 
except when the mothers life is in danger but munson on march 23 
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law 
from abortionrights forces 
the law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a 1000 
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to 
have an abortion performing an illegal abortion was punishable by 
up to five years in prison 
two days after the law went into effect an american civil 
liberties union lawyer janet benshoof of new york was charged 
with violating the measure by publicly encouraging women to seek 
abortions in hawaii the charges later were dropped prosecutors 
said the lawsuit challenging the law was a higher priority 
the governor said he did not know whether he would appeal 
todays ruling 
im still very prolife and i believe that a fetus is a human 
being and should be given life said ada a roman catholic like 
the vast majority of guams residents 
the challenge to the law was brought by an unidentified pregnant 
woman who wanted an abortion the guam society of obstetricians and 
gynecologists the guam nurses association an episcopal priest and 
three doctors 
anita arriola a lawyer for the abortionrights side had argued 
that the law introduced by her mother territorial sen elizabeth 
arriola was contrary to roe vs wade and was passed to promote a 
particular religious belief 
katherine a maraman representing the government of this us 
possession in the western pacific had argued that 99 percent of 
all abortions on guam were not necessary but were for the 
convenience of the mother 
in his ruling munson said sections of the law are vague and 
that the provision against soliciting an abortion violates the 
right to free speech 
arriola said the decision sends a very clear signal to 
governor ada and the guam legislature and other legislatures around 
the country 
this decision means that roe vs wade is still the law of the 
land said lou leon guerrero president of people for choice 
dawn c leon guerrero chairwoman of the guam prolife 
coalition said she expected the ruling because the judge has to 
follow legal precedent 
we figured that it wouldnt be an easy climb said roland 
rivera vice president of guamanians united for life there is 
just the next higher level to pursue

the hotel industry is howling over a state 
agencys request that its employees take unused soap and shampoo 
from hotels and donate it to the homeless 
the leader of an organization for the homeless also criticized 
the plan saying it doesnt seriously help the needy 
a division of the state department of public aid adopted a 
policy asking its workers to contribute unused toiletries 
voluntarily and an agencywide policy might be next department 
spokesman dean schott said wednesday 
the hotelmotel association of illinois objected 
where would you draw the line asked arnold karr the 
groups executive director the next thing that will be taken 
will be the other amenities glasses towels bath mats throw 
rugs and furniture 
karr said it might be better to ask hotels and motels for 
contributions instead 
les brown executive director of the chicago coalition for the 
homeless said other issues the need for jobs affordable housing 
and revitalized communities are more pressing 
its one thing to think about giving soap to the homeless 
people but where are they going to use it brown asked 
despite the criticism the state agency which spends 71 
million annually on programs for an estimated 80000 homeless in 
illinois still may ask every employee to contribute the unused 
toiletries schott said 
the idea was to focus on those items that are complimentary 
and free schott said and i have to emphasize that it is on a 
voluntary basis 
schott said the soap would be distributed to homeless shelters 
around the state

analysts and traders say the massive stock slide will shrink 
company profits and individual consumption they expect capital to 
further flow from the stock market with rising interest rates and 
investors fear of inflation because of soaring oil prices 
the stock decline today began in early morning as investors 
heard reports that saudi arabia might stop september oil delivery 
to japan traders said japan depends on imports from the middle 
east for about 70 percent of its oil needs 
the indexs decline also was linked to bond market weakness 
higher oil prices and wall streets performance said yoshiro

last week four major securities firms asked the finance 
ministry and tokyo stock exchange to take measures to support the

they believe only montary action by the central bank to lower 
interest rates could help boost prices immediately 
hashizume said the bank of japan today bought japanese 
government bonds including the benchmark no 119 10year bonds in 
an attempt to stabilize their prices and lower yields

the state department is advising americans in 
kuwait to plan their route carefully if they try to flee the 
country overland despite orders to iraqi forces to arrest anyone 
identified as a us citizen 
previously the department had advised americans not to try to 
leave kuwait without permission about 500 americans ignored the 
advice and got out the change in the advice was made over the 
weekend and came to light in a statement released by the department 
wednesday 
the statement beamed into the persian gulf over the voice of 
america as such statements are daily announced the 
administrations decision to keep the us embassy in kuwait open 
but with a reduced staff iraq had demanded that foreign embassies 
be closed by friday 
abc news citing iraqi sources in baghdad said troops will 
surround each open diplomatic mission in kuwait when the deadline 
expires the unidentified sources said the troops may prevent food 
from going into the buildings which will be put under virtual 
siege 
defense secretary dick cheney said on abcs good morning 
america that i dont have any way of knowing what they will do 
the presidents made it very clear as have many of the other world 
leaders that we would deem this an illegal act that we have 
legitimate representation with the government of kuwait 
we dont recognize the iraqi annexation of kuwait and i think 
most of us are determined to keep our embassies open i think it 
would be a mistake for saddam hussein to try to close down all 
those embassies in kuwait but hes done foolish things before 
cheney said 
state department spokesman richard boucher asked why the advice 
to americans in kuwait was changed said the situation for 
americans has changed 
the broadcast announcement continued to caution americans as it 
has before that there can be no guarantee for the safety of 
those attempting to cross the border it noted that iraqi forces 
were under orders to stop people identified as american citizens 
boucher said the department had been in touch with 1984 
americans in kuwait since iraq invaded the country aug 2 he said 
the best estimate of the total is still about 2500 with another 
530 or so in iraq 
president bush described them monday as hostages and has 
insisted unsuccessfully so far that they be permitted to get 
out 
iraq had called for all foreign embassies in kuwait to shift 
their operations to baghdad the iraqi capital as of friday 
bush asked at a news conference in kennebunkport maine 
wednesday what would happen when the iraqi deadline is reached 
said well wait and see 
there are about 60 american diplomats and about 60 dependents 
including nearly 30 children in kuwait city boucher said they 
would leave by road for baghdad in the next day or two 
boucher said iraqi authorities had assured the united states the 
diplomats and their families will be allowed to leave the country 
the department said the rest of the embassy staff would remain 
for the express purpose of serving american citizens detained in 
kuwait 
boucher said the reason the diplomats could be spared was that 
their jobs involved dealing with the overthrown kuwaiti government 
a function that no longer exists 
another eight americans who worked for united nations agencies 
in kuwait along with their families may have reached jordan 
tuesday night he said 
mohamed sadiq almashat the iraqi ambassador to washington was 
called to the state department on wednesday to receive a special 
appeal for the release of 12 americans with what boucher described 
as urgent medical problems 
he gave a noncommittal reply and was expected to convey the 
request to baghdad a us official said afterward

the mayor and governor signed an agreement to 
provide housing and other services to 5200 mentally ill homeless 
people by june 1992 but the plan must overcome major obstacles 
before it can be implemented 
tight finances and likely neighborhood opposition to the housing 
could hinder the plan 
this agreement creates a system to replace a revolving door 
said gov mario cuomo on wednesday we believe that with a home 
and some help men and women can rebuild their lives 
under the plan new housing enhanced with social services will 
be developed for 3300 people other kinds of housing will be found 
for another 1900 people 
learning from the mistakes of the past we must begin to 
create housing and service programs that conform to the special 
needs of these people said mayor david dinkins 
emmanuel lemakis president of friends and advocates of the 
mentally ill issued a statement saying the plan does not go far 
enough the additional units announced today will barely make a 
dent he said 
peter p smith president of the partnership for the homeless 
was more optimistic weve seen similar ambitious plans 
announced before with precious few results smith said all 
the indications are that this new plan is different 
the agreement brought a formal end to years of infighting 
between the city and the state over responsibility for the 
thousands of mentally ill people who are shuttled between 
psychiatric hospitals shelters and the streets 
dr billy e jones the citys commissioner of mental health 
mental retardation and alcoholism services said the siting issue 
is the biggest concern 
everybody is going to say yes but not in my neighborhood 
jones said 
money may also be a concern the 27 million in state funds that 
the program will require this year was approved by the legislature 
in the spring but only with difficulty with the 
republicancontrolled senate proposing to eliminate at least 7 
million from the package 
mental health officials say they will need about 30 million in 
each of the next two fiscal years to finish construction and start 
the program which will cost about 50 million a year to operate 
once it is in place

refugees continued to pour into jordan 
today despite a government order to close the border to foreigners 
fleeing iraq and kuwait twoway commercial traffic also flowed in 
defiance of un sanctions 
meanwhile king hussein flew to yemen today on the first stop of 
a round of regional visits aimed at settling the persian gulf 
crisis which began with iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 that 
prompted the usled military buildup in saudi arabia and united 
nations sanctions against iraq 
the jordanian frontier was to have closed to foreigners at 
midnight but a senior security official said 11000 refugees 
mostly egyptians passed through the ruweishid border post early 
today the post 240 miles northeast of amman is the only crossing 
point from iraq 
the security official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
another 20000 people mostly arabs or asians were waiting on the 
iraqi side at rutbah 75 miles east of ruweishid and said jordan 
would allow them in too 
the security official said the refugees were being given a few 
hours grace and indicated the border would be closed to them 
later he did not specifically say when 
we will be breaking the interior ministry rules just this one 
time and we will allow the crowd to cross into jordan today the 
officer said 
he said jordan had notified iraqi authorities of the closing of 
the frontier to refugees and iraq had stopped granting exit 
permits 
the closing of the border to refugees came after king hussein 
complained at a news conference wednesday that jordan simply could 
not cope with the human flood on wednesday 42000 evacuees 
mostly arabs and asians arrived in jordan in the biggest oneday 
border crossing since the crisis erupted 
meanwhile commercial and oil trucks could be seen today 
crossing in either direction between jordan and iraq at a rate of 
one every five minutes 
that indicated jordan has still not implemented the un 
sanctions imposed against iraq 
a senior official at the border post said the border closing 
does not apply to trade between the two countries it only 
applies to people coming in the official spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
jordan has been under increasing pressure from its arab and 
western allies especially the united states to abide by 
international sanctions imposed against iraq to force it to 
relinquish kuwait 
in a visit to president bushs vacation home in maine last week 
king hussein refused to promise he would close jordans red sea 
port of aqaba to iraqbound cargo to comply with the un sanctions 
the un security council and japanese government have agreed to 
help jordan cope with a loss of trade as a result of the un 
embargo on iraq 
jordan says the embargo against iraq will add to the kingdoms 
economic woes because it depends heavily on trade with its neighbor 
iraq has been supplying 90 percent of jordans oil needs but on 
wednesday saudi oil minister thabet al taher said saudi arabia 
would begin supplying jordan with 33000 barrels per day via a 
defunct pipeline taher said it was not yet clear whether jordan 
would continue receiving oil from iraq 
interior minister salem msadeh indicated wednesday that the 
closure of the border to foreigners would only be temporary but he 
did not speculate on how long it would last msadeh said the border 
was being shut because of concern for the health situation of the 
arrivals and to ensure suitable arrangements for their stay in 
jordan 
at his news conference on wednesday king hussein said 185000 
people have arrived in jordan recently only 67000 have gone on to 
other destinations 
we are encountering enormous difficulties in meeting the needs 
of these people he said the refugees jam air terminals the 
port and highways trying to make their way home 
it was not immediately clear if jordan also planned to stop 
iraqi airways flights ferrying daily between 300 and 400 people 
from baghdad

kuwaitis who fled their nation are 
forming a liberation army to lead any military effort to force out 
iraqi occupation forces kuwaits crown prince said today 
we will be reorganizing rearming reequipping with necessary 
arms to take part as an advance team in liberating our country 
prince saad abdullah al sabah said we kuwaitis will never submit 
or surrender to threats or to aggression or to occupation 
prince abdullah the no 2 official in the ousted kuwaiti 
government met with reporters at a hotel where he and other 
kuwaiti officials have set up temporary headquarters at this 
mountain resort 
abdullah declared that the kuwaiti government is alive and 
well and implored world leaders to tighten the economic and 
political sanctions against iraq 
we in kuwait and our brothers in this vital part of the world 
are fully convinced that it is quite necessary that we should 
cooperate together and to fight and to struggle by all means 
available to us to free kuwait he said 
abdullah said he was convinced iraq was planning to launch an 
attack on saudi arabia next in an effort to gain control of its oil 
and other riches 
the unjustified and unlawful aggression has shown to all the 
world the real designs and the real expansionist ambitions of the 
iraqi regime he said 
abdullah flanked by other kuwaiti officials said some kuwaitis 
who fled have returned to their country to take part in a 
resistance movement others he said were preparing to take up 
arms in case a military assault is made to force the iraqis out 
we will fight and fight and fight until we drive out the 
aggressors from our country he said we will do everything we 
are willing to sacrifice everything not only our money and our 
funds but also our blood to liberate our country 
the resistance movement he said is growing day by day it 
has been escalating and will continue to escalate 
abdullah said two or three members of the al sabah royal family 
had been arrested in kuwait other kuwaiti officials said the emir 
was in the hotel but would not meet with reporters 
he is too formal said ali jaber al sabah a member of the 
royal family who serves as marketing director for the 
governmentowned kuwait petroleum co 
jaber said the company is making arrangements to purchase about 
250000 barrels of saudi crude on a daily basis so that it can 
supply its gas stations in europe he said he also was negotiating 
with other persian gulf oil producers the oil operation is being 
run out of london 
jaber said kuwaitis still in their country have reported that 
two palaces are being used as concentration camps for women and 
children arrested at demonstrations 
they are beating the hell out of them he said 
jaber said recent reports indicate food is getting scarce in 
kuwait but that looting was not as common as in the days 
immediately following the aug 2 invasion 
unarmed boys are walking the neighborhoods to deter looting 
jabr said

a top civil defense officer went on national 
radio today to urge israelis to stock food tape shut windows and 
mix a homemade antidote to defend against a possible iraqi chemical 
attack 
the announcement on stateowned army radio was the governments 
first public response to israeli fears that their country could be 
a major target if the persian gulf crisis leads to war 
despite repeated threats by president saddam hussein of iraq 
that he would answer an american military strike with a chemical 
attack on israel government leaders have put off a decision on 
nationwide distribution of gas masks 
todays newspapers published advice on how to wear gas masks and 
defend against a chemical attack stores reported israelis were 
rushing to buy tape to seal windows and baking soda which can be 
used in homemade gas masks 
this is not a threat against our existence but we need to 
protect ourselves col dov peled head of the civil defense 
division for protective gear said in the radio broadcast 
outlining the precautions he said we advise that there be 
enough food for the family for a week or two that there be a first 
aid kit insulating tape for sealing windows 
the most important thing is to listen to the radio and 
therefore you need a transistor radio with extra batteries and it 
is important to explain to the kids what to do he continued 
peled also told his listeners that even without gas masks they 
could protect themselves against a chemical attack 
you can cover your face with a handkerchief or towel soaked in 
baking soda mixed with a liter of water this solution increases 
protection you also need to cover the exposed parts of your body 
only use natural fibers peled advised 
the government decision wednesday not to hand out gas masks 
apparently was made because of fears their distribution could cause 
panic or be misinterpreted by the iraqis as a signal that israel is 
preparing a preemptive strike 
but many israelis already have begun to buy gas masks rather 
than wait for free ones from the government 
ezra tzur a private importer sold out his stock of 1000 masks 
within hours wednesday after placing a small ad in a newspaper the 
yediot ahronot daily wrote the masks sold for the equivalent of 
149 apiece 
israeli worries about an attack were also evident in shopping 
patterns 
at the supersol supermarket in downtown jerusalem baking soda 
was sold out today and the next shipment was due friday 
we are selling four or five times more baking soda than 
usual said manager rifka yizhak she said there was no run on 
canned goods 
at houminers hardware store in jerusalem manager avraham yosha 
reported a 40 percent increase in the sale of insulating tape 
emergency lights jerry cans for water as well as portable toilets 
and wash basins that can be used in shelters and sealed rooms 
todays maariv daily carried two pages on how to seal a room 
use a gas mask and inject oneself with medication against nerve gas 
but some israelis hardened by five wars exhibited bravado or 
indifference in the face of iraqi threats 
im not worried about an iraqi attack i havent bought any 
baking soda and im not stocking food said yael a 35yearold 
jerusalem housewife who was shopping at the supersol 
another shopper 74yearold bunny sachs who came to israel 11 
years ago from johannesburg said ive seen so much in my life 
that im not going to get upset over this

pentagon officials say rutgers university is 
the first school to cut scholarships to rotc students because of 
the armed services prohibition against homosexuals serving in the 
military 
rutgers said tuesday that it will stop handing out four merit 
scholarships each year to rotc students critics of the move said 
it had the wrong target because it could deny room and board to 
needy students 
the militarys policy is as outmoded as their former policy on 
women and blacks was said david burns a rutgers vice president 
our intent was not to deny the program to a certain group of 
students but to open it to all 
maj doug hart a defense department spokesman said rutgers was 
the first school he knew of that protested the policy by cutting 
scholarships to rotc students other schools have taken measures 
that range from polite lobbying to kicking rotc off campus 
rutgers policy forbids discriminating against people because of 
their sexual orientation that clashes with a defense department 
rule that homosexuality is incompatible with military service 
about 1400 men and women are discharged from the services each 
year for violating the rule pentagon officials said in february 
the supreme court upheld the pentagon policy by declining to hear 
two cases opposing the law 
an official at the american council on education which 
represents 1600 colleges and universities agreed with rutgers 
ends but criticized the means as harsh on students 
what are they doing penalizing students for upholding the 
policies of the united states which have been upheld in every court 
case said sheldon steinbach general counsel for the ace 
students are being used as hostages on a matter of principle 
and ethics said steinbach who argued for congressional or 
presidential action instead

east germanys chaotic young democracy agreed 
today to abolish the nation on oct 3 and turn the territory over 
to its rich western neighbor lawmakers from both sides will hold 
their first joint parliamentary meeting shortly after unification 
the decision on the unification date following a lengthy 
debate was priased by leading west german politicians in bonn 
volker ruehe general secretary of west german chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democratic union called the decision an 
historic event for germany after more than four decades of 
division 
the decision most importantly gives the people of the gdr 
east germany grounds for confidence ruehe said 
west german finance minister theo waigel called the decision a 
reasonable solution waigel said the chosen date also takes 
into consideration the international political aspects of 
unification and leaves sufficient time for both germanys to 
prepare for the final step of unity 
otto lambsdorff the head of west germanys centrist free 
democrats the junior coalition partner in kohls government said 
the decision on the date of unity gives the people in the gdr 
hope 
kohl was to address a special session of the west german 
parliament later today to give his assessment of the east german 
parliaments decision 
after an 11hour debate lawmakers overcame a damaging political 
feud and voted overwhelmingly to unify with west germany on oct 3 
nearly one breathtaking year after the hardline communist 
government was toppled 
the lawmakers also approved an election treaty with west germany 
that will allow germans in both nations to elect a single 
government on dec 2 for the first time in nearly 60 years 
the rare moment of agreement in the east german parliament has 
resulted in a timetable for german unification that is all but 
certain 
weary lawmakers burst into applause when parliament president 
sabine bergmannpohl announced the truly historic event at 250 
am they voted 29462 to set oct 3 as the date the nation becomes 
part of a single germany seven abstained 
the date falls just four days before east germany would have 
celebrated its 42nd anniversary following last years anniversary 
massive strikes and demonstrations toppled communist party chief 
erich honecker leading to the opening of the berlin wall the 
countrys first democratic elections and first noncommunist 
government 
the oct 3 unification date was a compromise between the major 
factions in parliament after a weeks of battling that tore apart 
the broad coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
east germany in effect has approved a clause in the west german 
constitution that allows former german lands to accede to the 
western nation the agreement is a major psychological boost to a 
troubled nation crushed by economic and political chaos during its 
crash program to shift from communism to capitalism 
de maiziere urged the lawmakers to accept oct 3 as the day of 
german unity and end the seemingly pointless squabbling over 
whether unity should take place in august september or october 
many people have gotten the impression discussions over a date 
are more important to us than the solution of crucial problems 
de maiziere told parliament 
a binding commitment and an end to the discussion are long 
overdue he said 
the weekslong dispute was the result of a power struggle 
between the christian democrats of de maiziere and kohl and the 
leftleaning social democrats in both nations 
the two parties are jockeying furiously for the best political 
advantage heading into dec 2 elections 
many lawmakers acknowledged the convoluted wrangling that in 
recent days has seemed to have lost relevance as average east 
germans struggle with rising joblessness and higher prices 
i ask you who even understands our desires asked gregor 
gysi head of the reformed communists the thirdlargest party in 
parliament 
the social democrats had said unity should take place no later 
than sept 15 so west germany can deal directly with east germanys 
serious economic problems 
but the social democrats also were pressing for the early unity 
so kohl would be blamed at the polls for the high costs of bailing 
out east germanys woeful economy 
de maiziere had been pressing for oct 14 the date east germans 
will elect governments for the five states the nation will become 
in a united germany 
unemployment has been climbing since east germany converted to a 
free market on july 1 factories have been unable to compete with 
an invasion of western products 
west germany says it is crucial that unity not occur before the 
oct 12 meeting in new york of foreign ministers from the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
the meeting will cap a series of negotiations between the two 
germanys and the four world war ii allies the united states the 
soviet union britain and france which together have hundreds of 
thousands of troops stationed on german soil 
in those negotiations the soviet union dropped its opposition 
to nato membership for a united germany in exchange for a promise 
its troops in what is now east germany can remain there for up to 
four years also reached was an agreement that a united germany 
would not try to claim lands forfeited to poland after nazi 
germanys defeat in 1945

two un envoys checking on foreigner 
hostages in iraq and kuwait were told their organization is a 
tool of the us government the iraqi news agency said today 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz told them the world should 
pressure the united states to withdraw its forces from the persian 
gulf region because saddam hussein had tied the fate of the 
foreigners to us actions 
hours later iraqs health minister appealed to three 
unaffiliated organizations to pressure the united states and 
other countries to drop the economic embargo imposed on iraq after 
it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the minister salam m saeed sent letters to the world health 
organization the food and agriculture organization and unicef 
saying the embargo contradicted international law and threatened 
all iraqis with starvation especially children and the elderly 
said ina 
the economic sanctions would lead to the spread of disease 
effecting not just iraq but the whole world saeed said 
the un officials virendra dayal and kofi annan met aziz in 
baghdad on wednesday to discuss the future of an estimated 2 
million foreigners in the two countries baghdad says western 
hostages are being placed around military installations to prevent 
an attack by western forces in the persian gulf 
still aziz assured the two envoys the foreigners were being 
well treated they are the guests of the iraqi people ina 
quoted him as saying 
their situation is linked with the intentions of the us 
administration the international community must put pressure on 
the us administration to stop the policy of war and aggression 
withdraw its forces from the region and leave regional affairs 
alone to be tackled within the arab context he said 
ina monitored in cyprus quoted aziz as telling the two that 
the un security council had become an american tool he said 
this marks the beginning of a dark period in the history of the 
united nations 
aziz said the united nations should be working for peace on the 
basis of saddams proposal to free foreigners in exchange for the 
withdrawal of the usled multinational force and the lifting of 
the trade sanctions 
dayal who is the top un political officer and annan the 
head of personnel were to wrap up their talks with iraqi officials 
today un spokeswoman nadia younes said they had a substantial 
and detailed discussion with the iraqi foreign minister 
they are also seeking to discuss the fate of un employees and 
their families in the two countries seventyfive have left but 
the united nations wants to evacuate the remaining 235 
the united states has led efforts to impose mandatory sanctions 
on iraq to force it to pull its forces out of kuwait 
iraq has already started housing the detainees around key 
military and civilian targets saying they would be a shield to 
prevent an american attack 
while most asian and arab workers have been permitted to leave 
the country up to 20000 westerners are barred from traveling the 
largest communities include 4500 britons and 3000 americans 
tens of thousands of arabs and asians and several hundred 
westerners have escaped into saudi arabia or across the border with 
jordan 
but jordan said wednesday it was closing its border until those 
already taxing the countrys emergency services have left the 
country

in an apparent effort to influence japans response 
to the persian gulf crisis iraq has moved japanese nationals from 
kuwait to baghdad and refused to allow them to depart for jordan 
japan said today 
the move by iraq came one day after an official in tokyo said 
the japanese government is committed to giving aid to arab 
countries that support the economic boycott designed to punish iraq 
for invading kuwait on aug 2 
the iraqi ambassador was summoned to japans foreign ministry 
and told that baghdad should permit the japanese to leave 
the foreign ministry said 178 japanese had moved in three groups 
to baghdad from the japanese embassy in kuwait where they had 
taken refuge soon after the invasion another group of 62 
reportedly was following 
eight of the 178 then traveled to jordan the ministry said the 
rest joined about 200 japanese who are not permitted to leave iraq 
japan has decided in principle to compensate jordan for losses 
if it joins the sanctions against iraq a japanese official said 
wednesday on condition of anonymity but the timing of the aid and 
the amount have not been determined 
prime minister toshiki kaifu rejected a suggestion by an 
opposition leader that japan directly negotiate with iraq over the 
hostages 
kaifu was quoted by kyodo news service today as saying the 
united nations is dealing with the thousands of westerners detained 
by the iraqis and it would be difficult for japan to move by 
itself 
kaifu thus turned aside baghdads apparent attempt wednesday to 
divide the western nations when it said some french and japanese 
citizens could be permitted to leave as a goodwill gesture 
only two japanese diplomats were left as a skeleton staff at the 
embassy in kuwait iraq has demanded that all foreign missions in 
kuwait city close by friday the united states and other nations 
have said they will not comply 
the japan government supports the unmandated economic 
sanctions against iraq but it is in an extended debate over the 
shape of its promised further steps against iraq japan is limited 
by a constitution that bans the use of force to settle 
international disputes 
details of the proposed financial aid package for arab countries 
that have opposed the iraqi invasion have yet to emerge 
but it would require billions of dollars to help jordan egypt 
and turkey recoup the loss of oil transit fees and income from 
citizens working in iraq

armenias parliament overwhelmingly passed a 
declaration of independence today becoming the fifth of the 15 
soviet republics to move toward separation from the kremlin 
the decision increases pressure for the soviet union to split 
into separate countries even as president mikhail s gorbachev 
struggles to develop a new union treaty attractive enough to keep 
his nation whole 
but armenias path to independence may be complicated by its 
bloody twoyear conflict with the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan in the southern soviet union over the disputed territory 
of nagornokarabakh 
the armenian declaration of independence was approved by a 
vote of 1832 legislator samvel shakhmuradyan said in a telephone 
interview from yerevan the capital of the small republic bordering 
with turkey and iran 
the resolution declares the beginning of the process 
establishing independent statehood according to an english 
translation sent to the associated press 
shakhmuradyan said he expects the republic to remain part of the 
soviet union only during a transition period to complete 
separation but he did not specify how long that might take or what 
other steps would be taken 
the declaration says armenia will have a multiparty political 
system and freedom of expression the press and religion tass 
reported the declaration calls for separation of legislative 
executive and judiciary powers 
the resolution invalidates the soviet constitution in armenia 
and will itself become the basis for a new armenian constitution 
the republics current constitution will remain until a new one is 
written shakhmuradyan said 
the resolution grants citizenship to all residents of the 
republic and to any armenians living outside its borders 
the resolution also called for creation of armed forces to 
safeguard the armenian border which is often the scene of violent 
conflict with azerbaijanis a nationalist opposition force 
estimated to have at least 5000 wellarmed fighters has been 
operating for some time in the republic though it was unclear 
whether they would make up the new force 
when lithuania declared independence in march gorbachev 
rejected the move and started a 10week war of nerves that included 
intimidating troop movements and an economic blockade on all oil 
and most natural gas shipments in late june however lithuania 
agreed to freeze its declaration in return for negotiations on 
independence expected to begin soon 
the neighboring baltic republic of estonia which followed 
lithuania with a declaration of a transition period toward 
independence was expected to begin its formal negotiations with 
the kremlin today 
latvia is also expecting to begin talks in the next week 
georgia has declared its intention of moving toward independence 
five other republics also have declared sovereignty or the 
right to overturn soviet laws on their territory they are russia 
the largest of the 15 republics the ukraine byelorussia moldavia 
and uzbekistan 
armenias new nationalist president levon terpetrosyan said 
the resolution was an historic decision allowing armenia to set its 
own relations with the world including with neighboring 
azerbaijan and other soviet republics according to the independent 
news agency interfax 
but the declaration is likely to further strain relations with 
azerbaijan because it includes a statement on armenias inherent 
right of reunification with nagornokarabakh a largely armenian 
area in azerbaijan 
during the armenians threeday debate leading up to passage of 
the declaration the president of azerbaijan criticized the 
republic and called for soviet sanctions against armenia 
the armenian declaration also changes the republics name from 
the armenian soviet socialist republic to the republic of 
armenia 
earlier today tass reported that troops drove several hundred 
armenian guerrillas out of the kazakh border region of azerbaijan 
after three days of battles and attacks on villages 
several local residents and troops were killed and wounded and 
100 homes were destroyed by the armenian shelling the official 
soviet news agency said 
the southern republics of armenia and azerbaijan have been 
engaged in a bloody conflict since february 1988 over 
nagornokarabakh a mainly armenian enclave inside azerbaijans 
borders 
in an attempt to end the dispute and other ethnic violence in 
his multiracial country president mikhail s gorbachev last month 
ordered all outlawed guerrilla groups to turn in their weapons and 
disband 
the decree was largely ignored and the deadline was extended 
into september after armenia elected a new nationalist leader 
terpetrosyan 
he pledged that local militia would disarm the paramilitary 
groups if the kremlin held back federal troops 
maj gen g malyushkin deputy commandant of nagornokarabakh 
and adjoining azerbaijan border regions said the armenian 
guerrillas used modern weapons in their attack on the azerbaijani 
border region 
tass said they included missile and grenade launchers 
malyushkin said inadequate laws prevented his troops from 
pursuing the bandits across the border and they escaped into 
armenia tass reported 
reinforcements from the army and interior ministry kgb agents 
tanks and armored vehicles have been dispatched to the region and 
helicopters are searching overhead for armenian paramilitary units 
tass said

the government has instructed port 
authorities not to unload an iraqi oil tanker a port official said 
today an indication that yemen is honoring the trade embargo 
against iraq 
the port official who identified himself only as capt barakat 
said the port was told not to receive or deal with the tanker ain 
zalah anchored near the aden oil terminal 
the red sea country told the un security council earlier this 
week that it would adhere to the un sanctions imposed on iraq 
after its invasion and annexation of kuwait 
shipping sources said they did not know when the ain zalah 
arrived at aden but a western diplomat said he had been told it 
was early wednesday 
the ship is one of four iraqi tankers anchored near aden 
shipping sources said the empty products carrier baba gurgur and 
the empty oil crude tankers alfao and alqadissiyah are also 
anchored outside the oil terminal 
the baba gurgur was one of two iraqi tankers that refused to 
stop saturday when us navy frigates fired warning shots across 
their bows iraq has said the baba gurgur sailed to aden to pick up 
a load of fuel oil 
shipping sources said it was shadowed by an unidentified 
american warship until it reached yemeni waters on wednesday 
the alfao and alqadissiyah came to aden after they left their 
anchorage in the red sea off saudi arabia last week when they were 
unable to pick up a load of crude oil a western diplomat said the 
two tankers may have sailed to yemen to find a safe port or to keep 
the pressure on the yemeni government 
government officials have declined to discuss the iraq tankers 
at aden and the nations newspapers which has generally avoided 
criticism of iraq have not reported the decision to honor the 
embargo 
another western diplomat said over the past two days there has 
been a slight shift in proiraqi focus of the yemeni press toward a 
more moderate position the diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity said there have not been any large proiraqi or 
antius antisaudi demonstrations for two days 
the country was gripped in the first days of the persian gulf 
crisis by demonstrations including rockthrowing assaults on the 
american embassy 
oil executives and western diplomats say yemen needs the revenue 
from its aden refinery and cannot afford to risk drawing 
international sanctions for breaking the un embargo 
but yemen can adhere to the sanctions without publicly siding 
against iraq by ignoring the tankers and refusing them permission 
to load or unload saudi arabia used a similar ploy to turn away 
the empty iraq crude oil tankers

i just listen to the news reports a little more carefully and 
made sure my stuff is all together in one pile in the living room 
and not all over the house said reservist sgt debora probeck of 
deltona beach fla 
any time youre in the reserves in the back of your mind you 
dont count out the possibility that you will go said 1st sgt

of the armys 337th military intelligence battalion 
joseph bellavia 43 a pharmaceuticals salesman from reading 
mass said his eight children are scared and dont want him to go

to pay the piper 
officials did not identify the units that would be activated or 
say when they would be called defense secretary dick cheney 
planned to meet with military officials today before deciding how 
many reservists to call up 
the pentagon said some reservists will be shipped to saudi 
arabia while others will take the place of troops dispatched to

brooks said her unit spent a week training at pope air force 
base in north carolina this summer and members were in high spirits 
a lot of people think of those in the guard as weekend 
warriors but those days are over she said 
some employers were taking stock of their personnel to determine 
the effect a callup might have on their work forces fhp health 
care of utah reported that as many as 45 of its employees could be 
called to active duty

line between being a captain and being a candidate

the zodiac gunman was a noshow again 
police ended their fourth dragnet of the summer today without 
catching the shooter who has killed one man and injured three 
others since march 8 and has promised to strike again 
operation watchdog was called off at 8 am said police 
spokesman hugh barry no zodiac nothing 
the zodiac task force went out wednesday night anticipating a 
possible predawn attack by the astrologyobsessed gunman who 
apparently has not shot anyone since june 21 
this morning was considered key because it was 63 days from the 
gunmans last attack the four shootings attributed to zodiac 
between march 8 and june 21 have been on thursdays at intervals of 
21 or 63 days 
also of possible significance the astrological sign of virgo 
began today the gunman has vowed in rambling letters to police and 
the news media to shoot one person for each of the 12 signs of the 
zodiac so far his victims have been a scorpio a taurus a gemini 
and a cancer 
all of the victims were men police believe the gunman had 
somehow learned his victims birthdates 
about 50 detectives are assigned to the police departments 
zodiac task force and an unspecified number of officers worked 
overtime to help them today 
during previous dragnets for zodiac police posed as homeless or 
disabled people to resemble the gunmans first four victims 
each of the three previous dragnets cost the city 25000 in 
overtime 
detectives on the task force have tracked nearly 2000 leads and 
eliminated about a dozen suspects since the case began 
investigators frustrated by the zodiacs lack of activity even 
have matched fingerprints from the city morgue against two partial 
prints found on the gunmans letters in an effort to determine 
whether the gunman died 
i can almost say with certainty that if he died his body 
wasnt sent to the morgue said chief of detectives joseph 
borrelli 
some detectives have speculated that the gunman has not struck 
because he is in jail on an unrelated charge or has been 
hospitalized 
borrelli said if the gunman were not caught today the task 
force would probably be reduced to free up detectives to deal with 
the citys rising crime rate 
since the june 21 attack the gunman has not written any letters 
to police or the news media calls to the police departments

hey hey theyre the monkeys and the sneaky stray 
simians are driving people bananas 
trappers have spotted wild monkey colonies for years in the 
area but a recent spate of trouble calls comes from a new crop of 
monkeys escaping from unlicensed owners said exoticwildlife 
trapper todd hardwick 
boy we got monkeys coming out of our ears down here 
hardwick said wednesday since january ive handled probably 35 
or 40 monkey calls just in dade county 
the state issues monkey pet permits only to people who can prove 
they have three years experience with simians he said 
hardwick has caught a dozen stray monkeys in the miami area this 
year 
ive apprehended capuchin monkeys squirrel monkeys spider 
monkeys macaque monkeys marmoset monkeys and two green monkeys 
he said running out of breath monkeys monkeys everywhere i 
dont know whats going on 
neither does the state game and fresh water fish commission 
theres been a very marked increase said commission lt 
kathleen kelley catching them is one of our priorities 
but hardwick said that can be difficult one recent call took 
him to a seventhfloor condominium 
when i stepped on the balcony he smacked me right on the 
mouth the private animal catcher said the bottom line is ive 
faced snakes 250 to 300 pounds id rather do that than tangle with 
a monkey 
the monkeys in hardwicks experience ranging in size from 4 to 
40 pounds are smart and can get violent if cornered 
many of the loose capuchins a favorite of organ grinders have 
their long canine teeth intact and will bite to get away kelley 
underwent a painful series of rabies shots after being bitten 
earlier this year 
everybody else they look at a monkey and say oh a cute 
monkey he said ive had them throw my own traps down at me 
theyll pick avocados and mangoes and oranges and throw them at 
me 
hardwick said the subtropical climate is ideal for monkeys to 
survive in the wild and many people feed the monkeys because they 
see them as cuddly creatures

smokers angry over a cigarette shortage blocked a 
street next to red square pushing their summerlong nicotine 
protest to the heart of soviet power 
the scores of protesters ended their blockade after several 
hours wednesday but only after a truck delivered a dozen cases of 
cigarettes to a nearby tobacco kiosk a line of more than 230 
people formed immediately 
its only a temporary success said protester sergei 
borinov watching the truck driver unload the cigarettes they 
bring something sell it in 10 minutes and again there is nothing 
this is the way we live 
protesters staged another brief blockade of a moscow street 
today stopping traffic near the bolshoi theater a nearby tobacco 
kiosk later opened and sold cigarettes to dozens of people waiting 
in a pouring rain 
long lines snaked from other tobacco kiosks although many of 
them displayed signs saying cigarettes nyet 
deputy mayor sergei b stankevich said 22 of 24 cigarette 
factories have closed for repairs in the russian republic 
the government newspaper izvestia said the soviet union a 
nation of 70 million smokers bought 5 billion fewer cigarettes 
from bulgaria a principal supplier this year because of a lack of 
hard currency 
cigarettes usually cost about about 80 cents a pack but black 
market prices have ranged from 320 to 480 kosmos a premium 
brand has cost up to 8 
severe shortages of even basic consumer goods have plagued the 
soviet economy despite limited marketoriented reform pushed by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
smokers have staged strikes and other demonstrations over the 
acute cigarette shortage that has lasted all summer 
on monday 200 people blocked traffic in leningrad 300 staged a 
similar protest in gorky and 3000 people rallied at a plant in 
yaroslavl the interfax news service reported 
in wednesdays protest held during a steady rain about 120 
soggy demonstrators formed a human chain across the wide street 
from the moscow hotel to the lenin central museum stopping six 
buses and turning back cars 
some passengers patiently waited aboard three of the buses and 
the driver of one of them opened his window winked playfully at 
the protesters and said give me a cigarette 
but the atmosphere was tense at one point 20 testy 
demonstrators surrounded deputy mayor stankevich a radical 
politician elected to the moscow city council along with other 
reformers this year 
they peppered him with questions on when the cigarette shortage 
would end 
this has never happened before a woman shouted at 
stankevich 
why was there a good supply of everything in brezhnevs 
time a man yelled referring to the more stable economy under 
former leader leonid i brezhnev 
when one man suggested the soviet union use some of its gold 
reserves stankevich snapped back gold reserves have nothing to 
do with this 
you see there is a choice for us either we spend money on 
medicine or on cigarettes he said now we have had to take the 
money for medicine and buy cigarettes 
tomorrow invalids will appear in the streets because they 
will not be able to buy important medicine they need then we will 
have to stop buying cigarettes and start buying medicine again 
stankevich said 
he said he had met with prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and they 
decided to raid army storehouses of shag a coarse tobacco and 
deliver it to key points in moscow 
as to cigarettes the situation will improve several planes 
are arriving in moscow they are already landing at the airport 
he pledged 
stankevich said there were no plans to ration cigarettes saying 
it would be too difficult to print and distribute ration coupons 
informally however rationing already exists moscow kiosks limit 
customers to two packs outoftowners to one 
after enduring questions for more than 20 minutes stankevich 
who told his questioners he is a nonsmoker became sarcastic when 
someone suggested starting a rebellion 
yes this is the only thing we know how to do he said his 
voice heavy with irony lets make a revolution this is what 
were accustomed to at least well have a good time 
one woman her wet hair streaked down her face sneered at 
stankevich why are you insulting the people 
stankevich retorted dont speak on behalf of the whole 
people

polish workers returning home from iraq 
said they saw americans arriving at a chemical factory under guard 
a newspaper said today 
that appeared to bear out iraqs assertion that foreign 
nationals would be used as human shields to prevent an attack on 
key installations 
the polish workers account was among the first eyewitness 
reports on what was happening to americans in iraq once they were 
rounded up by iraq 
the united states and other countries have repeatedly demanded 
that their citizens be allowed to leave iraq and kuwait but 
thousands of westerners are being held 
polish workers at chemadex which produces chemicals in alqaim 
told the newspaper gazeta wyborcza that about 35 americans were 
brought to the factory on friday as the poles were leaving the 
americans were under guard the newspaper quoted them as saying 
also workers at a tool factory in alkaiji 35 miles from 
baghdad told the newspaper that iraqi soldiers were moved into the 
ground floor of their building and the soldiers told the workers 
their duty was to guard americans who were being brought to the 
plant 
approximately 3000 americans were stranded in iraq and kuwait 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion of the emirate 
at the onset of the persian gulf crisis about 3000 polish 
workers were in iraq and another 1000 in kuwait most were 
employed by polish construction and engineering firms to build 
roads and railways 
although poland has joined in the united nations trade embargo 
against iraq poles have so far not been blocked from leaving iraq 
or kuwait and several planeloads of evacuees have returned to 
warsaw

former atlanta archbishop eugene marino who 
resigned after having an affair with vicki long has stopped 
sending her money a church spokesman said 
it is my understanding that he has not sent her any money 
after the end of july and he does not intend to send her any of his 
own money in the future the rev peter dora said wednesday 
published reports said ms long received 14000 in money orders 
from may through july from the new york town where marino has been 
secluded 
as archbishop marino was paid 1500 a month and receives the 
same amount from a pension fund dora said he emphasized that any 
money sent to ms long was marinos personal money 
there are no diocese funds going to her at this time there 
will be no money in the future and there will be no settlement on 
any claims she might make against the archdiocese in this regard 
dora said 
marino 56 was the highest ranking black roman catholic when he 
resigned in july citing health reasons the church has since 
confirmed that the relationship with ms long a 27yearold 
riverdale woman led to his resignation 
ms long who has also said she had relationships with two other 
priests and a nun claims she and marino were married in 1988 
a fourmember panel headed by cocacola president donald r 
keough is investigating the churchs financial records to determine 
if church money was improperly paid to ms long 
church officials have acknowledged paying about 15000 in 
medical bills for ms long whose attorneys have sought additional 
financial compensation claiming that she was sexually exploited by 
the archbishop no lawsuit has been filed and the church said it 
will pay no more money

the rev jesse jackson today said iraq has 
granted him permission to visit as a television journalist 
we have received a communique making the visit possible 
jackson said 
he said iraqs foreign ministry had granted the request from his 
new media company the jesse jackson show 
we have not yet determined precisely the time but just as 
other news organizations have pursued the story and interviews and 
sources to get groundlevel firsthand information we intend to 
pursue that said jackson 
jackson said the state department had not given him any special 
guidance nor had it discouraged him from the trip 
the unclassified information that is available to all 
journalists is available to us as well 
jackson has stressed that he would be making the trip as a 
journalist for his new television talk show not as a diplomat 
jackson traveled to syria in 1984 to negotiate the release of a 
navy pilot shot down over that country 
but jackson said earlier this week that journalistic 
communications could encourage a diplomatic solution to the persian 
gulf crisis 
the jesse jackson show is scheduled to begin next month 
syndicated by timewarner inc which jackson said would help 
underwrite the trip

interviewer who provided some translation of the conversation 
one of the officers also repeatedly stroked the head of one 
child as saddam spoke to the young boy the boys were dresssed in 
shorts and tshirts saddam talked briefly with them about playing 
sports 
the iraqi tv broadcast appeared to be an attempt to show that 
the hostages were not being mistreated and gave saddam an unusual 
forum to repeat the iraqi position that the hostages were there to 
prevent an american attack

factory orders for bigticket durable 
goods rebounded 29 percent in july the government reported 
thursday but analysts said the zigzag performance this year 
indicates a listless manufacturing economy that could worsen 
because of the middle east crisis 
orders have been bouncing up and down and the net effect is a 
very weak upward trend said economist cynthia latta of 
drimcgrawhill a lexington mass economic research firm i 
dont actually see the industrial sector in decline but theres 
not much stimulus for expansion there 
economist thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa agreed but added since the middle eastern crisis were in 
a different ball game it makes things a little tougher than 
what we were experiencing before and that was fairly flat 
the commerce department reported that orders for durable goods 
those expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1283 billion after slumping 32 percent in june 
in the first half of the year orders rose during three months 
and fell in the others including a record 105 percent drop in 
january during that time orders totaled 7447 billion a 15 
percent decline from the same period of 1989 
the sluggishness in the manufacturing economy has cost 350000 
factory jobs since that sector peaked in march 1989 including 
another 7000 in july according to labor department figures drops 
in orders normally result in production cutbacks and job layoffs 
ms latta noted that the july increase included a 50 percent 
boost in transportation orders to 349 billion which she said 
will not result in any immediate stimulus to the economy 
a lot of that is aircraft and thats production three four 
five years down the road given the big backlogs that aircraft 
manufacturers have she said 
excluding transportation orders would have risen 22 percent 
defense orders slipped 31 percent to 76 billion after a 219 
percent decline a month earlier but ms latta suggested this 
category will pick up because of the middle east crisis 
there have been a lot of things shipped over to saudi arabia 
to support us military forces there she said there are a lot 
of stock piles that will have to be replenished 
orders for nondefense capital goods jumped 107 percent to 
401 billion this category often is a barometer of business 
investment plans but analysts were hesitant to read anything into 
the july number because of the mideast uncertainty 
orders in all major durable categories rose in july 
nonelectrical machinery up 27 percent to 224 billion 
electrical machinery 19 percent to 204 billion and primary 
metals 15 percent to 116 billion 
shipments of durable goods slipped 20 percent to 1247 billion 
following a 06 percent increase in june unfilled orders rose 07 
percent to 5016 billion more than offsetting a 05 percent 
decline a month earlier

the truth we want our struggle to be peaceful and not bloody he 
said 
lithuania and the two other baltic republics latvia and 
estonia were independent between the two world wars but lost that 
independence as a result of the molotovribbentrop nonagression 
pact the soviets signed with nazi germany in 1939 
the agreement signed by soviet foreign minister vyacheslav 
molotov and germany envoy joachim von ribbentrop placed the 
baltics and eastern half of poland in the soviet sphere of 
influence about a week after it was signed germany invaded poland 
to begin world war ii the soviet union annexed the baltics in 1940 
while soviet authorities thursday refused to relinquish control 
of the border station between lithuania and ogrodniki poland they 
did ease controls that normally hinder poles from crossing the 
frontier 
assisted by authorities on the polish side where there was no 
show of force 1144 poles streamed across the border on foot in 
small groups during a threehour period starting at midmorning 
they said they came to see lithuania and seek out longlost 
relatives 
in addition to poles and lithuanians there were representatives 
from the other baltic republics and czechoslovakia 
the official soviet press agency tass denounced the 
demonstration as an intentional forceful violation of the 
border 
this extreme propaganda action has an illegitimate character 
it pursues primarily political aims and benefits those who are 
interested in whipping up the already nervous situation in 
lithuania tass said 
on the field flags of the baltic republics mixed with banners 
of the polish solidarity movement as well as at least one american 
flag a tent city formed on the field ringed by dozens of buses 
as the weather cleared umbrellas were put away and a more 
festive atmosphere took over sausages and soft drinks went on sale 
and people strolled down to look at the guarded border 
even though lithuania has decided on its independence and a 
lot of other countries recognized it at least informally its 
obvious that the soviet union still has lithuania under annexation 
and occupation said rita dapkus a spokeswoman for the 
lithuanian parliament 
lithuania declared itself independent on march 11 triggering a 
kremlin economic embargo soviet authorities then closed the border 
crossing between the republic and poland 
lithuania agreed in june to suspend its declaration while the 
kremlin lifted the embargo and began negotiations on secession 
those talks are expected to start soon 
organizers had hoped to be able to walk all the way to the 
polish border thursday and welcome poles coming across but they 
were prevented by the heavy cordon of tanks stationed along the 
roadway and by kgb troops in camouflage uniforms with knives in 
their belts police dogs also patrolled the border zone 
independence demonstrators wednesday night read a declaration by 
megaphone to soviet border guards demanding control of the border 
but guards blared loud music through their speakers to drown them 
out

britain will send a second squadron of tornado 
fighterbombers to the persian gulf defense secretary tom king 
said today he said the warplanes will likely be based in bahrain 
we are going entirely for defensive purposes to safeguard the 
territorial integrity of saudi arabia king told a news 
conference 
he stressed that britain will continue to seek the restoration 
of the kuwaiti government which was overthrown by an iraqi 
invasion on aug 2 
he said britain is relying on strict enforcement of the un 
economic sanctions to compel iraqi president saddam hussein to 
withdraw from kuwait 
we must be sure it is effective and it is effective quickly 
we have no offensive plans king said 
he said the government is considering deploying additional 
antiaircraft rapier missiles and other forces to defend the 
tornado squadron 
king said the tornado squadron would provide a roundtheclock 
capability to strike against armored forces 
britain already has one squadron of 12 tornados at dhahran 
saudia arabia and a squadron of jaguar groundattack aircraft in 
oman 
a spokesman for the royal air force said a squadron is usually 
a dozen aircraft but would give no further details 
the foreign office meanwhile said it has accounted for all 
british citizens detained in kuwait and believes that none of them 
are being held at military installations 
the foreign office said today it believed that 135 britons have 
been detained in kuwait two fewer than the total announced on 
wednesday 
we believe that those originally held at a military 
installation may have been transferred to civilian establishments 
in kuwait city said a foreign office official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
there was no evidence that any of the detainees had been 
mistreated the foreign office official said 
a foreign office spokesman said the embassy in kuwait estimates 
that there are 3000 british citizens in that country about a 
thousand fewer than previously estimated 
a halfdozen staff members at the british embassy left kuwait

remain in defiance of an iraqi order that all embassies in kuwait 
be closed on friday mrs thatcher has said britain will maintain

the united states is evacuating some 
personnel from its embassy in kuwait but will leave its ambassador 
and a staff of marines for protection the white house said today 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to discuss 
whether the marines would fight any intruding iraqis 
their instructions are the same as theyve always been they 
provide security for the embassy building itself and the staff that 
remains in it theres no change in that fitzwater told 
reporters here 
he turned aside several questions on whether the marines orders 
could mean an outbreak of hostilities if the iraqis forcibly try to 
close down the embassy on friday as they have ordered 
we dont want to get into any kind of speculation that 
complicates or invites trouble fitzwater said 
things are changing very rapidly we are not trying to pin 
down specific instructions or any kind of pronouncement that might 
cause problems or constitute threats 
he said the nonessential embassy staff reportedly numbering 
more than half of the 120member staff were being transferred to 
baghdad in hopes of arranging transportation for them out of the 
country from there 
iraq in attempt to solidify its occupation of kuwait in the 
face of international opposition ordered the western embassies 
closed by friday as tension in the region remains high 
fitzwater said ambassador nathaniel howell will remain to assist 
other americans who want to leave the iraqicontrolled nation 
there are an estimated 2500 americans in kuwait 
fitzwater met with reporters a day after president bush brought 
the persian gulf crisis into thousands of american homes by 
ordering the nations military reserves to active duty 
officials say the order will take about 40000 reserve 
specialists from their civilian jobs and put them in military posts 
to bolster the us buildup 
bush also said he was undecided whether to wait for united 
nations backing before using force to sustain the trade embargo 
against iraq 
the president stressing the international condemnation of 
iraqs occupation of neighboring kuwait left open the question of 
whether he would militarily enforce the trade embargo against iraq 
without united nations approval 
he told reporters his administration has all the authority we 
need to intercept ships to enforce the unendorsed economic 
embargo but he left a doubt about whether he would take such 
action 
at this juncture im not prepared to say whether were going 
to insist on un action before we go further but i think the 
signal must go out to the world that many countries are prepared to 
fully enforce these sanctions the president said 
bush spoke to reporters after he met at his seaside home with 
defense secretary dick cheney gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff and deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
bush today continued his kennebunkport vacation and tonight 
planned to attend a fundraising event for republican david emerys 
maine congressional campaign and new hampshire gov judd greggs 
bid for reelection 
bushs executive order calling up the reserves will result in 
activation of prsonnel in specialized jobs including airlift food 
and water handling surface transportation cargo handling medical 
services construction and intelligence the white house said 
fitzwater said the callup was not expected to involve the full 
200000 reservists bush may activate without getting congressional 
approval however the president did notify the leaders of the 
house and senate that he was activating the nations reserve forces 
asked about reports that jordan is letting goods be shipped into 
iraq bush said im not sure i know the total facts 
bush said jordans king hussein in a visit to kennebunkport 
last week had assured him that he supported the economic embargo 
but the monarch left unclear whether his country would allow food 
or humanitarian supplies to cross the border 
kuwaits ambassador to the united states accused jordan on 
wednesday of collaborating with the iraqis 
i dont think that the credibility of his majesty king hussein 
is any longer of any value sheikh saud nasir alsabah told a 
washington news conference after the monarch announced he would 
hold new talks with arab leaders in an effort to defuse the crisis 
meanwhile the state department said it now is advising 
americans in kuwait to plan their route carefully if they try 
to flee the country overland despite orders to iraqi forces to 
arrest anyone identified as a us citizen previously the 
department had advised americans not to try to leave kuwait without 
permission about 500 americans ignored the advice and got out 
bush declined to answer when asked about a report that the 
soviet union still had 193 military advisers in iraq despite the 
united nations embargo moscow has supported at this point i 
would say we are getting superb cooperation from the soviets he 
said 
bush said he would encourage energy conservation in light of the 
persian gulf crisis but he also said he would not give up rides in 
his gasguzzling speedboat fidelity and he said the oil supply 
situation is not serious enough to keep people home from their 
vacations

the united states and iraq were on a collision course today over 
baghdads bid to close embassies in occupied kuwait iraq said 
defying the order would be an act of aggression but washington 
warned enforcing it would be a mistake 
one report quoted iraqi sources as saying embassies that failed 
to close by friday as ordered would be surrounded by troops 
defense secretary dick cheney said that would be a mistake on 
the iraqis part 
iraqi tv broadcast a tape of an unusual meeting between the 
iraqi president and a group of western hostages in which the 
smiling saddam hussein talked with children and told them their 
presence in iraq was to prevent a war 
the broadcast appeared to be an attempt to demonstrate that 
those held in iraq are not being mistreated and gave saddam a 
chance to repeat that westerners were interned only to prevent an 
american attack on iraq 
the tape showed a group of adults and children who were not 
fully identified saddam chatted with them smiled and patted 
children on the head during the meeting he said he was sorry they 
were being held and that it will not be for too long 
meanwhile more foreigners japanese this time were reported 
today to have been moved from the emirate to the iraqi capital 
thousands of foreigners including about 3000 americans are 
trapped in iraq and kuwait and saddam has said they will serve as 
human shields against attack 
it appeared that strategy was being carried out polish workers 
arriving home from iraq told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
today that last week as they left the iraqi chemical factory where 
they had been working about three dozen americans arrived under 
guard 
iraq also gave even stronger indications it would use the 
trapped foreigners to try to chip away at international support for 
sanctions against iraq and the multinational force deployed in the 
persian gulf region 
three weeks after iraqs lightning takeover of kuwait tensions 
were running high throughout the mideast 
an israeli civil defense official today urged citizens to stock 
up on food tape their windows shut and mix a homemade antidote to 
defend against a possible iraqi chemical attack 
washington which has deployed thousands of troops to the 
region called reserves to duty and sent minesweepers to the 
persian gulf 
saddam in what iraqi media billed as an open letter to 
president hosni mubarak of egypt today denounced egypt for sending 
troops to join us and other forces in the defense of saudi 
arabia and said arab leaders who failed to support arab causes did 
not deserve to rule his statement was read by an announcer on 
iraqi television 
the five permanent members of the un security council met 
again today the united states has been prodding moscow to endorse 
the use of force to back up the embargo against iraq 
a pair of united nations envoys were wrapping up talks in iraq 
today but reportedly received a cold reception iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz told the two that the un security council had 
become an american tool the iraqi news agency reported 
jordan was still not complying with un sanctions against iraq 
at the jordanian border today heavy twoway commercial traffic 
continued reporters said 
jordan overburdened by thousands of people fleeing iraq and 
kuwait had said it would close its border to foreigners today but 
it was allowing thousands of refugees to cross over nearly all are 
arabs 
the crisis reverberated in financial markets share prices in 
tokyo dived nearly 1500 points today or a 58 percent drop the 
fourthlargest daily drop in its history stock prices were down in 
london as well and wall streets dow jones average fell nearly 44 
points on wednesday 
crude oil prices topped 30 a barrel for the first time since 
november 1985 closing at 3122 a 42gallon barrel wednesday on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
sources close to the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said today some opec nations would gather this weekend to 
consult informally about the skyrocketing oil prices the sources 
who demanded anonymity said oil ministers from at least three 
nations algeria indonesia and nigeria were expected to hold 
talks in vienna 
on the embassy shutdown order iraqs information minister today 
warned foreign governments not to try to keep their missions open 
abc news citing iraqi sources in baghdad said troops would 
surround each diplomatic mission in kuwait that remained open after 
the deadline the unidentified sources said the troops may prevent 
food from going into the buildings which would be put under 
virtual siege 
if they stay they will be acting against our sovereignty 
that would be equivalent to an act of aggression the iraqi 
official latif nassif jassem told the french daily newspaper le 
figaro 
defense secretary dick cheney said today the united states and 
others have made it clear they would deem a shutdown of the 
embassies an illegal act 
we dont recognize the iraqi annexation of kuwait and i think 
most of us are determined to keep our embassies open he said 
today on abc i think it would be a mistake for saddam hussein to 
try to close down all those embassies in kuwait but cheney 
added hes done foolish things before 
the united states said it would cut embassy staff but pledged to 
keep the outpost open britain with 3000 of its citizens stranded 
in iraq and kuwait and other nations announced similar plans 
earlier 
but lebanon and india said today they would comply with the 
shutdown order 
the iraqi information minister also in the interview with le 
figaro linked the fate of french citizens in iraq to their 
governments stance on sanctions and participation in the 
multinational force 
if france distances itself from the polices of the united 
states we would take it into account concerning our decisions 
about the free movement of its nationals and their right to 
travel jassem said 
meanwhile japanese government said today that about 180 
japanese have been moved from kuwait to a hotel in baghdad and that 
all but a handful have been denied permission to leave for jordan 
the move came after japan indicated it planned to aid jordan in 
offsetting the loss of vital trade with iraq as a result of un 
sanctions 
the un move on aid to jordan came after an urgent un 
security council meeting late wednesday night aid to other 
countries affected by un sanctions also was discussed but 
diplomats said no particular figures were discussed 
heavy trucks and other commercial traffic passed through the 
jordanianiraqi border today indicating jordan had not implemented 
sanctions 
jordans king hussein had said he was closing the border at 
midnight wednesday because the flood of foreign refugees mostly 
arabs from iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait had strained the 
resources of his small nation

defense secretary dick cheney today approved 
plans to call as many as 49703 military reservists to active duty 
to bolster the american buildup of forces in saudi arabia a 
pentagon spokesman announced 
some members of the army navy air force and coast guard 
reserve forces could get the call as early as friday said cheneys 
press secretary pete williams 
we will call up only what we need and only when we need it 
williams said 
cheney approved the reserve callup plans presented at a 
pentagon meeting with the service chiefs president bush on 
wednesday authorized the first activation of us reserve forces 
since the vietnam war 
williams said most reserves put on active duty will be sent to 
the persian gulf area others would be placed in domestic posts 
vacated by troops sent to saudi arabia while some could go to 
europe if some us forces from nato countries are sent to the 
middle east 
williams said that by aug 31 the army could call to active 
duty as many as 4912 members of the army national guard and the 
army reserve by oct 1 the figure could rise as high as 24734 
the navy plans to call up 3213 members of the navy reserve by 
aug 31 and an additional 3030 by oct 1 williams said 
the air force callup of members of the air national guard and 
the air force reserve will be 1002 by aug 31 and a total of 
14476 by oct 1 
the coast guard plans to call as many as 700 members of the 
coast guard reserve by aug 31 and another 550 by oct 1 
williams said the marine corps asked for and received authority 
from cheney to call up as many as 3000 members of the marines 
corps reserves by oct 1 but that the marines did not expect to 
actually call any of those to active duty 
williams also said cheney gave the service chiefs the authority 
to delay the planned retirements and departures from active duty of 
those soldiers sailors and airmen in selected critical areas 
deemed vital to the saudi arabian deployment 
williams said he could provide no figures on how many active 
duty personnel would have their retirements or unit separations 
delayed 
among the army reserves to be put on active duty about half 
will perform jobs such as handling of fuel food water and 
ammunition supplies plus truck transport williams said most of 
these tasks would be done in or around saudi arabia he said 
the navy plans to call reservists with skills in dock handling 
and medical services while the air force needs pilots for 
longrange supply flights to saudi arabia williams said 
the callup of reserves will be for an initial 90day period 
williams said bush has the authority to extend a callup for 
another 90 days without declaring a national emergency 
williams said he could not say whether more reserves would be 
called up beyond the 49703 that cheney has authorized 
i dont think anybody knows whats going to happen beyond oct 
1 he said if theres an act of aggression by iraq perhaps 
these numbers will have to be reviewed 
the shift toward greater reliance on reserves began with the end 
of the draft in 1973 but has gone largely unnoticed outside the 
military private analysts said 
this shifting of responsibility occurred with very little 
fanfare or debate and now everybody seems to be caught by surprise 
that were calling up the reserves in this instance said martin 
binkin coauthor of a 1989 study on the reserves 
short of declaring a national emergency the president can 
mobilize up to 200000 of the nations 12 million reservists for 
up to 180 days it is up to the pentagon to determine how the total 
number is divided among the services 
the total active duty force is 21 million 
the transportation department said 40 ships were called up from 
the ready reserve force a fleet of old civilian cargo ships 
maintained for quick deployment in emergencies more ships were 
expected to be activated said transportation secretary samuel 
skinner 
after the draft was abolished the pentagon adopted a total 
force concept that moved many key tasks such as supply 
transport medical services and communications away from the 
professional soldiers to parttime civilian reservists 
the change was designed to ensure that no sustained conflict 
would be fought without the use of reserves the idea was that 
following the publicly unpopular vietnam war the white house would 
be forced to measure national resolve early in any future military 
crisis by bringing civilians into the fighting force 
taking thousands of men and women from their homes and civilian 
jobs to serve on active duty means that towns across the country 
will come to grips with the human dimension of the gulf crisis and 
the personal sacrifice it is requiring 
van d hipp jr deputy assistant secretary of the army for 
reserve forces and mobilization acknowledged the political 
sensitivity of the reserve callup decision 
we realize the tremendous sacrifice that these reservists and 
national guardsmen are going to have to make and their families 
have to make hipp said in an interview wednesday

the bush administration is concerned that the 
soviet union is still providing military advisers to iraq but has 
no evidence they are assisting directly in combat operations us 
officials say 
even so the administration officials are suspicious of soviet 
claims the advisers are kept at a distance and are engaged only in 
training 
the officials said the soviets gave a similar account of their 
advisers during iraqs eightyear persian gulf war with iran 
although soviet advisers were observed near battlefield sites 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
subject did not come up in secretary of state james a baker iiis 
telephone conversation wednesday with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
but they said the united states had registered its concern in 
the past the soviets replied that the advisers had not assisted in 
combat operations and the united states has no evidence they had 
during the invasion of kuwait the officials said 
in kennebunkport maine white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the soviets have continually worked to get their advisers 
and citizens out of there 
their position has been enormously helpful in terms of the 
latitude thats been given for all the countries of the world to 
pursue their opposition to this aggression fitzwater said 
on wednesday col valentin ogurtsov said in moscow that 193 
unarmed military experts were finishing their contractual 
obligations to show iraqis how to use tanks jet fighters and 
missiles and to maintain and repair the hardware 
the soviets joined the us economic blockade of iraq from the 
outset following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the united nations security council voted 130 to approve the 
economic embargo aug 6 and by unanimous vote on aug 9 declared 
iraqs annexation of the smaller persian gulf country to be void 
the embargo includes a cutoff of arms shipments but over the 
years the soviets have been a major arms supplier to baghdad 
another is france 
baker who is on vacation in wyoming sought shevardnadzes help 
wednesday in enforcing the economic embargo 
the response from moscow was a request for a slowdown at the 
united nations where the united states is pushing for a military 
blockade 
but the officials said shevardnadze did not threaten a soviet 
veto or any other effort to stop the us campaign 
in fact the officials said the soviets are using their close 
ties to iraq to urge the release of westerners including 
americans trapped in iraq and kuwait 
in any event the bush administration asserts it already has 
legal authority to enforce the embargo with or without a new un 
resolution 
baker went on his wyoming vacation last week leaving deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger in charge at the state 
department baker also talks frequently to bush by telephone as 
well as to other senior officials including brent scowcroft the 
presidents national security adviser 
bush on wednesday described soviet cooperation with the economic 
sanctions as superb 
soviet support is critical as a permanent member of the un 
security council the soviets could block any resolution with a 
veto and moscow has had a long and warm relationship with iraq 
the soviets want to allow a certain period of time to pass 
before adopting a resolution calling for a military blockade the 
officials said 
one reason is the presence in moscow of a senior iraqi diplomat 
deputy prime minister sadun hammadi he has met with shevardnadze 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and igor belonsov who is overseeing 
the evacuation of soviet citizens from the gulf 
the soviets would like to wait at least until hammadi concludes 
his visit before approving a military blockade the officials said 
i dont think we are in serious disagreement a us 
official said but the soviets are hesitant to move as quickly as 
wed like to in enforcing the sanctions they are not working 
against us but we are looking for their support not just their 
acquiescence

oil prices shot over 32 a barrel today to a 
sevenyear high as traders worried that fighting in the middle east 
could knock out saudi arabian production 
again its the possibility of war and the probability of 
damage to saudi oilfields if a war did occur annlouise hittle 
a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc said 
today the focus is very much on concern that there might be an 
escalation 
in early trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude hit 3210 per barrel for october delivery up 93 cents 
from the previous close the last time the price broke 32 at the 
merc was on aug 16 1983 
on wednesday crude soared over 30 per barrel on the merc 
breaking a threshold that had not been touched since november 1985 
unleaded gasoline futures which hit their sixth straight record 
close on wednesday moved up more than 3 cents per gallon to 1075 
on september contracts this morning 
what the market is looking for at this point is a clear sign 
that there will not be any military escalation hittle said 
its still nervous everybody is still buying if theres a 
change in the political or military situation then well see a 
change for sure but i cant predict that 
analysts said world supplies were starting to feel the crunch of 
4 million barrels of crude lost each day through the boycott of 
iraq and kuwait 
indications that saudi arabia and venezuela want to increase 
production have not materialized also the saudi arabians 
curtailed some previously arranged sales of jet fuel and other 
products to accommodate the massive military buildup on their soil 
oil industry watchers said consumers will be paying even more 
for gasoline at the pump although analysts said there was no firm 
way to translate the rise in futures prices to a predictable rise 
in retail prices 
one analyst said a 1cent rise in unleaded futures can mean a 
1cent increase at the pump 
wall street traders were generally surprised by the abrupt jump 
of crude over the 30 per barrel mark 
as long as this standoff continued i had expected pretty 
volatile markets in the 25 to 30 range said stephen smith an 
oil analyst with bear stearns amp co 
inventories of oil available to the world market have declined 
by about 80 million barrels from the 250 million barrel range 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 smith said 
in other products traded on the merc this morning home heating 
oil for september delivery jumped up more than 4 cents per gallon 
to a price of 96 cents while natural gas was up from 156 to 
160 per 1000 cubic feet for october contracts

trump the game may have 
stumped some players 
at least thats the explanation donald trump offered thursday in 
response to those who said the board game hasnt sold as well as 
expected 
it was unveiled last year with a personal visit from trump and 
glowing sales forecasts at east longmeadowbased milton bradley co 
i dont think overthecounter sales ever made it up to the 
levels that milton bradley thought it would said john g taylor 
an analyst with lh alton amp co in san francisco 
analysts said the personal downturn in the real estate tycoons 
fortunes probably had little effect on the games sales 
were mr trump still at the height of his power and prestige 
the sales results of trump the game would not have fared any 
better said toy industry analyst david leibowitz senior vice 
president of american securities in new york 
milton bradley officials who had planned to produce 2 million 
games did not return repeated telephone calls wednesday and 
thursday from the associated press company president george 
ditomassi was quoted in wednesdays editions of the unionnews in 
springfield as saying the game was a disappointment 
trump who is donating his proceeds of the game to charity said 
the game sold 800000 copies which were priced at 25 to 30 each 
and he believed his donations have amounted to 1 million 
how many games sell 800000 he asked i think it was too 
complicated a game the word of mouth was that the complexity of 
the game hurt it 
the game is a sophisticated battle in which players first bid 
against each other for airlines casinos luxury hotels and other 
trump properties and then try to negotiate deals 
since the games release trump has had to battle to save his 
reallife empire wednesday he completed signing documents related 
to a bailout package and received the first installment of 65 
million in new loans 
the new jersey casino control commission on tuesday approved 
trumps plan to put up his three atlantic city casinos as 
collateral for a 65 million bank loan he received to make a 43 
million bond payment on the trump castle casino 
taylor termed the games performance more sizzle than steak 
it was a timely introduction it was consistent with some of 
the things that were regularly in the press in those days and yet 
it seemed to be something that was more popular in the tabloid area 
than the toy store he said

a cult leader charged with killing a 
family of five said he had a vision that he had helped take christ 
off the cross a prosecutor said thursday 
he claimed that he had visions lake county prosecutor 
steven latourette told jurors in his opening statement for the 
murder trial of jeffrey lundgren 
he claimed that he was in christs head looking through 
christs eyes as christ died on the cross latourette said he 
claimed to have a vision that he helped bring christ from the 
cross 
latourette said lundgren manipulated his scriptural 
interpretations to persuade his followers to help kill dennis and 
cheryl avery and their three young daughters ages 7 13 and 15 
the averys were shot to death last year and buried on the kirtland 
farm where most of the cult members lived 
this defendant conned these oncegood people into supporting 
him and his family he said the evidence will reflect that he 
convinced them to participate with him in the deaths of five 
people 
authorities said the averys may have been killed in a 
soulcleansing ritual for the other cult members before they moved 
to wilderness campsites in west virginia and missouri prosecutors 
also have said the averys may have been targeted because lundgren 
felt they were not sufficiently loyal to the cult 
lundgren 40 a defrocked lay minister of the reorganized church 
of jesus christ of latter day saints is charged with five counts 
each of aggravated murder and kidnapping and could face the death 
penalty if convicted 
his wife alice 39 has been convicted of five counts each of 
kidnapping conspiracy and complicity in the april 17 1989 deaths 
and is to be sentenced next wednesday 
lundgrens attorney charles grieshammer said in his opening 
statement that the defense would not contest the allegation that 
lundgren killed the five 
we are not going to dispute that grieshammer said 
however he said there are a number of conclusions and a 
number of inferences which we will dispute 
the jurors and alternates on wednesday walked through kneehigh 
grass to tour the 15acre farm where lundgren led his cult whose 
members practiced paramilitary maneuvers and were preparing to meet 
god 
lundgren declined to accompany the jury to the farm about 30 
miles northeast of cleveland his attorneys wouldnt comment on why 
he waived the chance to visit the scene 
mrs lundgren visited the farm with the jury that later 
convicted her of helping to mastermind the slayings she showed 
little emotion during her trial but wept at the farm 
the lundgrens son damon 19 and five other cult members are 
awaiting trials and five others have pleaded guilty and await 
sentencing

the republic of armenia passed a declaration of 
independence on thursday and estonia began formal negotiations with 
the kremlin on separation bringing the soviet union closer to 
fragmentation 
the central asian republic of turkmenia meanwhile declared 
itself sovereign with the right to overturn soviet laws 
armenia a republic of 33 million people on the border with 
turkey and iran is the fifth of the soviet unions 15 republics to 
move toward complete independence from the soviet union 
however its path may be complicated by the bloody twoyear 
conflict with neighboring azerbaijan over the disputed territory of 
nagornokarabakh 
the declaration calls for creation of armenias own armed forces 
to safeguard the border which this week was again the scene of 
violent conflict with azerbaijanis the declaration also calls for 
nagornokarabakh a largely armenian area of azerbaijan to become 
part of armenia 
the armenian resolution declares the beginning of the process 
of establishing independent statehood according to an english 
translation sent to the associated press 
armenian legislator samvel shakhmuradyan said he expects the 
republic to remain part of the soviet union only during an 
undefined transition period to complete separation 
armenias decision increases pressure on president mikhail s 
gorbachev who is struggling to develop a new union treaty 
attractive enough to keep his nation whole however gorbachev 
seems to be bowing to baltic demands for complete independence 
kremlin officials began formal negotiations with the baltic 
republic of estonia on thursday the 51st anniversary of the 
nazisoviet pact that led to soviet annexation of the baltic 
states the two other baltics latvia and lithuania are expected 
to begin independence negotiations with soviet representatives 
soon georgia has also asked for talks with the kremlin on 
independence 
the estonian and soviet delegations plan to meet weekly for two 
months and present a final document to gorbachevs presidential 
council by the end of october tass said 
seven republics have declared sovereignty or the right to 
overturn soviet laws on their territory the republic of turkmenia 
passed such a declaration thursday joining russia the largest 
soviet republic the ukraine azerbaijan byelorussia moldavia 
and uzbekistan 
armenias parliament rejected a radical proposal to declare 
independence effective immediately as well as a communist party 
proposal to be independent but remain in the soviet union said 
raffi hovannisian an armenianamerican who watched the debate 
the resolution was approved by a vote of 1832 shakhmuradyan 
said in a telephone interview from yerevan the capital of the 
small republic the resolution invalidates the soviet constitution 
on armenian territory and says that only the armenian constitution 
is in effect shakhmuradyan said 
it demands a share of the soviet national wealth including 
gold diamonds and foreign currency reserves it calls for the 
creation of armenias own currency banking system and customs 
duties 
it also claims armenias right to conduct its own foreign policy 
and to bar other nations troops and bases from its territory a 
clear reference to the soviet armed forces 
however the declaration also states that armenia has its 
share of the ussr military without explaining 
the republic is already boycotting the soviet military draft and 
few of its youths appeared at recruiting centers this year 
the declaration also changes the name of the armenian soviet 
socialist republic to the republic of armenia 
it says armenia will have a multiparty political system and 
freedom of expression press and religion tass reported it calls 
for separation of legislative executive and judiciary powers 
grants citizenship to all residents of the republic and offers it 
to any armenians living outside its borders 
armenias president levon terpetrosyan said it was a historic 
decision allowing the republic to set its own relations with the 
world including neighboring azerbaijan the independent news 
agency interfax reported 
terpetrosyan has said that taking control of its own affairs 
should help armenia solve its problems with azerbaijan 
however azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov on tuesday urged 
soviet sanctions against armenia following armenian debate on 
creating its own armed forces mutalibov was angered because 
armenia has not yet disarmed paramilitary groups blamed for clashes 
on the border with azerbaijan 
a threeday battle erupted this week along the republics 
border tass reported thursday that soviet troops backed by tanks 
and helicopters drove out armenian militants who had been shelling 
the kazakh region of azerbaijan 
several local residents and troops were killed and wounded and 
100 homes were destroyed in the shelling tass said

about 245 japanese have been flown from kuwait to 
virtual house arrest in baghdad a foreign ministry spokesman said 
the move comes as japan debates measures to help enforce the un 
embargo of iraq 
the iraqis moved almost all the japanese stranded in kuwait 
after the iraqi invasion to baghdad on wednesday and thursday 
japanese officials said eight japanese were sent on to safety in 
jordan the officials said 
the japanese have been placed in a hotel under what amounts to 
house arrest according to the foreign ministry the japanese 
ambassador kunio katakura was forcibly removed when he tried to 
visit them the official said 
in ankara turkey foreign minister taro nakayama said in a 
statement that japanese diplomats had been unable to contact the 
japanese nationals 
he said iraqs action was a sheer violation of international 
law and cannot be tolerated from a humanitarian standpoint 
nakayama made the statement at the end of a trip to saudi 
arabia oman jordan egypt and turkey to determine the needs of 
countries immediately affected by the crisis 
us ambassador michael h armacost told reporters washington 
hopes japan will become more directly involved in the middle east 
crisis giving financial support to the united states and middle 
eastern countries and perhaps even sending military forces 
this would violate japans constitution which bars the use of 
force in settling international disputes the constitution was 
written under us supervision after world war ii to prevent the 
resurgence of japanese militarism 
japan is considering extending financial aid to countries like 
jordan egypt and turkey already japanese aid clients whose 
economies have suffered because of the crisis in the middle east 
but the government says it intends to go beyond checkbook diplomacy 
and is considering a physical presence in the persian gulf through 
medical teams logistics support ships or perhaps even 
minesweepers 
japan has said that in principle it is ready to help jordan make 
up its economic losses if jordan agrees to abide by un sanctions 
against iraq 
on thursday the foreign ministry made a latenight announcement 
that 178 japanese had been moved to baghdad from kuwait and 67 
others were in transit 
japan is dependent on the middle east for about 70 percent of 
its oil and received 112 percent of its oil needs from iraq and 
kuwait before the crisis broke out

the nations top antitrust prosecutor said 
thursday he has summoned the major oil companies for talks to 
determine whether they used illegal tactics to drive up gasoline 
prices following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
i have called the major oil companies and requested that they 
come in on a onebyone basis to meet with the staff and on several 
occasions with me said assistant attorney general james rill 
who heads the justice departments antitrust division 
already representatives of three major oil companies and two 
independent marketers have met with some of the 10 antitrust 
officials working on the inquiry rill told reporters at the 
justice department 
the purpose of the meetings is to have the company 
representatives explain the industrys price practices the 
circumstances of the sharp increases in detail and the reasons why 
those increases have occurred he said 
we are getting cooperation from the major oil companies in 
this phase of our inquiry he said noting that antitrust 
officials also are meeting with independent refiners and marketers 
of petroleum products 
rill declined to say which companies have been contacted and 
which have been in for meetings thus far each company has been 
promised confidentiality rill said however he would not say 
whether they were put under oath or whether any have been granted 
immunity from prosecution or other incentives to reveal information 
they have been forthcoming rill said adding that the 
companies are aware that prosecutions may occur once the inquiry is 
completed 
thus far no subpoenas have been issued to compel cooperation 
but rill said if any companies do refuse to cooperate well know 
how to deal with them 
rill said he anticipates that the inquirys general factfinding 
phase should be completed within the next four weeks and that 
will give us a good sense of the underlying events and the most 
promising lines of inquiry that it would seem appropriate to pursue 
after that 
the american automobile association says in its weekly survey 
that the average price of gasoline at the pump has jumped about 18 
percent since iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 the average pump price 
of unleaded regular gasoline jumped from 1050 on july 25 to 
1237 on monday the aaa reported 
obviously there was an event the invasion that had an 
economic impact on crude oil and petroleum product prices in the 
nation he said however we are here to determine whether or 
not there were other factors that contributed in the nature of any 
collusive or any anticompetitive practices and we are 
aggressively pursuing the possibility that that kind of conduct 
might have occurred 
rill had announced aug 6 that he was launching such an inquiry 
the announcement he said thursday was inspired in part to 
alert the industry that we were on the job and looking for 
evidence of illegal conduct in addition the announcement was 
intended to elicit information from potential whistleblowers 
in addition to the oil companies rill said he has sought the 
assistance of state attorneys general for information at the pump 
price level

the soviet union waited until an iraqi envoy left 
town before disclosing thursday it had urged baghdad to end its 
occupation of kuwait and stop its inhumane treatment of 
foreigners 
iraqs deputy prime minister saadoun hammadi left moscow after 
meeting soviet leaders monday and tuesday while he was in moscow 
the foreign ministry issued only sketchy details of his talks 
on thursday foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said 
hammadi was told iraq should change drastically the policy which 
it is pursuing now 
the attention of the iraqi representative was drawn to the 
need to take steps to reduce the tension caused by the 
irresponsible actions of the iraqi authorities gremitskikh told 
a regular news briefing 
we stressed that baghdad has lost much politically and 
morally in the eyes of world public opinion by its illegal and 
inhumane actions against citizens of third countries 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners were stranded when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and subsequently annexed it many have not 
been allowed to leave and some including americans have 
reportedly been moved to military installations throughout the 
country 
this is only exacerbating the situation gremitskikh quoted 
soviet officials as telling hammadi 
the decision to keep foreigners in the country by force has no 
precedent in the history of international relations and cannot be 
justified by any arguments including references to national 
security considerations 
gremitskikh said iraqs argument that it has a historical claim 
to kuwait was unconvincing 
after the invasion the soviet union cut off arms supplies to 
iraq last week president mikhail s gorbachev accused iraq of 
treachery for invading kuwait and using sovietbuilt weapons to do 
so 
gremitskikh gave no explanation for the foreign ministrys 
decision to reveal its message to hammadi 
earlier this week us officials suggested hammadis visit was 
linked to soviet delaying tactics over a un resolution that would 
sanction the use of military force to enforce the economic blockade 
against iraq they said moscow wanted to wait for hammadi to leave 
before approving the ussponsored resolution 
hammadi met with foreign minister eduard shevardnadze soviet 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and deputy foreign minister 
alexander belonogov who has been handling the gulf crisis on a 
daily basis 
gremitskikh said hammadi told them iraq was willing to show 
flexibility in the evacuation of foreign citizens if the other 
sides are flexible as well

the racial and ethnic makeup of the student 
body would be a key consideration for parents particularly 
minority parents if they could choose which public school their 
children would attend according to a gallup poll released thursday 
the poll conducted with the professional education fraternity 
phi delta kappa also found a high level of support for a bush 
administrationbacked plan to have parents choose where their 
children attend public school 
fortyeight percent of the 1594 adults interviewed in april and 
may said student bodys racial or ethnic composition would be 
either a very or fairly important consideration in making a 
decision by race 45 percent of the white parents and 67 percent 
of the minority parents would consider those factors 
overall 34 percent said race and ethnic composition were not 
too important 15 percent said they were not important at all 
and 3 percent didnt know 
what this is saying is that race and ethnic makeup are 
important factors said alec gallup cochairman of the gallup 
organization inc 
this whole thing is disturbing he said its very hard to 
interpret the nonwhite response its certainly a figure we want 
to track 
in interpreting such data the poll noted distinctions must be 
made between public opinion and private sentiment in other words 
what people will tell pollsters publicly may differ from the 
beliefs and biases they may be too embarrassed to disclose 
it is possible that racial and ethnic considerations are much 
more important factors in school choice than people admit to 
pollsters the study said 
on the issue of allowing parents to choose where their children 
attend public school 62 percent of those polled favored parental 
choice while 31 percent were opposed by race 72 percent of the 
nonwhites favored choice while 60 percent of the whites favored 
the plan 
minnesota arkansas and iowa have begun experiments with 
parental choice even though critics say it will mean a return to 
schools segregated by race nationality and social status 
in other findings the poll showed 
the percentage of the public believing that salaries for 
teachers are too low increased from 33 percent to 50 percent in the 
period between 1985 and 1990 
51 percent believe that raising teacher salaries would increase 
the quality of education in schools either a great deal or a fair 
amount 
16 percent place the blame for the problems confronting the 
public schools on the performance of the schools while 73 percent 
place the blame on societal problems 
this was the first year the poll asked what aspects of a public 
school would be most influential in decisionmaking should parental 
choice be adopted 
at least threefourths of those polled said teacher quality 
student discipline and the curriculum would influence parents 
choices the most 
class size the track record of graduates in college or on the 
job school size and proximity to the students home were highly 
rated by large majorities ranging from 88 percent to 74 percent 
for the different factors 
the social and economic background of the student body would be 
considered by 59 percent the poll showed 
the poll found that americans rate the use of drugs as the 
biggest problem facing the public schools and 81 percent assigned 
the highest priority to freeing every school in america from drugs 
and violence and offering a disciplined environment conducive to 
learning

tuberculosis kills more than 25 million people 
each year in developing countries largely because they cant 
afford treatment us health officials said thursday 
applying tb rates and population figures the centers for 
disease control estimated that 71 million new cases occur each 
year in developing countries including 51 million in east and 
south asia and 12 million in subsaharan africa west asia north 
africa and central and south america account for 860000 
more than a third of those patients will die largely because of 
poor treatment or no treatment the cdc said in its weekly report 
the estimated number of deaths from tb in the third world is more 
than 25 million the atlantabased agency said 
with the possible exception of measles more persons in 
developing countries die from tb each year than from any other 
pathogen the cdc said existing diagnostic technology and 
chemotherapeutic agents can prevent tb in these countries 
tuberculosis a contagious bacterial infection of the lungs can 
be cured in most cases with antibiotic drug treatment 
the most effective means of reducing transmission of 
tuberculosis infection and thus the number of tb cases is to 
treat and cure patients the cdc said 
but treatment often doesnt reach patients in poorer countries 
its a combination of things but clearly its money and 
resources said dr christopher murray lead researcher for the 
cdc report and a research fellow at the center for population 
studies at the harvard school of public health 
the cost of treating everybody thats untreated has been 
variously estimated at more than 700 million a year he said 
the average cost of treatment is more than 300 per patient cured 
while cases and deaths from tb have decreased in most developed 
countries since the 1940s and the advent of antibiotics tb 
remains a major problem in developing countries the cdc said 
in subsaharan africa the average person stands a 2 percent 
chance of getting tb in any given year by comparison the average 
resident of the netherlands runs a tb risk of 001 percent 
thursdays report said 
a similar but separate cdc study for the united states has 
placed the us risk at 0009 percent close to the netherlands 
figure 
until recent years theres been a great deal of pessimism 
about the possibility of high cure rates for tb in poor 
countries murray said in most developing countries fewer than 
half the patients who started treatment were cured in large part 
because the treatment routine can take a year or so 
but shortcourse drug treatment efforts in the 1980s have 
achieved cure rates of 8090 percent he said 
thats been a major gain murray said with wellorganized 
programs with careful followup primarily using shortcourse 
chemotherapy the time you need to maintain patient compliance is 
less and compliance is the basic issue 
most people carrying tb infections will never become ill in the 
united states cdc researchers estimate 10 million people are 
infected but only about 22000 new cases are reported each year 
tb kills about 1700 people a year in this country

arizonas ban on prisoners wearing beards 
does not discriminate against orthodox jews a federal appeals 
court ruled 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
wednesday the december 1988 grooming policy of the arizona 
department of corrections was a legitimate means of aiding rapid 
and accurate identification 
the policy allowed mustaches but prohibited beards except for 
medical reasons it was challenged by two prisoners kenneth andrew 
friedman and arnold naftiel who said their religious beliefs 
prohibited them from shaving their beards 
us district judge robert broomfield ruled in the states favor 
and was upheld by the appeals court the court cited testimony by 
jc kenney then supervisor of arizonas prisons that the 
nobeard policy helped identify prisoners in riots and escapes as 
well as daytoday activities that required identification 
the appeals court said kenneys testimony established that the 
policy served legitimate penological interests which would be 
harmed if the prisoners rights were protected that is the 
standard the state must meet to justify taking away prisoners 
constitutional rights under a 1987 supreme court ruling 
the opinion by judge thomas tang said the high court allows 
prison officials to anticipate security problems rather than 
having to justify their policies with evidence from past incidents 
tang also said friedman and naftiel had testified that they 
could practice their religion in other ways for example the 
prison provided them with at least one kosher tv dinner a day 
friedman 32 is serving a 15year sentence for sexual assault 
naftiel 36 is serving 25 years for assault and kidnapping

the five permanent security council 
members today reached a tentative agreement on a resolution 
authorizing the use of minimum force to halt all maritime 
commerce with iraq the us ambassador said 
we agreed on a text to send to capitals and we will continue 
our consultations this afternoon said the ambassador thomas r 
pickering who has been lobbying for the proposal for several days 
he spoke after another informal meeting with envoys from the 
soviet union britain china and france he has said he hoped for 
an early security council meeting to vote on the draft but there 
were no immediate plans for a meeting 
western diplomats described the move as progress but not a 
breakthrough and said much depends on views of the envoys 
governments 
approval or agreement not to veto the resolution would be 
required from the governments of the five permanent members before 
the united states would call a meeting diplomats said 
the united states has been pressing for council approval for the 
use of force to police and enforce the councils sweeping economic 
embargo against iraq the embargo was imposed aug 6 to punish iraq 
for invading kuwait 
the soviets and chinese have been reluctant to let the security 
council sanction the use of military force by the usled 
multinational fleet assembling in the persian gulf to defend saudi 
arabia 
however sources in the state department say the soviets have 
not threatened to veto such a resolution on wednesday a kuwaiti 
official visiting in beijing said china gave assurances it would 
not veto a blockade embargo 
meanwhile two senior un officials sent to baghdad wrapped up 
three days of meetings with top iraqi officials on the plight of 
the 2 million foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait by the aug 2 
invasion of the emirate 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz assured virendra dayal and 
kofi annan on wednesday that foreigners were being well treated but 
declined to give further information on the foreigners some 
americans and britons have been taken to iraqi installations to 
serve as human shields to us attack 
they are the guests of the iraqi people the iraqi news 
agency quoted aziz as saying however aziz also told the envoys 
that the united nations has become a tool of american policy in 
the persian gulf crisis 
in tokyo a japanese official said his government has decided to 
send aid to jordan whose economy is squeezed by the embargo as 
well as a crush of tens of thousands of refugees from iraq and 
kuwait 
as the economic embargo that the security council imposed on 
iraq tightens it is having unintended effects on some of iraqs 
major trade partners jordan and bulgaria told the security council 
the embargo is crushing their economies 
jordan which has been inundated with more than 185000 refugees 
from neighboring iraq since iraqi president saddam hussein launched 
the invasion of kuwait on aug 2 won the sympathy of the security 
council on wednesday 
the council held an urgent private meeting that concluded just 
before midnight and decided jordan was a very important and 
difficult case and they had to have help said the british 
ambassador sir crispin tickell 
diplomats said no particular figures or goals were discussed 
the security council decided to begin drafting a resolution calling 
on all un members to give jordan additional bilateral aid 
despite jordans policy of allowing food and supplies to be 
trucked from its port of aqaba to baghdad we all agreed that 
jordan was an exceptional case and they needed particular help and 
no voice was raised to say that would not be done said tickell

she termed the defenses argument that the woman consented to 
have sex with kehoe ludicrous 
the woman told police that she met kehoe april 28 at a bar and 
agreed to accompany him to his apartment to see his motorcycle 
the woman told police that kehoe persuaded her to enter the 
house then ordered her to take an unknown white pill he then

face then repeatedly raped her she said she finally escaped when 
another man knocked at the front door and kehoe went to answer it 
the woman said she called police several hours later and gave 
them kehoes address

food and drug administration scientists on 
thursday documented their belief that a synthetic hormone designed 
to increase milk production in cows poses no health risk to 
consumers 
in an unprecedented move the fda released its review of more 
than 120 studies to support its previous statements that milk and 
meat from dairy cows treated with the hormone which is still not 
approved are safe 
we have concluded that the food products derived from treated 
animals are safe for human consumption said richard teske 
deputy director of the fdas center for veterinary medicine 
publication of the review in this weeks edition of the journal 
science was a response to congressional and public interest 
over the safety of the hormone bovine somatotropin or bst said 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit 
some consumer activists say longterm effects of the 
geneticallyengineered hormone are still not known and farmers 
worry that consumers might shy away from products from treated 
cows farmers also are concerned that increased milk production 
would lower prices 
earlier this week the journal of the american medical 
association published the work of two researchers who concluded 
that bst can boost milk production in dairy cows by 10 percent to 
25 percent while causing no significant changes in composition of 
the milk also jama published an editorial by an independent 
researcher backing the conclusions 
the fda has not approved bst for commercial use but the agency 
has allowed four companies to run limited farm tests of their 
products and to sell the milk from the test cows 
also the fda is still reviewing studies on the health effects 
of bst on cows which must be shown before it can be approved 
we dont anticipate that well even complete the review 
process any earlier than the spring of 1991 teske said 
if approved synthetic bst would become the first major 
biotechnology product on the agriculture market 
two major milkproducing states minnesota and wisconsin have 
imposed temporary bans on use of bst and other states are 
considering similar action 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends 
called the jama article shameful because the articles two 
authors are consultants to monsanto one of the four companies 
testing bst 
the fda article was irresponsible because the agency 
scientists relied heavily on old studies that tested with natural 
bst rather than the synthetic hormone he said 
there are a lot of unanswered questions rifkin said the 
fda is trying to push this product through without doing their 
homework 
the general accounting office at the request of sen patrick 
leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee is 
reviewing the fdas assessment of bst risks 
his concern stems in part from a former fda veterinarian who 
said he was fired after he alleged that testing of bst was flawed 
the fda article written by judith c juskevich formerly with 
the agencys center for veterinary medicine and now an fda 
consultant and c greg guyer a chemist in the centers office of 
new animal drug evaluation says data from the studies show that 
bst is harmless when consumed orally because it breaks down during 
digestion 
the agencys scientists also said the data show that 90 percent 
of bst in milk is destroyed during pasteurization and that milk 
from treated cows would have synthetic bst residues within the 
normal range of the naturally occurring bst 
the public controversy over bst is unusual because the fda does 
not normally discuss the merits of products before they are 
approved 
in this case however the fda got permission from the four 
companies making the hormone monsanto agriculture co eli lilly 
co upjohn co and american cyanamid to seek a thirdparty 
review to make sure it the fdas review was done properly 
teske said 
as with all reports published in science the fda report first 
was reviewed by a panel of expert scientists

the bush administration scolded the soviet 
union on thursday for keeping military advisers in iraq and 
suggested moscow may be in violation of united nations sanctions 
against president saddam hussein 
it is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance 
to iraq state department spokesman richard boucher said we 
believe un sanctions extend to the provision of services to 
iraq 
the statement jarred an otherwise smooth approach taken by 
washington and moscow in the persian gulf crisis together the two 
superpowers are trying to force saddam to relinquish control of 
kuwait by denying iraq all economic necessities 
through diplomatic channels however the state department has 
registered its concerns to moscow about keeping military advisers 
in iraq although us officials told the associated press there 
was no evidence the soviets helped on the battlefield 
the issue flared publicly wednesday after a soviet colonel told 
reporters in moscow that 193 military advisers were finishing their 
contractual obligations to the soviets 
us officials said privately the figure may be even larger 
obviously we have differences with the soviets when it comes 
to advisers an official said thursday differences arise even 
with the best of allies in fact the british and canadians raised 
questions about our trying to enforce the sanctions with a military 
blockade 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
disagreement with the soviets was one of interpreting the sanctions 
imposed aug 6 by the united nations security council with soviet 
support 
we have a common concern with the soviets about the safety of 
foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait and we are working together 
on that he said 
the statement read by boucher stopped short of declaring the 
soviets in violation of the sanctions we lack sufficient 
information about the precise basis under which soviet advisers are 
in iraq to render a definitive judgment he said 
the soviets once a primary source of weapons for iraq agreed 
to cut off shipments in compliance with the sanctions boucher said 
there is no reason to suspect moscow is still arming iraq 
secretary of state james a baker iii spoke by telephone 
wednesday from his ranch in wyoming with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze us officials said they discussed the 
timing of moves in the united nations to enforce the sanctions 
the two superpowers exchanged messages on thursday but boucher 
declined to divulge the details

sgt aahmad alaawamleh i just got married last week 
the 23yearold police officer was helping a group of egyptians 
carry their baggage to a tent which sheltered people from the sun

not cope with the human flood on wednesday 42000 evacuees 
mostly arabs and asians arrived in jordan the biggest oneday 
border crossing since the crisis erupted

suitable arrangements for their stay in jordan 
hussein said 185000 foreigners mostly arabs have poured into 
jordan since the crisis flared only 67000 have left the country 
for other destinations 
those who remained in jordan gripped by severe economic woes

threats from saddam hussein will not deter the 
united states from defending its interests in the middle east the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said thursday 
dont try to scare us or threaten us gen colin l powell 
said in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars national 
convention it wont work never has 
we love peace but we know that it is better to obtain peace 
by standing up to aggression early so you dont have to fight a 
war 
powell said the united states will not abandon americans being 
held in kuwait and iraq 
we will always come to the aid of our friends and our fellow 
citizens we will not abandon them when they are hostages he 
said no iraqi leader should think for a moment that we dont 
have the will or the ability to accomplish what might be required 
of us 
a look at 20thcentury us history will give any iraqi leader 
all the proof he needs of the strength of our arms and our 
fighting ability he said 
mr hussein the solution to the crisis is simple leave 
kuwait let the legitimate government return use your wealth for 
peace not war he said 
powell called the invasion of kuwait a forceful reminder of the 
need for a strong america 
in the past three weeks we havent heard much of perestroika 
or glasnost or a reunified germany or market economies in communist 
countries he said 
the invasion of kuwait proves that the world needs a strong 
leader and the united states is the only superpower that can fill 
that role powell said 
we cannot shrink from it he said 
powell praised soviet leaders for working with the us to stem 
the crisis in the middle east 
but he said the united states must not forget that the soviet 
union remains a nuclear military superpower with the ability if 
not the intention to destroy our way of life in 30 minutes

david burke cbs news fifth president in five 
years was out thursday and eric w ober in as his successor as the 
oncetroubled division was back in the headlines after two years of 
relative calm 
one cbs source characterized the reason for burkes departure as 
a leadership issue and not arguments over budget with the 
costcutting president of cbs inc laurence a tisch 
burke 54 a former abc news executive vice president who cbs 
hired in august 1988 did not return phone calls but he strongly 
hinted in a statement that hed been forced out 
it is clear to me following amicable discussions of with the 
management of cbs that they would be more comfortable about the 
future of the news division under new leadership 
they have the right to make that decision he said pledging 
to help his 48yearold successor ober the latter has spent 24 
years at cbs including stints in cbs news he currently heads cbs 
television stations division 
im not walking in there with any mandate or any plans for a 
change ober said in a brief interview ive had no discussions 
about costcutting or anything else the priority over there at 
cbs headquarters is to let them do their jobs 
burkes hiring was preceded by six years of turmoil that 
included gen william c westmorelands 120 million libel suit 
over a vietnam documentary and low morale caused by staff cuts 
the largest of them occuring in march 1987 when more than 200 
employees were fired westmoreland dropped the lawsuit after weeks 
of a costly trial for both sides 
when burke arrived he clamped down on what had been a plethora 
of leaks by staffers about the woes of cbs news 
he also generally refused to grant interviews to reporters even 
about such controversies as his threemonth suspension of 60 
minutes humorist andy rooney 
the suspension announced in february came after a gay magazine 
quoted rooney as making a racial slur that the humorist denied 
saying burke ended the suspension three weeks later but again 
refused to talk to reporters about the matter 
but since burkes arrival cbs news had stabilized it scored 
successes last year with its coverage of the student uprising in 
china and this summer with its coverage of the persian gulf crisis 
and while the cbs this morning remains a distant third in 
ratings dan rathers oncedominant cbs evening news after a 
sharp ratings decline at least had become a respectable second to 
abcs world news tonight 
still said one cbs executive who spoke on condition of 
anonymity burkes downfall was due in part to his reclusive 
management style and tendency to stay cooped up his office 
it was a broad question of leadership a question of where cbs 
news was going the executive said the news division has got 
to be a collegial enterprise of very creative people and it needs 
a very open leader who involves people in decisionmaking and 
consultation 
after reviewing burkes way of doing things he said our 
sense was that were just not comfortable that thats the right way 
to lead a news divsion 
burke had two years to go on his contract when he left 
cbs broadcast group president howard stringer who preceded 
burke as president declined to comment on what part burkes 
management style played in the change at the news division 
rooney of 60 minutes said he knew little about why burke got 
the gate but i refuse to take any pleasure from it because as 
as far as i know he was doing a satisfactory job i dont think 
he handled my suspension well but thats not reason enough to fire 
him 
since 1980 there have been six presidents at cbs news 
including two tours by stringers predecessor van gordon sauter 
now a tv producer in los angeles 
richard s salant who earlier was twice president of cbs news 
and held the job for a nowincredible total of 16 years said he 
liked burke and didnt know what caused the departure 
salant left cbs in 1979 upon reaching the mandatory retirement 
age of 65 he was philosophical about those now running the company 
they cant seem to find a news president who will stay or 
that they want to stay put

japanese leadership in semiconductor technology 
key to missile targeting helped promote the strategic arms 
reduction treaty talks between the united states and the soviet 
union a japanese politician claims 
there was more motivation to come to agreement when these 
countries were no longer capable of making advances without the 
help of a third country shintaro ishihara said in an interview 
in the october issue of playboy magazine 
and nothing can be sweeter revenge for us than this the one 
country that has been bombed by nuclear weapons is in a position of 
having a great effect on the reduction of their availability and 
maybe their use ishihara said isnt that the most 
sophisticated kind of revenge 
ishihara 57 a film maker prolific and awardwinning writer 
and an outspoken member of the japanese parliament said japan is 
five years ahead of the united states in semiconductor technology 
and the gap is widening 
he said chips with a capacity of 1 and 2 megabits which are 
key to targeting icbms are not made in america at least not with 
consistent quality he said 
ishihara who is considering running for prime minister of 
japan has been a target of pentagon and congressional scrutiny for 
his contributions to the book the japan that can say no 
the collection of speeches by ishihara and by sony corp 
chairman akio morita has sold more than a million copies in japan 
but has been attacked in this country as an example of 
americabashing 
ishihara told playboy that a pentagon translation of the book 
which has not been officially published in this country contains 
misinterpretations and distortions 
i plan to publish an accurate formal version which is now 
being prepared at that time i plan to sue the pentagon over the 
illegal translation he said 
the book has also come to the attention of chrysler corp 
chairman lee iaccoca who has said the ishiharas and moritas 
arrogance pours salt into an already open wound ishihara said 
in the interview that iaccoca used japan as a scapegoat for his own 
inadequacies as an industrialist 
ishihara said his basic message is that japan has become the 
second most powerful nation on earth and the usjapanese 
relationship needs readjustment 
america has 10 times more kinds of basic research in 
stateoftheart technology than japan does thats not going to 
change what japan has is the industrial dynamism it takes to make 
useful quality products that ability has disappeared from 
american industry he said 
so think about what each of us does best america and japan 
could working together make a new civilization for the entire 
world he said

the us navy has boarded a handful of 
ships in its weekold effort to halt iraqi shipping the pentagon 
said thursday 
spokesman pete williams asked to be more specific said a 
handful would have to be less than 10 he said he could not give 
a definitive number nor say when or where the boardings occurred 
in recent days the united states has been urging swift approval 
of a un resolution allowing military force to support the 
international bodys sanctions against iraq over its invasion of 
kuwait but the soviet union has been counseling that caution be 
used before military force is applied 
at a pentagon briefing williams said he was not aware of any 
more shots having been fired but said dozens of ships were 
involved in the interdiction operations 
we continue to monitor ships williams said 
ships belonging to the two aircraft carrier battle groups in the 
red sea one carrier battle group in the gulf of oman and the ships 
of the middle east task force in the persian gulf are involved in 
the operation 
boarding parties have been issued shotguns pistols and 
specialized instructions on how to board and search vessels 
suspected of carrying cargo bound to or from iraq 
the sailors carry plastic cards in french arabic and english 
telling the ships crews to remain calm and that no harm will come 
to them if they cooperate with the us boarding parties 
williams said there was a high degree of voluntary 
compliance with the effort and that many ships have turned 
back again he said he had no specific number 
williams said the two iraqi tankers involved in saturdays 
shooting incident the first of the operation were still being 
shadowed by us navy ships 
the fast frigate uss reid fired six warning shots across the bow 
of the iraqiflagged vessel khanaqin in the gulf of oman after it 
refused repeated requests to halt in a separate incident the uss 
bradley fired three warning shots across the bow of another iraqi 
tanker 
the khanaqin unloaded a portion of its cargo in aden yemen 
on tuesday and has left port williams said 
the yemenis have assured the united sates that the offloading 
stopped before it was completed the spokesman said 
williams referred reporters to the state department when they 
asked whether it had been determined that the cargo involved items 
that would break the unsanctioned embargo against iraq 
asked whether any other ships had been challenged and had sailed 
on williams replied not that i know of

a teenager who said repeated viewings of the 
violent film a clockwork orange led him to fatally stab and 
strangle a friend was sentenced thursday to life in prison without 
chance of parole 
michale anderson of pittsburgh who turned 18 thursday was 
convicted june 21 of firstdegree murder in the slaying of 
17yearold karen hurwitz she died in her back yard oct 27 1989 
after being strangled and stabbed six times in the chest with a 
36inch martial arts sword 
before sentencing anderson allegheny county common pleas judge 
robert e dauer told him that murder is the most horrendous of 
crimes 
your crime is even worse you killed somebody you liked 
indeed loved he said 
anderson read a statement in which he apologized to the slain 
girls parents 
im sorry for the sorrow i have wrought upon you he said 
i ask you to see me for what i am and not for what i have done 
anderson said the whole truth has not come out about the 
killing he indicated lawyers and the news media have muddled the 
facts but did not elaborate 
no matter what you must know the truth anderson said i 
will tell you the truth eventually as it was recorded in my mind 
forever 
in a confession to police anderson said he always did bad 
things when he wore his black a clockwork orange tshirt he 
was wearing the shirt when he stabbed miss hurwitz a high school 
senior 
andersons attorney jon botula said during the twoday trial 
that his client was incited to kill by repeated viewings of the 
1971 film which starred malcolm mcdowell as the leader of a group 
of hooligans 
the movie chronicled the marauders ultraviolence similar 
to recent wilding episodes in new york and a futuristic 
societys efforts to control the youths 
botula showed jurors a 50minute clip of the stanley kubrick 
film based on the anthony burgess novel of the same name 
the murdered girls mother linda hurwitz said after the 
conviction that she recalled watching the movie while pregnant with 
her daughter 
i remember walking out afterwards so shaken saying to myself 
i hope im not bringing my child into a world with these kinds of 
people without any feeling or any emotion just plain brutality 
she said 
the prosecution rejected andersons contention that the movie 
made him kill and a specialist in media psychology suggested the 
movie was used by botula as a scapegoat 
every couple of years you have a noteasilyverifiable 
mystical source that causes people to do strange things said 
stuart fischoff a professor of psychology at california state 
university at los angeles 
the defense that the devil made me do it the devil is 
either records or movies or genetics is not new he said 
television and film is todays contemporary devil 
life in prison without parole is the minimum penalty for 
firstdegree murder in pennsylvania prosecutors did not ask for 
the death penalty because the required aggravating circumstances 
were not present

the local newspaper the enterprise says 
it will continue to publish names of arrested prostitutes and their 
customers in spite of the suicide of one customer 
a 47yearold man from a nearby town died friday apparently of 
carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in his garage after a report 
linking him with a prostitute was published in the newspaper 
police said the man left a suicide note that did not mention he 
had been arrested with a prostitute and had been convicted of 
sexual misconduct for a fee and fined 155 three days earlier 
the enterprise held to its policy of not naming suicides who 
kill themselves in private 
the newspaper has always published names of anyone arrested in 
the city except for routine traffic infractions paul salters 
night city editor at the enterprise said thursday 
everyone who gets arrested gets his name in the paper 
salters said 
the problem of prostitution is particularly troubling and 
deserves attention he said 
the editors of this newspaper believe that the situation is 
out of hand on the streets salters said these people come out 
like sea gulls at a town dump at night its just everywhere it is 
so bad residents of the city try to avoid driving through the 
downtown at night 
executive editor bruce smith said the practice of publishing 
names of customers started earlier this month after police chief 
robert j dicarli announced a crackdown and asked the newspaper to 
help by listing the names and addresses of both prostitutes and 
their customers 
i dont think there has been any direct link between the fact 
that his name was published and the suicide he said 
detective arthur mcclaren said police and the newspaper were 
getting hassled on radio and television talk shows 
people are saying his name was put in the paper thats why 
he committed suicide but the girls names have always gone in 
why not print the males and the girls 
smith said he thinks the enterprise is performing a public 
service that has helped cut down on solicitation in the city of 
about 97000 residents 
other cities have the same problem and they have 
crackdowns said george r cataldo assistant to mayor carl 
pitaro 
here business people were complaining they felt prostitution 
was taking business away from the downtown area as far as putting 
the names of johns and the girls in the paper its embarrassing in 
one respect but it has been a deterrent 
louis hodges director of society and the professions an ethics 
program at washington and lee university said the media should not 
collaborate with police and the names should not be published 
i dont think it is right for a newspaper to agree to publish 
the names at the request of police he said you can get 
yourself locked in in ways that are wrong 
secondly newspapers have no business inflicting additional 
harm so the names ought not to be published at all even upon 
conviction 
william kovach curator of the nieman foundation at harvard 
university said the fact that the police requested that names 
and addresses be published does not automatically make the 
newspaper a part of the police apparatus 
the first question the editor must address is whether or not 
prostitution is so important in that community that people should 
be exposed to the notoriety he said

a hospital blocked by an appellate 
ruling from ending the pregnancy of a psychotic patient sought 
thursday to have the woman declared incompetent so it can perform 
the abortion 
denise lefebvre 28 has been strapped to a hospital bed to keep 
her from hurting herself according to court documents on 
occasions since her july 3 hospitalization she has threatened to 
kill her baby according to the records 
she will spend the next sixth months the remainder of her 
pregnancy under restraint if the court rules the pregnancy can 
continue said her father joseph lefebvre 
last month broward circuit judge william clayton johnson 
granted permission to hospital officials to perform an abortion on 
lefebvre who is 13 weeks pregnant 
the 4th district court of appeal overturned the ruling on 
thursday before the abortion can take place the court said 
lefebvre must be declared incompetent johnson will rule on her 
competency 
this woman is very lucid regarding her baby said assistant 
public defender frank delatorre who is representing the woman 
everyone wanted to give the woman an abortion except her 
hospital officials sought the abortion because they feared the 
fetus had been damaged by lefebvres use of lithium an 
antipsychotic medication known to cause birth defects 
delatorre said lefebvre had stopped taking the drug after 
learning she was pregnant but the hospital maintains she is 
dangerously psychotic when not on medication 
hospital workers testified last month that lefebvre ate her 
excrement and wrote satanic messages with it on the walls she 
attacked nurses and shouted obscenities they said 
her voice goes really mean and she goes im going to kill my 
baby and im going to kill you nurse sharon stratton testified 
joseph lefebvre said he would consent to an abortion 
shes not capable of taking care of a child he said i 
dont think my daughter knows whats going on 
william scherer an attorney for broward general medical center 
said the hospital would ask that the competency proceedings be 
handled on an emergency basis 
abortion is legal in florida until the 16th week of pregnancy 
after that abortions can only be performed to save the mothers 
life 
officials have not located the father of lefebvres child she 
says he is a man named george who is also mentally ill

university of colorado physicists have 
produced what they claim to be the worlds coldest temperature 
within 11 millionth of a degree celsius of absolute zero 
that translates to 45967 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
physicist carl wieman who conducted the experiment with 
graduate student chris monroe said it shaved 14millionth of a 
degree celsius from the previous record recently achieved by 
physicists at the ecole normale superieure in paris 
absolute zero theoretically is the temperature at which 
molecular motion stops temperatures in space drop to about 3 
degrees celsius above absolute zero scientists said 
wieman said the achievement itself was not so important but its 
advancement of understanding about the basic nature of matter and 
its potential practical applications are noteworthy 
im absolutely convinced there will be an enormous number of 
applications he said 
the scientists used 200 diode lasers the same kind used in 
compactdisc players to trap atoms of the metallic element cesium 
in one place 
restricting the atoms in a cage of laser beams caused the atoms 
to slow down and cool said wieman 
the whole setup has turned out to be a very inexpensive 
apparatus thats giving spectacular results wieman said we 
have ideas on how to make this get much colder 
wieman said one practical application of the technique would be 
to improve the accuracy of atomic clocks by a factor of 100 atomic 
clocks which count the oscillations of cesium atoms already are 
the worlds most accurate timepieces 
cooling the cesium could reduce the atomic clocks margin of 
error now about one second every 300000 years said wieman 
wieman said the technique could lead to development of portable 
atomic clocks that could be employed in submarines spacecraft and 
other commercial applications

the middle east crisis highlighting americas 
reliance on foreign oil is spurring renewed calls for energy 
conservation including demands thursday that automakers build more 
fuelefficient cars 
a group of environmentalists and alternative fuel advocates 
chastised president bush for not producing specific programs aimed 
at cutting energy use and for opposing legislation that would 
toughen automobile fuel efficiency requirements 
while the president finally used the words energy 
conservation as us troops were on their way to the persian gulf 
he has so far failed to propose any significant policies to reduce 
dependence on oil said christopher flavin an energy expert at 
worldwatch institute 
automobiles guzzle more oil than anything else and increasing 
their fuel efficiency would be the single greatest step this 
country can take to reduce our dependency on oil said nancy 
hirsh director of the energy conservation coalition 
a senate bill sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev which 
would require automakers to increase fleet fuel efficiency to an 
average 40 miles per gallon by the end of the decade could save 
28 million barrels of oil a day the environmentalists maintained 
automobiles fleetwide now average about 28 mpg with only 
compact models reaching efficiency levels of more than 40 mpg 
until the recent middle east developments once again put the 
spotlight on oil prices and the potential for shortages the bryan 
bill has been touted primarily as a way to combat global warming by 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
automakers have vigorously opposed the legislation saying it 
would force them to build only small cars and prompt some motorists 
to keep less fuel efficient older models years longer 
congress should not be stampeded into taking potentially 
harmful actions that could boomerang on the american public said 
tom hanna president of the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
jerry terhorst a spokesman for ford motor co called the bill 
a panicky proposal that would not affect current oil 
disruptions anyway because it would take a dozen years before its 
impact on fuel use would take effect 
even before the latest middle east crisis the bryan legislation 
was given an even chance of being approved by the senate this year 
or possibly next now there is an increasing likelihood it may pass 
the senate some environmentalists and auto industry lobbyists 
agree environmentalists are less optimistic in the house where 
automakers are relying on rep john dingell dmich to keep any 
auto fuel efficiency legislation bottled up in his energy and 
commerce committee 
the environmental groups at a news conference called on the 
white house to push for the auto fuel efficiency bill which the 
administration so far has opposed and outline other energy 
conservation measures 
president bush when asked during a wednesday news confernce at 
his vacation retreat in maine about the need to conserve energy 
responded i call upon americans to conserve he provided no 
specifics but said he intended to continue using his highspeed 
motorboat 
i dont think weve reached the point where i want to call on 
everybody in the recreation industry to shut it down or everybody 
thats taking a vacation in america to shut it down the 
president said 
the energy department for more than a year has been working on a 
longterm energy policy including conservation measures the 
program is scheduled to be announced toward the end of the year 
recently the department said increased oil production and 
conservation can make up for most of the us oil imports lost 
because of the middle east turmoil if americans inflated their 
automobile tires to the correct pressure they could save 100000 
barrels of oil a day the department said 
meanwhile transportation department officials met thursday with 
an aviation industry task force to look for ways to save fuel 
consumed by airliners 
transportation secretary samuel skinner in forming the group 
asked it to review the use of energy during takeoffs landings and 
movement of the planes on the ground he suggested that airlines 
airports and government controllers might be able to adopt 
procedures that use less fuel

philadelphias independence hall is plagued by 
a leaky roof and an equally deficient budget that has allowed area 
fountains and walkways to fall into disrepair lawmakers said 
thursday 
the park that is the site of independence hall and the liberty 
bell is projecting a deficit of between 400000 and 800000 six 
philadelphiaarea members of congress said in a letter to national 
park service regional director james w coleman 
the shingles on independence hall can be crushed to sawdust in 
your hands the letter said 
the budget shortfall is definitely making a difference in the 
appearance of the park park spokeswoman kathy dilonardo said in 
a telephone interview 
the roof leaks when the wind drives the rain in a certain 
direction she said of the building where the declaration of 
independence was signed in 1776 
the water drips into a secondfloor gallery once used for 
banquets by the penns pennsylvanias founding family 
the budget woes also have kept officials from repairing 11 
fountains and fixing uneven brickwork on the park grounds 
dilonardo said 
the park closed six buildings last winter to save money 
among the casualties was old city hall where the supreme court 
met from 1791 to 1800 the building reopened april 1 for the peak 
tourist period but will close again for the season in october 
dilonardo said 
rep thomas foglietta dpa whose district includes the 
buildings said in a news release that the park budget has fallen 
from 72 million in 1980 to 69 million this year not counting 
inflation 
he organized the letter which requests 100000 for roof 
repairs and 300000 to fix a dilapidated section of park that 
includes trees walkways and fountains the money would come from a 
fund used for national park service maintenance projects in the 
midatlantic region 
more than 3 million people visit the park each year 
coleman the regional park service official was out of the 
office thursday and unavailable for comment

the militarybacked caretaker 
government on thursday blamed partisans of ousted prime minister 
benazir bhutto for a twoday ethnic rampage in which 30 people died 
police arrested at least 32 suspects officials said and all 
but three are members of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party but 
the government admitted it had no proof of their guilt 
of course we arrested them if we didnt arrest them how 
could we be sure once we have a lead well have an openandshut 
case interior minister zahid safraz told reporters in the 
capital islamabad 
the latest round of ethnic violence in ms bhuttos hometown was 
sparked by the return of altaf hussein the militant leader of the 
mohajir qami movement or refugee peoples movement representing 
indian immigrants from the 1947 partition of the subcontinent 
snipers fired from rooftops into a crowd celebrating husseins 
return thursday killing at least one person and injuring six 
police said 
on wednesday marauding gunmen fired into a crowd preparing for 
his return killing at least 29 people and injuring 50 police said 
no one claimed responsibility for either attack the latest in a 
resurging wave of gang warfare that has claimed at least 500 lives 
since late may 
jam saddiq ali the chief minister of sindh province said 32 
people had been arrested in wednesdays attack and 28 belonged to 
ms bhuttos leftofcenter peoples party 
jam said they launched the attacks to discredit the caretaker 
government that replaced ms bhutto two weeks ago after her 
government was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of 
power 
about 40000 sloganchanting supporters crowded into karachi 
international airport and blocked surrounding streets to greet 
hussein 36 who had been in london since midmay undergoing 
treatment for a kidney ailment 
about 250000 people attended a rally thursday evening for 
hussein police earlier said more than 1 million people were 
expected all markets and businesses closed throughout karachi a 
city of 9 million residents that is the countrys financial and 
industrial center 
the movement which overwhelmingly dominates karachi and other 
cities in sindh province is demanding recognition as pakistans 
fifth nationality along with the pathans baluch punjabis and 
sindhis 
for years karachi has been an urban battlefield between rival 
ethnic and political groups authorities estimate at least 2000 
people have been killed and thousands more injured since violence 
began in 1985 
president ghulman ishaq khan dismissed ms bhuttos governnment 
aug 6 citing its inability to stop the killings as one reason

a runamok computer on magellan got a 
partial memory transplant thursday as engineers treated symptoms of 
a mysterious ailment that twice made them lose touch with the 
venusorbiting spaceship 
the malfunctions have shaken the spacecraft but the overall 
spacecraft remains very healthy and were very optimistic well be 
back to a fruitful mission soon said ed sherry technical 
assistant to magellans project manager at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
magellan is on a 744million mission to use its radar to peer 
through the clouds of venus and make the most detailed pictures and 
maps yet of the second planet from the sun it went into orbit 
around venus on aug 10 about 15 months after it was launched from 
the shuttle atlantis it now is about 149 million miles from earth 
lab spokesman jim doyle said it isnt yet known how long 
magellans troubles will delay the official start of its mapping 
effort which was to begin the first week of september 
more pictures from magellans first radar test will be released 
friday he said the first pictures released tuesday showed 
numerous venusquake faults old lava flows craters cinder 
cones valleys and ridges on the planet 
engineers continued unloading magellans computer memory banks 
thursday to get flight data that will help them figure out why 
magellan broke off radio contact for more than 14 hours aug 1617 
and again for 17 hours ending wednesday afternoon 
on both occasions engineers sent computer commands to 
magellans presumed position to get its safety systems to restore 
radio contact 
the ultimate problem that made magellan lose contact on both 
occasions remains unknown but flight data show that tuesday night 
the spacecrafts automatic safety systems were unable to maintain 
radio contact as expected because part of the memory was 
corrupted in a backup computer that helps point magellan 
sherry said 
so engineers replaced the faulty contents of that computers 
memory with a rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft 
thursday he said 
we dont know what triggered these events he added were 
fixing the symptoms were taking the steps to keep magellan 
running 
engineers also reactivated magellans safety systems some of 
which were intentionally disabled wednesday to prevent them from 
again cutting off contact between the spacecraft and earth 
the spacecraft has four computers a main computer and its 
backup and an attitudecontrol computer and backup that help 
aim magellan 
sherry said the backup pointing computer started to run amok 
aug 16 after an unknown problem triggered a chain of events that 
made magellan lose contact the first time thats when four 
computer words in its memory went bad he added 
when another yetundiagnosed problem developed tuesday night 
the main computer checked the condition of the backup pointing 
computer found something was not kosher in its memory and as 
a result assumed magellan was pointing in the wrong direction 
which it wasnt sherry said 
that mistake prompted automatic safety systems to protect 
magellan by turning the spacecraft to make sure its solar panels 
could draw power from the sun when the spacecraft turned contact 
was lost because its secondary antenna no longer pointed at earth 
doyle said the mixed message between the main computer and the 
backup pointing computer was like someone wants to mail you 
something but the post office has your address messed up 
after contact was lost tuesday night some nasa officials feared 
magellan might be lost forever but sherry said that when contact 
was restored a lot of the engineers sat there smugly and said 
we told you the spacecraft was a real honey and would do what it 
was built to do

government troops deployed on an 
island across from the chief stronghold of ethnic tamil rebels and 
launched a broad offensive to lift the 10week siege of a fort the 
deputy defense minister said thursday 
it appeared to be the largest military action since the tamil 
tiger rebels broke a 13month ceasefire in june and resumed their 
war for independence against the sinhalesedominated government 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said the troops landed 
wednesday on kayts island across the lagoon from jaffna peninsula 
the chief rebel stronghold 
wijeratne gave no casualty figures and declined to say how many 
troops had been deployed 
a garrison of about 250 policemen and soldiers have been 
surrounded since june 11 in jaffna fort a 300yearold fortress 
which dominates jaffna town 
wijeratne who is directing the governments war effort said 
the government forces met little resistance on kayts island which 
faces the fort across 4 miles of water 
the fort is the largest of several military camps which were cut 
off in jaffna peninsula a densely populated piece of land that 
curves toward the southern coast of india 
the starshaped fort whose massive walls were erected by 
successive portuguese dutch and british colonial rulers is 
besieged by tiger guerrillas who are dug into reinforced bunkers 
military officials said at least 20 rebels were killed in aerial 
bombing and strafing raids wednesday the first day of the 
governments latest offensive the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said only seven soldiers were wounded 
there was no confirmation of the reports communications with 
the north has been disrupted since the latest round of fighting 
broke out on june 11 
wijeratne thursday withdrew an earlier offer to evacuate the 
fort and turn it over to the international committee of the red 
cross 
he said the red cross spent 10 days evaluating the proposal and 
only agreed wednesday when the offensive was underway 
now i dont have to evacuate the fort why should i 
wijeratne said he said government forces expected to retake the 
fort in two or three days 
government troops moved out of their military camps wednesday 
recapturing some areas and expanding their perimeters according to 
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
the tigers rained mortars and fired rockets and small arms at a 
military airstrip near jaffna and two other camps they added 
the jaffna peninsula is 185 miles northeast of colombo 
ethnic tamil rebels took up arms in 1983 claiming that the 
tamil minority needed a separate state to preserve its language and 
culture and to combat discrimination by sri lankas sinhalese 
majority 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people have controlled the government and military since the 
indian ocean island became independent from britain in 1949 the 
sinhalese are mostly buddhists 
tamils who are mostly hindu comprise 18 percent of the 
population but have an overwhelming majority in the north and a 
hefty minority in the east 
at least 14000 people have died in the 7yearold tamil 
insurrection government officials estimate the death toll since 
june 11 at 5000

six ships carrying 3000 west 
african soldiers sailed thursday to enforce a ceasefire in 
liberia where a 10000strong rebel army threatens to fight them 
to the last man 
the west african economic community sent the soldiers and 
emphasized its task force was on a peaceful mission to halt the 
8monthold civil war in which 5000 people have died mostly 
civilians 
rebel chief charles taylor says the peace plan is a maneuver to 
keep president samuel doe in power taylors national patriotic 
front of liberia has the largest of the three armies in the west 
african nation of 25 million residents 
rebel leader prince johnson a rival of taylor and forces loyal 
to doe have accepted a truce johnsons men and does forces 
control the capital of monrovia including the port taylors force 
controls most of the rest of liberia but has been unable to fight 
its way into complete control 
the fleet could reach monrovia early friday but it was unclear 
whether the task force would enter or wait offshore for more 
negotiations to bring about a truce its commander lt gen arnold 
quainoo of ghana has said he did not want to risk entering liberia 
until all sides agreed to stop fighting 
peace talks were to resume monday but taylor has not said 
whether he would send envoys 
troops from ghana nigeria sierra leone gambia and guinea have 
been assembling for weeks togo said it would send troops but did 
not 
efforts to persuade taylor to accept the force collapsed 
wednesday after his representatives and west african leaders 
conferred for two days in banjul gambia 
a statement from the office of gambian leader sir dawda jawara 
chairman of the west african organization blamed taylor for the 
talks failure 
it said the meeting agreed to meet taylors demands for an 
initial 10day truce but taylors envoys backed off when they 
heard doe and johnson agreed 
taylor has said he is concerned that hundreds of the soldiers 
come from nigeria and guinea whose leaders in the past have 
supported doe he led his forces into liberia from ivory coast on 
dec 24 saying does government was corrupt and he would oust it 
taylor has refused to allow thousands of nigerians and guineans 
caught behind his lines on monrovias eastern outskirts to leave 
the country 
his spokesman tom woewiyu said tuesday the rebels would 
fight to the last man against the west african soldiers 
there are enough guns floating around in liberia for a 
group of people to come to liberia with even bigger guns is like 
putting an explosive in a fire he said 
taylor reportedly said this week the intervention would leave 
him free to call on whomever he pleased for help he has denied 
charges by the united states and by johnson who used to be his 
chief commander that his rebels were trained and armed by libya 
and burkina faso 
west african leaders decided to intervene aug 6 they said the 
war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their 
citizens were trapped in liberia and about 400000 liberian 
refugees were burdening neighboring countries

the antidefamation league of bnai brith on 
thursday asked the pentagon to look into reports that jewish 
soldiers headed for saudi arabia have been told to consider 
concealing their religion and getting nondenominational dog tags 
while offering soldiers the option not to display their 
religious affiliation may be wellintentioned it is unclear 
exactly what procedure is being followed and upon whose orders 
adl national director abraham foxman said in a letter to defense 
secretary dick cheney 
it is imperative that this issue be presented in a manner 
which is not only consistent with military security but is also 
sensitive to the concerns of all service personnel while not being 
perceived as coercive foxman wrote 
he suggested that if such protections are needed the defense 
department should issue a directive to all american service 
personnel outlining the options on religious affiliation 
foxmans letter came one day after sen daniel p moynihan 
dny said he had received complaints from the parents of a 
jewish soldier who was advised to get a nonjewish identity 
before going to saudi arabia 
in his letter to cheney moynihan called the reported incident 
an apparent extension of our sorry policy of many years standing 
of turning a blind eye to saudi policy of refusing visas to 
americans of the jewish religion 
cheney on abcs good morning america said thursday that 
the saudis have accepted all forces as is regardless of 
religion 
i would speculate that some uninformed individual down the 
chain of command in the organization may have told the soldiers 
something based upon speculation the fact is the saudis have not 
imposed such restrictions on us and we obviously would not agree to 
that cheney said 
the soldiers father who spoke to the associated press on the 
condition that his name not be used said he was disturbed that his 
son would be given such an option 
i started to make some phone calls i found out that no other 
religion has to change their dog tags he said i know in world 
war ii nobody had to change their dog tags and we were fighting 
nazi germany who did a lot worse than whats happening over 
there 
maj nancy burt an army spokeswoman said the service has no 
official policy on advising jewish soldiers about changing their 
religious identities before going to the middle east 
its a personal matter as far as were concerned she said 
a soldier decides on his own 
however she said if such an incident occurred at a base we 
wouldnt know about it at this level 
there are approximately 7700 jews in the us military 
including about 1300 in the army according to the pentagon

a federal judge overturned the nations most 
restrictive abortion law on thursday prochoice activists said an 
appeal of that ruling would threaten the supreme courts landmark 
roe vs wade decision 
us district judge alex munson declared that roe vs wade the 
1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion applied with 
equal force and effect to guam 
government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued the 
law did not apply to guam because of the islands status as an 
unincorporated territory 
the law signed by gov joseph ada on march 19 banned abortions 
except when the womans life is in danger but munson on march 23 
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law 
from abortionrights forces 
the threat we live with is that the supreme court has 
indicated a willingness to overturn roe vs wade kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
said in a telephone interview from washington 
if the governor appeals munsons ruling he will endanger the 
rights of all women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of 
roe vs wade our goal is to keep these cases out of the courts 
michelman said 
the governor said he did not know whether he would appeal 
im still very prolife and i believe that a fetus is a human 
being and should be given life said ada a roman catholic like 
the vast majority of guams residents 
abortion opponents say they were not surprised by the judges 
decision adding the next step probably will be an appeal that 
would send the case to the supreme court 
we figured that it wouldnt be an easy climb said roland 
rivera vice president of guamanians united for life there is 
just the next higher level to pursue 
guams strong law could not be upheld without overturning 
roe vs wade said rep woody jenkins dla lead author of an 
antiabortion bill approved by the louisiana legislature but vetoed 
by gov buddy roemer 
although its not surprising that a federal district judge 
would follow the roe decision and rule against the guam law it 
must be remembered that this is just the first stage in the 
process jenkins said 
what is important is that this decision be appealed all the 
way to the supreme court so that the highest court in the land is 
given the chance to stop the killing of unborn babies he said in 
baton rouge 
munsons ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it 
violated free speech and due process clauses of the constitution 
the ruling tells states they dont have the power to overturn 
roe vs wade simon heller an attorney with the reproductive 
freedom project of the american civil liberties union said in a 
telephone interview from new york but i doubt it will stop 
legislatures from adopting similar laws its not like the supreme 
court issued this ruling

the us embassy in kuwait is normally guarded 
by just a few marines who provide nofrills security for the 
compound a former us ambassador said on thursday 
and removing them now makes sense said francois dickman a 
retired foreign service officer who was ambassador to kuwait from 
1979 to 1983 
they dont really serve as guards dickman said in a 
telephone interview from his home in laramie wyo they man the 
entrance to the chancery and in the evening they make sure that 
things are locked up and provide elementary security 
dickman said that when he was ambassador the marines lived a 
block away from the embassy compound but he heard at one time 
since that they were living within the enclosure 
these marines cant do anything he said there are only 
six of them it is possible the number has been increased but 
normally its a contingent of six 
he said the unit consisted of one noncommissioned officer in 
command and five enlisted marines

the proctorsilex co is setting aside 
several million dollars to provide free coffee makers to an 
estimated 800000 consumers who purchased a model mow declared a 
fire hazard company officials said thursday 
arnold dreyfus the corporations chairman declined to say 
exactly how much the recall would cost remarking only that it 
would depend on how many recalled coffee makers are turned in 
commenting in a telephone interview from proctorsilex 
headquarters in richmond va dreyfus said the recalled models 
were made in 1985 and 1986 and have since been discontinued 
this problem did not manifest itself until much later he 
said 
proctorsilex says it believes the recalled coffee makers are 
subject to potentially dangerous over heating because their 
thermostats and thermal fuses may malfunction 
dreyfus said the company is trying to identify the vendors that 
provided the allegedly bad fuses 
the company said more than 200 telephone operators are fielding 
calls about proctorsilex automatic drip coffee makers and issuing 
instructions on how to turn in recalled models and receive a free 
appliance 
company officials acknowledged that the initial volume has been 
so heavy that many consumers get repeated busy signals 
the tollfree number set up by the company is 18003413333 
dreyfus said the company is pleased so many people are calling 
the number because the calls will result in taking a product with 
a part that doesnt function properly out of the kitchen 
proctorsilex and the us consumer product safety commission 
announced the recall on thursday 
the company said it had received 181 reports of fire involving 
the coffee maker it was sold nationwide in thousands of commercial 
outlets including sears and jc penney 
the company said owners of suspected models should unplug them 
immediately 
people were reporting heat smoke and meltdown and that could 
have led to a fire dreyfus said 
some of the fires reported to the company caused property 
damage one owner received a minor burn when picking up an 
overheated unit the company said 
dreyfus said a number of people have sued the company for 
damages resulting from malfunctioning coffee makers but said he did 
not know how many 
the recall includes proctorsilex coffee makers with model 
numbers that begin with a4 or a5 and series numbers that end with 
the numbers 58 or 68 
recalled sears counter craft and sears kenmore coffee makers are 
models 360480293 and 360480272 
the consumer products safety commission noted that the last 
digit may vary 
recalled jc penney coffee makers have the model number 
7842178h or g and a c number ending in 58 or 68 
coffee makers produced after 1985 and bearing model numbers 
beginning with a6 are not being recalled

a referendum to protect the rights 
of homosexuals in anita bryant country is building into a 
confrontation reminiscent of the 1977 campaign led by the singer 
and former citrus queen 
opponents of the proposed measure have even borrowed the save 
our children slogan bryant used to help win repeal of a gay 
rights ordinance in dade county which includes miami more than a 
decade ago 
eightyeight counties cities and municipalities including palo 
alto calif iowa city iowa and palm beach county in florida 
have laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation massachusetts and wisconsin have state 
antidiscrimination laws 
but the only other gayrights referendum was in 1987 when 
voters in boulder colo approved the measure 
we are watching it closely in part because its a popular vote 
issue and because of where it is paul didonato spokesman for 
the national gay rights advocates in san francisco said of the 
broward county referendum 
the county dades neighbor to the north has a reputation for 
spring breaks and tiny bikinis but in march it gained attention 
when its sheriff banned 2 live crews raunchy rap album from record 
stores 
broward already prohibits discrimination on the basis of race 
color religion national origin sex age marital status 
political affiliation or handicap 
the only thing that the amendment does is to add sexual 
orientation to that list said allan terl an attorney and gay 
activist who helped prepare the measure for the sept 4 primary 
ballot anybody who tells you it would do more than that is lying 
to you 
referendum opponents cast the measure in more alarming tones 
they want to legitimize homosexuality its immoral anal sex 
is not the community standard said maurice baum head of the 
local branch of christian coalition a group founded by 
televangelist pat robertson 
the measure would allow more homosexual teachers he said and 
these teachers would molest our children these people would give 
our children an incurable disease 
activists worked for more than a year to get the measure on the 
ballot in recent weeks the campaign has become emotional even 
leading to claims of death threats from both sides 
miamis archbishop edward mccarthy sent a letter to broward 
countys 49 parishes calling the referendum morally 
unacceptable and asking them to blast the proposed law from the 
pulpit that prompted advocates to picket the archdiocese 
baum said the christian coalition has the silent support of 
bryant but the singers manager paul bartholomew said she is not 
involved 
bryants singing career took a tumble after she led the 1977 
dade county campaign the citrus industry fired her as its 
spokeswoman although in 1988 she was inducted into the florida 
citrus hall of fame 
we have simply put it behind us bartholomew said she 
spoke she made her stand and paid a very dear price 
leaders of the gay community estimate that about 100000 of the 
countys 13 million residents are gay and will turn out in full 
force 
the proposed referendum asks the countys 627000 registered 
voters shall the broward county human rights act be amended to 
include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation as a 
discriminatory classification 
it would allow the countys human rights board to investigate 
allegations of discrimination in job hiring housing and all real 
estate transactions 
the broward county referendum is definitely in the spotlight 
around the country in the gay and lesbian community said robert 
bray of the national gay amp lesbian task force in washington dc 
if we can pass it there in the heart of anita bryant country we 
can pass it anywhere

the chairman of the house banking committee 
predicted on thursday that the bush administration will have to 
renegotiate many sales of savings and loans the government 
completed at the end of 1988 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said committee investigators 
found that investors had received 78 in assets and 
governmentgranted benefits for every 1 of capital they put up to 
purchase the sampls 
many of these resolutions went beyond sweetheart deals and 
amounted to virtual giveaways gonzalez said in announcing that 
his committee had scheduled a sept 14 hearing to examine the 
controversial sales 
gonzalez said the committee would examine the results of a staff 
investigation of 94 of the 1988 deals focusing particularly on 
sales of american savings of california and two giant texas sampls 
first gibraltar and southwest savings of texas 
the house banking committee investigation is only one of several 
being conducted on the 1988 sampl sales which were completed by the 
federal home loan bank board the now defunct agency which at the 
time supervised the countrys sampl industry 
the resolution trust corp the agency created last year by 
congress to clean up the sampl mess is scheduled to complete its own 
study soon into whether the government would be better off by 
exercising contract options allowing the government to get out of 
some of the guarantees made in the 1988 deals 
gonzalez said that an effort to renegotiate some of the 1988 
deals should be made even though he recognized that would involve 
monumental legal and financial problems 
it may be better for the government to buy out some of the 
contracts at least the most onerous parts of the contracts 
rather than letting the costs mount under longterm guarantees 
gonzalez said 
he said unless the bush administration renegotiates some of the 
1988 deals it would further increase the price tag of the sampl 
bailout already the costliest government bailout in history 
the sales have been defended by former bank board chairman m 
danny wall as a crash effort by the government to transfer into 
private hands insolvent sampls which were draining billions of 
dollars out of the governments insurance fund 
but critics have charged that in its headlong rush to complete 
sampl sales in 1988 the government entered into contracts that will 
virtually assure sampl purchasers of a profit from generous 
government subsidies that will end up costing taxpayers more in the 
long run 
earlier this month a senate judiciary subcommittee chaired by 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio raised questions about what is now 
known as bluebonnet savings bank of dallas which was sold to james 
m fail an arizona insurance executive 
fail put up only 1000 of his own money and borrowed another 
70 million to complete a transaction that investigators said 
qualified him for at least 185 billion in government subsidies

is now out of politics and fully dedicated to military affairs 
at a ceremony marking his 17th anniversary as head of the army 
pinochet insisted the army is devoted to purely professional 
matters 
he added we must also cooperate in the establishment and 
maintenance of a situation of normalcy that guarantees to all 
chileans their complete freedom we must ensure respect to a 
superior legal order 
pinochet was appointed commander in chief on aug 23 1973 by 
thenpresident salvador allende the elected socialist leader he 
toppled 19 days later in a violent military coup 
allende died during the coup in his presidential palace as the 
palace was in flames and under heavy air and ground attack the 
military said he committed suicide 
after handing over power to aylwin on march 11 pinochet 
remained as army commander sheltered by a clause in the 1980 
constitution written by his government before he left office 
aylwin who is constitutionally prohibited from firing him made 
a public appeal for his resignation but pinochet refused 
in a message to army personnel thursday pinochet repeated his 
decision to continue to lead the destiny of this unbeaten army 
later during a ceremony at the military academy pinochet was 
promised our unrestricted loyalty by the armys second in 
command gen jorge lucar 
lucar speaking on behalf of the army also supported pinochets 
decision to remain commander in chief because of the security 
that your authority and experience give us 
the ceremony was set up as a purely military occasion prominent 
rightwing politicians including aides to pinochet while he was 
president gathered at his house in the morning to congratulate 
him but none were invited to the military academy 
a small group of people mostly women gathered outside the 
heavily guarded academy in an upperclass santiago neighborhood to 
cheer pinochet

west german chancellor helmut kohl on 
the threshhold of becoming the first leader of all germany since 
1945 appealed thursday for an allout effort to heal east 
germanys wounds 
just 12 hours earlier the east german parliament chose oct 3 
as the day that nation will cease to exist and will merge with west 
germany 
that means kohl will become chancellor of all germany on oct 3 
until joint german elections are held on dec 2 
kohl hopes to win those elections but is facing a tough 
challenge from oskar lafontaine candidate from the opposition 
social democrats 
there has been no single leader of all germany since the world 
war ii defeat of adolf hitlers third reich in 1945 
parliament on thursday ratified a treaty with east germany that 
will make possible the first allgerman elections since 1933 
government coalition partners and the opposition passed the measure 
easily with a show of hands 
east german lawmakers approved the same treaty the previous day 
in a 40minute speech to parliament kohl praised his fellow 
germans for persisting in their hopes of ending the division of 
their homeland 
today is a day of joy for all germans said kohl 
oct 3 he said will be a great day in the history of our 
people we are fulfilling a dream which many people among us had 
already abandoned 
but kohl warned his countrymen that overcoming east germanys 
considerable problems wont be easy unemployment is skyrocketing 
in east germany crime is rising and many east germans feel 
demoralized 
we have a heavy responsibility kohl said 
even though we have every right to rejoice we know we are 
standing before an extraordinary challenge overcoming the old 
economic and social order in what is now east germany he said 
kohl clearly trying to bolster his standing among voters with 
elections 3 months away had high praise for east germans 
with their courage their levelheadedness and above all their 
love for freedom they have given an example of how dictators can 
be peacefully overcome said kohl referring to last falls 
peaceful revolution that toppled 40 years of stalinist rule 
kohl has made no secret of his desire to be considered the 
father of german unity 
in his parliamentary speech he evoked the name of a beloved 
past leader konrad adenauer while reviewing his own contributions 
to the unity process 
lafontaine had some rare praise for kohl pointing out an 
agreement by kohl and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
german unity 
in that agreement gorbachev dropped his objections to nato 
membership for a united germany in exchange for promises red army 
troops can stay in east germany for up to four years 
but lafontaine said many factors paved the way for unity 
without gorbachevs reform policies renewal in eastern europe 
and in the gdr east germany would not have been possible he 
said

an impostor horse named milagros didnt 
pull off the miracle she was named after in a race that police are 
investigating after the bettors got stung 
the ringer distantly related to a kentucky derby winner 
was substituted for another winless horse racing at long odds but 
the impostor came in second meaning thousands of dollars in rigged 
bets went bad 
the real milagros had finished no better than 10th in five 
previous starts including a dismal performance in a june 27 race 
at mountaineer park in chester wva 
on the aug 16 race the horse entered as milagros went off at 
61 odds but finished second paying 980 for place and 520 for 
show 
those are good odds if your horse is a sure thing to win but 
those guys must have really got stung said massachusetts racing 
commission steward rene riera jr and you know he added 
milagros in spanish means miracles 
state investigators believe the impostor horse had multiple wins 
to its credit in more competitive events than the marshfield fair 
the impostor was a similarlooking but faster filly named joshuas 
sunny the horse had a record of numerous second and thirdplace 
finishes 
investigators discovered the actual identity of the horse last 
weekend a day before the filly was entered in another race at the 
fair 
state police trooper anthony bille one of three officers 
investigating the case said the first indication something was 
wrong came when authorities inspected the horses foal papers 
which include lineage and distinguishing physical characteristics 
the form was filled out in blue ink except for the id number 
which was typed in black ink 
when we held it up to the light we saw it covered other 
numbers bille said for the racetrack and bettors bille said 
this is the ultimate nightmare but weve got some solid leads 
the impostor horse is now under 24hour armed guard

mohawk negotiators suspended talks with the 
quebec government thursday after armored personnel carriers moved 
into position near a barricade the mohawks erected six weeks ago in 
their land dispute 
its clear to me this is an intimidation tactic said mohawk 
negotiator joe deom surrounded by masked guntoting members of 
the warriors society milling about the army vehicles theyre 
making it more and more difficult to stay at the table 
maj richard larouche an army spokesman said the soldiers 
advanced their position because armed warriors were spotted coming 
in and out of a milewide area separating army and mohawk lines the 
army said it would stay in its new position about 35 feet from the 
mohawk barricade 
despite that native spokesmen not identified said the 
mohawks were ready to return to the bargaining table 
larouche said the military closed the gap after sending armored 
personnel carriers to accompany a busload of mohawk negotiators 
tempers in the region 18 miles west of montreal were high 
residents were frustrated and furious over commuting hardships 
and loss of business revenue caused by the mohawk blockade of 
mercier bridge linking several communities on the south side of 
the st lawrence river with montreal 
crowds have tried to stop medical supplies and food from 
reaching the mohawk community and to keep indians from leaving 
the goverment guarantees access to the reserve while 
negotiations continue under an agreement reached aug 12 federal 
troops are at oka in response to a request by quebec premier robert 
bourassa 
as local police watched wednesday mohawks and whites brawled 
after a crowd halted three cars with mohawk passengers at 
stecatherine soldiers intervened and arrested five indians 
about 50 whites carrying crowbars and baseball bats patrolled 
another road from the reserve tires were slashed on two mohawk 
vehicles and a van was overturned before the indians fled 
a montreal demonstrator said the police have to let them 
through with their food we dont 
the dispute arose from okas plans to expand a golf course onto 
land said to be ancestral one officer was killed in a gun battle 
on july 11 when quebec police tried to remove a mohawk barrier 
blame in the death has not been fixed 
the mohawks put some demands in writing for the first time 
wednesday it was expected the mohawks will propose giving native 
reserves in ontario and quebec sovereignty over economic 
development 
on thursday the mohawks boarded a rented bus bound for 
negotiations at oka when they were met by armored personnel 
carriers 
the one in front lowered its machine gun at the bus and they 
said they were here to escort us to the talks said mohawk 
spokesman peter diome 
diome quoted the soldiers as explaining that death threats had 
been made against indian negotiators but the mohawks called off 
thursdays talks branding the army movement an act of 
aggression 
on wednesday angry whites stopped an ambulance from the 
kahnawake reserve carrying a mohawk woman who had just given birth 
she was being rushed to a montreal hospital because of birth 
complications 
two of the protesters insisted on looking into the back of the 
ambulance to verify there were no weapons and it was a real 
emergency said mireille sigmen head of communications for the 
ambulance service she said the service is filing a complaint with 
provincial police 
emergency vehicles are supposed to have unrestricted passage 
over mercier bridge 
quebecs public security minister said wednesday the dispute has 
cost the government at least 85 million us in police costs and 
compensation

president mikhail s gorbachev on thursday 
nullified an attempt by the russian republic to wrest control over 
its vast natural resources from the central soviet government 
gorbachev also said he would meet soon with the president of 
russia boris n yeltsin in an effort to coordinate plans to shift 
the soviet union to a market economy 
at the same time gorbachev issued his presidential decree 
russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics backed down from 
its order earlier this month that declared invalid contracts signed 
by the soviet government 
its action averted or postponed a critical battle between 
the national soviet government and the resourcerich republic over 
both the acquisition of badly needed foreign currency and the 
division of power 
russias aug 10 declaration had thrown into question scores of 
lucrative contracts including the 5 billion diamond deal with de 
beers the worlds leading dealer in diamond exports 
russia had maintained it voided all contracts signed without 
its approval to sell the republics diamonds metals oil gas 
uranium and even any manufactured product it considers strategic 
but on thursday russias deputy prime minister gennady 
filshin said the republic had now decided to honor all agreements 
even those forged without its consent the independent news agency 
interfax reported 
he specifically mentioned the diamond contract which was 
considered lucrative for both the republic and the soviet union 
interfax said 
gorbachev said russias earlier declaration could cause 
serious damage to the countrys interests by complicating 
possibilities to buy goods and win credits which are needed so 
badly amid current economic difficulties 
it is effectively directed at undermining the economic 
sovereignty of other union republics since it usurps the right to 
manage products belonging to the union of soviet socialist 
republics he said 
gorbachev declared the russian action null and void 
according to remarks carried on the soviet tv program vremya and by 
the official tass news agency 
in a second presidential decree gorbachev granted the national 
academy of sciences broad autonomy ending decades of tight state 
control 
gorbachev in a television interview said he spent six hours 
wednesday with the panel he and yeltsin set up to forge a path 
toward a market economy in the soviet union 
gorbachev praised the panel and said it had made good progress 
predicting there would soon be a unified program the panel is to 
present its findings to the soviet parliament early next month 
he said he agreed with the commissions proposal to first 
stabilize the countrys economy a process he said would take a few 
months he said this would take an edge off the transition period 
and would avoid sharp price increases he said the switch to a 
market system would take 18 months to two years 
on thursday gorbachev met with soviet prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov who leads a second panel that is exploring ways to switch 
to a market system

be put off until haitis political crisis is resolved 
a letter from seven of the 12 parties that make up the unity 
assembly coalition said the political climate is not conducive to 
holding free and fair elections tentatively set for nov 4

thursday afternoon after 10 men piled out of a vehicle and 
brandishing weapons and throwing stones ordered pedestrians off 
the streets no one was hurt and police made arrests radio

the unity assembly appointed mrs pascaltrouillot a supreme 
court judge as transitional president after military ruler lt 
gen prosper avril was forced to flee this poor caribbean island 
nation last march 
she is to govern alongside a 19member council of state until 
elections but political violence a rise in crime and the return 
of figures associated with the brutal duvalier dynasty that ruled 
haiti for 29 years has put in doubt the holding of credible 
elections 
the council of state a quasilegislative body broke relations 
with mrs pascaltrouillot last week and called her an obstacle 
to elections 
fears focus on the army which was accused of allowing the 
massacre of 34 voters at the polls during aborted november 1987 
elections 
our problems begin and end with the army it has not yet 
decided to promote the democratic process said presidential 
candidate louis dejoie jr

letter to electoral council president jeanrobert sabalat we ask 
you to suspend the electoral timetable until the government crisis 
is completely resolved 
the seven parties range from far left to far right

was one of the five parties that did not sign the letter said 
if the government falls the army will take over 
haiti with a population of more than 53 million has been 
almost exclusively under authoritarian rule since it won

before us health officials said thursday 
polio which the pan american health organization has targeted 
for eradication in the americas this year was detected last year

confirmed in the absence of other causes even though many 
patients died or were lost to followup and detailed viral 
analysis was not possible 
the pan american health organizations technical advisory group 
has recommended not counting polio cases in the future unless they 
can be virally confirmed 
worldwide about 250000 cases of the paralyzing viral disease 
were reported last year some 25000 patients died 
polio was wiped out in the united states after the 1954

an investigative reporter angered by the new 
york times review of his book on the alleged links between 
organized crime and the national football league filed a 10 
million libel lawsuit against the paper thursday 
dan e moldea filed suit in us district court in washington 
over the newspapers sept 3 1989 review of his book 
interference how organized crime influences professional 
football 
the new york timess top attorney expressed confidence that the 
suit would be thrown out of court and said the review was based 
on accurate facts 
the review by times sportswriter gerald eskenazi said in part 
that moldeas book contains sloppy journalism as well as 
errors and unfounded insinuations 
the lawsuit alleges that the review was intended to protect 
the nfl by personally attacking moldea discrediting his reputation 
and smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter 
the review gave false impressions through use of false and 
misleading examples intended to injure moldeas reputation impeach 
moldeas honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that 
interference would become a widely read book by the public the 
suit says 
moldea said in an interview that his publisher william morrow 
and co inc had printed 33000 copies of the book because initial 
sales had been strong but after the new york times review came 
out sales dropped off precipitously and only about 21000 were 
sold 
this thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just 
published a correction or my letter that countered point by 
point statements in the review moldea said 
eskenazi declined comment on the matter referring questions to 
times executives even though this is something im appalled at 
when people do it to me 
the new york times senior attorney george freeman said he had 
not seen the lawsuit but he was familiar with the case 
were totally convinced that the suit will be dismissed 
freeman said a book review is protected opinion particularly 
where a review is based on accurate facts as this one is 
freeman moldea and the writers attorney roger c simmons of 
frederick md noted that moldea had proposed a settlement of the 
case that expired thursday but no one would disclose details of 
the settlement offer 
its funny they didnt even wait until the deadline expired 
before filing the suit freeman said 
other books by moldea are dark victory ronald reagan mca and 
the mob which came out in 1986 the hunting of cain a true 
story of money greed and fratricide in 1983 and the hoffa 
wars teamsters rebels politicians and the mob in 1978

the chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee said thursday that president bush should explain his 
intentions in the persian gulf to a joint session of congress when 
lawmakers return in two weeks 
rep dante fascell dfla said a host of issues need to be 
addressed as the united states moves beyond the initial emergency 
among them he said is how the enormous military undertaking 
will be financed and how the world community will pay its fair 
share of the costs 
should it become necessary for the united states alone or 
collectively to initiate military action in defense of our citizens 
and interests it is essential that the congress be fully involved 
in view of its constitutional responsibilities and that the 
american people fully understand the reasons why its government 
believes such a grave action has become necessary fascell said 
in a statement released by his office 
iraq is holding thousands of our citizens hostage this is an 
intolerable situation it is by no means clear however that 
military action is the most effective way to deal with the 
situation 
fascell said he was not criticizing the presidents actions so 
far but said the time has come to deepen and broaden the 
national dialogue on steps yet to be taken 
congress returns from its summer recess sept 5 
rep bill lowery rcalif said thursday that he would 
introduce legislation to update the soldiers and sailors relief 
act so members of the military reserves who are called into active 
service during the persian gulf crisis arent evicted from their 
homes for not paying rent while serving 
there is a provision that prevents a service members family 
from being evicted from their rental home or apartment while he or 
she is serving said lowery but it only applies if the rent is 
less than 150 and only for three months 
he said he wanted to bring the law in line with todays economy 
he said he has asked the defense department for suggestions on 
other changes in the law to modernize it 
lowery also said army secretary pw stone has asked the house 
appropriations subcommittee on military construction to approve use 
of 30 million in emergency funds to build a tent city in saudi 
arabia 
lowery who is the ranking republican on the subcommittee said 
action will come as quickly as possible 
stone said he had approved the project to provide basic 
shelter and sustainment facilities for the health safety and 
soldier support of personnel participating in operation desert 
shield 
federal law gives the army secretary authority to take such 
emergency steps but it requires congressional approval within 21 
days 
rep bruce morrison dconn said meantime that events in the 
persian gulf illustrated the need to approve a bill he introduced 
last year to establish a permanent world court for the prosecution 
of internationally recognized crimes 
he said saddam husseins detaining of foreigners in kuwait and 
iraq is criminal 
when i introduced hr 3355 last year no one anticipated the 
situation we now face in iraq said morrison but that is 
precisely why we need the kind of international criminal court that 
my bill calls for to see to it that the rule of international law 
has teeth 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said he and six other 
gop senators hope to meet with egyptian president hosni mubarek in 
cairo during an 11day trip to the middle east and eastern europe 
that begins friday 
i still believe mubarak is the best hope for resolving the 
gulf standoff as far as being an effective strong leader dole 
told reporters in topeka kan he still has pretty good ties with 
saddam hussein 
the trip includes stops in egypt bahrain yugoslavia bulgaria 
romania czechoslovakia and the soviet union accompanying dole 
will be sens don nickles of oklahoma alfonse damato of new york

a judge upheld 52 million in fines levied 
against the united mine workers during a 10monthlong strike 
against pittston coal group inc by thousands of union members 
russell county circuit judge donald mcglothlin jr ordered the 
payments wednesday although both pittston and the umw had filed a 
joint motion to dismiss the fines after settling their strike feb 
19 
the walkout involved 1200 striking miners in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky 
umw leaders said thursday they were reviewing mcglothlins 
ruling they have appealed past orders to pay fines that were 
levied against the union when its members violated orders 
restricting pickets during the strike 
mcglothlin agreed to dismiss 112 million in fines to 
compensate pittston for losses caused by union efforts to limit 
coal production 
he upheld the remaining 52 million owed to the state and to 
dickenson and russell counties in virginia where most of the 
strike action took place 
umw members said they were trying to put the strike behind them 
when the ruling came 
it brings back a lot of hard feelings said electrician 
james gibbs of bristol he said he had hoped the judge would have 
decided it took two sides to have the problems that we had 
gibbs said mcglothlin may be biased against the union because 
umw leader jackie stump defeated donald mcglothlin sr an 
incumbent in the virginia house of delegates election in november 
we run a man against his daddy and beat him there might be 
a little malice there said freeman artrip another union member 
a lot of it is a vindictive thing said jack kiser who 
works at pittstons preparation plant in russell county 
mcglothlin said the election had no influence on his decision 
he said he anticipated a strong reaction after his ruling 
im not geared as a judge to making my decisions on what 
people might think he said 
mcglothlin said more legal action may be needed to compel the 
union to comply with his orders

a citywide police dragnet failed to snare the 
elusive zodiac gunman for the fourth time this summer thursday and 
that could mean a sharp reduction in a 50detective task force 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli is evaluating the size of 
the task force and a decision will come down sometime next week 
said police department spokesman sgt peter sweeney 
borrelli told reporters tuesday that a cut in the task force was 
likely if the astrologyobsessed gunman failed to strike late 
wednesday or early thursday calling it not a deemphasis on 
the case but a reduction 
the gunman who began six letters to police and the media with 
the phrase this is the zodiac has shot four men killing one 
since march 8 in the rambling letters he threatened to shoot 
eight others one for each astrological sign 
since the gunmans last attack on a homeless man sleeping on a 
central park bench on june 21 the zodiac has not written any new 
letters to police or the media or claimed any new victims 
the task force released a sketch of a man wanted for 
questioning has interviewed close to 2000 people and questioned 
and released about a dozen suspects in the case 
but calls to a 24hour confidential hotline have trickled down 
to two or three a day and the case is being handled primarily as a 
homicide investigation the chief said

the british producer of miss saigon plans to 
meet with representatives of actors equity next month in an effort 
to settle remaining disputes and bring the 10 million production 
to broadway next april 
equity believes that a dialogue between the parties rather 
than further press releases will prove to be salutary said a 
threeparagraph equity statement thursday perhaps through these 
discussions miss saigon can move out of the press room and into 
the rehearsal studio 
marc thibodeau a spokesman for producer cameron mackintosh 
said the meeting had been set for the week after labor day 
mackintosh will come to new york for the meeting both sides said 
miss saigon is a musical love story about an american 
soldier during the final days of the vietnam war in 1975 
equity the actors union voted aug 7 to bar white actor 
jonathan pryce from playing the part of a eurasian pimp in the us 
production of the play which is now on the london stage 
but after mackintoch canceled the production which would be the 
most expensive in broadway history the unions executive council 
reversed itself last week and approved pryces role 
mackintosh said equitys vote came without an understanding that 
artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised and said he 
would not bring the musical here until his fears were assuaged 
equity responded by inviting him to a meeting 
some actors in the asianamerican community were incensed by 
equitys turnabout 
the asianamerican community is still not happy one bit with 
the reversal and nothing has changed in that regard said 
dominick balletta producing associate at the pan asian repertory

moderates gathered thursday to plot their revival 
after more than a decade of waning influence in the 
fundamentalistdominated southern baptist convention they said 
they hoped to avoid a split in the denomination 
the opening session of the threeday meeting was marked by calls 
for cooperation and trust within the convention but the 
fundamentalists were decried for having maligned and libeled good 
and godly people 
an organizer of the meeting predicted it would take a miracle of 
biblical proportions to reconcile the political differences between 
the two baptist factions 
the only hope i can give you is that god parted the red sea 
said the rev daniel vestal pastor of dunwoody baptist church in 
atlanta and a defeated candidate for the southern baptist 
convention presidency 
vestal said the meeting of 25000 disaffected southern baptists 
had not been convened for the purpose of creating a new 
denomination 
the southern baptist institutions and missionary causes are 
still very much viable as a whole vestal said this group of 
people here are tired of fighting fundamentalists 
asked by a reporter if it would be wrong to interpret the 
meeting as the first step toward an eventual break vestal said 
i wouldnt tell you not to interpret it that way im just 
saying our intention is not to split 
in an address to the gathering vestal said the meeting was 
forced by a group of folks who have told us they dont want us to 
work with them in the cause of christ 
i have heard that the key to revival is brokenness said 
vestal who was defeated in june by conservative texan morris 
chapman for president of the convention well if there ever was 
a group of people who have experienced brokenness it is us 
over the last 12 years conservatives have gained increasing 
control of the 149 millionmember church the largest protestant 
denomination in the nation they believe in the inerrancy of the 
bible and contend that those who disagree are not true christians 
the moderates advocate local church autonomy and want the 
denomination to include those with diverse interpretations of the 
bible 
among the sessions scheduled at the consultation of concerned 
baptists meeting was a workshop on alternative funding 
group leaders are expected to consider a proposal to give 
churches that are unhappy with the convention leaderships use of 
its budget an optional delivery system for contributions to 
mission programs

diffrent strokes star todd bridges was 
acquitted thursday of assault in the shooting of a narcotics dealer 
at a drug den it was the second trial clearing the actor of 
criminal charges 
bridges 25 looked up and breathed a heavy sigh after the 
superior court jury announced its verdict 
i feel a lot of relief that its over bridges said outside 
court 
bridges who played gary colemans brother willis on the nbc 
series for eight years faced a retrial in the february 1989 
pointblank shooting of convicted drug dealer kenneth tex clay 
in the first trial jurors acquitted bridges of attempted 
murder but deadlocked on the assault charge prosecutors decided 
to retry bridges on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon 
deputy district attorney william hodgman contended that bridges 
shot clay several times at a southcentral los angeles drug house 
because clay allegedly stole the actors bmw 
clay recovered from the gunshot wounds to his arms and chest 
the prosecution said bridges admitted to the attack as he was 
being booked by police 
but defense attorney johnnie cochran argued his client was in 
the middle of a fourday cocaine binge during the attack at the 
drug den and that someone else shot clay 
the jury deliberated for three days spending much of wednesday 
reviewing the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses who 
claimed to have seen bridges with a gun shortly before the shooting 
the evidence was lacking in this case said cochran we 
proved that todd bridges did not do the shooting 
but deputy district attorney william hodgman said jurors may 
have been influenced by bridges fame from appearances in the 
situation comedies diffrent strokes and fish after 
announcing the verdict at least one juror asked for bridges 
autograph 
when you have a celebrity defendant the normal rules dont 
apply and i think thats what happened here hodgman said 
in his closing argument cochran blamed the shooting on bridges 
former codefendant harvie duckett who had pleaded guilty to an 
accessory charge and was promised leniency for his testimony 
cochran said bridges an actor since age 6 was actually a 
victim in the case a cocaine addict who fell prey to violent drug

the bush administration pulled 
marine guards and most diplomats out of the threatened us embassy 
in kuwait on thursday but left the ambassador and a skeleton staff 
behind in defiance of saddam husseins eviction order 
a few marine guards arent going to fight off the entire iraqi 
army a senior white house official said we dont want to put 
american lives at unnecessary danger 
with iraqs friday deadline looming for foreign embassies to 
close their doors in kuwait city the white house said publicly it 
had evacuated nonessential personnel from the embassy 
administration officials said privately that all but about a 
dozen of the 120 americans at the embassy had left for baghdad 
where us officials expected to fly them out of iraq 
the group reached baghdad about 1 am local time friday 5 pm 
edt thursday in a 33car caravan after a trip that took more than 
19 hours said a senior us official in washington who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
however another official said one woman traveling with the 
group was injured when two of the cars collided at the start of the 
trip and had to be left at a kuwait city hospital 
the deadline imposed by iraq for closing the embassy initially 
was given to the united states in a diplomatic note as noon local 
time 4 am edt on friday the senior official said but 
subsequently iraq has said the deadline is midnight 4 pm edt 
friday the official said 
the iraqi state news agency by contrast set the deadline at 9 
pm local time 1 pm edt 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater initially indicated the 
embassys marine security guards would probably stay as long as 
the ambassadors there 
but he later issued a written statement saying contrary to 
earlier information there are no us marines at the us embassy 
in kuwait the marines departed with the convoy which is en route 
to baghdad 
also on thursday 
president bush looked to the united nations to put military 
muscle behind its sanctions against iraq spokesman fitzwater said 
we are in this to the end 
at the pentagon defense secretary dick cheney approved plans 
to call 10000 military reservists to active duty over the next 
week and nearly 50000 by the end of september to support the 
massive deployment of us troops ships and warplanes to the 
persian gulf many of the reserves themselves will be heading for 
the gulf area 
state department spokesman richard boucher denounced as 
shameful theater saddams television appearance in baghdad with 
british children and others who have not been allowed to leave the 
area 
fitzwater said ambassador nathaniel howell and the skeleton 
staff at the kuwait embassy were staying behind to help some 2500 
trapped americans saddam calls them guests though he will not 
let them leave who were in kuwait when iraqs tanks overran it 
three weeks ago 
about half the americans at the embassy before the partial 
evacuation were diplomatic personnel and half were dependents 
including nearly 30 children the state department said 
the diplomats will remain as long as there are americans that 
they can assist said fitzwater briefing reporters at a seaside 
hotel near bushs vacation home 
boucher asked why howell was staying said simply hes 
captain of the ship 
bush indicated at a news conference wednesday that he was 
willing to give the united nations a little time to decide how 
to stop iraqi ships before ordering us warships to do the job 
fitzwater said talks were going on at the un among the five 
permanent members of the security council the united states 
great britain china the soviet union and france on a possible 
resolution to enforce the sanctions the soviets have raised 
objections to a draft british resolution that would specifically 
authorize military action to enforce the embargo 
we are still following the situation continuously we are 
following the tankers in the gulf and continue to work with the 
un said fitzwater 
we are in this to the end and we are determined to see it 
through fitzwater said 
in washington boucher scolded the soviet union for keeping 
military advisers in iraq and suggested moscow may be in violation 
of united nations sanctions 
it is inappropriate to provide any form of military assistance 
to iraq the state department spokesman said we believe un 
sanctions extend to the provision of services to iraq 
but the white house refrained from such criticism 
fitzwater said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze had 
assured secretary of state james a baker iii that the soviets were 
trying to get all their advisers and other citizens out of iraq 
the soviets stand against iraq has been enormously helpful in 
terms of the latitude thats been given for all the countries of 
the world to pursue their opposition to this ggressor fitzwater 
said 
on jordans decision to close its border with iraq against a 
flood of refugees fitzwater said we do understand the jordanian 
predicament and the united states stands ready to help 
but he also said the united states will hold king hussein to 
his pledge to abide by the sanctions bush was very firm with 
him when they met here last week and that has not changed 
the united states also will hold yemen to its promise not to 
unload a tanker filled with iraqi oil that was allowed to reach a 
yemeni port fitzwater said 
bush stayed out of the public eye thursday boating with brent 
scowcroft his national security adviser and planning to attend a 
closeddoor republican fundraiser thursday evening in nearby cape 
porpoise for new hampshire gov judd gregg and for david emery a 
congressional candidate here in maine 
this was the 14th day of bushs planned 25day vacation which 
has repeatedly been interrupted by crisis planning bush summoned 
treasury secretary nicholas brady budget director richard darman 
and other aides for a luncheon meeting friday to discuss the 
federal budget deficit made worse by the gulf crisis and the 
soaring price of oil 
fitzwater denied there has been much criticism from the public 
about bushs vacationing during the crisis 
we hear more and more from people who are saying you are 
doing just the right thing mr president stay with it said 
fitzwater 
being at kennebunkport helps give him a little distraction and 
get a little of the rest that hes going to need we all are going 
to need as we proceed through this in the next weeks before us

authorities in tirana are building a wall 
around the embassy quarter where about 5000 albanians sought 
asylum last month western business executives who visited the 
albanian capital this week said wednesday 
the business people speaking on condition of anonymity said 
metal barriers block the only road into the quarter and police are 
posted around the area 
asylumseekers crashed through gates and scaled embassy compound 
walls in their desperation to emigrate 
a spokesman for a us congressional delegation that visited 
tirana this week confirmed in a telephone interview in prague 
czechoslovakia that a wall was being built around the entire 
embassy quarter 
the spokesman who also spoke on condition of not being 
identified said the top of the wall was being lined with broken 
chunks of rock and mortar 
the businessmen said brick walls one foot to 16 inches thick are 
being erected around the embassies and are already about 10 feet 
high in places 
albania is the last holdout in east europe against democratic 
reforms symbolized by the tearing down of the berlin wall that 
divided east and west for 28 years 
the nations communist leadership introduced new regulations in 
july allowing all albanians to own a passport for travel abroad 
however most albanians do not have access to the hard currency 
they would need to travel 
many of those who took refuge in embassies and were later 
permitted to emigrate complained of low living standards and 
repression under the communists 
the rush on the embassies embarrassed the tirana leadership at a 
time when it is aggressively seeking to cultivate ties abroad 
albanian leader ramiz alia has begun to introduce economic 
reforms in an effort to improve supplies of basic goods and 
services and raise living standards for albanias 3 million people

the united states and britain charged 
thursday that iraq was violating the un economic embargo by 
trying to ship oil worldwide and buy arms on the open market and 
black market 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said he hoped airing of the 
accusations would clear the way for the security council to adopt a 
resolution authorizing military action to enforce the embargo 
the soviet union has said it needs clear evidence of violations 
of the embargo against iraq before approving international military 
enforcement of the sanctions the soviet envoy declined to say if 
he was persuaded by the evidence 
the united states and britain presented their case at an 
informal meeting of the security council sanctions committee 
attended by all council members they presented photographs of 
tankers they said were violating the sanctions and a photo of a 
battle tank said to have been imported illegally 
libya also was accused of helping iraq try to break the arms 
embargo diplomats in attendance said later 
on aug 6 to punish iraq for its invasion of kuwait the 
security council imposed an embargo on all trade with iraq except 
medical supplies and in special humanitarian circumstances food 
iraq is known to be breaking the embargo pickering said 
we are also talking about many efforts by iraq to illegally 
import many different commodities arms machinery steel from 
the open market black market gray market green market any 
market pickering told reporters 
we are talking about lots of ships and many miles in these 
violations pickering said iraq is sending ships to export oil 
all over the world 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon displayed photocopies of the 
pictures and ridiculed them as evidence he said the united states 
and britain appeared to be whipping up a warlike hysteria 
why are some people apparently so eager to go to war and 
mislead public opinion alarcon asked nobody has provided any 
evidence that the embargo is not working 
later iraqi ambassador abdul amir alanbari said the sanctions 
were onesided and imposed under pressure from one or two 
superpowers 
we believe there is no need to worsen the situation by 
resorting to the use of force he saidthis problem could be 
solved diplomatically 
earlier thursday a soviet envoy said political and diplomatic 
efforts should be given more time to defuse the gulf crisis before 
the un security council permits navies to use force to halt all 
shipping to and from iraq 
soviet ambassador valentin v lozinskiy also told reporters that 
there was no breakthrough or accord on a proposed us resolution 
authorizing minimum force to police the embargo against iraq 
he spoke after an informal meeting by the five permanent members 
of the security council the united states the soviet union 
britain china and france 
pickering had told reporters we agreed on a text to send to 
capitals and we will continue our consultations 
we are going to have a vote as soon as it can be arranged 
he said 
pickering and us officials later denied there was any 
disagreement between pickering and lozinskiy about whether the text 
had been accepted by the five governments the only agreement they 
said was to send a text to the capitals of the five powers for 
further consideration 
no security council meeting has been scheduled 
lozinskiy said there could be a security council meeting this 
week but not thursday 
when asked about a breakthrough he said hopefully 
hopefully it takes time not today 
president bush said wednesday he wanted the security councils 
blessing to use force to halt iraqs shipping but said the united 
states already has the right to enforce a un embargo on trade 
with iraq 
us officials contend the united states is authorized to 
enforce the embargo at the request of the ousted kuwaiti 
government and by the un charters specific language granting 
nations the right to selfdefense 
us officials have said they would not call a meeting of the 
full 15member security council unless they have approval of the 
five permanent members or a promise not to veto the us 
initiative

miracle 
elevenyearold ian morton in shorts a print shirt and 
eyeglasses stood quietly through most of the film as the iraqi 
president tried to talk with a younger boy identified only as 
stuart 
the iraqi film broadcast on british television moved to the 
mortons son steven and his wife patricia both 37 and to ians 
brothers gary 15 and craig 13 then pat morton put in a plea 
that their families back in england be notified they are all right

identified by the london newspaper the daily telegraph as dale 
pilkington his wife michelle and their two children 
the familys relatives live at weymouth in southwest england 
pilkingtons brother wade pilkington told the paper i cant 
imagine he would have been happy being used as a pawn

realize that we are in an unknown destination we realize that our 
families know we are in an unknown destination but we would like 
them to know we are fit and well our parents are old my husband

a swiss bank agreed to provide records demanded by 
attorneys for manuel noriega to track money for his legal defense 
but a german bank declined a federal judge was told thursday 
noriegas attorneys who have estimated it could cost 5 million 
to defend the ousted panamanian dictator on drug trafficking 
charges are trying to track millions of dollars believed held in 
foreign banks 
the us government has agreed up to 6 million of noriegas 
money should be available to the defense but left it to his 
attorneys to track it down 
the union bank of zurich switzerland is complying with the 
records request said bank attorney john d lovi of the new york 
law firm of sullivan and cromwell and assistant us attorney myles 
malman 
the records of the account were turned over by the bank to the 
swiss government and under the terms of an international treaty 
that government turned them over to the us government lovi told 
us district judge william hoeveler 
malman told the judge that the justice department is expected to 
turn this material over to noriega attorney frank rubino and a 
subpoena has been withdrawn 
the prosecutor said deutsh sudamerkanische bank of hamburg 
germany has declined a request to turn over records on the account 
the account upon best information and belief is in the name 
of the banco nacional of panama which may have its own rights and 
interest in the account according to prosecution documents 
the united states has none and takes no position whether 
dsbhamburg should be compelled to comply with noriegas subpoena 
bank attorney barry hunter said the bank does not have a 
noriega account he said the account was opened in 1988 a year 
before the dispute between the current government and noriega 
he said by invoking a certain legal procedure noriegas 
attorneys could obtain the information in 30 to 60 days but they 
have said that would take too long 
rubino has said he wants to find out how much money is still in 
the account and where the money has gone 
bank lyonnaise of marseille france has also been asked to turn 
over records 
federal magistrate william turnoff said aug 2 that the banks 
must comply with subpoenas to supply records to the defense 
it was the first time that a federal court has backed a private 
litigants request to examine usually secret foreign bank records 
rubino said then 
ramon anzola who said he represented the panamanian government 
told the judge that even if defense attorneys find the money the 
funds should not be paid to noriega 
panama is filing a 53 billion racketeering suit against 
noriega aimed at collecting funds it says belong to the people of 
panama 
rubino has said noriegas money estimated at more than 20 
million is deposited in about six european countries the defense 
has claimed that noriega earned much of the money legally 
including as an informant for us intelligence agencies so it was 
unfair for the united states to freeze his access to all his 
accounts noriega has had no way of monitoring the accounts since 
his arrest 
noriega is being held in a jail outside miami awaiting trial on 
charges he took 46 million in bribes to protect the colombian 
cocaine trade

and injuring 12 others officials said 
the twinengine grumman g159 turboprop carrying employees of

south of the airports main terminal complex said airport 
supervisor frank haley the airplane had been headed for new 
orleans 
the fuselage was torn nearly in half and a fire scorched 
sections of the aircraft 
when we were taking off it was turning and turning and the 
next thing i knew the plane was on the ground said passenger 
patrick michael duran 33 of meridan miss who suffered a

the planes three crewmen said harris county assistant medical 
examiner jay evans the names of the dead were not immediately 
available 
everybody else is going to make it evans said 
it was unclear whether some of the injured escaped the wreckage 
on their own or whether all were rescued by firefighters 
evans said the aircraft appeared to be taking off in a 
northtosouth direction but it was unclear whether the aircraft 
had become airborne before it crashed 
jh lynn a houston police accident investigator said it 
appeared to him that the plane skidded from the runway crossed a 
grassy median and then a taxiway before crashing and burning 
companies from about four other fire departments were dispatched 
to the airport said airport firefighter mg mcclelland 
as night fell workers moved in portable lights while police and 
other emergency vehicles ringed the area 
pieces of propeller littered the taxiway and a small patch of 
grass near the aircraft was blackened remnants of firefighting 
foam were scattered about 
the plane was virtually broken in half the left wing was burned 
away and all that remained of the left engine was a skeletal shell 
the runway involved was closed briefly but airport operations 
were not otherwise affected said airport spokesman hoyt brown

most diplomats out of the us embassy in kuwait but left 
ambassador nathaniel howell and a skeleton staff behind in defiance

depends on the outcome of the standoff the state department called 
it shameful theatrics and british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd called the display the most sickening thing ive seen for a 
long time

in iraq and kuwait by iraqs aug 2 conquest of the new 
jerseysized emirate now saddam seeks to cut their lifeline in

a series of iraqi moves graphically demonstrated saddams 
willingness to use the trapped foreigners to try to pressure their 
governments to halt sanctions and send home the troops 
the most dramatic was a broadcast showing englishspeaking 
adults and children gathered in an office where saddam told them 
your presence here and other other places is meant to prevent the 
scourge of war

trapped foreigners as human shields for key iraqi installations

stayed open past the deadline would be surrounded by troops who

they consider themselves modernday 
disciples of jesus christ but they wear cloth of a different kind 
tshirts jeans tattoos and harleydavidson motorcycles are 
their priestly uniforms and spreading the word of god to outlaw 
bikers is their mission 
guy girratono robert kaps and the rev dale crofford have been 
bikers since their youth and each has had his share of trouble 
girratono served time for armed bank robbery and assault 
crofford served time for assault with intent to kill kaps rode 
aimlessly around oklahoma moving from one job to another 
it wasnt until they reached the lowest point in their lives 
that they found god they say through people who cared in 
turn they seek to bring jesus into the hearts of motorcycle gangs 
i just have a real heart for these people i lived that life 
in my younger years and i got saved said the bearded crofford 
dressed in a harleydavidson tshirt jeans and heavy work boots 
an outfit similar to what he wears when he preaches to his 
congregation at the wellington holy christian fellowship church in 
wellington mo 
i believe that you can be a christian and be you and this is 
what i am said crofford 48 when not preaching crofford works 
in a motorcycle shop in the kansas city area 
i just believe that these guys and girls out there need to 
know that god loves them exactly where theyre at he said we 
can be christians ride motorcycles love god and still dress this 
way 
for years crofford wore a suit and tie on the pulpit but felt 
awkward 
what does a preacher look like anyway i dont know he 
saidi believe that if saint peter would have lived in this day 
and age he would have been a biker thats the kind of man he was 
the three men spend many weekends attending bikers rallies 
across missouri they hold outdoor services each contributing his 
unique talent 
crofford knowledgeable about the bible preaches the gospel 
kaps a baritone sings the hymns girratono a diplomat of sorts 
preaches and uses his contacts with gang leaders to give the three 
a safe haven in the bikers camps 
girratono 51 said he has spent years cultivating the leaders 
of outlaw bike clubs in kansas city so the three can move freely 
within those circles 
i can move in their rallies in their groups in their 
festivities without a threat of reprisal of any kind girratono 
said they know me they respect me and i have their blessing so 
to speak 
some biker gangs treat their ministry with indifference others 
with curiosity 
ive had some who have come to me and cried crofford said 
ive had some who have come to me and said i want to change but 
i dont know how ive had some whove said im not going to go 
to a religious blanketyblank church 
the important thing is that were there to help if they have a 
need 
during many bikers rallies club members often indulge in drugs 
and alcohol girratono said we want to introduce them to a 
better way of life a life free from the bondage of alcohol or 
drugs and illicit sex 
once a biker shows an interest in their message the second part 
of their mission begins preparing bikers to withstand persecution 
and getting mainstream churches to accept them tattoos and all 
even if a person comes to christ from this biking community 
for that man to walk into a church next sunday morning and sit down 
and receive the word of god like anybody else off the street is not 
going to happen in most cases girratono said 
we hope to give them a good enough grounding so they are not 
hurt their emotions are very delicate 
the three also hope to convince mainline churches to receive 
these kinds of people rejection by the church is a familiar and 
painful feeling for kaps 
lonely and down on his luck at the age of 19 kaps walked into a 
tulsa okla church looking as he does today wearing a ragged 
tshirt jeans and work boots 
one of the church members told him to clean up and put on a tie 
he was taken by the elbow and escorted out of the church 
it was some time before he made his way back to a church 
when not attending bikers rallies the three often participate 
in community activities to benefit the less fortunate 
in march they joined more than 450 bikers on a 100mile charity 
ride to benefit the homeless the bikers donated more than 23000 
to the city union mission in kansas city a privately funded 
homeless shelter

gold fever killed annah chayera 
sand and boulders crushed her when a crude handdug mineshaft 
collapsed in a gold belt known since biblical times 
stuart simba was luckier he only got a police bullet in the

a decade of growing unemployment in this southern african 
country has spurred thousands like them to try their luck at the 
rivers that crisscross the region

mahoganylike munhondo tree the sand washes away and when luck 
smiles leaves pinhead flecks of pure gold or sometimes a nugget

coast never have been fully explained 
what is certain historian henrik ellert said is that the 
legends attracted portuguese explorers they were searching for 
gold in the 16th and 17th centuries and found it 
the portuguese records show it was panned by local villagers 
in the river beds in exactly the same way it is done now said 
ellert a danishborn zimbabwean who writes books on regional 
history 
natives exchanged the gold called goride in the local shona 
language for cloth and beads 
traders took it by foot and dugout canoe to a natural deepwater 
harbor known as sofala in what is now mozambique from there it 
was shipped to india and goa to be traded for spices 
zimbabwe ranks as the worlds 11th largest gold producer annual 
output of about 18 tons from legal mines earns 300 million for the 
treasury 
gold mined or panned illegally is estimated to be worth an 
additional 20 million a year putting zimbabwe alongside brazil 
and papua new guinea in that category 
so pure is the alluvial gold that it easily can be melted and 
fashioned into bracelets or other items for smuggling panned gold 
dust can be hidden in such places as the shafts of ballpoint pens 
matthew de klerk a prospector who owns a legal gold claim said 
the modern traffic works this way 
dealers buy illegal gold from miners in local currency sell it 
for hard currency on bullion markets in europe and india then sell 
the hard currency in africa for more than twice the original cost 
of the gold 
the zimbabwe chamber of mines estimates at least 50000 people 
are panning gold illegally most of them because they cannot find 
jobs 
officially the unemployment rate is 23 percent in this nation 
of 95 million representing an increase of 60 percent since 1985 
private economists put the figure much higher 
little panning was done in the 1970s because the war of 
independence made it too dangerous laws against illegal mining 
were enforced before that when zimbabwe was whiteruled rhodesia 
todays freelance prospectors ignore laws that restrict the 
purchase of gold to the state bank and forbid panning for 
environmental reasons 
panning has clogged rivers and dams with silt and caused 
devastating soil erosion even desertification along the 
oncefertile water courses the natural resources board reported 
tragically we dont have the men or enough fourwheeldrive 
vehicles to police our rivers said keith harvey a board 
official 
authorities confiscate thousands of dollars worth of gold from 
the few illegal prospectors arrested each year but individuals 
seldom are fined more than 1500 zimbabwean dollars 600 us 
according to the chamber of mines 
it is worth the risk said panner elias mutasa theres 
goride here plenty plus

a dispute over the rights to marilyn monroes image 
is keeping a french mint from distributing a gold medallion 
depicting her nude figure 
la monnaie de paris established in the time of the emperor 
charlemagne is a branch of the finance ministry it took the 
medallion off the market because of claims by roger richman a 
california licensing agent 
la monnaie de paris has made medallions for 400 years and first 
produced the marilyn medals in bronze in 1985 said patrice cahart 
director of the mint 
it was part of a series of medallions featuring about a dozen 
cinema stars struck to commemorate the cannes film festival he 
said in an interview it is something done quite frequently with 
figures from the arts theater etcetera 
in 1987 the mint produced the marilyn medal in gold because of 
an order from a japanese dealer cahart said 
the coins have her face and name on one side and on the other 
her nude figure in the reclining pose reproduced on countless 
posters and calendars in the 28 years since her suicide 
richman claimed he controlled the rights to the 
commercialization of her image and la monnaie de paris halted sales 
of the medallions in 1988 cahart said 
early in august richman told the associated press in los 
angeles we are now in the process of settlement negotiations 
he said no lawsuit had been filed but he would not rule out the 
possibility 
the estate of marilyn monroe has french trademarks covering 
this classification richman said 
the gold medallions are of 18karat gold less than an inch in 
diameter and weigh slightly more than a quarterounce 
cahart said most of the medallions produced had been sold but 
would not say how many there were or give the market value citing 
the negotiations with richman 
bronze medallions of marilyn sold for the equivalent of about 
32 cahart said although he would not divulge the price of the 
gold medallions they are said to cost hundreds of dollars each 
he said the mint took the medallions off the market voluntarily 
and there are continuing discussions with mr richman 
he says he owns the rights to marilyns image and that we must 
pay for its use cahart said weve asked him for proof of his 
claim and as of now we have not received any such proof the 
situation remains unclear 
if richman substantiates his claim the mint is prepared to 
reach a settlement the director said 
nude figures were common on medallions produced in the 1930s 
but not of celebrities cahart said 
theres nothing shocking about marilyn monroe nude he said 
its a very familiar pose not something we made up its just a 
question of sous someone feels we owe him money and wants us to 
pay

the wealth effect that immeasurable partly 
psychological component of the economy has taken an awful beating 
in the past few weeks people just dont feel as well off as before 
it isnt difficult to find the reasons why the stock market is 
down many home values have shrunk inflation has quickened the 
jobless rate is rising credit is tight recession talk abounds 
and war seems just a trigger away 
all these are factors in how people think of their financial 
condition and because almost all these factors have deteriorated 
it is safe to say that a large percentage of americans consider 
themselves less wealthy today 
the wealth effect isnt based so much on what assets people have 
in precise dollars and cents but how confident they are about 
those assets this confidence or lack of it has immediate 
repercussions in the marketplace 
most immediately affected are the biggest ticket items such as 
homes and cars but it doesnt take long for a decline to show up 
in investments travel entertainment and any unessential services 
and postponable purchases 
nobody really can measure the wealth effect with any degree of 
preciseness because it represents a selfimpression 
you cannot for instance add up a persons assets at a given 
time and say that persons wealth effect has been raised or lowered 
by the difference in the totals no its more than that its how 
people read those figures 
those readings are as changeable as attitudes 
if a person has a 20 percent oneyear gain in the market value 
of a house and the market is still rising then its quite likely 
that person will project his or her wealth as even higher 
if that person believes the market value of the house has fallen 
by 20 percent it is also likely the person might feel more than 20 
percent poorer in such instances perceptions are more important 
than reality 
just a slight decrease in the wealth effect can produce major 
changes in the marketplace even if the persons disposable income 
and savings remain as high as ever 
a person generally doesnt buy an automobile for instance by 
cashing in the equity in the house instead they use savings or 
credit the latter based on their estimate of ability to repay 
that estimate however can change with the persons impression of 
the value of the house 
aware of this and of rising fuel costs automakers almost 
immediately scaled back their sales estimates for the next few 
months and barring improvement the impact most likely will spread 
to others parts of the economy 
the latest combination of negative factors has been unusual it 
includes not just higher energy prices which people have faced 
before but the threat of war too it includes threats not just of 
inflation but recession as well 
surveys by consumer researchers housing industry organizations 
and business researchers show the latest decline in wealth 
perceptions include not just the obvious negatives but a varied 
assortment of lesser factors 
an idea of how business perceives such factors is provided by 
paul m low president of lomas mortgage usa 
commenting on weakness in homebuilding he cited among other 
reasons demographics taxation regulation financing and even 
some consumer psychology for good measure 
consumer psychology obviously depends on how much money people 
have in their wallets a fat wallet promotes a feeling of 
confidence when a person walks into an automobile showroom 
but maybe even more important than the dollars in that wallet is 
the perception of the wallet owner sometimes 100 makes a person 
feel rich and sometimes it seems barely enough to finance survival

wolves shadowy creatures 
of the woods who strike fear in some while unleashing the wildness 
in others have been captured by young imaginations in an art 
display at yellowstone national park 
each year the park solicits art from students in grades 512 in 
an effort to encourage appreciation of natural areas such as 
yellowstone the exhibits theme changes annually this year it is 
the wolf while next years theme will be celebrating our 
parks 
students interpret the theme any way they wish in poetry 
paintings drawings sculpture or essays the exhibits were on 
display this summer in yellowstones visitors center at mammoth 
hot springs 
through colors shapes and words they the students have 
shared the wolf of their imaginations reads the introduction to 
the exhibit traditionally the wolf has elicited from its human 
neighbors a mosaic of curiosity and kinship hate and fear 
human encroachment combined with misunderstanding has led to 
the eradication of wolf populations across much of their habitat 
including yellowstone national park perhaps the concern and 
understanding conveyed in their art works can help foster a new 
relationship with this animal and the other wild inhabitants whom 
we share the earth 
alexis ellwood of edina minn submitted a poem entitled ode 
to the wolf 
oh wolf your cry is sad 
they shot you and drove you north 
away from the beauty of your homeland 
the moose and the bighorn 
oh wolf your cry is joyous 
at last we may find you back in the beauty of your homeland 
the pronghorn and the deer 
back in the beauty of yellowstone 
its the old relationship in which the wolf is seen as a 
bloodthirsty predator with a taste for cattle and sheep that has 
largely held up a proposal to restore the animals to yellowstone 
driven from the park at the turn of the century by a massive 
federal and state extermination program theres been an ongoing 
debate in recent years over whether the wolf considered to be the 
missing link in yellowstones ecosystem should be allowed back 
in the park 
opponents say wolves will not stay within yellowstone but rather 
head into the surrounding countryside and prey on livestock 
many of the students seem sympathetic to the wolfs plight some 
of their works artistically return the predator to the park 
ellwood in a painting tied to her ode placed a wolf on a high 
plateau with head lifted up to the moon howling 
ross mellinger 13 of millwood wva pictured a harsher scene 
in his work unleashed snowfall in it a wolf is posed over a 
bloodied rabbit 
for 11yearold joshua wiersma of idaho falls idaho the 
japanese poetry form of haiku helped him convey his feelings about 
wolves 
the wolf how mighty 
his chest so great and strong 
he cries in yellowstone 
wendy despain 15 of mammoth hot springs conveyed the wolfs 
absence from yellowstone through a collage entitled whats 
missing from this picture 
in the collage despain created a wolf in white construction 
paper standing atop a black ridge the surrounding forest is 
varying shades of green blue and black paper while the sky is 
black and the moon white 
in her painting through his eyes 14yearold molly 
stratton of bozeman mont captured a hunter reflected in the eye 
of a wolf 
jj adamsen of franklin va took a look at the ongoing debate 
of whether wolves should be restored to yellowstone the 
18yearolds piece pictures a wolf standing by a downed tree in 
the snow with a rising moon over the mountains its entitled 
twilight in yellowstone past or future 
finally libbi alcorn of saratoga wyo touched on wolf the 
predator in her artwork fatal intentions in which a wolf is 
silhouetted in a yellow moon 
while the predators head is colored blue alcorn ran a red 
stripe up its nose and over its forehead and painted a red tongue 
surrounded by turquoise teeth

its a performers dream audiences who idolize 
them full houses high ticket prices potentially huge record 
sales 
and for many of the worlds hottest musicians japan is the best 
place to be whether its rock classical or jazz japan has become 
a must stop often the first stop for traveling bands 
madonna kicked off her 1990 world tour blond ambition with 
a sevenconcert tour of japan beginning april 13 then went back to 
the united states and on to europe 
the money in japan is certainly a factor said liz 
rosenberg a publicist for warner bros records tour sponsorship 
in japan is on a much bigger scale than in other parts of the 
world financially its very worthwhile 
although rosenberg refused to say how worthwhile fans paid 
about 45 million to attend madonnas first three concerts in 
tokyo alone there was no indication how much of that went to 
madonna and how much to local organizers 
the singers flashy show in tokyo consisted of little more than 
deafening music and a garishly lighted stage still about 35000 
young fans at an outdoor stadium screamed and cheered under driving 
rains through shows that lasted for twohours 
other pop performers who played for japanese audiences in the 
first half of 1990 include paul macartney the rolling stones 
michael jackson janet jackson tracy chapman bobby mcferrin and 
david bowie 
rock stars perform in huge stadiums packing in tens of 
thousands while classical music concerts are much smaller but 
while madonnas top ticket price was about 56 good seats for the 
chicago symphony in tokyo ran as high as 168 each 
for classical music lovers the chicago symphony st louis 
symphony cleveland orchestra and the london symphony with leonard 
bernstein conducting have all made recent tours of japan 
many of the orchestral worlds top batons are enthusiastic about 
the japanese music consumer 
st louis symphony conductor leonard slatkin finds japanese 
audiences quiet polite and appreciative 
european audiences often take the music for granted japanese 
never do said christoph von dohnanyi the conductor of the 
cleveland orchestra which toured japan for two weeks in may 
israeli conductor and pianist daniel barenboim who has been 
coming to japan to perform for 25 years agrees 
im always struck by the silence with which the japanese 
audiences listen to music it makes me feel the music is not just 
entertainment but that there is a deep respect almost awe for 
the music said barenboim musical directordesignate of the 
chicago symphony orchestra in an interview 
that is something i find inspiring no other audiences are 
like this no other audiences buy records like the japanese do 
either henry fogel executive director of the chicago symphony 
says that among the three largest record markets in the world 
europe the united states and japan the orchestras royalties 
payments are highest from japan 
fees paid to the orchestra by musical presenter kajimoto concert 
management co are about twice what the chicago symphony gets when 
it tours european capitals but costs are higher in japan too says 
fogel sponsorship from motorola inc and kajimotos fee just 
covered the 21 million cost of the orchestras threeweek japan 
tour last april well break even fogel says 
japan is also home to some wellknown festivals that attract the 
giants of jazz this summers mount fuji jazz festival featured 
wynton marsalis and dizzy gillespie another festival outside 
tokyo select live under the sky will feature pat metheny 
herbie hancock wayne shorter and jack dejohnette 
japanese jazz fans will pay 270 a ticket to see miles davis at 
a small tokyo club this month 
jazz has been popular in japan since it was first introduced by 
us occupation forces after world war ii american jazz labels 
such as blue note have said they were able to remain in business 
during slumps in jazzs popularity in the united states because of 
continuing support in japan 
japan is the second largest market after the united states and 
jazz music sales here total about 66 million a year

the remarkable resurgence of quality tv 
animation for children reaches a culmination of sorts this fall 
with the premiere of the disney afternoon a daily twohour 
block of shows 
disney rolls out the block of funnyanimal cartoons sept 10 in 
146 television markets covering 93 percent of the country and 
disney is not alone in its efforts to attract young viewers 
on sept 8 fox broadcasting cos fox childrens network rolls 
out six new saturday morning shows three hours of cartoons its 
animated foxs peter pan amp the pirates a daily halfhour 
premieres sept 17 
warner bros syndicated tiny toon adventures produced by 
steven spielbergs amblin entertainment debuts with an 
unprecedented cbs special sept 14 showcasing the allnew cast of 
teenage cartoon characters 
buster bunny babs bunny plucky duck and hamton j pig begin 
their 65episode syndication run the following monday sept 17 in 
some markets they will be teamed with a halfhour of repackaged 
merrie melodies 
credit for this cartoon renaissance goes to disney which 
simultaneously revived a dying industry and upped the stakes for tv 
cartoons in 1987 with ducktales the adventures of uncle 
scrooge and newphews huey dewey and louie 
until ducktales programmers wondered whether childrens 
cartoons could survive on tv at all the medium was artistically 
bankrupt a violent sexist marketplace for 22minute commercials 
wrapped around ads for candy toys and breakfast cereals 
the producers were willing to take heat from critics as long as 
they were moving the goods but once every girl owned my little 
pony and every boy a set of transformers the fads faded kids 
stopped watching and panic set in 
ducktales syndicated by disneys buena vista television 
immediately became the highestrated childrens tv show it was 
luxuriously animated with rich backgrounds depth and detail and 
it was storydriven not toydriven 
the difference in quality was obvious even in terms of cels 
the single sheets of celluloid in which animators draw the 
foreground action 
these were literally made for television said gary krisel 
head of disney television animation in an interview earlier this 
year 
our shows are averaging 22000 drawings full cels he said 
that compares with an average 10 years ago of 8000 to 10000 or 
12000 the best other shows today are around 15000 cels 
thats still not as many cels as a feature film projected onto 
a big screen ducktales action would look jerky and uneven on 
the little screen and compared with a 10000cel cartoon it 
looks like fantasia 
were running between 400000 and 650000 an episode 
krisel said 
ducktales stayed no 1 until 1989 when it was supplanted by 
disneys own chip n dales rescue rangers starring the 
aforesaid chipmunks which is the second component of the disney 
afternoon 
the third show is disneys adventures of the gummi bears 
which moves from saturday morning where it has been the no 1 show 
in its time period for five years 
the final halfhour and perhaps the most accessible to older 
children and certain tv writers is tale spin a delightful 
new funnyanimal adventure that brings back baloo the bear louie 
the ape and shere khan the tiger from disneys theatrical hit the 
jungle book 
big burly baloo operates the higher for hire air cargo service 
owned by cute bear rebecca she her daughter molly baloo and the 
orphaned cub kit cloudkicker face a wonderful band of funny 
villainous air pirates 
tale spin is disneys highest achievment yet in tv 
animation and uses computer animation to help artists move objects 
like planes through space and for the changing perspectives of 
intricate dogfights and stunt flying 
it is firstrate animation wellwritten equally appealing to 
boys and girls and fun to watch 
as good as it is and thats very good disneys twohour 
block of funny animal cartoons isnt balanced fare for younger 
viewers who deserve tv that aspires to address all their interests 
and needs just like grownups tv 
diversity is not the name of their game said peggy charren 
of action for childrens television a relentless lobbyist for 
expanding the scope of kids tv 
one thing you can say about animal shows is at least the 
characters arent all white unfortunately theres also not a lot 
of role models she said 
somebody has to tell the broadcasters that a steady diet of 
dayglo animals and squeaking ducks no matter how charming isnt 
enough

the sudden and unanticipated escalation of 
mideast tensions in the past two weeks has battered not only the 
securities markets but the pretensions of the markets shortterm 
forecasters 
such forecasters abound in the marketplace and most of them get 
very good money for selling their notions to the public their 
numbers include not just advisers at the extreme of plausibility 
but many brokers too 
whatever their method the claim is the same that week to week 
and even day to day the stock markets movements can be revealed 
in advance by means of charts graphs cycles patterns formulas 
and special insight 
while some practitioners have a degree of rationality to guide 
them and some might even have streaks of good luck almost all of 
them must concede that the biggest factors of all might lie beyond 
their province 
it is that many of the triggers producing rises and falls in 
markets have very little to do with their area of expertise they 
might know something about stocks even about popular behavior but 
nothing about saddam hussein 
nor do many have insight into the likelihood that earthquakes 
storms or droughts might occur or into the private thoughts of 
federal reserve chairmen into what congress is liable to do or 
who will declare war 
even over longer periods of time the record of forecasters is 
not very good hulbert financial digest for example monitored 21 
newsletters over a 10year period and found only two that beat a 
standard amp poors average 
within those longer periods some forecasters have streaks of 
outstanding performance but good performance is often followed by 
poor even peter lynch one of the greatest portfolio managers 
ever has conceded the point 
while longer time periods allow for mistakes to be corrected 
shorter time periods do not performance records disappear when the 
attempt is made day to day and there exist thousands of former 
believers who found out the hard way 
this doesnt mean that shortterm forecasting efforts will ever 
cease in part because a new crop of investors is constantly 
entering the market and it doesnt mean that existing forecasters 
will admit to failure 
the future is a freeforall anything can be said about it 
because nobody knows anything about it and if the forecast is 
properly worded the forecaster can blame events for not unfolding 
as logically as they should have 
nobody can say for certain how events will unfold in the 
mideast but whatever does will influence the stock market nothing 
beyond that is certain 
and important a factor as it is the mideast crisis is by no 
means the only influence on the latest decline in prices even 
before the invasion of kuwait there existed statistical evidence 
that the market was overpriced 
that much a forecaster could have ascertained but to have 
foretold exactly when a correction was to occur would have taken a 
feat of intellectual insight beyond human capacity and the 
understanding of science 
unless of course the forecaster was saddam hussein

labor unrest is growing in brazil and 
acquiring a tone of violence and sabotage that could threaten the 
governments ambitious antiinflation program 
if his members continue to lose buying power said union leader 
vicente paulo da silva the result might be a major social 
convulsion with unpredictable consequences 
in late july hundreds of auto workers went on a threeday 
rampage at the sao paulo subsidiary of ford motor co where a 
strike shut down production for more than a month they destroyed 
more than 50 cars smashed windows and doors and set fires in the 
plant administration buildings 
a strike by power workers this month caused a 10hour blackout 
in brasilia the capital and shut off electricity for two hours in 
the northeastern state of bahia in brasilia the lights went out 
in government ministries and the residence of president fernando 
collor de mello 
ozires silva infrastructure minister of the national 
government told reporters signs of sabotage were found at 
power stations and authorities might sue the power workers union 
for damages 
labor leaders say the violence is a sign of rebellion against 
the pay restrictions collors government contends are vital to its 
antiinflation plan 
the incidents at ford were merely a sign of the future 
violence that could erupt as a result of the workers despair da 
silva president of the sao bernardo do campo metalworkers union 
said in an interview their wages are not enough to feed clothe 
educate or house their children decently 
most foreignowned auto plants are in sao bernardo do campo an 
industrial suburb of sao paulo brazils financial center and 
largest city da silvas union which says it represents 140000 
workers is considered brazils most militant and politicized 
da silva said the government was trying to control inflation 
by provoking recession and unemployment and slashing our 
purchasing power 
more than 500 strikes have occurred since collor announced a 
radical austerity program march 16 one day after taking office 
aimed at reducing annual inflation of nearly 5000 percent 
his plan included an 18month freeze on savings and money market 
accounts elimination of subsidies and incentives the sale of 
government mansions and cars and mass layoffs of public employees 
inflation came down from nearly 100 percent a month to about 11 
percent in july but the economy headed toward recession and 
unemployment soared 
the brazilian institute of geography and statistics said nearly 
1 million employees of private companies had lost their jobs since 
march 16 and more than 100000 federal employees had been dismissed 
industrial output dropped 71 percent during the first six 
months of 1990 said the institute whose statistics the government 
considers official 
in may collors government ended automatic costofliving wage 
adjustments and said workers must negotiate pay raises with 
employers indexed pay increases had been a traditional brazilian 
hedge against inflation 
hundreds of thousands of workers have gone on strike in an 
effort to recover at least part of the purchasing power lost to 
inflation 
labor leaders want raises of more than 100 percent for their 
members to compensate for the wild inflation before mar 16 
these losses must be replaced in the workers paycheck da 
silva said then we could negotiate real wage hikes based on 
productivity 
the government must adopt a wage policy that guarantees wages 
will be adjusted to inflation 
collor said in a radio interview he would veto any congressional 
attempt to reinstate automatic wage adjustments because they would 
plunge brazil back into a hyperinflationary spiral 
workers interviewed by the associated press said raises obtained 
through negotiations had not closed the gap 
josemar de medeiros a 30yearold maintenance worker at ford 
got a 59 percent raise after the strike and earns the equivalent of 
915 a month that is excellent pay in brazil where the monthly 
minimum wage is about 62 
this salary makes me a member of the elite of brazils work

medeiros said 
millions of lowerpaid workers are in serious trouble he said 
and told a reporter our purchasing power is declining day by day 
and we are angry if this situation continues the wave of strikes 
will certainly grow 
some economists are puzzled by the widespread labor trouble 
during a recession they say workers usually are more concerned 
with keeping their jobs than getting more pay 
da silvas response workers are fed up with footing the bill 
for economic stabilization programs the mass dismissals and the 
loss in purchasing power prove the collor government lied when it 
said its austerity program would not sacrifice the working class 
today the worker feels he has nothing to lose except his fear 
of getting fired and hes losing that rapidly

born of an odd mixture of 1970s funk punk 
rock rap california surf skateboard and hippie cultures a wild 
musical genre called thrash funk has swept the san francisco 
club scene 
the area that gave rise to acid rock in the 1960s is now the 
nations hotbed of the colorful youthdriven punkfunk and 
the record industry is ready to cash in 
if any of these bands break through you are going to have the 
entire industry swooping down on san francisco to scoop up what 
they can find said john axelrod director of artist and 
repertoire for rca records in los angeles 
inspired largely by george clintons parliamentfunkadelic era 
bands such as psychefunkapus limbomaniacs primus the smoking 
section and fungo mungo make up a diverse musical scene linked by 
seething energy a thumping bass sometimes bawdy lyrics and a 
sense of humor 
its about intensity which is always a good rock n roll 
standard said butthouse lead singer and bassist for 
limbomaniacs 
band members dismiss the label thrashfunk as confining 
confusing and misleading and cite an array of influences led by 
clinton and augmented by james brown prince jimi hendrix frank 
zappa and led zeppelin 
to me each of these bands is completely different than the 
others said psychefunkapus bassist atom ellis primus is 
really hardedged fungo mungo is more like james brown meets the 
red hot chile peppers limbomaniacs are more of a gogo kind of 
thing smoking section is a really smooth groove band its hard to 
say what we are 
despite the diversity the socalled punk funksters seem to 
admire one anothers music and theres a street style of long 
hair tattoos and muscular physiques shared by some of the band 
members and many of their fans 
axelrod signed psychefunkapus in late 1989 when he worked at 
atlantic records and plans to soon sign the smoking section to 
rca he says the bands present a wholly american sound that 
embodies san franciscos liberal past 
these are pseudohippies he said its another evolution 
of what the psychedelic movement was about in the first place 
free love and peace addressing the issues but remembering we are 
here to have a good time 
the scene appears to have evolved almost by mistake coming on 
the heels of the late 1980s success of los angeles groups the red 
hot chile peppers and fishbone both are widely seen as progenitors 
of the funkinfluenced thrash genre although san francisco 
musicians distance themselves from such bands 
it seems like every one of these aggregate groups started on 
their own with little influence from the others said david 
hawkins drummer of the smoking section we came in a little 
later but wed never seen them or heard them until we got billed 
with them 
primus and the limbomaniacs came first standing today as the 
bands with the strongest instrumental skills and the most funny and 
raunchy lyrics both have recorded albums on independent labels 
sixyearold primus led by comical bassistsinger les claypool 
is the thrashiest of the thrashfunk bands 
after some personnel changes the band released a selfpressed 
live album called suck on this four years of talks with geffen 
records failed to produce results and the band produced its first 
studio album frizzle fry on the new yorkbased caroline label 
psychefunkapus was the first san francisco punk funk band to 
sign with a big label their atlantic debut is in the top 10 on the 
college charts with more than 28000 albums sold including about 
8000 in dallas the marin countybased band represents the 
psychedelic wing of the genre a funk sound mixed with rap reggae 
and acid rock 
the limbomaniacs go heavy on washingtonrooted gogo street 
music rap and funk the bands debut album is due out soon on 
relativity records with bootsy collins of clintons 
parliamentfunkadelic singing on the opening track butt 
funkin 
the thrashfunk audience is a heavily white male crowd the 
beat lures listeners to the dance floor braver souls head to the 
core of the throbbing slamdancing mob where people are pushed 
and shoved almost against the grain of the music and some dive or 
are thrown at the stage 
this is music that has found its root in live performance 
said creighton burke manager of psychefunkapus a lot of the old 
1970s rock created record sales out of the live performance the 
new york dolls the grateful dead hendrix those bands created 
album sales through live performance 
fungo mungo started three years ago as a punkfusion band 
later integrating a funkstyle bass 
we all loved heavy rock bands from the 1970s black sabbath 
acdc i love disco said bassist arion salazar 19 of fungo 
mungo now i love kc and sunshine band i used to hate them it 
was so cheesy youre eight years old and you see a bunch of guys 
with big bell bottoms jumping around in hindsight that was 
what was cool its kind of neat now

true to the name of the band the lanky 
lead singer of the funkinspired smoking section wanders on stage 
with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth a gray cloud of smoke 
wafting out over the audience 
the smoking section is the place in the back of the room 
singer tony hawkins said before a recent packed show at slims 
nightclub its darkly lit and you have characters acting up 
its kind of a badboy symbol 
hawkins takes another stab at finding meaning behind the name 
really the rhythm section is smoking 
made up of young but solid musicians the smoking section has 
surfaced in just 18 months as a top local club draw now national 
attention promised by a major recording contract looms ahead 
the fivemember band boasting superb guitar and bass work rode 
in on the thrashfunk wave of the late 1980s though the tag 
doesnt quite fit with a more groovebased sound and a twoman 
horn section the style is more funk than thrash a factor that 
might help the smoking section attract a wider audience than some 
of the more jarring bands of the genre 
absent is the harshness long hair and skateboarder look that 
mark other punk funksters 
hopefully we have as wide or wider appeal than the others 
because well appeal to older crowds by giving the music more 
melody not just inyourface thrash said drummer david hawkins 
no relation to the singer 
david hawkins and guitarist damon wood both of berkeley first 
ran into each other in a local cafe several years ago they found 
they shared a love of funk mostly george clinton prince and james 
brown 
the core of the band began playing in 1988 and hired the lead 
singer eight months later after exhaustive auditioning 
the founders toyed with the idea of calling themselves three 
white boys with glasses but eventually opted for the smoother 
name the rest of the band now consists of bassist bob sax 
player adam beach and trumpeter scott jenson 
the bands short history is a namedroppers dream 
big breaks came from two 1970s pop stars clinton himself and 
boz scaggs 
beckoned by concert promoter bill graham the smoking section 
opened for two of clintons shows at the warfield auditorium last 
year then the band caught scaggs ear while opening for an act at 
slims a club owned by scaggs who eventually produced the groups 
demo tape for rca records 
hes only done this for two other bands the cars and huey 
lewis david hawkins said he made a lot of phone calls for us 
we just went whoa just his name he has a very good reputation 
and a good ear 
now the band is hammering out an album deal with rca and hopes 
to start recording this fall 
tony hawkins lends visual drama to the bands shows often 
starting sets wearing floppy cat in the hattype hats and 
puffing a camel he jumps dances and jives leading the audience 
into a frenzy 
numbers range from the serious waters edge which examines 
the meaning of life to big fish which asks listeners to 
watch out for big fish theyre not as harmless as you think 
the 24yearold singer brings his peculiar stage persona to an 
interview repeating the phrases goodness gracious and that 
is dead in your mind when he doesnt want something in print he 
describes his first live performance as velvety crunchy and 
eyeopening 
hawkins spent much of his childhood in oakland where he sang 
with the choir of the love center church a ministry run by his 
stepfathers family his uncle is edwin hawkins of the edwin 
hawkins singers a gospel group whose single oh happy day was a 
hit in 1969 
as a youth tony hawkins favored sly and the family stone chaka 
khan and marvin gaye over the white rock his peers tried to push on 
him he said he thinks of himself as an actor as well as a singer 
i was really shy when i was young and when i broke out i 
broke out hard he said im just a fool and i press things 
far and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt 
one time it didnt was at the end of a recent set at the 
haightashbury neighborhood club nightbreak when the performer 
aimed a fire extinguisher at the audience the cheap freudian 
climax to an otherwise rousing show angered the audience the 
management and when the 150 bill arrived from the club the 
rest of the band 
there was no encore it got quiet hawkins recalled you 
heard nothing but rustling and mumbling it was a killer ending to 
a killer show

it takes years and years of familiarity plus 
the addition of a boxoffice smash actor to bring a comic book 
character to the screen just ask joker jack nicholson or his 
fedorawearing friend warren beatty 
dont ask charles stein hes betting 1 million it only takes 
slick packaging massive promotion and a character with a body that 
wont quit 
stein is readying the night cat a prefab crimebuster with a 
comic book a movie and an album all in the works he sees her as 
janet jackson meets wonder woman for 750 a ticket 1399 per 
compact disc 
shes to be aloof and a lady in every respect untouchable and 
desirable stein says of his instant idol on stage she is 
supposed to be a sex object such as paula abdul or madonna 
she can have a boyfriend if it is not flaunted she is 
supposed to be the ideal of all the young people in every 
moralistic way and yet on stage totally the opposite 
for this role stein recruited an actressmodel whose previous 
screen credit was a shoe commercial 
got that 
sure its not the way guys like dick tracy or batman made it 
big but stein says its the way to go these days and marvel 
comics ceo stan lee agrees with him 
im pretty excited about it said lee im hoping that 
itll be big we have a personality who seems to be incredibly 
talented and one we hope will lead to a series 
of course it could all turn to kitty litter for 20yearold 
model jacqueline sahhara tavarez the 20yearold who was tabbed to 
portray the night cat imaginatively the heros alterego is named 
jacqueline tavar 
when the night cat comic book story begins shes a 19yearold 
criminology student whose father carlos is a police officer 
her mother had been a singer enticed fatally to drugs and 
alcohol who loved her cat midnight jacqueline signs to a record 
company as the night cat dresses accordingly and doesnt reveal 
her identity 
time for a plot twist 
carlos is assigned to a recording studio where a drug deal is to 
go down jacqueline midnight and a sadistic scientist who makes 
designer drugs all happen to be there at the same time 
something goes wrong time for another plot twist 
jacqueline suddenly grows claws leaps 6 feet into the air with 
the ferocity of a jungle cat and escapes the bullet that fells her 
father at his funeral she vows to avenge his death shell 
continue her recording career and use her new powers to fight evil 
end of story start of multimedia blitz 
lee who is also chairman of the advisory board of black cat 
entertainment started in comics about 1940 though he has been 
away from the nuts and bolts of marvel for 10 years he was 
intrigued enough by the night cat to write the first script 
marvel is conservative though only one comic book is planned 
and lee isnt sure what its print order will be if we sell 60 or 
70 percent of what we print its good 
sometimes one comic book can give you tremendous 
indication lee says we did spiderman a few years ago and we 
could tell by the sales and reception we had a winner there the 
minute you realize that you go to press with a lot more issues we 
like to think we have a sense of what will work and what wont 
were hoping this will happen 
marvel comics will own the night cats name jacqueline tavar 
people have said to me many times i look like a cat said 
tavarez ive got my moms green eyes thick lips and thick 
eyebrows 
her father is from spain her maternal grandfather is spanish 
and her grandmother named sahhara is a sephardic jew born in 
egypt for a time sahhara was considered as the night cats name 
i like to sing tavarez said i used to go to the chapel 
of the synagogue and sing when i was little i take singing lessons 
and acting lessons dancing comes more natural to me 
as the night cat shell do concerts dancers will be dressed 
in villain outfits im singing the song maybe ill stop and be 
fighting them it is going to be really fun 
the night cat was the idea of don kessler who has a long island 
public relations firm and has worked for stein in the past 
after the deal with marvel comics was made shares were offered 
in black cat entertainment corp tavarez owns 10 percent of black 
cat kessler says 
she gets a salary and 25 percent of what she brings in they 
expect to do in excess of 100 million in merchandising things 
like tshirts with her picture in costume the first year 
kessler said 
but hype alone cant make the night cat purr with success no 
matter how much his company spends stein says she has to come up 
to scratch 
it is up to her own performance to determine the level that 
she goes he said were gambling on her the record company is 
also spending a great deal of money 
the record company is lmr sam lefrak millionaire builder and 
herb moelis longtime recording mogul created lmr which stands 
for lefrak moelis records 
realistically in a project like this well spend between 
half a million and a million dollars moelis said twentyfive 
percent will go into recording the rest is manufacturing 
marketing advertising the video that has to be done youre 
dealing with a major project 
moelis says songs are being written for tavarez theyll be 
dancepop songs the paula abdul janet jackson kind of songs that 
go with the image of the night cat sensuality drive and 
excitement

the government says the love affair with 
china needs better chaperoning to prevent the communists from 
taking advantage and plans to restrict investments on the mainland 
that could harm taiwans economy 
the chinese communists are conducting trade as part of a 
political struggle against us said ma yingjeou of the governing 
nationalist party who heads the mainland affairs committee 
if we unilaterally proceed with free trade as a way to achieve 
chinas reunification it could lead to very serious consequences 
we need to establish a new order that will look after our security 
and our interests 
taiwan businessmen now trade with china and invest there through 
third countries free of taiwanese government restrictions 
when the nationalists relaxed a ban on contacts with the 
communists three years ago there were hopes that trade tourism 
and other exchanges would help remove obstacles to eventual 
reunification 
more than 1 million taiwanese or 5 percent of the islands 
population have visited china since then and businessmen have 
flocked to the mainland to negotiate lucrative contracts 
projects financed from taiwan are estimated to be worth 1 
billion and twoway trade totaled 35 billion last year up from 
27 billion in 1988 despite a slowdown in chinas economy trade 
is expected to remain at about 35 billion this year 
differences between the rival governments appear to have 
narrowed significantly but the improvement has been mainly at 
taiwans expense and important political issues remain analysts 
and scholars say 
china appears interested only in trade and investment to improve 
its economy they say and this could be costly to taiwan if it 
becomes too dependent on mainland business 
china is too big an economist who advises the government 
said on condition of anonymity they can easily put political 
pressure on us as contacts build up 
vice premier shih chiyang said taiwan had no plans to curtail 
exchanges but would bar taiwanese investment in sensitive 
hightechnology and defenserelated projects we must deal with 
the mainland with more reason more coolness and more dignity he 
said 
also he said the government is trying to improve investment 
conditions in taiwan to discourage businesses from moving to china 
where labor costs are lower 
the effort has included a crackdown on violent crime 
businessmen have been targets of extortionists and kidnappers and 
attempts to curb soaring land prices 
officials are offering building sites at a bargain prices to 
taiwans largest conglomerate the formosa plastics group if it 
will abandon plans to spend 7 billion on factories in china 
experts say stricter government control on mainland investment 
could give the nationalists leverage against beijings campaign to 
push taiwan off the international stage 
with our economic strength we are entitled to international 
status said presidential spokesman chiu cheyne we should not 
allow any power to drive us to a corner as they wish 
taiwan is recognized by 27 nations most of them in the third 
world and china by 137 
under a plan promoted by president lee tenghui the 
nationalists have asked other countries since last year to 
recognize china as a single nation with two governments one in 
taipei and the other in beijing 
the nationalists still claim to be the sole legitimate 
government of china and have shown no inclination toward 
reunification on beijings terms 
grenada liberia belize lesotho and guineabissau recognized 
taiwan under the twogovernment formula in response china 
suspended relations with those countries 
in july the nationalists were stunned when saudi arabia 
recognized beijing ending 44 years of relations with taiwan there 
is concern that singapore south korea and south africa may do the 
same 
foreign minister fredrick chien blamed the saudi switch on 
taiwanese businessmen and politicians who visited china without 
government approval he said that had given the wrong signal about 
taiwans approach to reunification

sara gilbert of roseanne gets serious for 
the lifetime movie sudie and simpson in which she plays a 
white teenager who befriends a black man in a racist southern town 
of the 1940s 
its about friendship but its also a coming of age thing for 
sudie said miss gilbert shes growing up and learning about 
life when people in the town find out about their friendship it 
creates a problem its a town where black people have never been 
allowed in 
louis gossett jr stars as simpson a black man who lives as a 
recluse in the woods near the town when he becomes a suspect in an 
attack on a young girl sudie is the only one willing to speak out 
against a white teacher who has been molesting school girls 
sudies friendship with simpson not only changes both their 
lives it also begins to alter the towns racist views 
premiering tuesday on the lifetime cable channel the movie is 
based on the novel sudie by sara flanigan who wrote the 
screenplay with ken koser joan tewkesbury directed the film which 
was shot on location in conyers covington and oxford ga south 
of atlanta 
also appearing in the movie are frances fisher as a yankee 
schoolteacher who befriends sudie and simpson paige danahy as 
sudies best friend john jackson as a physician wallace wilkinson 
as a hellandbrimstone preacher larry black as the school 
principal and howard kingkade as the teacher who is molesting the 
girls 
miss gilbert talked about sudie and simpson in a stuffy 
dressing room across from the roseanne stage where she was 
back in her role as darlene in the abc comedy series 
although the actress is a mature 15 she plays both darlene and 
sudie as younger teens 
it is partially because of her age that sudie and simpson dont 
hit it off immediately in the lifetime movie she had never been 
close to a black man before and is terrified at first then 
curious simpson fears she will tell everyone that he is living 
secretly in the woods 
she thought he was going to eat her alive miss gilbert 
said shed heard so many stories and black people were kept out 
of the town 
eventually they form a bond and simpson becomes a surrogate 
father for sudie whose own father had rejected her love 
this is the first movie where ive had a good role said 
miss gilbert i do more here than in anything ive done 
miss gilbert grew up in a show business family her sister 
melissa gilbert starred in little house on the prairie and 
has appeared in a number of other projects her brother jonathan 
also appeared in little house 
grandfather harry crane created and wrote the honeymooners 
and still works on several television shows and her mother 
barbara gilbert is a talent manager and producer 
i saw my sister doing it and that was a big influence on me 
said miss gilbert i wasnt even born when melissa started 
little house the first thing i ever did was a pilot of the 
apple dumpling gang i was 6 i did a commercial and weekend 
special called runaway ralph ralph was a mouse 
i was jane alexanders daughter in calamity jane she 
said then i didnt want to work and stopped for several years 
next came her role on roseanne 
darlene is a tomboy but shes starting to grow out of it 
miss gilbert said of her character 
i think darlene connects with her mother in a way she may not 
want to admit she has that same sarcastic kind of humor yet she 
spends most of her time with her father shes into sports and the 
things hes interested in my sister spends more time with 
roseanne my sister and i are always fighting and arguing and 
stuff 
she said she hopes that like her reallife sister she can make 
the oftendifficult transition into adult acting 
i want to direct too she said i spent a lot of time in 
the booth last year watching the director on sudie and simpson 
id run up to the camera and look through the viewfinder before 
each shot i think id like to switch back and forth between 
acting and directing

military action in the middle east bumped gasoline prices 
sharply higher across the country this month reminding many 
drivers of the price shocks and gas lines of the 1970s 
the longterm effects on energy prices and availability are as 
uncertain as the next move in the mideast drama one factor can 
americans still conserve fuel and electricity the way they learned 
to in leaner times will they 
the associated press checked with seven energy and 
transportation specialists for that perspective on the gulf crisis 
here are their responses

in my view this is going to be a long drawnout affair oil 
prices have reached a new permanent plateau somewhere in the 
mid20s dollars per barrel and thats going to have a damaging 
effect on the us economy 
were likely to see inflation and recession at the same time 
prices are going to go up profits are going to get squeezed and 
the recession that was coming on anyway is going to be accelerated 
there are a number of things that the government can do to 
respond obviously the first and most important is to encourage 
greater energy conservation during the years of low oil prices and 
abundant supplies we have forgotten about conservation and its 
time to refocus our efforts on becoming more energy efficient 
compared to the japanese and the germans we squander energy 
now the time has come for real presidential leadership in this area

how many people do you know who have gone to a gas station and 
bought less because prices have gone up 15 cents i dont know 
anyone who has and i dont think at this stage motorists are 
thinking along those lines 
prices have to remain not only at these levels but go sharply 
higher to change driving habits in this country if prices were to 
increase by say another 25 cents then i think motorists would 
possibly consider using public transportation and take other 
measures 
and i dont think thats going to happen if it does i dont 
think its going to remain at that level i think the saudis want 
to prevent a third price shock weve been through two already 
1973 and 79 and much of the opec producers but particularly 
the saudis recognize the danger in delivering such sharp increases 
to the consumer 
theyre worried about consumption decreasing because if prices 
go up sharply the consumer is going to be interested again in 
conservation buying smaller cars and all of that 
ultimately that would mean lower sales by the opec nations 
particularly those that have excess capacity and want to use more 
of that capacity

were going to work from a different level as to the cost of 
energy than we have in the past if its war youre going to be 
looking at a 30plus price for crude oil and if it isnt war 
youre looking at 25plus 
as the price goes up for gasoline the consumption goes down 
and as the price of energy goes up the economics will bring on 
alternative forms of energy 
the first thing that comes to mind is that theres a lot of 
natural gas available to us and there should be fuelswitching to 
natural gas right now from fuel oil 
its a lot better to buy domestic natural gas than it is to buy 
foreign crude oil one it helps the trade deficit but two 
natural gas sells at a discount to crude oil that means its 
cheaper for the consumer

weve been in a recession for a year in housing and cars i wish 
because of this gulf situation wed get to work on the budget 
deficit we need it now more than ever and certainly we need an 
energy policy 
i always felt that if we taxed gasoline at 25 cents a gallon 
it wouldnt hurt our business at all fifty cents people may buy 
more fours cylinder engines but a nickel or a dime wont hurt 
but if it goes to 25 to 50 cents 
i dont think people are going to stop buying cars because of 
high fuel prices i think they are going to worry about their jobs 
and the uncertainty that a recession that this iraq situation may 
bring on us thats the big problem

while the president used the words energy conservation as 
us troops were on their way to the persian gulf in a year and a 
half in office he has failed to propose any significant policies to 
reduce dependence on imported oil indeed the steady rise in us 
oil imports during the reagan administration has continued during 
the bush presidency 
means are available to reverse this trend we can make our cars 
buildings and industries far more fuelefficient than they are 
today and we can gradually develop clean renewable fuels to run 
our vehicles the ques in encouraging more oil production in 
delivering less costly natural gas and development of synthetic 
fuels will be governed by price considerations so will 
conservation which will be ultimately regulated by energy 
regulation and cost realistically nuclear energy must be 
reexamined as a significant expanded domestic energy source with 
the safeguards we proposed in the 70s

michael hirsh was assigned to the tokyo bureau 
of the associated press a few months ago here are some of his 
impressions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
westerners living in tokyo are not adequately 
described by the word minority 
singularity might be closer 
despite tokyos cosmopolitan reputation and the governments 
endless talk of kokusaika or internationalization diversity in 
the capital city runs mostly to products not people 
no need to take a survey just ride the subway or train at rush 
hour 
walk through the ginza tokyos famed shopping street on a 
sunday afternoon during tourist season 
there in gleaming storefronts are gucci guy laroche and 
benetton dunkin donuts shakeys pizza dairy queen and the 
omnipresent colonel the occasional westerner often looks confused 
in the relentless tide of japanese 
kokusaika is just a media buzzword most ordinary japanese are 
still wondering what were doing here said anthropologist 
theodore bestor author of neighborhood tokyo 
while to your eyes there may be few westerners to their eyes 
it doesnt seem that way because its gone from nearly zero to tens 
of thousands in several years 
the scarcity of ones kind is rarely mentioned in conversation 
after all eisaku sato then prime minister declared in the 1970s 
that japan was a member of the west and tokyos governor likes to 
call this a world city 
it doesnt seem that way when wideeyed toddlers clasping a 
parents leg point to you and exclaim foreigner foreigner 
the number of north americans and europeans living in tokyo rose 
from 17550 in 1979 to 27630 last year about twohundredths of 1 
percent of its 12 million people according to the justice ministry

new a landmark is where you put down stakes for the bulldozer 
prewar apartment buildings prized in new york are derided 
as hasbeens they certainly are rare having fallen victim 
successively in this century to earthquake war and tokyos 
everlasting construction boom 
real estate agents divide what in america are known as apartment 
buildings into highquality manshons the new and apaatos 
the old they dismiss the latter with the disparaging made of 
wood 
the tokyo skyline drones on a vast tangle of 12story slabs of 
concrete and brick elevated highways and railroad tracks that 
stretches to the horizon the excitement is in occasionally 
finding nestled within the graceful tiled eaves of a buddhist 
temple or shinto shrine 
tokyo burned in the great earthquake of 1923 and burned again in 
1945 
it is not a place that people feel has a whole lot of past 
whatevers here is often what was thrown up hastily after the 
other buildings burned down said patricia steinhoff a 
university of hawaii sociologist 
construction is everywhere under the crush of 30 million people 
in the city and suburbs tokyo is building homes over freeways on 
manmade islands and next to cemeteries that soon will feature 
gravestones squeezed together into walls to save space 
its crowded a reporter searching for an apartment walked into 
a bedroom and came facetoface with a truck

nothing like a few weeks of walking around tokyo to clear up 
some of the mystery surrounding the usjapan trade imbalance 
it seems puzzling at first that there is a problem department 
store shelves are filled with americanmade products whose japanese 
counterparts are rarely if ever seen in the united states 
food and hygiene products are big for example gillette 
revlon kraft heinz even tabasco sauce are found everywhere from 
the corner momandpop to the huge tokyu department store chain 
those products dont cost much however and you dont see many 
usmade items that do no fords or chevys for instance 
japanese companies export bigticket hightech products to the 
united states american companies that succeed here except for ibm 
and a few others provide lowerpriced goods 
to some extent therefore the trade imbalance becomes a matter 
of simple arithmetic 
the products most important for americas industrial future 
such competitive hightechnology products as semiconductors 
supercomputers satellites and telecommunications equipment in 
contrast to such consumer products as razor blades and laundry 
detergent have the most difficulty penetrating the japanese 
market glen fukushima former us trade representative for 
japan and china said in a magazine interview

if the japanese sometimes seem unfriendly on subways it may be 
because theyre sleeping 
tokyo seems a city exhausted whether at morning rushhour or 
midday subway snoozers easily outnumber those in new york where 
people usually ride with all senses on full alert 
young and old men and women can be seen catnapping while seated 
straightbacked on the velveteen cushions or even swaying on straps 
the low crime rate may have something to do with it 
new york subways are too dangerous said a rider who 
identified himself as yasu people here are more relaxed

rinchinsanbuu and his family stood 
proudly beside their white herders tent sheep grazing nearby he 
could envision no better life 
i take care of 100 cows and 300 sheep said rinchinsanbuu 
51 i have 15 children i have spent my life in the countryside 
i want to stay as a herdsman 
herdsmen and with them mongolias cultural legacies face an 
uncertain future 
mongolia once was a nation of nomadic herders but fewer than 40 
percent of its 2 million people now herd their horses sheep 
cattle and camels across the vast central asian steppe 
those who remain herders like rinchinsanbuu are constricted by 
the borders of state farms and agricultural cooperatives which 
have owned most of mongolias livestock since the communists took 
over in 1921 
new democratic parties that recently won a voice in government 
want to give the animals back to the herdsmen and allow freer 
grazing that plus the concern of the new parties for reviving 
traditional culture would reinforce the old ways 
both the new groups and the communist party however also want 
to increase mongolias links to the outside world attract foreign 
investors and tourists and introduce modern technology 
in addition to restricting the herdsmen communism also 
cushioned them from modernity by stunting overall economic growth 
it is impossible to predict how the herding lifestyle will survive 
a return to capitalism and the expected invasion of japanese 
tourists and hong kong television 
the culture of mongolian cities already is largely imported 
most young people wear western clothes and horses have given 
way to motorbikes cars and buses television ballet video 
parlors and rock concerts provide entertainment for urban office 
workers 
for rinchinsanbuu and his family life still follows a 
traditional outline 
i get up at 5 am and sleep at midnight he said i could 
even say i work 25 hours a day 
he looks after 100 cattle and 300 sheep for the tuya 
agricultural cooperative and has 50 sheep cattle and horses of his 
own 
at least three times a year he and his family dismantle their 
three round tents called gers pile their possessions on a 
horsedrawn cart and move to new pasture 
they cook their meals on woodburning stoves whose pipes project 
from the tops of the gers sending thin streams of smoke into the 
wide blue sky 
every now and then they slaughter a sheep for food but most of 
the time they eat boiled mares milk or strongtasting cheese and 
bread with fresh butter or dried curds 
entertainment generally means listening to the radio but there 
are several festivals each year that feature mongolian wrestling 
horse racing archery and singing 
herders preserve traditional courtesies when unexpected 
visitors stopped at his summer camp on a hillside 35 miles east of 
ulan bator the capital rinchinsanbuu donned his best del an 
outer garment closed with a wide colorful sash at the waist 
while his wife served milk tea he solemnly handed a snuff 
bottle around 
rinchinsanbuu and his good friend dashnyam laughed when asked if 
it would not be easier to live in a city and work in a factory 
of course city life is quite good because these city 
residents can have anything they want in a department store 
dashnyam said but i think we are rich we have more fresh air 
more meat country life is healthy 
by another measure the herders are poor according to the 
government the average herder working for a cooperative earns 
about 3340 tugriks a year less than 600 even at the artificially 
high official exchange rate 
sanitation is abysmal flies are abundant and outhouses are 
crude 
rinchinsanbuu is relatively wealthy he and his grown sons own a 
generator which are few and expensive and three televisions 
which are rare outside cities 
ichinkhorloo a yak herder camped across the stream said he 
wanted electricity because it is very difficult to live without 
light and there is a shortage of candles ichinkhorloo said he 
also wanted more pay maybe 300 to 400 tugriks a month 
ochir an 80yearold camped several miles away said he wanted 
a bigger pension he gets 60 tugriks a month about 10 and must 
continue raising sheep because it is too little to live on 
like many of the older herders ochir hesitated to blame the 
communist party for the poor economic conditions 
i have supported this party from my childhood he said i 
dont know about these new parties we dont know who they 
are 
in places where the new parties campaigned extensively the july 
29 election showed herders can be open to change 
a good example was the gachuurt state farm just outside ulan 
bator where a communist ran for the national legislature 
unopposed voters rejected him and a new election is being 
scheduled

col william hollands national guard brigade 
just ended three weeks of war games in the mojave desert enduring 
the same combat tests and 120degree heat other troops face half a 
world away in saudi arabia 
they trained on topoftheline equipment to the same standards 
as elite forces unlike guardsmen of the past they did not work 
with handmedown weapons or bide their time watching training 
films in stuffy classrooms 
to skeptics who deride the guard as secondrate weekend 
warriors holland says his troops are ready if needed in the 
persian gulf 
i feel very confident we can give a very strong account of 
ourselves said holland 51 a plant manager of a carpet company 
who doubles as commander of the 48th mechanized brigade of the 
georgia army national guard 
were redblooded americans its our patriotic duty 
holland said 
president bush this week called upon these parttime soldiers to 
discharge their duty mobilizing the reserves to bolster the 
defense of saudi arabia 
as many as 40000 reservists from the army and air national 
guard army reserve navy reserve marine reserve and air force 
reserve could be in uniform by the end of the month 
this is the first real test of the total force policy 
adopted when the draft ended in 1973 to make reservists fulltime 
partners in military planning not since bunker hill has america 
depended so heavily on its citizen soldiers 
its also an opportunity for reservists to apply spit and polish 
to a tarnished legacy from the vietnam era when they often were 
dismissed as draftdodgers 
most military experts agree that reservists are better trained 
better equipped and better motivated than were their counterparts a 
generation ago but the unanswered question is are they up to the 
job 
the reserve forces policy board which rates the readiness of 
citizensoldiers for the pentagon says they are 
in a 1987 report the board said the guard and reserve are the 
best they have ever been and when provided with adequate 
resources are capable of accomplishing their wartime missions 
according to pentagon ratings 76 percent of the national guard 
and 56 percent of the army reserve units were able to undertake 
major portions of their wartime mission in 1987 thats an 18 
percent improvement from 1983 
but martin binkin a senior fellow and defense expert at the 
brookings institution in washington called it a risky venture 
for the pentagon 
how good are they who knows there are no sure answers 
said binkin coauthor of us army guard amp reserve rhetoric 
realities risks 
theyre far superior to what they were in the vietnam period 
but theres no way of measuring in peacetime how well a unit will 
perform in wartime 
one of his books observations on balance the nations 
experience with mobilizing its reserve forces since world war ii 
has been disappointing 
when president kennedy called up reserves during the 1961 
building of the berlin wall an army study group concluded 
without a visible mission to perform and without the existence 
of a national emergency these personnel increasingly had one 
objective to go home as soon as possible 
since korea reserves have seen more domestic duty than foreign 
assignment they mobilized five times for school integration 
clashes the berlin crisis the cuban missile crisis the vietnam 
war and a 1970 postal strike 
an army study group called vietnam a particularly dismal 
period for the guard and reserve and said its ability to go to 
war was near zero 
it wasnt so much what reserves did as what they didnt do 
president johnson decided not to activate the reserves when the 
vietnam buildup escalated in 1965 choosing instead to rely on the 
draft 
the reserves became a haven for thousands of collegeeducated 
men who avoided the draft and sat out the war in relative safety 
some reservists wore wigs to cover their long hair while counting 
the days to discharge 
johnson did call up 35280 reservists after the 1968 tet 
offensive a small fraction of the 34 million draftees and 
enlistees who served in vietnam 
the most memorable reserve action of the vietnam era happened in 
ohio when national guardsmen shot and killed four kent state 
university students at an antiwar rally for the most part 
reserves made headlines only when they were killed in training 
accidents with jeeps and helicopters 
but officials say thats no longer the case 
annual training used to be an openended poker game and 
beerfest said harry heath spokesman for the georgia department 
of defense and a retired army colonel today the army and air 
national guard are prepared to accept any challenge and will acquit 
themselves competently and professionally 
herbert r temple former head of the national guard bureau put 
it this way it was not but a few years ago that they said we 
couldnt fight our way out of a wet paper bag baby weve come a 
long way 
today 12 million men and women serve in all branches of the 
reserves about 324000 are in the army reserve and 596000 are in 
the air and army national guard more than during vietnam 
one highpriority combat unit is the 48th mechanized brigade of 
the georgia national guard a force of about 4000 soldiers it 
makes up onethird of the wartime configuration of the us armys 
24th mechanized infantry division which has been deployed in saudi 
arabia twelve of the armys 18 active divisions are rounded out by 
a reserve brigade 
in 1983 the 48th brigade became the first reserve unit to train 
at the armys national training center in the mojave desert 
members are equipped with the abrams m1 tank and m2 bradley 
fighting vehicle which they received even before the regular army 
division to which they are assigned 
their commander holland is a 28year veteran of the guard he 
has his duffel bags packed travelers checks in hand and a haircut 
that meets military regulations he has assigned power of attorney 
to his wife 
theres just a tremendous turnaround i wouldnt have anything 
to do with the guard the way it was holland said in a northern 
georgia drawl 
the center for defense information a group of former military 
officers critical of pentagon spending estimated it would cost an 
extra 83 million a day or 3 billion a year just in salaries if 
100000 reservists were activated 
they are by and large responsible and actively involved 
citizens who will answer the call said retired adm eugene 
carroll but there will be some ducking and dodging from some who 
dont want to go 
and still there are skeptics wayne mcintosh a rifleman from 
new york city discharged from the marines in 1988 said theyre 
civilians at heart they have a civilian attitude when the stuff 
hits the fan i wouldnt feel comfortable with a weekend warrior 
next to me 
that kind of talk doesnt sit well in northern georgia 
most peoples image of a reservist was an individual trying to 
beat the draft or a bunch of drunks and cardplayers theres been 
a complete turnaround said sgt alton key 41 of the 48th 
brigade 
the morales high this unit has been super well be prepared 
to do our duty key said we signed on the dotted line were 
ready to stand in ranks

a black former mayor is trying this year to 
do what a popular white governor could not do in 1984 topple 
republican jesse helms the senates zealous crusader against 
obscene art and homosexual causes 
helms is counting on his national fundraising juggernaut and 
hotbutton values issues to win him a fourth term harvey 
gantt his democratic challenger depicts himself as a champion of 
what he contends are peoples real concerns education health 
care and the environment 
gantts race is one of the wild cards that keeps the contest 
from being a typical conservativeliberal matchup another is 
helms capacity to inspire devotion and distaste among voters in 
nearly equal measure leaving the outcome to a small percentage of 
undecideds 
the two candidates backgrounds are as different as their styles 
and philosophies 
helms was a television commentator in the 1960s and became a 
household name with his editorials against integration during that 
same period gantt became the first black student at clemson 
university 
gantt an architect also is the first black man to win his 
partys senate nomination and he did it by defeating white rivals 
in both a primary and a june 5 runoff he said then that helms 
would bring up the race issue at his own risk 
helms has not mentioned race directly but he refused to rebuke 
james meredith a civil rights pioneer who now works on his staff 
when meredith said national black leaders were heavily involved in 
drugs 
and helms in at least one television ad has dusted off an old 
southern strategy to remind voters that his opponent is black 
that ad ends with a photograph of helms tagged north carolina 
values and a photo of gantt labeled liberal values 
the senators radio and tv spots so far have featured president 
bush stumping for helms and a grandfatherly helms with crippled 
children others criticize gantts support for abortion rights his 
opposition to the death penalty and his alleged support for five 
different tax increases while serving as charlottes mayor 
some of the ads question gantts extreme liberal record but 
they stop short of the kind of personal negative attacks that 
helms used against nick galifanikas john ingram and former gov 
jim hunt in earlier campaigns 
helms in a rare news conference told reporters he has been 
trying to be restrained after democrats predicted he would 
mount a scathing negative campaign against gantt 
helms began his 1984 campaign against hunt then the governor 
more than a year before the election but said he wanted to spare 
the voters this time 
people ought to be given some relief from politics you may 
love it he told reporters but they dont love it they would 
resent and regret so much emphasis on politics until after labor 
day 
while helms has used innuendo and indirect attacks gantt 
campaign officials say the helmshunt race the most expensive and 
bitter in state history may have defused direct attacks this time 
around 
i think 1984 did as much to help us as anything said susan 
jetton gantts press secretary the negative tone of that 
campaign was something people just didnt want to see again 
and everybody remembers it it sticks in their minds she 
said people who dont follow politics know about it 
gantt in one of his own ads takes aim at helms previous 
campaign tactics and the record that brought him the nickname 
senator no 
some people are always trying to tear things down gantt 
says in a tv spot that recounts his rise from a public housing 
project to become the mayor of charlotte im an architect we 
build things 
since winning the june 5 runoff gantt has been alternating 
campaign trips to hamlets and villages with fundraising forays 
outside the state the most recent federal reports show he had 
raised 853000 as of june 30 
helms meanwhile had continued a recordbreaking pace of 
fundraising raising some 79 million so far but much of the 
money is plowed back into expensive directmail fundraising he 
had just over 555000 in the bank in july 
helms fundraising letters sent to a network of conservative 
donors developed during his 18 years in the senate generally paint 
the campaign as in crisis 
either my campaign raises 376000 within the next 10 days or 
my campaign may very well be over he said in a recent letter 
sent to prospective donors by certified mail our polls show the 
situation is desperate and my campaign people tell me every 
dollar we have in the bank will be gone within 10 days 
the polls show helms and gantt virtually deadlocked at about 45 
percent of the vote each with about 10 percent undecided 
but that is almost a standard breakdown in any helms campaign 
no matter who runs against the senator helms biggest victory in 
1978 came with a 55 percent to 45 percent margin over ingram he 
defeated hunt by only a 5248 margin despite president reagans 
powerful appeal in 1984 
thad beyle a political science professor at the university of 
north carolina said gantts poll standings could be misleading 
what concerns me about the polls is the racial slippage he 
said thats what happened in virginia with gov doug wilders 
campaign 8 to 10 percent of the wilder vote just disappeared on 
election day thats because of people who tell you they will vote 
for a black man but wont 
the gantt campaign hopes his personal campaign appeals to groups 
of 50 to 200 people in rural areas will help white voters stick 
with gantt 
were going into a lot of places where theyve never seen a 
senate candidate before jetton said a lot of the audiences 
have been overwhelmingly white and the reaction has just been 
incredible 
gantt will start appearing in urban areas after labor day when 
media coverage becomes more important jetton said 
helms said he plans to campaign in the state every weekend after 
labor day but its unclear whether reporters will be welcome 
unlike his previous three races helms has not released a 
schedule of his campaign activities and campaign officials in the 
last month have stopped talking to reporters insisting that 
questions be submitted in writing when the campaign responds the 
answers come in a written statement 
its certainly his style to stay as far away from reporters as 
possible beyle said of helms but he said this years tactics 
are unusual even for helms 
i just wonder whether theres something about having harvey 
gantt running that may be causing them problems beyle said i 
dont know what those problems are but it makes you wonder

disturbing side effects patients blame on 
the popular antidepressant prozac have resulted in several 
multimilliondollar lawsuits and a group of women have formed a 
support network for those who feel adversely affected by the drug 
its a very dangerous drug especially since people arent 
being warned about its possible side effects said janet sims of 
noblesville ind who linked her suicide attempt to the drug and 
in may founded the prozac survivors support group 
since then support groups have been formed in at least seven 
states an estimated 2 million people worldwide have taken the 
drug depression afflicts an estimated 4 percent of american adults 
prozac a member of the class of drugs known as fluoxetine has 
been promoted as a miracle drug with few and minor side effects 
according to sims and other patients 
but it can induce violent and persistent suicidal and homicidal 
tendencies in people who never have experienced such thoughts 
before they say the manufacturer and federal officials defend 
prozac 
this summer two patients sued the drugs manufacturer eli 
lilly and co of indianapolis both allege prozac can prompt 
suicidal or aggressive behavior and that eli lilly failed to warn 
doctors about the possibility 
in addition the widows of three victims of a kentucky man who 
murdered eight people at a printing company last september before 
shooting himself are each suing the company for 50 milllion 
saying the aggression was linked to prozac 
eli lilly has not commented on the lawsuits 
in her lawsuit rhonda hala of shirley ny said that within 
two weeks of beginning to take prozac her thoughts turned to 
suicide during 18 months on the drug she slashed herself with 
razor blades and dug scissors and screws into her flesh about 150 
times she said she tried six times to kill herself she said 
i thought i had someone elses brian in my body said mrs 
hala a 40yearold school secretary 
when she stopped taking the drug she said her life returned to 
normal 
in 1988 the food and drug administration approved prozac for 
treatment of depression it quickly became the most widely 
dispensed antidepressant on the us market 
its being given out like candy said michael obrien a 
spokesman for the los angelesbased citizens commission on human 
rights a group established by the church of scientology to 
investigate psychiatric abuse the doctors and psychiatrists are 
told that the drug is incredibly safe so they give it out for just 
about any reason 
in the american journal of psychiatry in february dr martin 
teicher of harvard university and colleagues reported that six 
patients had developed violent suicidal thoughts within weeks of 
taking prozac the problem stopped after patients stopped using the 
drug 
the bottom line is that prozac is no wonder drug it has no 
extravagant claims attached to it but it has helped a lot of 
people suffering from depression appreciate the benefits of life 
said jerrold rosenbaum chief of the psychopharmcology unit at 
massachusetts general hospital and associate professor at harvard 
university 
in florida use of the drug by former threeterm sen lawton 
chiles has become a topic in his campaign for governor 
state house speaker tom gustafson the running mate of chiles 
democratic primary opponent suggested that chiles could be a 
suicide risk in the governors mansion candidate bill nelson a 
sixterm congressman distanced himself from the remark and 
gustafson eventually apologized 
later chiles released medical records that said he never 
contemplated suicide 
fda and lilly officials said there have been no unusual problems 
with prozac 
the thousands of adverse reaction reports received about prozac 
are not unusual for a drug so widely prescribed fda spokeswoman 
faye peterson said and she said most of those reports cite 
sleeplessness and agitation not violent behavior 
we dont think there is any problem here but we continue to 
monitor it she said 
unfortunately suicidal thoughts as well as acts of suicide 
are known risks of depressed patients lilly spokesman ed west 
said 
there have been extensive clinical and postmarketing trials of 
the drug west said we see no trend that suggests a causal 
relationship between our product and this type of behavior he 
said 
patients who formed chapters of the support group disagree 
avis martin of san francisco said that while she was taking 
prozac she would sit in my room planning out how i was going to 
murder my children and then commit suicide 
it makes you think youre crazy and that the only way out is 
to take more drugs said sharyn digeronimo founder of a new york 
support group the groups will let people know that theyre not 
alone and that theyre not crazy 
bonnie leitsch who founded the louisville group said she is 
convinced prozac caused joseph wesbeckers rampage at a louisville 
printing plant last year records showed wesbecker had been taking 
the drug but the state medical examiner george nichols said 
prozac was not a solo drug and not directly responsible 
leitsch has taken a sabbatical from work to devote more time to 
the group 
until this job is done until this drug is off the market i 
think its safe to say ive resigned she said

an unusual rehabilitation program that offers 
firsttime drug offenders the chance to try acupuncture treatments 
is surprising officials with its success a year after it began 
its the first and last time im going to jail cheryl said 
confidently after removing five tiny golden needles from her ears 
on her 12th day of treatment 
cheryl 40 is working on kicking her 22year habit through 
acupuncture therapy and counseling she agreed to talk on condition 
that her full name not be used 
the goal is to get people out of the jails and into 
constructive lives said dade county state attorney janet reno 
cheryl said she is worried she could lose her job with the 
county over her arrest but is optimistic about her treatment 
i know that it works i havent had the urge to buy reefer 
since im here she said 
of about 1500 people who have chosen the treatment in the year 
it has been offered only 16 have been arrested again said mae 
bryant director of the metrodade office of rehabilitative 
services 
officials say an average of 150 to 200 people a day go to two 
outpatient clinics offering acupuncture 
this is absolutely phenomenal we couldnt get people to 
come here with the promise of a meal before this said raymond 
white of the county department of human resources 
acupuncture an oriental practice that uses needles to treat 
illness and relieve pain is drawing people in like nothing else 
has he said 
its a nonverbal method i can come in sit get the 
service leave and feel im working on recovery said white 
adding that the relaxed mood brought on by acupuncture also helps 
make participants more receptive to traditional counseling 
the program is voluntary and those who complete the yearlong 
period have their charges dropped and records cleared 
only a few cities have similar programs and miamis has become 
a model including for one starting this fall by courts in 
montgomery county ohio 
one indicator that the miami program is succeeding is that 
almost 75 percent of those entering are staying said janet 
konefal an associate professor in psychiatry at the university of 
miami and a consultant for the county the retention rate for 
outpatient drug treatment programs usually runs about 20 percent to 
25 percent she said 
traditionally it has been thought that people with crack 
problems couldnt be treated on an outpatient basis white said 
for whatever reason acupuncture seems desirable enough for the 
clients that they keep coming back 
we dont know how it works but we know it works said 
carlos alvarez an addiction counselor at the lincoln hospital 
division of substance abuse in the new york city borough of the 
bronx that program also uses acupuncture combined with counseling 
and social rehabilitation for drug and alcohol patients 
cities all over the world are expressing interest in acupuncture 
for drug treatment alvarez said 
lynn hankes director of the addiction treatment program at 
south miami hospital said acupuncture is not currently used in 
mainstream addiction medicine but could be effective in some cases 
its main therapeutic effect is during the detoxification 
period he said adding that the longterm effects need to be 
studied 
like other drug offenders taken directly from court to the 
clinic in a corrections van a 26yearold homestead man wasnt 
sure what to expect from his first session 
do they stick them in all the way he asked nervously while 
holding tightly to a package of tiny needles 
acupuncture aims to redistribute the bodys energy flow or 
stimulate the production of chemicals often depleted through drug 
abuse in order to achieve a calming effect practitioners say 
in the dade county program the five points where needles are 
inserted are linked to certain areas of the body the sympathetic 
which is tied to the central nervous system the senmen to the 
spirit the kidney liver and lung the ears were chosen because 
they are convenient and sensitive said van yuan the programs 
chief acupuncturist 
after a certified acupuncturist inserts five needles into each 
ear the participant sits quietly for 45 minutes to an hour 
the direct effect is to stimulate the bodys own tranquilizing 
system chemical changes in the body to help a person to relax and 
reduce muscle tension hankes said 
overall they begin to get a sense of wellbeing and cravings 
are decreased said ms konefal 
in the first four months participants must attend the clinic 
two to three times a week after an initial 12 consecutive visits 
their urine is tested on each visit and they can get acupunture 
therapy in the final stretch education and career counseling also 
are offered the countyfunded program costs about 500 per year 
per person 
county officials are discussing expanding the 12 million 
program but first want to find out exactly how well it is working 
some answers may come from a threeyear 1 million study being 
funded by the national institute of drug abuse and conducted by ms 
konefal

yellowstone national park 
officials are turning to a fictional mountain man of the 1800s to 
guide children along a nature trail reflecting the force of 1988s 
firestorms 
joshua grimes the craggy ol mountain man created by writer 
sandra chisholm robinson to recount the natural and human history 
of yellowstone national park will resume his storytelling along 
the childrens fire trail next month 
yallerstones a powerful place with more tales to tell than 
even an ol timer like me could ever larn grimes tells visitors 
in a taperecorded message being installed at the start of the 
boardwalk trail 
but the story of fire heh heh that story sure do shine 
grimes will tell that shining story through a dozen interpretive 
displays being erected along the trail 
hell note the baked boulders charred trees and sterilized 
soils that serve as reminders of the fires that caught the worlds 
attention and grimes will point to natures recuperative powers 
the floral bursts of fireweed and lupine the lodgepole seedlings 
the aspen shoots 
the trail located roughly six miles east of mammoth hot springs 
on the blacktail plateau is a tribute to the scores of children 
throughout the country who in 1988 wondered how they could help 
yellowstone recover from the onceinalifetime fires 
the wildfires blackened roughly half of yellowstones 22 
million acres and at various times forced the closure of some of 
the parks lodgings although none of the geologic features or 
historic buildings were damaged sparked both by lightning and 
careless humans the fires grew to historic proportions as a result 
of the summers extremely hot dry and windy conditions 
many children wanted to send pine cones and seedlings to the 
park to help reforest burned areas but park policy dictating that 
the areas recover naturally made those offers inappropriate so 
instead the national park service decided to build the trail and 
suggested that students interested in helping yellowstone raise 
funds for the project 
so far those donations have covered about 6000 of the 
projects 125500 estimated cost 
as children and others wind their way down the trail theyll 
see living trees interspersed with charred skeletons of trees some 
scattered about the forest floor others towering like blackened 
totem poles 
theyll be able to run their hands across boulders that stood in 
the path of the wolf lake fire and see how the rocks protected 
their northern faces while the southern faces are shedding slivers 
of rock literally baked by the flames 
a series of photographs taken sept 9 1988 the day the fire 
stormed the area will be on display since the rapid growth of 
wildflowers has obscured some traces of the flames 
well have copies of those photographs because when you look 
at it now its very tough to tell there was a fire said ranger 
joe zarki who is overseeing development of the trail 
revegetation of the area also will be described by some of the 
panels one of which will explain how sagebrush that burned two 
years ago now is affecting the regrowth zarki said 
since sagebrush burns hotter than surrounding grasses explained 
the ranger soil closer to the bush was sterilized and will take 
longer to again be able to sustain plants vegetation around these 
bushes is actually coming back in concentric circles greening up 
from the outside in he said 
stands of aspen and lodgepole pine surrounding the trail are 
evidence that while fire can destroy trees it can also create 
life the ranger said when exposed to heat lodgepole pine cones 
expand allowing the seeds they cup to drop to the ground where 
they can germinate said zarki 
aspens meanwhile redirect their energies when they burn the 
ranger said 
if the above ground tree dies all the energy goes into 
producing growth in the roots shoots he said one of the 
exhibits will talk just about that reproductive ecology of the 
aspen 
nearby migratory routes for elk bison pronghorn antelope and 
mule deer also will be noted as will the attractiveness of the 
burned area to hawks nuthatches bluebirds and wrens 
fires produce dead trees that are good nesting sites for 
holenesting birds such as tree swallows said zarki 
park officials hope those who meander along the boardwalk gain 
an appreciation for yellowstones rapidly changing world 
the fastmoving fires of 1988 made changes to the land that 
are quickly being altered by the passing seasons reads the last 
panel that will be placed at the end of the trail each minute 
brings new changes to the park helping make yellowstone the 
special place that it is 
change belongs to yellowstone as much as the rocks the trees 
the wind nothing ever stays the same

tales of 120yearold yogurt eaters with the 
boundless energy of adolescents made memorable television 
commercials and fed the notion that even if it is not the key to 
eternal youth yogurt sure is healthy 
hence workers lunching at their desks with little containers of 
fruitflavored yogurt or shoppers choosing frozen yogurt over ice 
cream or parents getting their kids to snack on yogurt americans 
eat 46 pounds per person annually a 110 percent increase in 10 
years according to the national yogurt association 
yogurt is healthy but that doesnt mean it is calorie 
sugaror fatfree 
to keep down fat consumption buy low or nofat yogurt read 
labels carefully especially on frozen yogurt containers to make 
sure there is no unwanted added fat or sugar 
add fruit or other flavorings to plain yogurt use it plain to 
replace sour cream or mayonnaise in sauces and dips it also will 
work in marinades and in many recipes for bread or other baked 
goods 
however it will curdle if put into hot liquids whipping it can 
break the curd and make the yogurt watery 
there is a significant difference in calories and fat content 
among the various types and brands of yogurt a cup of nonfat 
plain yogurt has 90 to 110 calories none from fat flavored 
yogurts can have as many as 270 calories a cup and some varieties 
get more than a third of their calories from fat 
yogurt fermented milk with living microbes was not discovered 
by hippies who made it in communes it has been eaten for at least 
4000 years in many parts of the world throughout the middle east 
women moving to a foreign place traditionally carried a bit of 
starter culture to ferment milk the yogurt association said 
it is the action of live cultures that converts milk into yogurt 
and the natural bacteria that gives yogurt its distinctive taste 
the specific type of culture used neednt be listed on the label 
which will distinguish between living cultures and those that have 
been killed through pasteurization 
inactive cultures are thought to lose their therapeutic benefit 
jean carper said in her book the food pharmacy 
no one has documented extraordinary longevity based on yogurt 
consumption but early this century nobel prizewinning scientist 
elias metchnikoff argued that eating fermented milk would 
counteract diseasecausing microbial putrefaction in the 
intestines carper said 
people long have used yogurt to ward off or fight intestinal 
troubles carper said some studies have suggested yogurt may help 
boost the immune system research has been initiated into possible 
links to managing or preventing some forms of cancer 
the calcium in yogurt is helpful to people who are allergic to 
milk because of a lactose intolerance they often can eat yogurt 
without difficulty calcium may help prevent the debilitating bone 
disease osteoporosis 
one cup of lowfat yogurt provides 415 milligrams of calcium 
the recommended dietary allowance is 1200 milligrams for people 
ages 11 to 24 and during pregnancy and lactation 800 milligrams 
for people ages 1 to 10 and over 24 and 400 to 600 milligrams for 
infants 
a cup of milk has 290 milligrams of calcium four ounces of tofu 
contain 154 milligrams

diabetes rates have been rising in europe and 
new zealand but not in north america bolstering suspicions that 
some environmental factor may promote the disease a study says 
the research focused on the most serious kind of diabetes in 
which a person must inject himself with insulin daily to stay 
alive about 1 million americans are estimated to have this form 
genes are partly responsible but scientists also suspect some 
kind of environmental trigger like a virus or something in a 
childs diet 
the new work is reported in the july issue of the journal 
diabetes by scientists from 10 countries and the world health 
organization it focused on data from 1966 to 1986 
in leicestershire england rates rose 115 percent a year for 
children up to age 4 122 percent for children ages 5 to 9 and 
26 percent for children ages 10 to 14 researchers said 
in other locations increases were similar among the three age 
groups diabetes rose 101 percent among white children in 
auckland new zealand but showed no trend among maori and 
polynesian populations 
other increases included 56 percent in wielkopolska poland 
51 percent in austria 37 percent in sweden 34 percent in 
finland and 28 percent in norway although the percentage rises 
were faster in europe than in scandinavia europes diabetes levels 
were only a third to a fifth of scandinavias to begin with 
researchers said 
rates in hokkaido japan were up 63 percent 
no significant trend appeared in samples from alabama colorado 
minnesota north dakota and pennsylvania researchers cautioned 
that they may have overlooked a trend because of too little data

a 26yearold man admitted to a hospital for an 
apparent epileptic seizure actually was throwing a temper tantrum 
researchers say 
the episode occurred as he spoke to a woman who was selling him 
a house he thought was in poor condition 
other attacks occurred after he accused his girlfriend of 
infidelity and in a later marriage after an argument with his 
wife researchers report in the journal psychosomatics 
the mans tantrums periodically are misdiagnosed as 
epilepsy wrote researchers from the baystate medical center in 
springfield mass college of the holy cross in worcester mass 
and the university of massachusetts medical school 
the man was hospitalized after he felt a sharp abdominal pain 
and then began thrashing and bucking brain tests found no sign of 
epilepsy 
in a hospital interview with a mental health worker he began to 
feel stomach pain again as he described painful childhood 
experiences he asked to stop the interview and when urged to 
continue he proceeded to have a dramatic temper tantrum 
researchers said 
temper tantrums in adulthood generally are truncated and 
thinly disguised such as when a person kicks a flat tire or when 
a tennis player hurls his racquet they wrote for some 
individuals such as this patient temper tantrums may be virtually 
indistinguishable from those of children

in this summer of swooning markets what 
possible incentive could a conservative incomeminded investor 
find to consider venturing into stocks 
not much it would certainly appear if the subject in question 
is playing the market in the hope of fun and profit such 
rewards have been in very short supply of late and the risks that 
go with them have been painfully plain to see 
but with a different objective and a correspondingly different 
strategy the picture looks less grim at least as it is painted 
by an analyst at the nations largest investment advisory service 
milton schlein associate research director at the value line 
investment survey set out to compare the relative merits of bonds 
and electric utility stocks two popular vehicles among investors 
seeking a steady stream of income from their savings 
the two have much in common including relatively generous 
yields and a tendency to rise or fall in price mainly in inverse 
reaction to the ups and downs of interest rates 
but after examining the behavior of these two species over the 
past 13 years schlein finds enough disparity in their performances 
to draw this conclusion history suggests that utility stocks 
have been superior total return holdings to bonds whether rates 
were going up or down 
the 197789 period schlein chose for his study witnessed a wide 
variety of financial environments an upsurge in interest rates and 
inflation from 77 to 81 a sharp decline in rates between 81 
and 86 and most recently a protracted stretch of relatively 
stable rates 
in both the risingrate and fallingrate environments he found 
utility stock prices fared significantly better than those of 
bonds since 1986 he said the performance of the two has been 
about equal 
the utilities biggest advantage schlein says seems to be 
increases in their dividends which give them a measure of 
inflation protection that isnt available with the fixed interest 
payments made on bonds 
in addition he observes utility stocks arent encumbered by 
what he describes as two restraints on the appeal of bonds 
many bonds come with call provisions that allow their issuers to 
buy them back at specified times in addition bonds typically have 
a specified maturity date when they are redeemed for their face 
value in cash 
both these characteristics limit the appeal of a good many bonds 
as a means of locking in yields for an extended period of time 
on the other side of the ledger utilitystock yields arent as 
secure as those of bonds a utility that runs into trouble is 
almost certain to lower or eliminate the dividend on its stock 
before it would take the more drastic step of interrupting its 
contractual interest payments to bondholders 
and some utilities do get into trouble as witness the many 
cases in recent years of problems at nuclear power projects 
to minimize this risk value line recommends choosing among 
utility stocks whose yields hover around the average for the 
industry avoiding both the high and low extremes 
why do we favor the middle of the pack because it describes 
the most balanced course of investment schlein concludes 
in our view yields much above the norm imply an unusual 
degree of risk typically in the form of heavy construction 
programs and regulatory uncertainties 
by contrast with the stock of a utility in peak financial 
condition schlein says the price of ultrasafety is likely to be 
a poor return in dividend yield 
we assume that most utility investors especially those using 
these stocks as a bond substitute are concerned with drawing as 
high a current income as possible within their tolerance for 
risk schlein says 
for a topflight utility the current yield is usually

tepito the infamous smugglers market is 
suffering an identity crisis 
mexico has thrown its doors open to imports making sonys and 
mars bars legal yesterdays contraband is available at stores with 
names like super gringo 
whats a smuggler to do 
cut prices build a shopping center offer cheap parking 
tepitenos have always had a keen sense of timing an eye for 
opportunity said miguel galan president of the confederation of 
tepito merchant associations 
in the 1970s when mexico was flush with oil money tepito 
became known as the place to buy contraband known as fayuca 
tough import restrictions meant only smugglers could supply the 
booming consumer demand for japanese televisions and stereos for 
shampoo and sweets made in the usa 
residents of tepito a scrappy innercity slum were glad to 
oblige 
it became a place where guts and a pickup could make a prince of 
a pauper tepitenos streamed back and forth across the us border 
like ants buying off police and customs officers 
fayuca flourished because it was good business for everybody 
customs the police the tepitenos the consumers galan said 
things began to change after mexico joined the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade or gatt in 1986 president carlos salinas de 
gortari has further eased import restrictions since taking office 
in 1988 
most of merchandise in tepito which specializes in electronics 
now is imported legally because people realized it was easier to 
pay taxes than to make payoffs galan said in an interview 
the prospect of legitimacy has spawned ambitious visions of 
direct imports from japan singapore hong kong and south korea it 
evokes dreams of conventional grandeur 
galan proudly unfurled an architects rendering of a fivestory 
172000squarefoot commercial center that would replace the maze 
of stalls booths and shops run by thousands of people whose 
families have done business here for generations 
we need 4000 parking spaces minimum galan said 
is it possible that infamous tepito home to 14000 merchants 
could become just another shopping mall 
on the surface the district seems to have changed little it 
hums with the raffish energy that made it legend 
housewives haggle with hustlers carts jam the streets laden 
with products as diverse as fresh donuts and eggs of endangered 
turtles pickpockets prey on the unwary in a bruising din of 
radios stereos televisions video players and nintendos 
merchandise still changes hands on a cashonly 
donteventhinkofaskingforareceiptorwarranty basis 
tomorrows tepito already seems to be evolving however since 
mexico opened its borders smalltime smugglers have been largely 
replaced by bulk importers legitimate and otherwise 
there used to be thousands of people bringing stuff across the 
border said alejandra escareno a thirdgeneration tepitena 
now there are only a handful of big guys they bring in stuff by 
the trailer load put it in their warehouses and sell it to small 
vendors 
escareno 42 said smalltimers cant offer competitive prices 
so she quit dealing in electronics when it became legal 
how could we compete when we had 10 televisions and they had 
100 she asked escareno went back to the familys old line used 
clothes another timehonored business in tepito 
tepito is a scavenger on the edges of mexican history for 
decades it was like a quirky mirror that reflected the silver 
lining instead of the cloud 
there has always been a special kind of person here who could 
figure out how to keep ahead of the game tepito historian 
alfonso hernandez y hernandez said in a recent interview with the 
newspaper la jornada 
its openair markets emerged after the desperate years of the 
19101920 revolution craftsmen displaced by war settled in tepito 
and survived by patching old clothes and shoes 
world war ii shortages rekindled the demand for refurbished 
items and then came the postwar years of growth 
as people moved into mexico citys new suburbs tepitenos 
snapped up their discarded possessions 
they cast off their old things in the rush to be modern 
galan said running a hand over the huge clawfooted desk his 
father had found tepito became known as the place to get 
bargains on antiques 
businessmen like galan who quit living in tepito after he made 
a fortune in pirated cassettes sometimes are described as 
insensitive to its special nature 
most tepitenos are fiercely loyal to the neighborhood which 
already was a teeming slum when spanish conquerors arrived in 1519 
the spirit that bred its smugglers also has spawned writers 
painters and poets some fear legitimacy may be the one thing this 
barrio of about 400000 people cannot survive 
escareno considered galans vision of megashopping parking lots 
and computerized marketing and said 
tepito is a special place the community is very united but 
it just wouldnt be the same

next time you push that button on your computer 
to send a coworker a racy electronic mail message about the boss 
think twice 
someone may be reading your mail 
every day millions of computer users send electronic messages 
to fellow employees supervisors clients and friends many assume 
these computertocomputer electronic mail systems the postal 
system of the information age are confidential 
but a recent lawsuit challenges that notion the suit contends a 
california company spied on employees for months by monitoring 
thousands of their electronic messages 
the classaction suit filed last month by several employees 
against epson america inc of torrance calif claims the 
companys computer operations manager made printed copies of 
electronic mail sent and received by 700 epson workers the suit 
claims such snooping violates a state wiretap law 
epson a japaneseowned company that sells personal computers 
calls the lawsuit unfounded 
it is clearly not the policy of epson to indiscriminately read 
electronic mail said spokeman scot edwards he declined to 
comment on the suits specific allegations 
the suit is just the latest example of a growing privacy debate 
surrounding electronic mail or email which mushroomed in 
popularity over the past decade along with the growth in personal 
computers among other cases 
the mayor of colorado springs colo caused a stir earlier 
this year when it was discovered he had been reading printouts of 
electronic messages that city council members sent each other in 
confidence 
the irancontra affair unraveled partly because investigators 
discovered electronic messages sent by lt col oliver north and 
supporters the north team didnt realize every message had been 
stored on computer tape 
computer experts say some email systems automatically destroy 
electronic messages once they are read while others keep a copy 
but even systems that erase old messages arent safe from 
snoops in most systems computer room operators can read messages 
that havent yet been opened by recipients said mike zisman 
president of softswitch inc a wayne pa company that helps 
corporations link email systems 
when you send a message most people think its as private as 
sending it through the us postal system but in some companies it 
can be as private as writing it on the bathroom wall said david 
atlas an email analyst at international data corp a hightech 
research firm 
atlas said he knows of another suit similar to the epson class 
action as well as employees at two other companies who are 
considering their own lawsuits but he declined to identify them 
few employers have explicit policies on the use and privacy of 
email said walter ulrich an office automation specialist at the 
consulting firm arthur d little inc 
thats an area where companies should give guidance to 
employees said ulrich who estimates there are 10 million email 
users in north america 
ulrich recommended companies state they will not snoop in email 
systems unless they believe users are using them illegally or 
abusively 
it is unhealthy to go on a fishing expedition he said 
but ulrich said he doesnt think companies should be barred 
outright from reading email he argued that since the companies 
own the computer systems they therefore own the information 
created on them 
the american civil liberties union takes a stronger stance 
against email snooping it believes federal privacy safeguards are 
needed to prevent employers from eavesdropping on employees 
personal affairs that happen to be contained in computer files 
theres virtually no law that would stop any employer from 
sytematically reading all of the computerized information of any of 
their employees said lewis maltby coordinator of the aclus 
national task force on civil liberties in the work place 
federal laws that bar wiretapping dont apply to computer 
systems maltby said 
ulrich said email users need not worry about the security of 
electronic messages sent long distance over systems such as mci 
mail which link corporate email systems nationwide federal law 
as well as the design of these systems prevent snooping he said 
the electronicmail issue is part of a broader concern about the 
use of technology to monitor workers word processors reservations 
agents and others have complained about systems that allow 
supervisors to secretly watch their work 
despite privacy concerns email experts contend the systems 
have vastly improved the way business operates eliminating missed 
phone calls postal delays and timezone lags that hamper 
communication among farflung workers they also say email has 
changed the way some businesses operate by allowing group 
discussions via computer that formerly would have been nearly 
impossible

six of the 13 opec nations might gather 
informally this weekend at the cartels vienna headquarters to 
consider soaring oil prices sources said 
the idea of the consultations is apparently an attempt at a 
compromise between those countries which want an emergency meeting 
of all the cartels members and those which do not 
on monday opec announced that there was no majority support for 
a saudi arabian request to call an urgent meeting 
word of the possible informal meeting came wednesday as the 
price of oil on world markets climbed to levels not seen since the 
mid80s in crudeoil trading at the new york mercantile exchange 
for example prices surged over the 31 a barrel level a 72 
percent gain since the crisis erupted aug 2 
indonesia has proposed the meeting in vienna for sunday said 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the sources stressed that no final decision has yet been made on 
whether to meet 
it may or may not be held said one source if it is it 
will be very very informal no decisions could be made at the 
gathering he said 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said last saturday 
that his country intended to increase oil production by 2 million 
barrels a day with or without opecs approval the increase would 
make up about half of the loss of some 4 million barrels a day 
caused by the international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil that 
followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
nazer had urged the cartel to hold an emergency session to 
discuss the situation the united arab emirates qatar venezuela 
and ecuador were said to support his plea 
irans oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said he opposed an 
emergency meeting because there was enough crude in storage to make 
up for the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
under the indonesia proposal the sources said iran saudi 
arabia nigeria algeria indonesia and venezuela would gather for 
the informal talks 
those nations represent two committees recently set up by the 
cartel to monitor oil production 
in its statement monday opec said algerian mining minister 
sadek boussena the cartels president would hold consultations 
with some ministers before the end of the month it did not 
elaborate 
meanwhile industry sources in venezuela said wednesday that 
country was accelerating plans to boost oil production by at least 
300000 barrels daily and filling its storage facilities at home 
and overseas to have extra output available as soon as authorities 
allow more production 
venezuela whose opec quota is about 19 million barrels a day 
has been lobbying for a formal opec meeting to sanction increased 
output 
saudi arabia which pumps about a quarter of the cartels oil 
has an opecset production quota of just under 54 million barrels 
a day 
at their summer conference last month opec ministers agreed to 
limit their output to 225 million barrels a day in the last half 
of the year to try to push crude prices up to 21 a barrel 
with the gulf crisis the average price of a basket of crudes 
monitored by the group surged last week to 2529 a barrel 
the next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled 
until middecember

as the stock market nosedives and rising interest 
rates begin to take their toll analysts expect tougher times for 
the japanese economy 
most market dealers remained pessimistic about future trends on 
an already bearish tokyo market but some said the continuing 
strength of the japanese yen against the dollar was among signs 
that the economy was fundamentally sound 
the nikkei stock average posted its ninthlargest fall ever 
wednesday dropping 108693 points and finished this mornings 
session with a fall of nearly 1000 points 
the biggest problem is that interest rates are going up 
said masumi murakami manager of nikko securities overthecounter 
stock division high yields he said were drawing money from the 
stock market 
he added that the middle east crisis had really compounded 
domestic inflationary problems making further increases in 
interest rates necessary 
the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government bond has gone 
from 7480 percent on aug 1 to more than 82 percent by midweek 
increased interest payments will slow down capital expenditures 
by businesses and in turn slow down growth he said the japanese 
economys annual growth rate would then cool from 5 percent to 45 
percent dodds predicted 
bruce johnson head of the research division at baring 
securities said the persian gulf crisis also had the potential of 
eating away manufacturers profit margins through rising oil prices 
and higher inflation 
the stock markets plunge presents a serious problem for japans 
commercial banks said roger gough a banking analyst at baring 
securities 
most of the countrys largest banks have large hidden 
portfolios of stock issues which they count as assets when share 
prices decline such assets lose value and the banks have to make 
up for losses to maintain internationally recognized reserve 
requirements 
gough said many of japans top banks are slipping below the 
reserve requirement and predicted difficulty in making up the 
losses without increasing interest rates and obtaining cash at high 
expense 
still some japanese remain positive 
one financial source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the continuing strength of the yen against the dollar despite 
international uncertainty revealed faith in the strength of the 
japanese economy 
i think thats a bright sign he said 
the japanese economy is not weak though there may be some 
negative factors it doesnt use too much energy and the damage 
from oil price increases will be small said nikkos murakami

corporations have become confidants for many frightened 
relatives of about 3000 americans held in the middle east 
officials call routinely lend an ear maybe crack a joke to ease 
the tension 
we are very sensitive to the needs of our people said ron 
kurz a spokesman for abb lummus crest inc of stamford conn 
any request they have of us we would follow through and 
respond as best we can 
late wednesday it appeared the engineering companys efforts 
might be paying off kurtz said he received word that four 
employees all phillipines citizens had been granted visas to 
leave iraq 
its a start said kurtz and were going to keep it up 
until we get them all out 
but michael saba founder of the coming home committee to 
support the families of hostages in iraq and kuwait said such 
support isnt universal 
there are some companies that have cut people off the payroll 
as of august 2 the day of the invasion said saba who escaped 
baghdad shortly after saddam husseins troops invaded kuwait 
its despicable 
saba said six or seven family members including an elderly 
woman who needed medical treatment were negotiating wednesday with 
companies that had cut off pay and benefits to trapped employees 
the champaign ill businessman would not identify the companies 
saba and relatives said company officials may not be able to 
sway events in the middle east but they certainly can ease fears 
with gestures as simple as a phone call or as elaborate as 
arranging for chartered planes or buses 
someone from santa fe international corp calls sarrah amos 
every day she said its the kind of handholding that makes the 
unknown more bearable 
if they know something they tell us mrs amos said 
wednesday from gilmer texas and if they dont they still 
call to say hey how you guys doing 
for many bewildered relatives its nice to know they have the 
resources and push of a powerful corporations behind them 
weve always felt well taken care of said mrs amos who 
along with her husband fled wartorn beirut with santa fes help in 
1975 
this time troops captured her 56yearold husband and many of 
his oil company coworkers before they could reach the border and 
bolt as hundreds of foreigners have done since the standoff began 
three weeks ago 
marjorie walterscheid has also taken comfort in santa fes 
concern as the days become weeks without word from her 52yearold 
husband he was among 35 us citizens reported transferred from a 
baghdad hotel to an undisclosed location 
theyve been really good to me calling every day said the 
jacksboro texas resident it makes me feel like someone cares 
and that company officials said is the least they can do 
at this point any communication is helpful said spokesman 
scott hallman of the aerospace company lockheed corp which has 
three employees missing these people are dealing with constant 
agony over whats going to happen to their loved ones 
sherry deaton hasnt heard from her husband since aug 17 when 
he called from a hotel in kuwait city she said lockheeds 
sensitivity has helped bridge that silence 
their hands are tied but they keep me up to date mrs 
deaton said from marietta ga they cant do much but it all 
helps

3020 to 3030 
share prices were lower almost across the board in thin trading 
yoshiro inoue an analyst with nomura securities co said the

prices 
the average fell 4381 points wednesday the price of the main 
us crude oil shot up 251 per 42gallon barrel wednesday on the

bargain hunting inoue said considering the amount the nikkei 
has lost it should start rebounding any time soon but the problem 
is that the middle east crisis is still there

federal securities regulators say five 
partners in a detroit law firm avoided sizeable losses on the stock 
of a foundering drug company through an alleged insider trading 
scheme 
three of the lawyers charged in a civil lawsuit wednesday 
settled with the securities and exchange commission without 
admitting or denying wrongdoing 
the sec charged that one partner saul bluestone who was a 
member of the board of zenith laboratories inc sold his stock in 
may 1988 after learning the ramsey nj generic drug maker had 
defaulted on a bank loan and was considering filing for bankruptcy 
protection 
bluestone 61 of farmington hills mich was accused of 
passing the information on to the other defendants who also were 
partners in the detroit law firm now known as lopatin miller 
federal securities law forbids corporate officers and board 
members from trading stocks in their company while possessing 
inside information not known to the general investing public 
the sec complaint charged that two days before zeniths problems 
were made public the other four partners sold their stock for 
about 2 per share based on information from bluestone that they 
knew or should have known was confidential and therefore illegal 
to use 
on may 4 1988 zenith announced it was seeking protection from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the 
announcement dropped the price of zenith stock to 112 per share 
bluestone and two of the defendants settled the charges without 
admitting or denying wrongdoing they also agreed to pay fines and 
restitution ranging from 9234 to 84334 
the two were identified as joseph bartnick 40 of detroit and 
norman rosen 44 of farmington hills 
bluestone and bartnick also agreed to pay additional fines equal 
to the losses saved by the persons they told directly about 
zeniths problems 
my position is that i absolutely did nothing wrong said 
bluestone when reached at the firms offices bluestone said he 
settled the sec charges because it was easier to resolve it with 
them than it was from the cost standpoint to fight it 
two other members of the law firm albert lopatin 60 of 
detroit and sheldon miller 53 of birmingham mich did not 
settle the charges the sec is seeking restitution of 11563 from 
lopatin and 10752 from miller plus unspecified fines

the nations big three automakers say they dont 
expect any effects of the mideast tension or the gasoline price 
increase it has caused to show up today in new car and truck sales 
numbers 
todays report for the aug 1120 period is the first full 
10day sales report since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and started a 
gasoline price rise that has averaged about a pennyaday per 
gallon 
representatives of general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp said they didnt expect to see any immediate trend 
away from large gasgulping cars to smaller more fuelefficient 
vehicles 
closeout sales are underway to end the model year complicating 
any analysis of what may be going on in dealers showrooms in 
response to the mideast crisis 
weve had two exceptional weekends and its been right in the 
teeth of this mideast thing said ralph jackson general sales 
manager at gwatney chevrolet in jacksonville ark there still 
appears to be in arkansas people who are shopping for automobiles 
however he added if it does get worse it could change 
peoples attitudes the one thing that it probably would effect was 
the full size vans with the gas going up its going to affect that 
market a little bit more 
the new car and truck sales pace this year has been lagging 
behind last year through july 31 gm ford and chrysler had sold 
about 61 million cars and trucks down 67 percent from last year 
during the fuel crises of the 1970s when americans were waiting 
in long lines for a limited supply of gasoline vehicles went fewer 
miles on a gallon of gas than they do today 
for example the small ford pinto of the late 1970s got about 
the same mileage as some of todays lincoln luxury cars 
although prices are going up now gasoline is going to have to 
get a lot more expensive somewhere around 150 a gallon for 
regular before sales are affected said joseph phillippi of 
shearson lehman brothers in new york city 
the gas thing is one issue but i think as news reports scare 
people half to death over this issue its going to have an effect 
on consumer confidence phillippi said 
chrysler spokesman tom houston agreed saying gasoline prices 
arent having nearly as dramatic an effect on the industry as is 
uncertainty 
through this point in time we havent seen anything gm 
spokesman terry sullivan said he declined to speculate at what 
point the automaker would begin seeing the effect of higher 
gasoline prices on sales 
joel pitcoff a ford spokesman also said the company has seen 
no indication so far of mideastlinked events affecting vehicle 
sales with one notable exception 
the one exception that we are definitely aware of is in 
locations that are contiguous to military installations he said 
it has really been devastating to the dealers 
pearson ford is within 10 miles of the main gate of the 32nd 
street naval station in san diego new car sales manager mike 
bridgeman said traffic in his showroom has fallen off dramatically 
in the last few weeks 
i would say its off at least 50 percent he said

cbs news president david burke confirmed today 
he is leaving at the end of the month in the network news 
divisions second highlevel shakeup in two years eric ober will 
become the sixth chief executive since 1980 
it is clear to me following amicable discussions with the 
management of cbs that they would be more comfortable about the 
future of the news division under new leadership burke said in a 
statement 
they have the right to make that decision and i intend fully 
to cooperate in the transition of leadership responsibilities 
burke 54 a former abc news executive vice president had two 
more years to go on his contract he did not immediately return 
calls to clarify whether he had resigned or was forced out 
ober is a 24year cbs veteran and president of the cbs 
television stations division he previously worked at cbs news as 
vice president for public affairs 
a cbs source who spoke on condition of anonymity wednesday night 
quoted network executives as saying burke had told them he was 
leaving but gave no reason 
another source said burke has had philosophical differences with 
budgetconscious cbs inc president laurence a tisch with whom 
burke reportedly has clashed over the costs of news coverage 
pressure from tisch to cut costs at cbs news led to the firing 
of more than 200 staff members in 1987 
however one cbs executive who asked not to be identified said 
today that burkes departure is not a money issue this is a 
leadership issue 
although there have been reports that cbs news was spending up 
to 1 million weekly for its coverage of the persian gulf crisis 
nobody within this company has talked with the news division 
about what its costing the source said 
it is right its our responsibility and we feel good about 
it 
cbs news after more than five years of internal turmoil 
recently had been scoring successes with its coverage of last 
years student uprisings in china and of this summers crisis 
highlighted by dan rathers reports from iraq 
while the revamped cbs morning news has remained third in 
ratings rathers cbs evening news has been a respectable 
second to abcs world news tonight for several months 
burke who from the start clamped down on leaks to the press 
from cbs staff members had generally stabilized the news division

work is under way in cooperation with soviet 
officials and economists to develop ruble futures and options 
markets at the chicago mercantile exchange 
as the soviets dismantle their past economic system of rigid 
controls and move toward a market driven economy it is imperative 
that their monetary unit become an accepted world currency said 
leo melamed executive committee chairman of the merc where 
trading of foreign currency futures had its inception in 1972 he 
made the announcement wednesday 
melamed considered a pioneer in currency futures said he 
expects the exchange will begin trading in the ruble late in 1991 
the big question is how fast the russians move to 
convertibility melamed said it hinges on that 
western economists say the ruble cannot become truly convertible 
to other currencies until the soviet union establishes a market 
pricing system for all its goods and allows free crossborder 
trade they also say it is not possible to have a convertible 
currency in a controlled market 
also the currency doesnt circulate outside the soviet union 
over the years soviet businesses wanting to trade with western 
companies have had to trade rubles with the soviet government for 
western currencies while this has loosened up somewhat under 
gorbachev the rate of exchange is still set by soviet officials 
earlier this month the soviet council of ministers or cabinet 
said it would let some businesses and organizations trade rubles 
for foreign currency at market rates beginning at the first of the 
year the rate would be established by banks currency auctions and 
other operations 
while the mercs move into ruble futures could pay off if a 
sizeable demand develops for the soviet currency the comparatively 
low level of trade between the soviet union and most western 
countries raises questions on the need for a futures market 
douglas lamont senior lecturer in international business at 
kellogg graduate school of business at northwestern university 
said 
the establishment of a ruble futures market is probably more 
for public relations than it is for sound business reasons he 
said 
but lamont conceded that the merc will be in a good position if 
the soviets move rapidly in making its economy more compatible with 
other nations

commodity futures trading commission filed separate administrative 
actions against stotler and co 
a goverment securities subsidiary of stotler group inc the 
firm that karsten cash mahlmann was in charge of until early

minimum net capital requirements for months 
in the cftc action stotler and co which has closed down 
because of a capital shortage agreed to having its license revoked 
and to cooperate with a cftc investigation 
previously the cftc filed civil fraud charges against a related 
company stotler funds inc a commodity pool operator 
mahlmann resigned first as head of stotler group and then chief 
of the cbot the worlds largest futures exchange on aug 1 one 
day after the cftc charged stotlers commodity pool subsidiary with 
misusing customer money 
mahlmann 52 who says he hasnt been involved in the daytoday 
operations of stotler group since 1988 was not accused of 
wrongdoing by either the sec or the cftc 
no spokesmen for mahlmann or stotler group could be reached for 
comment wednesday a woman answering the telephone in the groups

metropolitan property amp casualty insurance 
co is asking workers to retire but its general counsel says a 
report that the company wants 80 percent of its work force to leave 
was exaggerated 
in no way would there be an 80 percent reduction in our work 
force vice president richard w berstein said today reacting to 
a story in the providence journalbulletin that the company wanted 
475 of its 670 workers to leave 
berstein said incentives were being offered to 475 workers but 
based on experience at other companies metropolitan expected no 
more than 100 to take advantage of that 
if any more than that decided to leave we would have to 
replace employees he said 
in a statement wednesday the company an affiliate of 
metropolitan life insurance co blamed the move on a weak 
insurance market we just want to make sure that we keep our 
expenses in line so that we have competitive rates berstein said 
clerical and salaried workers are being offered incentives of 
from 12 top 65 weeks pay depending on seniority to quit said 
brendan houlihan senior director for human resources 
if they do not accept by sept 19 they may face an 
involuntary layoff program later in the year houlihan said 
company president theodore j rupley said in a statement the 
drastic move was the only way to keep the company healthy 
carol young the journals metro managing editor said the paper 
drew its conclusion from incomplete information 
the company did not tell us yesterday what percentage it 
expected to take the incentives she said and we drew the 
conclusion that up to 80 percent could do it 
besides those in warwick about 25 of the companys information 
system workers in new york also will be affected houlihan said

possibly misrepresenting the condition and source of the parts it 
sold to airlines aircraft operators and other aviation vendors

spokesman bob raynesford 
fbi spokesman max geiman would not disclose what touched off the

helfand said that the companys faacertified parts repair shop 
remains licensed and open and that the faa advised us that 
everythings fine he said the faa had the option to close kc

charles keating jr the key figure in the 
lincoln savings scandal must prove he is broke and was ordered not 
to send any money out of the country a judge ruled 
keating also must give 48 hours notice before spending more than 
5000 us district judge stephen v wilson said wednesday 
the federal office of thrift supervision sought the action as 
part of an effort to recover 409 million from keating and five 
associates in connection with three soured business deals at 
lincoln 
its an absolute victory for the american taxpayers said 
william fulwider ots spokesman 
the ruling would help recover taxpayerinsured money allegedly 
misspent at the thrifts and there would be more such efforts he 
predicted 
the ruling was one of two court losses for keating in 
washington today us district court judge stanley sporkin 
dismissing keatings lawsuit to recover control of lincoln savings 
the judge said actions by keating and his cohorts amounted to a 
looting of lincoln 
both lincoln savings and keating have become emblems of the sampl 
debacle regulators say lincolns failure may cost taxpayers 2 
billion keating whose personal style was lavish steered lincoln 
into speculative real estate deals and junk bonds 
keating controlled irvinebased lincoln through his american 
continental corp in phoenix accs spokesman bradley boland said 
keating is broke had never transferred money overseas and is 
being made a scapegoat for bungling government officials who 
created the thrift crisis themselves 
the case is part of a sixyear attempt to take a piece of mr 
keating boland charged after wilsons decision the government 
is not going to give charlie any breaks theyre vicious vicious 
people here 
the ots said keating had failed to comply with its 
administrative order and had asked the court to enforce it 
negotiations between attoneys for the two sides had broken down 
forcing the case into wilsons court 
keatings attorney jeffrey powell said wilsons ruling would 
be appealed at powells request another hearing was scheduled 
aug 31 although wilson said he did not see how his order would 
change 
if the ruling stands keating must give the ots an audited 
financial statement to prove his contention that he is broke and 
has never transferred money out of the country 
if he does not he can be found in contempt 
given the amount of funds he was drawing out of lincoln its 
hard to imagine its all gone said carolyn lieberman the senior 
counsel for the ots 
its also quite possible that given his travel to switzerland 
and the bahamas during the last few years that he opened accounts 
there she said

zapata corp announced thursday it has reached an 
agreement to sell a 90 percent interest in its drilling rig fleet 
to a european group for about 280 million 
the houstonbased drilling rig company also said it has reached 
an agreement in principle with its bank lenders to restructure 
about 560 million of senior secured debt 
a cash tender offer for the companys subordinated debt will be 
the final step in zapatas restructuring the company said 
i am very encouraged by the progress we have made but we 
still have a third essential step bondholder acceptance of our 
tender offer to complete zapata chairman and chief executive 
officer rc lassiter said in a statement 
if the tender offer fails it is likely that the company will 
be forced to file for protection under the bankruptcy laws in this 
case the value received by everyone involved would likely be 
considerably less than the value that would be received through 
voluntary restructuring lassiter said 
the cash tender offer will be made within the next few months 
he said 
zapata spokesman barney white said the fleet would be sold to a 
group of european investors who were forming a new company 
specifically for the purchase he would not name the principals 
lassiter said negotiations of specific terms relating to the 
sale were proceeding and a final agreement was expected within 
days 
zapatas 10 percent equity in the fleet and a continuing 
management role will ensure that our current contract commitments 
and our valued customer relations will not suffer any 
interruptions he said 
besides operating the rig fleet zapata produces oil and natural 
gas and has commercial menhaden fishing operations that produce 
fish meal and edible oil 
zapata also is the largest shareholder in zapata gulf marine 
corp the worlds leading operator of marine service vessels 
under its restructuring deal approximately 560 million in debt 
would be reduced to 115 million with banks receiving at least 160 
million in cash and 80 percent of the companys common stock 
including shares already owned by the banks 
zapatas senior lenders hold liens on all the companys assets 
so most of the proceeds from the rig sale will be used to repay 
536 million of rig debt and then restructure the companys senior 
bank indebtedness lassiter said 
despite recent developments in the middle east the 
fundamentals of the market for offshore drilling services remain 
unchanged in addition the companys marine protein division is 
experiencing another very disappointing year with its performance 
well below our expectations lassiter said 
it is time for zapata to take decisive action to resolve its 
debt situation he said

the soybean futures complex fought off a surprise 
revision of a government report on soybean oil stocks thursday and 
closed higher on the chicago board of trade the grains also 
advanced 
the census bureau reported early in the session that the stocks 
of soyoil and meal are far below all trade expectations the 
futures market responded with a higher opening 
but at midday the data for soybean oil stocks was revised and 
put at 1420 billion pounds well above the early figure of 1203 
billion pounds 
the market tried to sell off at midday when the figures were 
revised but was met with very strong buying said william 
biedermann research director of allendale inc in suburban crystal 
lake 
he said the selloff probably failed because the nations grain 
stocks are unusually tight further grain traders appear to be 
taking increasing note of the potential for war in the mideast 
at the close wheat was cent to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 283 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 5 cents higher with september at 258 a bushel oats

midaugust vehicle sales by the nations major 
automakers fell 47 percent from the same period last year 
although general motors corp and ford motor co reported strong 
truck sales thursday 
the figures indicated no dramatic effect on sales due to rising 
gasoline prices spurred by tension in the mideast it was the first 
full vehicle sales period since iraq invaded oilrich kuwait on 
aug 2 
the big three automakers gm ford and chrylser corp said 
their cars and trucks sold at an average daily rate of 32674 
during the aug 1120 period compared with a daily rate of 34290 
during the same time last year 
car sales fell 10 percent while truck sales rose 51 percent 
based on strong sales of gm and ford vehicles trucks as a class 
are less fuel efficient than cars and a rise in the truck sales 
figures indicates consumers did not shy away from gas gulpers in 
favor of gas sippers 
sales of cars made by the big three tumbled 173 percent while 
sales of north americanmade cars bearing japanese nameplates rose 
451 percent 
transplants and trucks theyre the only real action said 
economist tom webb of the national automobile dealers association 
in mclean va 
but considering all the negatives out there stagnant growth 
declining employment rising energy prices and international 
tension i expected much worse he said 
ford spokesman joel pitcoff said the company recorded big jumps 
in sales of all segments in the truck market especially in 
fullsize pickups and the new explorer sportutility vehicle 
terry sullivan of gm said most of the growth in his companys 
truck sales is coming from minivans particularly its new apv line 
of minivans sold through chevrolet pontiac and oldsmobile dealers 
this is a continuation of whats been happening all year 
long he said its our secondbest truck year in history 
behind 1988 
chrysler was the only one of the big three to report declines in 
both car and truck sales during the 10day period 
during the midaugust period last year automakers enhanced 
their incentives in an effort to clear out unsold 1989 model cars 
to make way for the 1990 models at that time there were about 65 
selling days worth of new cars on us dealer lots 
this year there are about 55 days worth of unsold cars at 
dealerships making the need for incentives less acute 
for the entire year big three car and truck sales were running 
7 percent behind last years pace with car sales down 103 percent 
and truck sales off 17 percent 
ford said a sharp 194 percent rise in its light truck sales 
combined with an equally sharp 229 percent drop in car sales for a 
78 percent decline in vehicle sales during the period 
for the year fords vehicle sales were running 81 percent 
behind last years pace with car sales down 131 percent and truck 
sales down 03 percent 
gm said its midaugust vehicle sales were down 61 percent this 
year as a 13 percent rise in truck sales was offset by a 101 
percent decline in car sales 
for the year gms car sales were down 61 percent and truck 
sales were up 17 percent combining for a 35 percent decline in 
vehicle sales 
for the midaugust period chryslers car sales were running 
273 percent behind last years pace while sales of its trucks 
which include profitable minivans and jeeps were down 95 percent 
for a combined 195 percent drop in vehicle sales 
through aug 20 of this year chryslers vehicle sales were 
running 14 percent behind last years pace with car sales down 186

that higher oil prices will lead to more inflation in an already 
shaky us economy

invasion as the elimination of 4 million barrels daily of iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil from world markets tightens world supplies

it was an unusually large weekly increase and broke the previous 
record total of 40178 billion set a week earlier that figure 
originally was reported as 40448 billion but was revised downward 
by the institute because the overall number of funds declined 
the increase in fund assets in recent weeks reflects a rush by 
investors to put their money into safe interestbearing investments 
because of the economic uncertainty created by the persian gulf 
crisis

unabated as investors kept moving their money out of equities and 
bonds said jacob dreyer the institutes vice president and 
chief economist 
the biggest weekly rise in the funds assets 964 billion in 
the week ended oct 21 1987 came during the stock market 
collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money

general purpose funds rose 240 billion to 14245 billion assets 
of 105 brokerdealer funds increased 267 billion to 16607 
billion and assets of 162 institutional funds rose 115 billion 
to 9948 billion

previous week according to donoghues money fund report a trade 
journal based in holliston mass

the united auto workers union on thursday mulled 
over the first comprehensive contract proposals from two of the 
nations big three automakers and waited for a third on friday 
the union took the proposals from general motors corp and ford 
motor co under advisement and negotiators huddled privately to 
dissect them 
their contents remain a mystery gm issued a statement saying 
only that a proposal for a new threeyear national contract had 
been given to the union ford and the uaw said there would be no 
statements and union members in locals around the country said 
they knew nothing about the details of the proposals 
the chrysler corp proposal was due friday there has been 
speculation that the struggling no 3 automaker would try to break 
from the practice of pattern bargaining in which the uaw 
identifies one of the three companies and negotiates a contract 
then brings it to the other automakers 
but the union is expected to stick with pattern bargaining 
its a pattern agreement uaw president owen bieber said 
flatly after meeting with chrysler negotiators 
the union is expected to identify its target negotiating company 
on tuesday in detroit with speculation centering on gm 
bieber said the proposals from the big three would figure 
heavily in the unions selection of a target company contracts 
covering some 450000 employees expire sept 14 bargaining on new 
national contracts began in midjuly 
chryslers chief negotiator anthony st john has hinted that 
the uaw should consider breaking the pattern with chrysler he has 
said that simply rolling over the current agreement into a new 
threeyear pact would boost its costs by 16 percent and thats too 
much for the company to pay 
chrysler earned 180 million in the second quarter down 47 
percent from a year ago and is expected to lose money in the third 
quarter its cars and trucks were selling at a pace 14 percent 
below last years rate through aug 20 
in my comments this morning i indicated to the union 
leadership that first and foremost chrysler was unique in terms of 
its costcompetitive situation among the big three st john said 
they should have a considerable concern about the short and 
intermediate prospects given our sales activity and given our cost 
structure he said i suggested to them that we had to 
collectively come up with appropriate solutions to help ensure the 
future viability of the company 
there has been speculation that chrysler and the italian 
industrial giant fiat group are holding discussions which may 
involve fiat buying a stake in the us automaker 
neither fiat nor chrysler have commented on details of the 
discussions

the dollar continued its losing streak thursday 
falling broadly to achieve new lows against the german mark and the 
swiss franc and reach its lowest level in nearly nine years against 
the british pound 
gold prices were mostly higher 
once again the dollar succumbed to expectations that the already 
sluggish us economy will be further weakened by fallout from the 
tensions in the middle east 
the dollar finished at a new european closing low of 15478 
german marks down from 15535 marks late wednesday the dollar 
fell further in later new york trading declining to 15445 marks 
from 15575 late wednesday 
the dollars previous lowest close against the mark had been 
15485 marks reached just last friday in europe 
some west german dealers said they doubted the dollar would go 
below 15400 marks after touching that level during trading on 
thursday i think the dollar is finished for the time being at 
15400 after it tested that level several times during the 
afternoon but didnt manage to break through said wolfgang 
grebe currency dealer at credit lyonnais in frankfurt 
but us analysts were pessimistic about the dollar reaching 
bottom anytime soon 
corrective upticks for the dollar are very limited and 
people are viewing even the smallest corrections as selling 
opportunities said pete grant a currency analyst with money 
market services in chicago 
we would look for further declines in the dollar grant said 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait has sent oil and gasoline 
prices sharply higher and economists fear this will worsen the 
united states economic troubles traders believe the federal 
reserve faced with soaring inflation is less likely to nudge us 
interest rates downward to stimulate the sluggish economy 
lower interest rates detract from the dollars value because it 
is unable to compete with currencies of countries with higher rates 
robert hatcher a corporate foreign exchange dealer with 
barclays bank plc in new york said the dollar is likely to fall 
further unless central banks including the federal reserve decide 
the us currency has fallen far enough however there are no 
signs the banks are concerned about the dollars drop 
despite its broad setback thursday the dollar did finish above 
its lows for the day traders said a report that durable goods 
orders rose 29 percent in july was three times larger than 
expected suggesting the economy may not be as weak as expected 
the dollar reached a new closing low against the swiss franc 
dropping in europe to 12598 francs from 12735 late wednesday and

and the cost of oil approached record highs thursday as mounting 
tensions in the 3weekold persian gulf crisis shook world 
financial markets 
trading activity in securities oil and foreign currencies was 
nervous and heavy around the world driven by fears of war between 
iraq and an international force led by the united states 
god only knows what could happen said robert brusca chief 
economist for nikko securities international inc in new york at 
this point nobody wants to take any risk 
the tokyo stock market registered its fourthbiggest drop ever

barrel in march 1980 
this is by far the biggest thing thats ever happened to this 
market since crude sold off from 40 a barrel said brian tagler

growing nervousness gripped world markets thursday the main 
fear is that war could disrupt oil supplies even further worsening 
inflation weakening an already wobbly us economy and prompting 
an exodus from sensitive investments such as stocks 
slow growth prior to the middle east crisis led to hopes the 
government would lower interest to stimulate the economy but 
oildriven inflation fears have erased that chance 
everyone figured were going to war recession is imminent 
interest rates arent coming down and they dont want to own 
stocks said dudley eppel a senior vice president at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp whenever theres uncertainty 
people sell stocks 
a showdown loomed friday over an iraqi order to empty all 
western embassies in occupied kuwait which iraq seized after 
accusing its neighbor of cheating on opec production levels and 
depressing world oil prices iraqi president saddam hussein was 
shown on television with foreign captives 
also reports of a bolstered foreign military presence in saudi 
arabia where the united states has massed its largest military 
buildup since the vietnam war and war preparedness in israel added 
to market tensions

may not be available if there is warfare said warren shimmerlik

cattle futures prices plunged the daily limit on the chicago 
mercantile exchange thursday as concern grew about the 
implications of the mideast crisis 
pork futures also suffered setback particularly bellies which 
were down the limit for the third consecutive day 
on other markets oil futures posted new strong gains gold 
moved ahead slightly and grains and soybeans advanced 
beef is more expensive than pork at the meat counter now making 
cattle much more vulnerable to outside price swings said phil 
stanley a trader at the merc and consultant to adm investor 
services 
economic worries had as much to do with the break in cattle 
prices as anything he said 
inflation or recession would turn shoppers away from highpriced 
beef cuts 
pork futures have been under pressure from the skidding cash hog 
market and thursday was no exception 
its been kind of a free fall for cash hogs said stanley 
noting that theyve lost nearly 350 per hundredweight this week 
a large increase in the number of animals being brought to 
slaughter has severely weakened the cash market 
pork prices were at record high levels earlier this summer but 
have been in a fairly steady decline meanwhile cattle have 
remained fairly level for half a year 
while the relatively high price of beef makes cattle more 
vulnerable pork is not immune stanley noted 
if the stock market falls on its face he said we can 
expect another deep plunge for cattle and hogs 
live cattle settled 75 cent to the limit 150 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in october at 7672 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 57 cent to the limit 150 cents lower with august at 
8895 cents a pound live hogs were 30 cent lower to 20 cent 
higher with october at 4842 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies 
were 158 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with august at 4372 
cents a pound 
the soybean complex resisted a selloff at the chicago board of 
trade after a surprise revision of a government report that made 
important changes in the level of the nations soybean oil stocks 
grain and bean complex prices ended with substantial gains 
the census bureau reported early in the session that the stocks 
of soyoil and meal are far below all trade expectations the 
futures market responded with a higher opening 
but at midday the data for soybean oil stocks was revised and 
put at 1420 billion pounds well above the early figure of 1203 
billion pounds 
the market tried to sell off at midday when the figures were 
revised but was met with very strong buying said william 
biedermann research director of allendale inc in suburban crystal 
lake 
he said the selloff probably failed because the nations grain 
stocks are unusually tight further grain traders appear to be 
taking increasing note of the potential for war in the mideast 
wheat settled cent to 4 cents higher with the september 
contract at 283 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 5 cents higher 
with september at 259 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents 
higher with september at 119 a bushel and soybeans were 11 
cents to 13 cents higher with september at 628 a bushel 
gold futures prices posted only modest gains at the commodity 
exchange in new york despite soaring oil prices 
the december contract has repeatedly touched the 425 level but 
has lacked the punch to break through 
every time it reaches that price it runs into extremely good 
selling said david syphen manager of metal futures for merrill 
lynch capital markets inc in new york it shows a fundamental 
weakness in the market with very very willing sellers at those 
levels 
he said that if the oil market turns around theres going to 
be quite a long slide for gold 
gold settled 1 to 140 higher with the december contract at 
42030 a troy ounce silver was 5 cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with september at 5135 a troy ounce 
there was no letup of the mideast crisis at the new york 
mercantile exchange 
light sweet crude oil settled 71 cents to 150 higher with the 
october contract at 3193 a barrel heating oil was 357 cents to 
6 cents higher with september at 9623 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline was 392 cents to 444 cents higher with september at 
10855 a gallon

florida attorney general bob 
butterworth on thursday sought to open a secret stock settlement 
between times publishing co and a texas billionaire saying it may 
harm the nonprofit poynter institute 
butterworth in a letter to institute president robert j 
haiman said he would take the issue to court unless the institute 
immediately provides details of the settlement which were not made 
public as part of the agreement 
we need numbers we cant go with these broad statements that 
everything is great the attorney general said in an interview 
last week a group led by texas investor robert bass agreed to 
drop a federal lawsuit seeking a better return on its investment in 
times publishing in return for redemption of 3000 shares of 
preferred stock the group owned 
the poynter institute which runs a variety of journalism 
programs uses the stock dividends from times publishing to support 
its operations times publishing runs the st petersburg times 
congressional quarterly florida trend and georgia trend magazines 
it is the stock redemption that butterworth is challenging the 
attorney general was asked in march by the poynter institute to 
intervene in the bass case partly out of concern that redeeming 
the stock would jeopardize the nonprofit journalism schools 
financial viability 
the sparse summary of that settlement provided this office 
and the public includes a statement that all preferred stock 
will in fact now be redeemed or retired butterworth said in 
the letter 
butterworth said that unless trustees agree to provide him with 
more information about how the settlement was structured and who 
made the decisions he could only conclude that the arrangement 
will harm the poynter institute 
without more information he said he would try to open the 
settlement in court 
there is no way i can get out of this lawsuit based on what 
weve been told which isnt enough he said i was asked to 
join the lawsuit to protect the poynter institute and were going 
to do that 
times editor andrew barnes who also serves as poynter institute 
chairman and chief executive officer of times publishing said the 
settlement was careful to assure the poynter institute would be 
enhanced not harmed by any agreement 
we are comfortable as were the poynter institute trustees 
that the settlement is fair and assures significant ongoing 
financial support for the institute he said 
george rahdert the attorney handling the case for the poynter 
institute said he would reply to butterworth soon and hoped to 
meet the attorney generals request 
we have limited flexibility as to what we can do he said 
we want to answer the attorney generals questions 
the secret settlement arose from the bass groups attempt to buy 
the times for 270 million earlier this year the group owned 40 
percent of the voting stock in times publishing but under an 
unusual arrangement got only 57 percent of the dividends 
the partnership known as poynterjamison ventures ltd 
challenged the stock system in us district court the settlement 
last week resulted in dismissal of that suit but butterworth said 
he could continue it to obtain assurances of the poynter 
institutes financial health 
we are not going to bat for the st pete times or any of the 
magazines butterworth said the only entity were going to bat 
for is the poynter institute

tests show that airlines could save hundreds 
of millions of dollars in fuel costs with a new wing design that 
reduces drag from air flowing over a passenger jetliners wings 
nasa said thursday 
a joint governmentindustry flight test program produced results 
that were much better than expected said officials of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the tests were conducted for five months on a boeing 757 on 
which a 22foot wing section had been replaced by a wing surface 
designed to produce a smooth air flow the space agency said if 
the modification had been made along the entire wingspan on both 
sides drag would have been reduced by 10 percent the space agency 
said 
each percent of drag eliminated by the us transport fleet 
would result in an annual fuel savings of 100 million for the 
industry nasa said 
the modified wing section includes millions of tiny 
laserdrilled holes in a titanium skin covered by a flap along the 
leading edge to shield against insects and dirt during takeoffs and 
landings 
the holes create a suction effect that diverts turbulent air 
from the surface of the wing and allows a smoother air flow 
the design resulted from earlier flow tests on military jets 
nasa said a future flight test is being considered that will use 
the system on other wing sections 
the testing is jointly funded by the government and boeing 
commercial airplane group which builds boeing jetliners

the procter amp gamble co and rhonepoulenc 
rorer inc facing an antitrust challenge to a joint marketing 
plan said thursday they cancelled the agreement to avoid a legal 
dispute 
the plan to cooperate in the overthecounter drug market would 
have given pampg which makes the peptobismol stomach remedy 
exclusive rights to sell rorers maalox antacid 
the justice department announced a lawsuit aug 7 challenging 
the arrangement on grounds it would reduce competition and raise 
prices in the stomach remedy market 
randy thurman group president of rpr pharmaceuticals said the 
companies were confident the arrangement would survive us 
department of justice legal challenges 
however we weighed the risks of an extended court process to 
rprs consumer business our employees and our customers and on 
balance chose to terminate the agreement thurman said in a 
statement from rhonepoulencs headquarters in fort washington pa 
thurman said failing to close the agreement with pampg could 
reduce pretax earnings 30 million because of lost revenue from 
inventory transfers 
we are convinced that this alliance would have enhanced the 
level of competition in the us and been of value to consumers 
pampg and rhonepoulenc said in a joint statement 
the agreement announced march 13 had not taken effect pending 
government review 
according to the justice department the 236 million in 
combined sales by pampg and rhonepoulenc in the overthecounter 
stomach remedy market make up 26 percent of the 900 million market 
pampg reported worldwide sales of 24 billion for the year ending 
june 30 rhonepoulenc reported sales of 3 billion

seven opec nations will meet informally 
sunday to discuss the persian gulf crisis that has tightened world 
oil supplies and sent crude prices soaring venezuelas president 
said thursday 
oil ministers from a majority of the 13 nations making up the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to attend the 
talks in vienna the cartels headquarters venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez said in caracas 
perez did not list the nations he said the meeting would not 
require a decision on whether to increase production to make up for 
an international embargo of iraqi and kuwaiti crude because of 
iraqs invasion of its neighbor 
boosting production to account for the decline which amounts to 
about 4 million barrels of crude oil daily has received 
insufficient support among opec members 
but in venezuelas view the meeting could turn into an 
emergency session in which decisions could be made venezuelan 
energy and mines minister celestino armas said 
an opec source who spoke on condition of anonymity said opec 
president sadek boussena the algerian oil minister will be in the 
austrian capital sunday and he will consult with anybody who 
cares to come 
fears of military escalation in the mideast and shortages of oil 
on thursday sent futures prices for light sweet crude up 71 cents 
to 3193 a barrel 
on wednesday crude exceeded 30 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange breaking a threshold that had not been touched 
since november 1985 
in addition to boussena ministers from indonesia nigeria and 
iran were expected to show up for the opec gettogether 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh as saying his trip is a positive response to 
boussenas call for an exchange of views on the current situation 
in the world oil market 
one source said saudi arabia also was likely to attend but 
there was no official confirmation of the report 
boussena made a surprise visit thursday to jiddah saudi arabia 
for talks with hisham nazer the kingdoms oil minister who was 
rebuffed earlier in the week in an attempt to call an emergency 
session of all 13 nations 
nazer along with venezuelas armas had requested the meeting 
to discuss the turbulent situation but opec headquarters issued a 
statement monday saying there was not enough support among the 
others to hold a formal meeting 
it was unclear whether either saudi arabia or venezuela would 
attend anything short of a conference of all the members they were 
reportedly backed in their call for an urgent meeting by qatar the 
united arab emirates and ecuador 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita was quoted by a 
local newspaper in jakarta as saying neither iraq nor kuwait would 
attend the weekend talks 
saudi arabia and venezuela would like opecs approval to boost 
oil production to help meet the shortfall 
nazer said last weekend saudi arabia which produces about a 
quarter of the cartels oil would lift pumping to 2 million 
barrels a day with or without the nod from opec 
without a formal meeting the oil ministers could not authorize 
some countries to overshoot the supply quotas set last month for 
each member 
analysts expect saudi arabia which produces about a quarter of 
opecs oil to follow up on its pledge to increase production its 
cartel quota is 54 million barrels a day 
in caracas the newspaper el national quoted industry sources as 
saying the oil company petroleos de venezuela has received orders 
to boost crude output soon by at least 300000 barrels a day 
analysts expect the south american nation to add as much as a 
half million barrels a day to its opec quota of 19 million barrels 
they say the united arab emirates likely producing about 17 
million barrels a day could reach up to 2 million barrels 
nigeria and libya could each add about 100000 to 200000 
barrels a day to their quotas nigeria has a cap of 16 million 
barrels and libya 12 million barrels 
opec agreed at its midyear meeting last month in geneva to limit 
output to 225 million barrels a day in the final six months of the 
year to try to kick crude prices up to 21 a barrel 
with the gulf crisis the average price of a basket of crudes 
monitored by the group reached 2529 a barrel last week 
the next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled 
until december
