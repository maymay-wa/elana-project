a federal judge friday ordered georgia to stop 
mandatory drug testing for job applicants until he holds another 
hearing on a lawsuit contending the states new drug testing law is 
unconstitutional 
us district judge robert hall granted a request for a 
temporary restraining order that will allow atlanta lawyer ed 
martin to take a job with the state department of human resources 
without undergoing the test 
the lawsuit opposing the drug testing law which took effect 
july 1 was filed by the georgia association of educators martin 
and two teachers the plaintiffs contend the law violates state job 
applicants constitutional guarantee of privacy 
hall scheduled a hearing on a request for a preliminary 
injunction in the case for aug 16 and 17 and ordered testing of 
all state job applicants halted until then 
michael kramer an attorney for the association argued that the 
new law is too sweeping because it requires testing for all state 
job applicants from teachers to maintenance workers 
under the law anyone refusing to submit to the test or testing 
positive for drugs would be banned from public employment for two 
years and their names would be placed on a state list for an 
indefinite period of time 
association attorneys estimated that 1500 applicants have 
submitted to the drug tests since july 1 
martin found the idea of submitting to the test deeply 
offensive kramer said 
kramer also argued that martin who has been offered a legal job 
in the department of human resources office of regulatory 
services which oversees nursing homes posed no risk to the state 
and should not be required to take the test 
the state passed the new law to make a statement kramer 
said they have no evidence there was any need for this 
acrosstheboard testing 
senior assistant attorney general wayne yancey argued that the 
drug testing law is necessary especially for teachers who are 
the frontlines in trying to educate the students and stop use of 
drugs 
we dont need to have the public work force to be the haven 
for all drug users in the state of georgia yancey said 
martin said he was pleased with the judges ruling i couldnt 
see where they had a right to do that to people he said of state 
legislators who approved the law i had to take a stand 
the other two plaintiffs in the atlanta lawsuit are mary smith 
a sixyear teacher who did not teach during the 19891990 school 
year and wants to return to the classroom and richard schmidt who 
has applied for science teaching jobs 
in granting the temporary restraining order hall said a 1989 
ruling by the us supreme court cannot be used to uphold all parts 
of the georgia law 
in that case the high court approved tests for us customs 
service workers after the government contended drug use by workers 
in sensitive jobs could make them likely targets of bribery or 
blackmail

the associated press will accelerate 
implementation of its photostream network and installation of the 
ap leaf picture desks aiming at completing the nationwide program 
by the end of 1991 a year earlier than previously announced 
ap president louis d boccardi said thursday the decision to 
attempt to speed up the installation schedule was made in response 
to encouragement from ap member newspapers to put the news agencys 
new photo system in place as soon as possible 
installations of photostream and the ap leaf picture desks will 
start in september in new york the state in which ap will save the 
most money by switching from landline transmission to satellite 
delivery of pictures 
installations will start in october in other northeastern 
states in february 1991 installations will commence 
simultaneously in the three other divisions of the aps domestic 
photo service southeast central and west 
within each region ap teams will be working in more than one 
state at a time but the general order for installations is 
determined by where the greatest savings can be made to help pay 
for the program 
the original timetable had called for a 28month implementation 
schedule but development of hardware and software has proceeded 
at a pace that indicates we should attempt to accomplish this 
enormous task in 16 months boccardi said 
the pace of progress on the installations will depend on several 
factors including site preparation newsroom training and 
decisions by newspaper executives on how they wish to integrate the 
ap leaf picture desk with their production systems boccardi said 
we anticipate that the pace of installations will grow as ap 
and the members gain familiarity with what happens when the leaf 
desk arrives in the newsroom boccardi said ap expects to make 
30 installations by the end of 1990 and the rest through 1991 
he said that the ap would give its members at least a quarterly 
update on the progress of the installation program 
aps us photo network is divided into four regions with 
headquarters bureaus in new york chicago los angeles and 
washington 
in addition to the landline savings the northeastern region is 
the first to begin conversion because of its proximity to aps 
photo and computer headquarters in new york aps technical center 
in new jersey and leaf systems inc in massachusetts leaf systems 
is the company that produces the ap leaf picture desk 
the new york region states in order of installations are new 
york pennsylvania massachusetts rhode island new jersey maine 
vermont new hampshire and connecticut 
installation will begin simultaneously in the other three 
regions in february 1991 in this general order 
chicago region texas ohio indiana kentucky michigan iowa 
nebraska south dakota north dakota minnesota illinois kansas 
missouri wisconsin arkansas oklahoma colorado and wyoming 
los angeles region california nevada oregon washington 
arizona new mexico idaho montana utah alaska and hawaii 
washington dc region louisiana mississippi tennessee 
alabama georgia florida north carolina west virginia virginia 
south carolina maryland and delaware 
additional photo editors will be hired for the four control 
bureaus to edit and transmit pictures from bureaus and newspapers 
in the states under their jurisdiction additional staff also will 
be hired to install the darkrooms and train member newspaper 
staffs technical training for the ap staff has begun and a member 
training program is being designed in addition ap will set up a 
fulltime help desk to assist members with the changeover 
in the present analog photo network black and white pictures 
are transmitted in about nine minutes and color pictures in 30 
minutes when fully implemented photostream will allow digital 
delivery of black and white pictures in one minute each and color 
pictures in three minutes 
the ap also announced that it would use the ap leaf picture desk 
for its internal photo computer system and would discontinue 
development and marketing of the ap vax picture desk which runs on 
digital equipment corp computers 
the ap leaf picture desk exceeds our expectations in power 
speed and functionality said john reid ap vice president and 
director of communications and technology work on new features 
is proceeding rapidly members attending anpatec saw the 
difference and demonstrated an overwhelming preference for the 
leaf 
if an ap member newspaper does not want an ap leaf picture desk 
it may elect to keep its present photo receiver or accept a 
twominute receiver or it may choose to buy an electronic darkroom 
from another company in which case ap will provide that member 
with a rebate of 47 weekly for five years effective on the date 
the member would have received its ap leaf picture desk 
the present photo receiver will be left in place at sites where 
an ap leaf picture desk is installed 
members receiving an ap leaf picture desk and photostream will 
be assessed a surcharge of between 15 and 80 weekly depending on 
circulation

marlon brandos daughter was served with a 
subpoena in tahiti to testify against her halfbrother who is 
charged with killing her boyfriend authorities said thursday 
it was not immediately clear whether cheyenne brando will return 
to los angeles in time for mondays hearing for 32yearold 
christian brando an american diplomat served the notice to her in 
papeete on wednesday 
miss brando 20 left for french polynesia after refusing to 
testify against her halfbrother who is accused of the may 16 
shooting death of dag drollet at her fathers estate in the santa 
monica mountains 
the case is complicated by reports that authorities in tahiti 
filed a complaint allowing them to question miss brando in the 
killing and that she was forbidden to leave french polynesia for 
the time being 
further clouding the matter is that miss brando is believed to 
hold both american and french passports 
sandi gibbons a spokeswoman for the los angeles county district 
attorneys office said that extradition procedures would be 
unnecessary in any case because miss brando is wanted by los 
angeles authorities as a witness not as a suspect 
drollet the father of miss brandos unborn child was gunned 
down at marlon brandos estate the actor was home at the time of 
the slaying but he was elsewhere in the house and did not see it 
christian brando reportedly told police that drollet died during 
a struggle over a gun 
miss brando a native of the south pacific islands is the 
daughter of brando and his current wife tarita teriipia miss 
teriipia is the tahitian actress who played his love interest in 
the 1962 remake of mutiny on the bounty 
miss brando returned to french polynesia eight months pregnant 
with the child of her slain boyfriend she gave birth and is now in 
a tahitian hospital undergoing treatment for nervous exhaustion 
marlon brando maintains a home in tahiti

hundreds of the worlds endangered plants 
from tiny indonesian orchids to the giant saguaro cactus of 
arizona have found a home in a cluster of governmentrun 
greenhouses where they are nursed back from the brink of extinction 
we keep the noahs ark of the plant world said rob 
pennington superintendent of collections at the us botanic 
gardens 20acre poplar point nursery in southeast washington 
among the 25000 plants that flourish in the nurserys two dozen 
greenhouses on the anacostia river banks are about 3000 rare and 
exotic specimens seized by customs officials at us ports of entry 
the plants were removed from import shipments that violated the 
convention on international trade in endangered species a 
multinational accord that forbids trafficking in a long list of 
endangered plants and animals without strict certification 
diseased plants are destroyed immediately the others are sent 
to 15 government plant rescue stations around the country 
including poplar point where they are nurtured and bred for 
scientific study and display at botanical gardens 
the botanic garden established by congress in 1821 also grows 
plants at poplar point to landscape the capitol and adjacent 
federal buildings and for seasonal floral displays at its 
conservatory a formal greenhouse on the mall at the foot of 
capitol hill 
there are no maneating plants in penningtons collections but 
there are extremely rare specimens of encephalaratos lehmannii 
cyads from the desert region of africa these primitive palmlike 
plants survived the dinosaur era because of their toxic trunk and 
roots for centuries they have poisoned human beings who beat the 
pulp into bread flour 
poplar point also acquired hundreds of javanicum tortipelatum a 
small endangered orchid from indonesia from a growers shipment 
that was confiscated in los angeles they had spent six weeks in 
boxes without light or water pennington said its a miracle that 
many managed to survive 
domestically the greenhouse is the last refuge of a sneeze 
weed that the state of virginia spent 30 years trying to 
eradicate also here is the insectgobbling saracenia oreophila 
plant now nearly extinct in its natural habitat along the carolina 
and gulf coast shores 
poplar point also is salvaging a majestic saguaro cactus of 
arizona once commonplace as a travel poster symbol of the arid 
southwest until it was nearly bulldozed into oblivion by land 
developers 
pennington delights visiting school children with tales about 
his pittosporum boninensis a nondescript shrub thats nearly 
extinct on its native island of chichi jima in the pacific ocean a 
cannibal supposedly lived there at one time 
chichi jima became a footnote in the history books when george 
bush a young navy pilot who later became president ditched his 
crippled plane a few miles offshore after a bombing run against 
japanese forces in world war ii 
i tell the kids that the cannibal used to hide in this 
shrubbery waiting to eat downed pilots and that george bush 
escaped with his life pennington said with a laugh when you 
have a plant this plain and ugly you have to think of something to 
tell them 
pennington 36 a horticulturist trained in plant pathology 
said the biggest threat to the worlds tropical plants comes from 
runaway population growth more and more people means destruction 
of forests and vast amounts of foliage for food housing and 
commercial development 
these plants are endangered because they no longer have a home 
when their environment is removed he said we provide a home 
for wayward plants you might say

like douglas wilder in 1989 and andrew 
young this year abdul alim muhammad is waging an uphill battle for 
political office like them he is black but there is a difference 
there is nothing colorblind about muhammads campaign for 
congress he is the candidate of the nation of islam the 
fundamentalist muslim organization long regarded as a bastion of 
black separatism 
this year for the first time the group headed by louis 
farrakhan is exploring the political mainstream running three 
candidates with its official endorsement 
it is highly likely this is not the last time we are going to 
be involved in electoral politics muhammad said in an interview 
at his storefront campaign headquarters in marylands prince 
georges county just outside washington 
the other two candidates are george cure a legal adviser to the 
nation of islam who is running for the district of columbias 
nonvoting delegate seat in congress and shawn brakeen a 
schoolteacher candidate for the districts school board 
the muslim movement has espoused racial separation since it 
began nearly 60 years ago but muhammad said we have never been 
isolated we believe that where we are dominant in numbers we 
should have a position of leadership that is representative of our 
numbers 
my objective in congress will be to inspire and organize and 
secure resources so that prince georges county will be a 
shining light an example of what highly motivated blacks can do to 
pull themselves up by their own bootstraps so to speak said 
muhammad 
farrakhan has been criticized for making comments offensive to 
jews and other ethnic groups but he said recently that the muslim 
candidates would represent all people regardless of their race 
creed or color 
the emergence of nation of islam candidates comes amid growing 
black prominence in american politics 
wilder the former virginia lieutenant governor became the 
nations first elected black governor last year after successfully 
courting both black and white voters 
young a civil rights leader and former mayor of atlanta 
finished second in georgias democratic gubernatorial primary on 
tuesday and faces a runoff aug 7 against lt gov zell miller 
some black leaders have criticized young for running a colorblind 
campaign in an effort to woo white support in a state where about 
22 percent of the registered voters are black 
muhammad said it was understandable for wilder and young to 
reach out to white voters but he said such crossover 
politicians do not provide the same leadership for the black 
community as would a black leader 
andy young cant win with the black vote in atlanta he 
said he needs some of the rural white vote to win at least some 
of those voters he has to be what is called a crossover candidate 
blacks have to understand that it is possible for blacks to be 
leaders in that sense but they should not expect from this kind of 
crossover politician the kind of thing you would expect from a 
black leader 
doug wilder has become governor of all the people of virginia 
but he should not be mistaken for a black leader who is going to do 
very much to correct the wrongs in the black community he said 
muhammad 42 a surgeon who is farrakhans spokesman is running 
in the sept 11 primary against steny hoyer chairman of the house 
democratic caucus hoyer 50 has represented marylands 5th 
congressional district for four terms and is strongly favored for 
reelection 
the district which includes most of prince georges county is 
about evenly divided between black and white with the black 
population increasing 
as almost all candidates do muhammad said he expects to win 
hoyer however has a strong lead in fundraising having raised 
453000 for his campaign before he announced muhammad has been 
raising funds among blacks in the washington area as well as in 
philadelphia and other cities 
muhammad declined to say how much had been raised but said the 
campaign had been advised it need not file with the federal 
election commission an fec spokesman said a campaign must file 
with the commission if it has raised more than 5000 
although the nation of islam has not previously endorsed 
candidates muhammad said individual members have run from time to 
time on their own 
dr talibkarim muhammad for instance already has announced 
his candidacy for mayor of memphis tenn in an election to be 
held oct 3 1991

last year a healthy 40yearold man died from 
severe dehydration brought on by food poisoning blamed on the eggs 
in a meringue pie 
twentyone guests at a baby shower in new york became ill after 
eating an undercooked pasta dish made with raw eggs 
six people developed the same infection after eating homemade 
ice cream made with eggs in illinois 
the guilty bacteria salmonella enteritidis or se is turning up 
in more and more eggs around the country and beginning to alarm the 
egg industry public health officials agricultural community and 
congress 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations was hearing today what the agriculture department is 
doing to stem its spread 
the world health organization has characterized se as an 
international epidemic said a memo from the panel chaired by 
rep john dingell dmich in the united kingdom where the issue 
of se resulted in the resignation of the minister of health the 
existence of the phase 4 se strain has plagued the european egg 
industry and the health ministries 
this particularly virulent strain has not spread in the united 
states although isolated incidents have been reported in canada 
and health officials here are worried the memo said 
before 1979 only cracked eggs were believed to be likely 
carriers of the bacteria now it is believed that it comes from the 
hens ovaries and can exist in the eggs yolk according to the 
federal centers for disease control 
in 1982 the cdc confronted the first outbreak of 
eggassociated salmonella enteritidis in a restaurant in bostons 
logan airport said the memo from dingells committee 
although the cdc suspected that there may be a problem with 
this littleknown strain of salmonella it was not until 1986 that 
the cdc became convinced that the theory of bacterial transmission 
in an intact egg via the yolk was plausible 
from 1985 through october 1989 a total of 6604 illnesses and 
43 deaths were blamed on the bacteria last year there were 2394 
illnesses and 14 deaths and in the last six months there have been 
450 cases of illness but no deaths according to cdc statistics 
the problem so far has been the worst in the northeastern 
states although it has shown up across the country 
how worried should you be 
cooking expert julia child said its a little like playing 
russian roulette but she protects herself by knowing where her 
eggs are produced 
i eat eggs all the time but im very careful where i buy 
them child said in a telephone interview from her home in 
massachusetts 
her advice to consumers is to make sure their eggs are 
refrigerated from the time they are laid until they are eaten 
if the eggs have been refrigerated the danger is low you will 
have a problem she said advising that consumers leave the eggs 
in the box when they refrigerate them at home the egg containers 
on refrigerator doors dont keep eggs as cold she said 
eggs must be cooked at 140 degrees to kill the salmonella 
according to child thats more heat than is needed for scrambled 
or poached eggs for example 
the very old very young and very sick are the most vulnerable 
to death from the eggborne salmonella 
in pennsylvania six nursing home patients died after eating 
stuffing that contained undercooked eggs said the dingell 
committee memo eleven died and 512 were sickened in a new york 
hospital after being served contaminated eggs from maryland 
the states and united egg producers are seeking action from the 
agriculture department which is looking into the situation along 
with the food and drug administration

profits are good for food vendors and gift 
shops at the national parks and the interior department believes 
the government should get a bigger part of the action 
interior secretary manuel lujan said thursday that in future 
contract talks with park concessionaires he will press for higher 
franchise fees he said uncle sam now gets only about 25 percent 
on average of what customers pay 
lujan told a news conference he also intends to seek other 
changes in the park concession system to provide more competition 
several congressional panels are looking into park concessionaire 
profits and the lack of competition for contracts 
two recent investigations by the interior department concluded 
that park concessionaires are reaping millions of dollars in 
profits while paying in some cases less than 1 percent of gross 
receipts to the federal government 
in 1988 gross receipts of concessionaires were reported at more 
than 500 million of which only 125 million went to the national 
park service 
lujan said he had no quarrel with the quality of park 
concessions in general but he said the government should receive 
more money from concession revenues so parks can be improved 
i dont think we will put any concessionaires in a position of 
losing money but the intent is to cut into the excessive 
profits he said he said the park service will push for higher 
franchise fees as contracts come up for renewal over the next few 
years 
lujan declined to say specifically how much more concessionaires 
should pay saying that would tip his hand in upcoming contract 
negotiations but he noted that he considers yellowstone national 
park where the government collects fees of about 22 percent of 
concession receipts as a model 
financial information from concessionaires has been difficult to 
obtain when the recent interior studies included profit figures at 
specific parks the conference of national park concessioners a 
trade group successfully won a court order barring disclosure of 
the information 
environmentalists called lujans announcement a good first step 
for too long now too many concessionaires have been getting a 
sweetheart deal said paul prichard president of the national 
parks and conservation association 
george frampton president of the wilderness society said that 
while lujan is aiming in the right direction congress should pass 
legislation to open the park concession business to competition 
the wilderness society is considering bidding for concession 
rights at some parks including yosemite national park in 
california but frampton said entry into the business is almost 
impossible because of the advantages given an incumbent 
concessionaire 
under the law concessionaires are given preferential contract 
renewal rights that allow them to match any other bid the 
government also has allowed incumbent concessionaires to value 
their capital improvements at parks artificially high making it 
difficult for a competitor to purchase these facilities 
as a result there has been little competition for concession 
rights although business at some of the parks has been highly 
profitable lujan said that of 29 contract bids that have gone out 
only one has attracted competitive interest 
lujan said he hopes to make the bidding system more competitive 
by seeking shorter contracts redefining what should constitute 
preferential rights and adopting new accounting methods when 
setting values for capital improvements by concessionaires 
in addition the national park service plans to use outside 
consultants to analyze concessionaires financial statements 
appraisals and other documents as part of future contract 
negotiations contract talks traditionally have been conducted by 
local park officials who have little financial background 
while some park concessions continue to be run by small 
companies concessionaires at large parks often are subsidiaries of 
major entertainment conglomerates such as mca inc whose park amp 
curry co subsidiary runs concessions at yosemite

animal rights groups at least one country 
singer and a former beatle have been snapping at meat eaters 
lately but none has bitten down hard on the hot dog 
thats came as something of a surprise considering its 
national hot dog month the industry says and critics might be 
expected to challenge this extravaganza and the 5 billion hot dogs 
consumed by americans each year 
but sara lilygren of the american meat institute a national 
trade association says she has heard no specific protests about 
hot dogs she did however mention some of the general meat 
protests now making the rounds 
hot dogs have not been attacked in any big way that i know 
of lilygren said thursday in a telephone interview but 
theres something about a hot dog thats so allamerican maybe 
thats the reason 
in ames iowa this week paul mccartney stirred resentment 
among many farmers in the big cornbeefandpork state when his 
antimeat sentiments were publicized but the former beatle played 
down his vegetarianism during his concert there wednesday night 
we havent come on this tour to preach against meat he 
said were procorn very procorn 
that didnt stop the marylandbased animal rights group people 
for the ethical treatment of animals from offering concert goers 
tofu not dogs as an alternative to the meat kind 
lilygren noted that canadianborn singer kd lang also has been 
controversial with her meat stinks commercials for peta 
causing some midwest radio stations to ban her albums 
the institute and the national hot dog and sausage council said 
a joint full course hot dog lunch in washington dc recently 
was a howling success 
more than 400 attended including rep kika de la garza 
dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee who 
proclaimed hot dogs to be an american tradition they said 
for those who pursue trivia the hot dog industry also provided 
some background 
frankfurtammain in west germany is traditionally credited 
with inventing the frankfurter in 1484 in the late 1800s hot dogs 
also called dachshund sausages because of their shape gained 
popularity in the united states as they had in europe 
a german butcher in new york city opened the first coney island 
hot dog stand in 1871 hot dogs were sold at the 1893 chicago 
worlds fair and they quickly became standard fare at baseball 
parks 
hot dogs earned their unique name in 1901 at the new york polo 
grounds the report said on a cold april day concessionaire 
harry stevens was losing money with ice cream and cold drinks 
stevens goes the legend sent out for dachshund sausages and 
rolls his vendors began hawking hot dogs from portable hot water 
tanks yelling theyre red hot get your dachshund sausages 
while theyre red hot 
sports cartoonist tad dorgan heard the vendors and drew a 
cartoon of barking dachshund sausages on a roll with the caption 
hot dog the new name stuck

a conservation group says a new survey shows 
most farmers would support changes in federal law that would help 
protect the environment 
officials of the american farmland trust said thursday the 
survey provided strong evidence that farmers are more supportive 
of environmentally sound farming practices than their washington 
lobbyists admit 
the survey results were released as the senate began debate on 
the 1990 farm bill a complex measure that will guide us farm 
programs and policy for the next five years 
in recent months the trust said much of the debate about farm 
bill amendments has centered on alleged farmer resistance to 
changes in federal law that would help clean up the environment 
including reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers 
according to the survey more than 70 percent of about 1000 
farmers interviewed in 22 states were interested in participating 
in a federal costsharing program that would reduce contamination 
of water through the adoption of new farm management practices 
further it said majorities of these farmers approve of 
pesticide and fertilizer use plans that would help farmers 
economize on the use of these materials 
ralph grossi president of the farmland trust a membership 
organization said he gave congressional agriculture committees 
high marks for their efforts to protect wetlands and set the right 
course on water quality planning and flexible cropland use 
but he added i give them very low marks on longterm soil 
protection promotion of environmentally sustainable farming and 
protection of farmland from urban encroachment 
officials said the survey was designed to reflect national 
attitudes it did not show state breakdowns 
the states where the survey was conducted are alabama 
arkansas california georgia iowa illinois indiana kansas 
louisiana michigan minnesota missouri montana north dakota 
nebraska new york ohio oklahoma pennsylvania texas washington

milk prices at the farm declined last winter 
but regained some of their lost ground during the spring an 
agriculture department report said 
however continued substantial growth in milk production and 
reductions in probably swollen user inventories of nonfat dry milk 
likely will limit further advances in milk and dairy product 
prices the report said thursday 
milk production in the second half of 1990 probably will rise 
about 3 percent from a year earlier the report said that would 
raise total 1990 milk output by about 2 percent from last year 
if wholesale prices hold relatively steady the rest of 1990 
analysts said the average price increase for farm milk prices may 
be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for the entire year 
retail prices for dairy products in 1990 may be up an average of 
8 percent to 10 percent from last year the report said

forget bruce willis arnold schwarzenegger and 
tom cruise the new stars of the summer are a spooky spider and a 
bubbly bear 
the megabudget maleoriented films die hard 2 total 
recall and days of thunder have yet to excite moviegoers the 
way last summers batman did 
but the walt disney co hopes its arachnophobia and jungle 
book can find loyal patrons in the crowded summer film season 
theres no way arachnophobia will match batman which 
made 252 million in 1989 the eightlegged drama does have the 
potential though to emerge as one of the seasons sleeper 
successes 
in a campaign littered with hardwareladen projects aimed at 
young males arachnophobia and paramounts ghost two 
modest original works appear to have a good chance of reaching a 
broader audience 
there are signs that a share of the audience is more interested 
in novel nonsequel titles than the more heavily promoted and 
expensive cookiecutter films 
jungle book the 1967 film rereleased last friday by 
disney enjoyed the best opening ever for an animated movie with 
77 million last weekend surpassing the 75 million collected by 
the land before time in its debut weekend in 1988 
on wednesday arachnophobia starring jeff daniels and john 
goodman opened to moderate but unspectacular business of about 
12 million on more than 1200 screens who framed roger 
rabbit by comparison grossed 18 million in its first night on 
999 screens two summers ago 
on tuesday walt disney co president frank wells predicted the 
thriller the first release from disney subsidiary hollywood 
pictures would be one of the seasons biggest hits 
the head of marketing for a competing studio speaking on 
condition that he not be identified said arachnophobia should 
open slowly and build forcefully on strong word of mouth its 
pronounced ahraknahfohbeeyah 
cinemascore which tracks audience reactions to movies said the 
film scored a bplus in surveys of 335 patrons wednesday that places 
it alongside dick tracy but below ghost days of 
thunder and die hard 2 all of which earned an a rating 
among the summer releases that have been savaged by reviewers 
are robocop 2 betsys wedding fire birds the 
adventures of ford fairlane cadillac man quick change 
and ghost dad 
arachnophobia is about the invasion of a small california 
town by a deadly south american spider in ghost a murdered 
mans spirit comes back to protect his lover and solve his own 
slaying 
on monday and tuesday nights ghost quietly made more money 
than bruce willis noisy die hard 2 even though the latter 
film made at an estimated cost of a staggering 62 million was 
playing on more than twice as many screens 
while theres no batman this summer the season now halfway 
finished is hardly fizzling in fact it likely will be the 
secondbest in hollywood history and it easily should exceed the 
1988 holiday season returns of 17 billion 
the business of some of these movies is incredible said tom 
sherak president of domestic distribution and marketing for 20th 
century fox shame on everybody for comparing it to last year 
said barry london president of paramounts motion picture 
group some films depending on who was in them and the kind of 
film they were were coming in with unreasonably high 
expectations 
the trade newspaper daily variety is predicting this summers 
boxoffice take will be about 185 billion compared with the 
recordsetting 1989 summer when moviegoers spent 204 billion 
you cant expect records to be broken every week said john 
krier president of exhibitor relations co inc which tracks 
boxoffice figures but its a good summer

the chairman of the senate republican 
conference says sen dave durenberger is being punished enough for 
ethics violations and he doesnt plan to take any action against 
him 
the gop caucus could strip the 12year senator from minnesota of 
his seniority or choice committee assignments 
he has been examined quite thoroughly here said ed quinlan 
a spokesman for sen john chafee rri it would seem that 
theres no need for another entity to deal with these events 
the senate ethics committee on thursday recommended the full 
senate denounce durenberger for reprehensible financial conduct 
and require him to make up to 124000 in restitution 
the committee said durenberger violated senate rules by 
laundering speaking fees through a book contract and claiming 
reimbursement for staying in a minneapolis condominium in which he 
owned an interest 
the committee referred its findings to the senate republican 
conference as well as the justice department and the federal 
election commission 
the gop conference has no plans to pursue the matter and no 
member has suggested disciplining durenberger quinlan said 
the language in the ethics committee report states that 
there was no criminality that there was no malice demonstrated by 
his behavior that sen durenberger has publicly apologized for his 
judgment and thats where it should lie quinlan said 
chafee who considers durenberger a personal friend contributed 
1000 to durenbergers legal defense fund according to records 
released this week he was the only sitting member of congress to 
do so 
during its secret deliberations the ethics committee rejected a 
proposal to recommend that republicans take away durenbergers 
committee seats including a prized spot on the taxwriting finance 
committee said lois west durenbergers press secretary 
durenberger agreed to reimburse the senate 29050 plus interest 
for payments on his minneapolis condominium and give to charities 
95000 that he received in excess speaking fees less whatever 
taxes he paid on the income 
durenberger has already repaid 11005 in condominium payments 
to which the senate rules committee said he wasnt entitled 
he has paid 212000 in legal fees mostly from his campaign 
treasury and says he still owes about 377000

president bushs chief economic adviser is 
taking out after prophets of declineism who are forecasting 
america is fast becoming a secondrate economic power 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers says he is tired of hearing america is losing its 
competitive edge to countries such as japan or that the country is 
losing control of its economic destiny to foreign investors who are 
buying up america 
the united states has not lost and is not losing its position 
as the worlds leading economic power boskin said thursday in a 
speech to the us chamber of commerce 
the fact is that with less than 5 percent of the worlds 
population we produce 26 percent of the worlds gross national 
product boskin said 
boskin conceded that the country does face problems listing in 
particular the need to shrink the federal budget deficit and 
improve a weak elementary and secondary school system which he 
called an outright disgrace and a ticking time bomb 
but boskin said the united states can muster the political will 
to correct its own problems 
the real challenges facing the american economy are 
significant but this does not mean that the us economy will 
inevitably become secondclass as the prophets of declineism would 
have us believe boskin said in a speech previewing economic 
themes likely to be used by republicans during the fall 
congressional campaigns 
the united states is large and strong indeed preeminent in 
the world its future is neither bleak nor predetermined he 
said our destiny is overwhelmingly in our own hands 
boskin attacked democratic critics who have been pushing for the 
administration to close us markets to foreign goods in 
retaliation for other countries erecting barriers to american 
products he said it is wrongheaded to call for the federal 
government to take a more active role in promoting commercial 
research and development projects normally done by private industry 
this approach sometimes called an industrial policy is modeled 
after the success japans powerful ministry of international trade 
and industry has supposedly achieved in promoting the economic 
interests of japanese businesses 
boskin said proponents of this approach chose to ignore the 
failures of japanese government planners such as their suggestion 
many years ago that sony corp would have more success if it did 
not get into the home electronics field 
boskin also dismissed forecasts that the current economic 
expansion of nearly eight years the longest in peacetime history 
is in imminent danger of ending in a recession 
this expansion can should and most likely will continue for 
some time to come he said the most likely outcome is that 
after a period of a few quarters of slower growth we will see the 
economy pick up the pace in the second half of this year

salvadoran guerrilla leaders are sticking to 
a stance they had when the last peace talks failed that the 
government must purge the army of rights abusers 
the talks scheduled to resume today in san jose costa rica are 
the third round of unmediated negotiations that started in 
venezuela in may 
rebel leaders say they are preparing for a military offensive 
like one in november their largest ever if the new round of talks 
fails to produce results on the issue of the armed forces 
the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
has fought a series of usbacked governments in a 10yearold 
civil war that has claimed some 72000 lives 
there is a sector of the armed forces that must pay the bill 
for so much oppression imposed on the counry guerrilla commander 
schafik handal the chief rebel negotiator said in an interview 
with the associated press at the rebels mexico city office 
this issue of the role of the military was a major sticking 
point in the last round of talks held in mexico in june between the 
rebels and the conservative government of president alfredo 
cristiani 
salvadoran defense minister gen humberto larios said the army 
will handle the hiring and firing in its ranks 
we do not reject the idea of purifying our institution the 
armed forces like any other insitution is subject to evolution to 
improvement larios said in a recent interview but he said we 
are purifying ourselves 
since 1979 troops and death squads linked to them have executed 
about 30000 people suspected of leftist sympathies international 
human rights groups say no officer has been tried or found guilty 
for such crimes 
the us congress the financial underwriter of the salvadoran 
governments war effort plans to tie military aid for 1991 to 
progress made in peace talks and to prosecution of army officers 
responsible for a november massacre of six jesuit priests 
the war could drag on for years if the military is not 
restructured sen christopher dodd dconn said this week adding 
that about 50 highranking army men should be eliminated 
fifty seems to us a low number said handal top guerrilla 
leaders have suggested that 200 officers should be dropped from the 
ranks 
handal said the armys efforts at selfpurification have been so 
ineffectual that rebel leaders are proposing abolishment of the 
institution in a demilitarization process that would also mean 
the disappearance of the guerrilla fighters 
if larios maintains that the army is being constantly 
purified and nevertheless it continues to play the role of 
repressor then its obvious that purification is not enough to 
clean it up it should be abolished flatout which is our 
conclusion handal said 
the costa rican army was abolished in 1949 costa rica is the 
only country in central america that can claim a stable democracy 
throughout recent decades 
the rebels proposes a police force under civilian command to 
maintain law and order after demilitarization the military is dead 
set against the idea and has gotten cristianis backing 
the continued existence of the armed forces is not a subject 
of discussion the president said after last months fiveday 
round of negotiations

noncommunist cambodian guerrillas say 
heavy government shelling has forced them out of a central 
cambodian town that functioned as the capital of the territory they 
control 
guerrillas loyal to prince norodom sihanouk retreated along with 
civilians thursday to the outskirts of the town stoung in kompong 
thom province said spokesman roland eng 
he said government forces had rained artillery and multiple 
rocket launchers for two days and some civilians were hurt 
neither side held stoung today but some guerrillas have 
returned there eng said in a telephone interview from his bangkok 
office 
the guerrillas said they took stoung on april 12 and since used 
it as an administrative and communications base for wide areas of 
the province they have seized 
eng denied a statement from the vietnameseinstalled government 
that it had retaken stoung last sunday 
stoung is only about 95 miles north of the national capital 
phnom penh it was the most populated town under guerrilla control 
with tens of thousands of residents 
sihanouks forces are allied in a guerrilla coalition with the 
communist khmer rouge and the noncommunist fighters of former 
prime minster son sann they are fighting the government vietnam 
installed in phnom penh after invading the country in late 1978 to 
topple a khmer rouge government 
sihanouk said thursday his forces were more determined than ever 
to fight after the us announced a day earlier that it was 
withdrawing recognition of the coalitions seat at the united 
nations 
the us shift was prompted by fears of a return to power of the 
khmer rouge the strongest rebel force while in power from 
197578 hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of a 
radical program to turn the country into an agrarian commune

regional economic growth in the united states 
is shifting away from the bicoastal pattern of the 1980s and 
returning to the sun beltfrost belt split of the 1970s a 
government report indicates 
the commerce department said thursday that personal incomes grew 
fastest in western states and slowest in new england between the 
first quarter of 1989 and the januarymarch period of this year 
by region incomes in the far west grew 85 percent southeast 
72 percent rocky mountain states 71 percent southwest and 
midatlantic states 7 percent plains states 68 percent great 
lakes states 55 percent and new england 52 percent 
eight of the 11 states with fastest income growth were in the 
west while four of the nine states with the slowest growth were in 
new england 
economists who follow regional patterns said thursdays report 
provided evidence that the bicoastal economy of the 1980s in 
which california and the northeast enjoyed more prosperity than the 
nations heartland is over 
we are returning to an economic pattern that we saw 15 to 20 
years ago said economist robert dye of the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa forecasting firm 
growth rates among the top 11 ranged from nevadas 122 percent 
the fastest in the united states to oregon and californias 82 
percent that compares with a national average over the period of 
69 percent 
rates in other states in the top 11 were hawaii 99 percent 
alaska 98 percent washington 96 percent idaho 92 percent 
kansas 89 percent and utah florida and minnesota 84 percent 
the states with the slowest income growth were north dakota 
23 percent south dakota 3 percent new hampshire 36 percent 
montana 4 percent indiana and maine 44 percent massachusetts 
46 percent west virginia 49 percent and rhode island 5 percent 
economist mark zandi of regional financial associates a west 
chester pa consulting firm said a booming casino industry and 
related construction are keeping nevada growing 
growth in the northeast is being fueled by strong lumber 
exports a flood of orders for civilian aircraft to boeing co and 
heavy migration of californians looking for a more affordable place 
to live he said 
meanwhile declines in real estate construction hightech 
companies defense contracting and banking are crimping new 
englands income growth he said 
in new england all the industries that supported the economy 
are in recession he said 
according to the commerce department a rebound in farm income 
helped kansas this year after drought shriveled the states winter 
wheat crop in 1989 
zandi said florida and california were two highgrowth states in 
danger of cooling off 
migration and tourism have been supporting the florida economy 
but when national economic growth softens as it has this year 
fewer people take vacations he said also lackluster real estate 
markets in the northeast make it more difficult for retirees to 
sell their houses and move south he said 
california is at risk because housing is extremely 
unaffordable in most parts of the state crime pollution and 
congestion are all problems that are going to slow migration 
flows he said 
youre probably not going to see a california recession but 
you will see much slower growth zandi said

house democrats are backing away from a 
threatened 231 million cut in the administrations antidrug 
programs following a namecalling exchange with drug policy 
director william j bennett 
the house agreed thursday to restore the proposed cut in fiscal 
1991 drug education and treatment programs as it approved a 170 
billion appropriations bill covering labor health and education 
spending 
the outspoken bennett had denounced congress as cheap 
dishonest and sneaky after the house appropriations committee 
last week approved a bill that contained cuts in president bushs 
requests for drug demandreduction programs 
bush had sought 252 million but the panel approved only 21 
million 
i just resent that rep silvio conte of massachusetts 
ranking republican on the appropriations committee said of 
bennett he didnt just say democrats he said were all a bunch 
of clowns up here 
bill bennett has lost his effectiveness with the congress 
said rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics he has now seen fit to insult the 
congress rather than consult the congress 
the house approved the appropriations bill 35958 after 
defeating a series of amendments that would have cut total spending 
democrats have strongly criticized bennett in the past for not 
putting enough money into and emphasis on treatment and education 
bennetts discovery of the hidden cuts which were never debated 
in public sessions politically embarrassed house democrats 
rep william h natcher dky chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that wrote the bill offered an amendment on the floor 
that restored the cuts 
the amendment was sought by house democratic leaders and 
approved on a voice vote but only after congressmen paraded before 
the podium to attack bennett 
if our drug czar is going to wind up hyperventilating in 
public every time he doesnt get a dollar he wanted then i suggest 
he go back to chain smoking so he can calm down said rep david 
obey dwis 
bennett said later he was pleased the money was restored and 
that the changes represented drug treatment for as many as 100000 
people 
i know democrats are upset i know some republicans are upset 
too and im sorry about the rancor this has caused bennett 
said but we needed this money we were taken completely by 
surprise on these cuts and raising a ruckus seemed the only way to 
get this money back 
appropriations committee members said they had agreed to the 
cuts because much of the money in the programs 1990 budget had not 
yet been spent 
natcher in an interview said only 29 percent of 11 billion 
in block grants to the states for drug treatment had been spent in 
the first 9 months of the current fiscal year 
i dont want to get in any disagreement with bill bennett 
natcher said sometimes you can get a little mad and say things 
you shouldnt bill bennett was mad and im not 
the programs targeted for cuts included a block grant program to 
states to finance drug treatment programs an education department 
program for drug education in the schools and funding for local 
assistance for treatment 
the bill provides 76 billion for the department of labor in 
fiscal 1991 it authorizes 1357 billion for the department of 
health and human services 26 billion for the department of 
education and 1 billion for related agencies 
the total represents a 173 billion increase over 1990 spending 
and a 42 billion increase over the amount requested by bush in 
his proposed 1991 budget

president bush had lots of practical reasons 
to decide to open talks with vietnam about the war in neighboring 
cambodia 
the question now is whether he acted in time 
the khmer rouge which massacred hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians when it ran the southeast asian country from 1975 to 
1978 is advancing toward the capital phnom penh 
the khmer rouge poses a far more serious threat to the cambodian 
people than the provietnam government the united states has been 
trying to upset with millions of dollars of aid to insurgents some 
of it covert 
bushs decision which was urged on him by secretary of state 
james a baker iii means talking to the vietnamese about holding 
multiparty elections in cambodia 
it also may lead to us recognition of vietnam a lowering of a 
15year trade embargo and perhaps a slowdown of the tragic exodus 
of boat people many of these vietnamese economic refugees if 
they survive reach malaysia or hong kong only to be pushed off 
those are some of the practical steps that could follow this 
latest decision by a practical president who won the white house 
disguised as a conservative ideologue but mostly is a politician 
who keeps his ear close to the ground 
another step could be to encourage vietnam which has sent 
troops and advisers back into cambodia after last years pullout 
to step up the pressure on the khmer rouge 
whether bush takes that nervy last step remains to be seen 
but for now at least he has stopped trying to isolate vietnam 
diplomatically even though he isnt ready to normalize relations 
with hanoi or authorize talks with the cambodian government bush 
is no longer shunning the two countries as puppets of moscow 
the policy shift is hardly unprecedented 
bush has switched on taxes he has dropped his suspicions about 
mikhail gorbachev and most of all he has concluded the cold war 
is over and is making military decisions accordingly 
pressure from congress played a part in these turnabouts and 
congress was moving to choke off aid to the cambodian guerrillas 
when the policy shift was hatched last friday at the white house 
but bush and baker his pragmatic adviser also were guided by 
other practical considerations one was successful cooperation with 
the soviet union in other regional disputes the next dividend 
could be an agreement on how to end the 12year war in afghanistan 
the most practical reason of all however was to try to staunch 
the bloodletting in cambodia 
the guerrillas were unable to contain the khmer rouge baker 
said in announcing the policy shift wednesday in front of the us 
embassy in paris the fighting continues he said cambodians 
continue to suffer and cambodians continue to die 
so bush has put aside two decades of us hostility toward hanoi 
and effectively withdrew diplomatic recognition of the rebels 
trying to overthrow prime minister hun sen in phnom penh 
the khmer rouge are by far the most powerful of the three 
guerrilla factions until now the bush administration hoped the 
coalition with the factions headed by prince norodom sihanouk and 
son sann would be able to defeat the cambodian army or at least 
fight it to a draw thereby bringing about elections 
this scenario depended also on the khmer rouge playing a benign 
role in the transition to a new government 
but the history of the khmer rouge provides no evidence of 
restraint or of submission to popular will the massacres they 
conducted in the name of agrarian reform when they ran the country 
matched the worst holocausts of the century 
jeremy stone president of the federation of american 
scientists has been campaigning for the policy shift for a long 
time 
it was probably inevitable he said thursday the one 
question smart guys all over town have been asking the 
administration was what if your coalition wins at some point 
before a khmer rouge victory the state department had to come to 
its senses 
stone is convinced that vietnamese military advisers combined 
with cambodian forces can stop the khmer rouge and he said 
weve got to stop threatening the phnom penh government so it can 
hold the multiparty elections it has already agreed to hold

senate banking committee chairman donald 
riegle says he is giving away the campaign money he got from 
savings and loan interests and will accept no more 
the magnitude of the problems in the sampl industry stemming 
from multiple causes over a 15year period leave a shadow across 
the industry and across any campaign contributions from that 
industry riegle dmich said in a statement thursday 
riegle is one of five senators under investigation by the ethics 
committee for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of 
charles h keating jr former owner of the failed lincoln savings 
and loan the government seized the irvine calif thrift last 
year a move expected to cost taxpayers 2 billion 
riegle said he would give the federal government a check for 
about 120000 it will cover all the money he has received from 
thrift interests except for 78250 from keating and his 
associates which riegle returned in 1988 
he said he no longer will accept contributions from political 
action committees representing any company whose principal business 
is under his panels jurisdiction he also is forswearing donations 
from officers of such companies as well as fundraising events of 
their sponsorship 
riegle said there were no personal conflicts of interest in 
any of these contributions given in past years and that all 
were legal proper and publicly recorded he said he considered 
it appropriate to give his remaining sampl money to the government 
rather than to the original contributors 
in march 1987 keating hosted a fundraiser for riegle at the 
pontchartrain hotel in detroit a year later riegle returned 
78250 given by 77 individuals who listed 13 separate business 
connections after the detroit news disclosed their ties to keating 
the news reported last week that riegle received 7250 from 
individuals associated with silverado banking savings and loan 
association of denver colo in 1987 he visited the thrift and 
met with board members including president bushs son neil 
silverado collapsed a year later and its bailout is expected to 
cost 1 billion 
riegle was reelected to a third term in 1988 he became 
chairman of the banking committee last year 
he has come under fire in michigan for accepting generous 
contributions from the thrift industry while a ranking member of 
the banking committee particularly after the sampl crisis arose 
common cause the selfstyled citizens lobby reported recently 
that riegle was congress secondlargest recipient of sampl donations 
in the 1980s

new technology may give ground telescopes a 
clearer view of the stars than is possible from a repaired hubble 
space telescope and at only a fraction of the cost according to a 
study published today 
horace w babcock the former director of the carnegie 
institution observatories said in the journal science that new 
telescope systems now being developed hold the promise of seeing 
stellar objects as far away as those thought to be visible only by 
a perfectly working hubble 
babcock said the new system uses a mirror that can be warped or 
deformed in a systematic way to compensate for the distortion of 
the atmosphere the process is called adaptive optics 
adaptive telescopes in the infrared will not match the 
resolution of the hst hubble space telescope but in the visible 
they may exceed it babcocks paper said 
babcock said in an interview that even if the new telescope 
concepts fulfill their promise orbiting observatories still are 
needed because the earths atmosphere scatters light in some parts 
of the spectrum such as the ultraviolet only telescopes in space 
above the atmosphere could collect such light he said 
but for visible light he said adaptive optics could allow 
ground telescopes to match or exceed the capabilities of hubble 
these are more than just dreams babcock said 
the european southern observatory in south america already is 
experimenting with adaptive optics and has proven the value of 
these systems in the infrared portion of the spectrum he said 
to adapt the technique for the visible spectrum will require 
more experiments he said but researchers already have proven 
elements of the system 
installing adaptive optics in a new telescope babcock said 
would be only a fraction of the total cost of the hubble he 
said an 8meter telescope could be built at some locations for 
about 40 million 
nasa spent 15 billion to build the space telescope engineers 
learned last month that it is crippled by a mirror that gives an 
outoffocus view of the universe the flaw may be corrected in 
1993 when a new camera is installed 
john manges an optics engineer on the hubble project at nasas 
goddard space flight center said adaptive optics on ground 
telescopes could exceed the clarity of hubble in years to come 
eventually 
even now he said adaptive optics are getting competitive 
with the hubble in the visible region 
but manges pointed out that even with new ground systems an 
orbiting telescope would have an advantage because it would not be 
affected by weather or clouds ground observatories cannot work on 
cloudy nights and some are affected by high winds an orbiting 
telescope also is able to observe in the ultraviolet portion of the 
spectrum which is impossible from the ground he said 
babcock said the adaptive optics system works by using a mirror 
that changes shape rapidly with computer instructions 
when the right instructions are sent to a deformable mirror 
it deviates from flatness in such a way to correct for the 
distortions caused by the atmosphere he said this will 
compensate almost entirely for the distortion 
a telescope with adaptive optics will first focus on a bright 
star and use the twinkling light to establish a pattern the shape 
of the deformable mirror then is changed as needed to compensate 
for the twinkle caused by the atmosphere 
babcock said the optics in effect create a circle of 
compensation through which the telescope could look far into the 
universe 
any faint object if it falls within that circle can be 
observed with very high resolving power he said asked if such a 
telescope could see objects 14 billion light years away which is 
the range expected from a perfectly working hubble babcock said 
there is no reason why it shouldnt work at such a distance

a synthetic protein molecule attaches itself 
tightly to an aids virus in test tube experiments and prevents the 
virus from infecting healthy cells according to a report published 
today 
researchers at harvard said in a study in the journal science 
that the manmade molecule called cpf prevents a molecule on the 
surface of the aids virus from adhering to the immune cells it 
usually attacks 
the cpf very effectively prevents the aids virus from binding 
sticking to a target cell and this inhibits the spread of the 
virus said steven j burakoff a researcher at the danafarber 
cancer institute an affiliate of harvard university 
burakoff said cpf is also very inexpensive and very simple to 
synthesize 
the harvard researchers found cpf while studying the chemistry 
of how the aids virus called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
is able to attach itself to tlymphocytes blood cells that are 
part of the immune system and a principal target of the aids virus 
hiv attacks t cells by using its surface molecule called gp120 
to attach to a molecule called cd4 on the outside wall of a t cell 
in effect the gp120 acts as a key to open the lock on the surface 
of the t cell the virus can then move inside 
a molecule that sticks to the gp120 would in effect prevent 
the key from fitting in the lock on the t cell surface burakoff 
said this he said would keep healthy cells from becoming 
infected 
in laboratory experiments burakoff said the harvard group 
exposed aids virus to cpf and found that the manmade molecule stuck 
so firmly to gp120 that it could not be washed off 
burakoff said the group then exposed an aids virus bound with 
the cpf to healthy t cells the aids virus which would normally 
attack the t cells with ease was unable to cause an infection 
next burakoff said aidsinfected t cells were put in a test 
tube with both healthy t cells and cpf the synthetic molecule he 
said prevented the virus from spreading from the infected t cells 
to the uninfected cells 
we found it to be very very effective said burakoff in 
the test tube anyway the cpf molecules look very interesting 
the researcher said that tests of the molecule in laboratory 
animals are just beginning and that there are many hurdles to go 
over before the compound could be tested in human patients 
another aids researcher dr allen goldstein of the george 
washington university school of medicine in washington said the 
research was very solid but noted theres a long way to go 
before you could translate that into a clinical application 
goldstein said that cpf joins a whole bunch of potential 
antivirals that need to be tested further 
before such a molecule is useful as a drug he said researchers 
will have to show that it is effective in a concentration that the 
body can tolerate and that it affects only the target virus 
it would have a major problem in the body if it will stick to 
lots of other things said goldstein 
burakoff said cpf is composed of two amino acids proline and 
phenylalanine and is a small molecule 
being small there is a reasonable chance that it can be given 
orally he said and the fact that it can be synthesized means 
it can easily be modified to improve it 
the cpf research was a combined effort by burakoffs danafarber 
group and the harvard university department of chemistry science 
magazine is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

the korean peninsula was divided into 
communist north korea and capitalist south korea at the end of 
world war ii in 1945 following is a chronology on relations 
aug 15 1945 korea was liberated from 35 years of japanese 
colonial rule in the postwar politics korea was divided along the 
38th parallel with soviet union troops in the north and us troops 
in the south 
1948 north korea established a communist dictatorship headed by 
kim il sung south korea held elections and established a 
ussupported government headed by syngman rhee 
1950 north korea invaded south korea triggering a bitter 
threeyear civil war an estimated 24 million soldiers and 44 
million civilians were killed or wounded on both sides 
1953 the korean war ended with an armistice and a 25milewide 
demilitarized zone was established dividing the peninsula a peace 
treaty was never signed 
1968 a group of 31 north korean commandos tried unsuccessfully 
to assassinate thenpresident park chunghee the us 
reconnaissance ship pueblo was captured by north korea for 
allegedly sailing into its territorial waters the crew was 
released 11 months later 
1972 the koreas issued a joint statement renouncing hostilities 
and pledging peaceful unification of the peninsula but talks fail

a plan to provide us support for emerging 
eastern european democracies is tangled in a political dispute as 
senate foreign relations committee democrats go forward with an aid 
package despite a republican boycott 
the democratcontrolled panel on thursday voted 100 with all 
nine republican members absent to send the 535 million bill to 
the full senate the measure would give president bush a long menu 
of ideas for advancing economic reform in the former warsaw pact 
nations including technical assistance for the soviet union 
the committees senior republican sen jesse helms of north 
carolina said in a letter to sen claiborne pell dri who 
chairs the panel that the feeling of comity has collapsed 
during work on the east europe aid bill 
helms complained that the measure was being rushed into action 
without time for republicans to review it and his aides said the 
bush administration had an extensive list of concerns about the 
measures overall cost and its specific provisions 
unlike foreign aid legislation passed last year in which us 
help was limited to poland and hungary the measure approved 
thursday makes assistance available to any eastern european country 
that bush believes needs help on its road to democratic and 
economic reform 
the bill makes available 535 million for the programs in the 
year that begins oct 1 well in excess of the 300 million bush 
had sought and an increase from the 489 million already approved 
by the house

felix bloch target of a us spy 
investigation wants to quit the foreign service but the state 
department is trying to decide whether to fire him instead a 
spokesman says 
bloch 55 lost his job in the european affairs bureau in 
february and his 80000ayear pay stopped with his suspension in 
the meantime the justice department looked into suspicions bloch 
gave sensitive information to the soviet union and had been paid by 
moscow 
however law enforcement sources have said the fbi was unable to 
prove that bloch passed along specific classified information 
which is necessary to prove espionage a grand jury meanwhile had 
examined his finances in an attempt to trace any soviet payments 
if bloch is fired he will be branded a violator of us 
national security 
spokesman richard boucher confirming an account in the 
washington times said thursday bloch submitted his resignation on 
july 5 and also withdrew a request for a hearing on the state 
departments attempt to fire him 
the department has informed mr bloch that it will continue 
with the proceedings initiated last february to remove him from the 
foreign service for national security reasons boucher said 
the department will take no action on mr blochs tendered 
resignation pending the outcome of these proceedings 
although bloch was the subject of fbi surveillance for months 
he was never arrested or charged with a crime as a senior foreign 
service officer he would be eligible on retirement to receive up to 
70 percent of his salary or about 56000 a year

the administration suppressed a government 
report that offered ways to reduce significantly the timber job 
losses that would result from protection of the rare northern 
spotted owl two northwest lawmakers say 
reps peter defazio dore and jolene unsoeld dwash said 
thursday the may 1 report was leaked to them by a source in the 
administration 
the white house declined comment a spokesman for interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr said the report was an internal document 
that never was intended for release 
they are just playing partisan politics said the spokesman 
steve goldstein 
the report prepared by the forest service an arm of the 
agriculture department and the bureau of land management part of 
the interior department outlines ways to save as many as 21000 
timber jobs by among other things adding new restrictions on log 
exports and boosting spending on forest service programs defazio 
said 
he said it was prepared for release at the same time the two 
agencies projected that one controversial plan to save the owl 
would cut timber harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent and 
cost the region more than 28000 jobs by the end of the decade

the foreign minister of liberia and other 
prominent liberians say their president will soon resign and leave 
the country and asked for a temporary us peacekeeping force in 
the war torn nation 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the department received the appeal and may respond in some way 
today 
foreign minister j rudolph johnson washington ambassador 
eugenia wordsworthstevenson and eight other liberians wrote 
president bush thursday that they expect the resignation and 
departure from liberia of president samuel doe and the 
establishment of an interim government 
the letter proposed that a limited us force be provided on 
the invitation of that interim government to play an initial 
peacekeeping role in the vicinity of monrovia the capital now 
under siege by rebel forces 
the appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of 
doe would be carried out while agreeing not to seek reelection 
the president has refused to leave the country and is sitting out 
the approach of rebel forces in his heavily fortified residence in 
monrovia 
the state department said the letter was being studied by its 
task force monitoring the crisis in the african nation founded by 
freed american slaves 150 years ago 
the letter and its signatures were regarded as authentic the 
us official said 
us warships with marine units embarked were moved close to 
liberia several weeks ago 
ambassador wordsworthstevenson and former liberian un 
ambassador winston a tubman listed as a press spokesman did not 
answer their telephones thursday night 
without foreign peacekeepers victory by any faction will 
not end the civil war and is far more likely to trigger a more 
violent ethnicbased bloodbath the letter said 
this is because the war has spawned rival armed factions now 
threatening the capital has inflamed tribal animosities and 
endangered the whole country as never before it said 
liberians are now at the mercy of advancing bands of 
foreignarmed combatants each with its own agenda and none capable 
of averting massive plunder and tribal revenge the letter added 
not naming the arms providers 
because of its moral authority in liberia going back to the 
countrys founding the united states is uniquely positioned 
with minimum risk manpower and expense to halt the breakdown of 
law and order in liberia and prevent even worse carnage the 
letter said 
neighboring african states can thereafter play as it is 
intended they should a more sustained peacekeeping role it 
added 
this crucial help would not be viewed as colonial paternalism 
mr president the appeal said it would be welcomed by all 
liberians as the generous assistance of the same friend that 
helped create liberia nearly a centuryandahalf ago and has been 
our constitutional ideal ever since 
hopes for reform have turned to dust under doe who took 
power in a 1980 coup the letter said the rebels accuse his 
government of corruption mismanagement and widespread abuse of 
human rights 
other signers of the letter were tubman former armed forces 
chief george toe washington former customs commissioner george 
toukolon former post and telecommunications minister abdulai 
vandi former commerce minister a romeo horton senator hilary f 
gbunblee former justice minister lawrence a morgan and winifred 
massaqquoi former student adviser at the liberian embassy in

a newspaper cannot be held liable for 
breaking a promise of confidentiality to a source minnesotas 
highest court ruled today in rejecting a 700000 award against the 
states two biggest daily papers 
lawyers for both sides agreed the 42 ruling by the state 
supreme court has farreaching implications for the nations news 
organizations 
the court rejected a jurys award of 200000 in compensatory 
damages and 500000 in punitive damages to dan cohen 
cohen had sued the saint paul pioneer press and the star tribune 
of minneapolis for 1982 stories identifying him as the source of 
documents showing a democratic candidate for lieutenant governor 
had been convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier 
cohen then a republican gubernatorial candidates consultant 
had given the newspapers reporters the information in return for 
assurances of confidentiality but the newspapers editors 
overruled the reporters believing readers should know the 
information came from the gop candidates campaign 
the supreme court today upheld an appeals courts dismissal of 
cohens claim of fraudulent misrepresentation but reversed that 
courts ruling allowing him to claim breach of contract 
to impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an 
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship 
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that 
ethical relationship associate justice john simonett wrote 
the court also said enforcement of the promise of 
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract 
where none exists would violate the newspapers first amendment 
rights 
the case involved the classic first amendment context of a 
political source involved in a political campaign the majority 
wrote 
its a very important case one with farreaching 
implications said cohens lawyer elliot rothenberg the issue 
is to what extent do newspapers and the media have a 
constitutional right to violate promises to which everyone else in 
society would be held liable 
rothenberg said he would appeal to the us supreme court 
the associated press filed the only friendofthecourt brief in 
the case louise sommers an attorney for the ap called the ruling 
a major victory for the news media 
cohens victory at trial had produced a spate of similar 
lawsuits around the country the aps attorneys said 
todays ruling is the first definitive opinion by a supreme 
court of a state directly addressing the issues in cohens case 
said dick winfield another attorney for the ap he said the media 
can take considerable comfort in the decision 
cohen was doing public relations work for 1982 gubernatorial 
candidate wheelock whitney when he gave reporters documents showing 
that marlene johnson a candidate for lieutenant governor was 
convicted of shoplifting in 1970 
johnsons conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence she 
was elected as democratic gov rudy perpichs running mate in 1982 
was reelected in 1986 and is running with perpich this year 
editors at the newspapers testified that they believed the 
public had a right to know the information about johnsons past 
came from the whitney campaign 
reporters for the ap and wccotv also promised cohen anonymity 
and received the documents the ap published the story and honored 
its promise the tv station did not run the story 
in rejecting cohens argument that he had a contract with the 
newspapers the supreme court said we are not persuaded that in 
the special milieu of media newsgathering a source and a reporter 
ordinarily believe they are engaged in making a legally binding 
contract 
the parties understand that the reporters promise of 
anonymity is given as a moral commitment but a moral obligation 
alone will not support a contract the court said 
the court said it had to balance the constitutional rights of a 
free press against the commonlaw interest of protecting a promise 
of anonymity 
the potentiality for civil damages for promises made in this 
context chills public debate a debate which cohen willingly 
entered albeit hoping to do so on his own terms the court said 
in this context and considering the nature of the political 
story involved it seems to us that the law best leaves the parties 
here to their trust in each other 
in a dissent associate justice lawrence yetka said the result 
of the ruling was to carve out yet another special privilege in 
favor of the press that is denied other citizens 
associate justice glenn kelley who also dissented said the 
decision serves to inhibit rather than to promote the objectives 
of the first amendment by drying up potential sources of 
information on public matters 
saint paul pioneer press attorney paul hannah said the court 
recognized the difficulties editors and reporters face in making 
decisions about what voters are going to know about the candidates 
and campaigns 
star tribune executive editor joel r kramer said the newspaper 
was especially pleased that the court has ruled that the decision 
to publish true facts relating to the activities of a political 
source in a political campaign is one that is protected by the 
first amendment

united flight 232 survivors wandered 
pensively about the runway where a year ago their crippled jumbo 
jet cartwheeled in flames killing 112 of 296 people aboard 
i want to see it without bodies and luggage and airplane parts 
strewn all over brad bayless of littleton colo said during a 
reunion of survivors and victims relatives on the crash 
anniversary thursday 
little evidence of the crash remains the cornfield where the 
wreckage came to rest is now planted in soybeans the torn runway 
has been patched and pieces of the shattered united air lines dc10 
are locked away in a hangar 
bayless and other survivors walked around the crash site and 
into another cornfield where they picked tassels as reminders 
at first i thought oh no they took away the corn because 
they didnt want me to see it to remember but they explained it 
was normal crop rotation said bayless wife sharon the couple 
suffered minor injuries in the crash 
organizers of the reunion said 104 of the 184 people who 
survived the crash returned for the gathering 
i wanted my boys to know that sioux city is a place where 
normal things happen that its a place of mending as well as 
catastrophe said brownell bailey of bowmar colo baileys 
wife francie died in the crash 
mrs bayless said i have a lot of memories of some pretty 
gruesome things and we both feel guilty that we walked away 
unharmed while so many others didnt i knew it would be hard to 
come back 
but i realized i needed to feel some things that i have kept 
under the surface over the last year feelings like was i really 
here 
at a memorial service timed to coincide with the moment the 
plane crashed people huddled in a hangar at the sioux gateway 
airport to get out of heavy rain 
many cried quietly as the rev gregory clapper a united 
methodist minister led the survivors and families of victims in 
part of the 23rd psalm some survivors described feelings of guilt 
when national guard jets roared off to form a missing man 
formation some put their hands over their ears and held their 
fists to their mouths 
they gave a standing ovation to capt al c haynes the pilot 
who guided the crippled plane to the airport haynes voice cracked 
as he addressed the group 
its been an emotional roller coaster for all of us but even 
so the remembering has been an important part of the healing 
process he said but somehow we must find a way to take them 
memories away from our present and make them part of the past 
pilots have marveled that haynes got the jet even close to an 
emergency landing after an engine shattered and severed the 
hydraulic lines used to control the plane 
lori michaelson used the reunion to call on congress to require 
child restraints on airliners currently small children may sit on 
their parents laps 
lets have something positive come out of this crash said 
ms michaelson whose 11monthold daughter sabrina was torn from 
her grasp in the crash a passenger heard the babys cries and 
pulled her from the wreckage

the new nixon library and birthplace 
is open today for the people of his hometown and everyone else 
curious about the successes and failures of the first president to 
resign his office 
it requires only 395 for adults and children can get in free 
to examine subjects ranging from richard nixons triumph in china 
to aspects of the watergate scandal that forced the 37th president 
from office 
president bush and former presidents ford and reagan were among 
guests at thursdays dedication of the library 
bush gave advice to those who visit the museum which chronicles 
nixons career from his first run for congress through his 
resignation and his postwhite house life 
look at richard nixon the man said bush he was an author 
he worked in the most pragmatic of arenas yet insisted that 
politics is poetry not prose he believed in love of country 
and in god in loyalty to friends and protecting loved ones 
fifty thousand spectators turned out for the dedication 
according to police estimates and the count from metal detectors at 
the library 
the 21 million library was built with private funds and will 
receive no federal funds to operate many donors attended a fancy 
blacktie party thursday night in los angeles wrapping up the 
celebration 
those guests arriving at the front door of the century plaza 
hotel were confronted by several hundred demonstrators espousing 
causes as varied as prochoice in abortion to aids research and the 
war in el salvador 
fourteen demonstrators were arrested 
guests were carefully screened and those without invitations 
were turned away that included reporters who have never been 
favorites of nixon and his supporters 
much has been written and said about richard nixon some has 
even been true ronald reagan said in his speech at the 
dedication journalists historians political pundits and just 
plain folks will talk for decades about his career and what it 
meant to our country and the world 
it will come as no surprise to anyone here that there will 
always be a good deal of debate about richard nixon 
gerald ford got a laugh from the crowd by turning to each of 
the men who have occupied the oval office and saying mr 
president mr president mr president 
he said nixon was proof that you can come home again 
the only living former president who was not there was jimmy 
carter who also is the only democrat in the bunch he sent regrets 
the word watergate was mentioned only once and that was by 
bush in passing bush called watergate the seventh crisis a 
reference to six crises the first of nixons eight books 
mr president you worked with every fiber of your being to 
help achieve a generation of peace bush told nixon today 
as the movement toward democracy sweeps our globe you can take 
great pride that history will say of you here was a true 
architect of peace 
for nixon the dedication was a triumphant day one widely 
regarded as a milestone in his 16year effort to overcome the 
disgrace of the watergate scandal in which burglars broke into the 
democratic headquarters spurring a white house cover up 
over the past years pat and i have had the opportunity to 
visit some wonderful places nixon told the crowd but nothing 
we have ever seen matches this moment to be welcomed home again 
so warmly on this day by our friends in california

the chairman of the state republican 
party dismissed democratic calls for sen dave durenberger to 
resign now that a senate committee has recommended that the full 
senate denounce him 
other state republicans agreed but said its too early to tell 
how much the senators chances of reelection in 1994 have been 
hurt 
the senate ethics committee said thursday that durenberger 
violated senate rules by laundering speaking fees through a book 
contract and claiming reimbursement for staying in a minneapolis 
condominium in which he owned an interest 
the panel recommended the full senate denounce durenberger for 
reprehensible financial conduct and require him to make 
restitution 
state gop chairman bob weinholzer said most callers to party 
headquarters supported durenberger 
there have been a few callers who said they think he should 
resign but that was the minority weinholzer said 
lois west durenbergers press secretary said most people who 
called the senators washington office also were supportive 
were getting a lot of calls of support and a few who say 
things like get out of town west said but they are 
overwhelmingly supportive 
democratic senate candidate paul wellstone said denouncement by 
ones colleagues is a real disgrace that would make it 
difficult for durenberger to be an effective lawmaker 
the people back here in minnesota should figure in 
somewhere wellstone said what makes sense is for dave 
durenberger to resign and the governor to appoint a caretaker 
senator and for us to have an election in november and if 
durenberger wants to run again he should 
in washington republican sen rudy boschwitz said he hopes that 
we are close to the point where david can put these mistakes 
behind him and get back to being the strong effective senator for 
minnesota that he has been for the past 11 years 
weinholzer said calls for durenbergers resignation were 
nonsense 
some of these charges already were known to the electorate in 
1988 when durenberger won reelection to a 6year term he said 
if he were to resign now he would be disenfranchising those 
voters 
if durenberger were to step aside and then win reelection this 
november he would lose the seniority he earned during nearly 12 
years in the senate weinholzer said

mongolia said today that us secretary of state 
james baker will pay a visit next month becoming the first 
highlevel american envoy to do so since the two countries 
established diplomatic relations in 1987 
among other things baker will sign an agreement for american 
peace corps volunteers to work in the remote sovietbloc nation 
said tepbishiin chimeddorg spokesman for mongolias foreign 
ministry 
his announcement made at a news conference in the mongolian 
capital of ulan bator was reported by chinas official xinhua news 
agency 
chimeddorg said baker will visit from aug 25 he will sign an 
agreement on consular affairs and discuss a range of political 
economic and trade matters with mongolian leaders the spokesman 
said 
the state department already had announced that baker will 
attend a july 30 meeting in singapore on pacific economic 
cooperation and will meet soviet foreign minister eduard 
schevardnadze in the soviet city of irkutsk on aug 1 irkutsk is 
in siberia about 140 miles north of mongolia 
it appeared that baker would not stop in beijing 
the chinese capital is a main gateway to ulan bator and it 
normally would have been natural for baker to spend a day in 
beijing en route north however the united states still has not 
announced a resumption of highlevel visits to china halted since 
china used the army to crush the nations prodemocracy movement in 
june 1989 
chinas foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said last week 
he had no information on any plans by baker to visit 
mongolia the worlds secondoldest communist nation has 
undergone dramatic political changes in the past year spurred by 
reforms in the soviet union and eastern europe young urban 
mongolians began street protests last winter that led to the 
resignation of top communist party and government leaders 
the party voted to allow opposition parties after seven decades 
of monopoly rule and to separate its functions from those of the 
government the first multiparty elections in mongolian history are 
scheduled for july 29 primaries are to be held sunday 
the united states joined the six other leading industrialized 
democracies at the houston summit this month in welcoming movement 
toward greater political openness in mongolia

the government today proposed legislation to 
abolish flogging as a means of punishing male criminals 
the proposal will be debated by the lawmaking legislative 
council in october and the government said it hoped flogging would 
be abolished this year 
the punishment administered with a light cane was introduced 
in hong kong in the heyday of the british empire its use has 
declined in recent years hong kong courts ordered only two 
floggings last year compared with 476 in 1952 officials said 
under existing laws only men can be flogged the number of 
strokes range from 18 for offenders age 17 or older to six for 
offenders under 14 
a court can order floggings for offenses that include indecent 
assault robbery rape of a woman under 16 weapons possession and 
piracy 
flogging was abolished in britain about four decades ago and 
the hong kong government has been encouraged to end the practice 
because of international criticism

the seabrook nuclear plant focus of 
debate over atomic energy has reached full power for the first 
time 
the 66 billion reactor among the nations most expensive 
went to full throttle at 952 pm thursday plant spokesman ron 
sher said the plant generated 1150 megawatts electricity for 1 
million new england homes 
its the most important milestone yet for the decadelate 
project and another setback for antinuclear activists whose mass 
civil disobedience demonstrations had made seabrook a symbol of 
their movement 
reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so 
hard to achieve said edward brown president of the plants 
operator new hampshire yankee 
for plant opponents the milestone was the latest in a series of 
disappointments since the nuclear regulatory commission gave 
seabrook a commercial operating license in march 
what theyre doing now is another step in the long process of 
the abuse of power said roy morrison of the antinuclear 
clamshell alliance its a complete disregard of the public 
safety the plant is unsafe its operating in a place where there 
is no evacuation possible 
the project conceived 22 years ago is located less than two 
miles from hampton beach new hampshires most popular summer 
resort the peak summertime population within seabrooks 10mile 
emergency planning zone is estimated at nearly 250000 
the nrc and seabrook supporters say evacuation plans would 
adequately protect the public in the unlikely event of a serious 
accident 
plant supporters include white house chief of staff john sununu 
who as new hampshire governor during the 1980s helped keep the 
project afloat despite financial troubles the lead owner public 
service company of new hampshire finally had to take bankruptcy 
refuge in january 1988 because of seabrook delays 
opponents were led by gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
which has six communities within 10 miles of seabrook dukakis 
contended that evacuation wouldnt be feasible considering the 
beach crowds and limited roads in the area 
many people interviewed on the beaches near seabrook this week 
have placed their trust willingly or otherwise in plant operators 
i think they got everything pretty much under control or they 
wouldnt be going up to full power said tom mcdermott 28 of 
lowell mass i guess im just relying on them to take care of 
it to let us know if somethings wrong 
public service proposed a nuclear power project in 1968 but 
shelved it the next year then proposed seabrook in 1972 as a 
twinreactor plant with a cost of less than 1 billion the first 
reactor was planned for commercial operation in 1979 the second in 
1981 
antinuclear acitivists began using civil disobedience to 
publicize their cause in 1976 a protest that resulted in more than 
1400 arrests in may 1977 was at the time the largest ever 
against an american nuclear plant in all antiseabrook 
demonstrations have resulted in more than 3200 arrests 
construction delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns 
forced owners to scrap seabrook 2 in the mid1980s

rebel soldiers who led a coup attempt 
against president corazon aquino in december offered a truce today 
to help relief efforts following this weeks killer earthquake 
we call on the present leadership to set aside all political 
differences in order to squarely face this catastrophe the 
underground revolutionary alliance of the massessoldiers of the 
filipino people said in a statement 
mondays earthquake which measured 77 on the richter scale 
was the strongest to hit the country in 14 years and officials say 
hundreds of people were killed 
the rebel group said its members were prepared to help in the 
relief effort but asked that the government agree to a temporary 
and finite halt to the search and capture of rebel members 
it said the rebels have declared a unilateral stop to all 
antigovernment activities during this time of national tragedy 
the statement was signed by former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan who led the august 1987 coup attempt and was among key 
leaders of the last coup attempt 
the december attempt left at least 113 people dead and more than 
600 injured it was the sixth and most serious bid by rebellious 
soldiers to topple mrs aquino since she took power after a 
people power revolution ousted the late ferdinand marcos in 
1986

a court decision this week throwing out convictions 
in a terrorist bombing has added to public frustration that judges 
and investigators have failed to pin down the blame in several 
attacks in the past 20 years 
an appeals court on wednesday overturned the convictions of four 
people sentenced to life in prison two years ago for the 1980 
bombing that killed 85 people at bolognas train station 
the verdict meant investigators are back to square one in trying 
to solve one of europes worst terrorist acts a full decade after 
it occurred 
how shameful for the state said il messaggero a moderate 
rome newspaper in a frontpage editorial the leading milan daily 
corriere della sera called italy a country without truth 
some commentators blamed investigative incompetence political 
interference and the dark deeds of a secret service that may have 
compromised the truth forever 
the bologna bombing was only the latest in a series of major 
cases dating back more than 20 years that have gone unsolved 
they include the bombing at a milan bank in 1969 that left 16 
dead and ushered in more than a decade of terrorism from the left 
and right bomb blasts in the city of brescia and on trains in the 
1970s and the mysterious crash of an italian jetliner in 1980 that 
killed all 81 aboard 
in the milan bombing there were arrests and at least three 
trials but in the end the suspects were acquitted a trial of 
brescia suspects ended in acquittal there were arrests in at least 
one of the train bombings in the 1970s but a trial never 
determined the perpetrators 
there have been no arrests in the plane crash and experts have 
still failed to make a firm determination on the cause whether a 
bomb exploded aboard or whether it was downed by a missile fired by 
an unidentified plane 
adding to the anguish of the victims relatives the judge 
investigating the crash has just quit the case over a dispute with 
a socialist politician regarding his handling of it 
before the bologna verdict italians were diffident if not 
distrustful toward the system of justice said franco ferrarotti 
a university of rome sociologist in a telephone interview 
the verdict has delivered a powerful blow to the relationship 
between citizens and institutions in italy he said 
prosecutors in the bologna case described the attack as a 
neofascist plot to undermine italys democracy and the four 
convicted of planting the bomb as rightwing terrorists 
seemingly strengthening this theory was the indictment and 
conviction in the first trial of licio gelli former grandmaster of 
the secret propaganda due p2 masonic lodge which had been 
accused of seeking to install a rightwing dictatorship with the 
help of secret service officials 
gelli had been given 10 years in prison on charges of misleading 
investigators but he was also acquitted by the appeals court 
the technique seemed to fit the pattern attributed to italys 
neofascist gangs striking at masses of people in the city that is 
the heart of communist party strength 
leftist terrorists were said to be more selective in their 
targets aiming at individual politicians or businessmen 
it was in this highly politicized atmosphere that the trials in 
the bologna case were held the communist party reponded to the 
verdict thursday by leaving the front page of its party newspaper 
blank but for a photo of a rescue worker carrying a victim of the 
train station bombing 
sociologist ferrarotti said other countries carry the burden of 
doubtcreating crimes pointing to the theories on the 1963 
assassination of president john f kennedy but other countries 
make an attempt to deal out justice swiftly 
it took six years to complete the investigation of the bologna 
bombing and two more years to bring it to trial the appeals court 
handed down its verdict just a few seeks before the 10th 
anniversary of the bombing on aug 2 
i dont know what was behind the reversal of the verdict 
said a bitter paolo bolognesi spokesman for the families of the 
victims i only know this this the courts anniversary present 
the trials have served as an unpleasant reminder of the dark 
days of terrorism in sharp contrast to the economic boom and 
relative social peace enjoyed by italians over the last decade 
leftist terrorism responsible for the kidnapping and killing of 
former premier aldo moro in 1978 was crushed when dozens of the 
urban guerrillas decided to turn states evidence 
the rich italy of today will have to come to terms with its 
past sooner or later said the il messaggero editorial a true 
democracy cant exist with so many dark areas

a judge ruled that donald trump can be 
questioned by attorneys representing his estranged wife ivana 
about an alleged extramarital affair 
manhattan supreme court justice phyllis gangeljacob ruled on 
thursday that trump would have to divulge his intentions toward 
marla maples when he and mrs trump updated a prenuptial agreement 
in december 1987 
mrs trump contends she was tricked into signing papers that 
would give her 25 million if she and trump divorced 
she said she would not have signed the agreement had she been 
aware of his adultery and philandering 
the judge also ruled that trump would not have to discuss his 
relationship with maples after the 1987 agreement 
the agreement which trump attorney jay goldberg has called 
ironclad was fraudulently obtained according to mrs trumps 
lawyer michael kennedy 
the new york post reported today that mrs trump revealed in 
court papers obtained thursday that her relationship with trump 
began to sour four years ago 
in 1986 he mentioned that he thought an open marriage might 
be interesting but he knew i was too oldfashioned a girl to even 
tolerate any other sexual relationship or affair she said 
he did not tell me that he was seeing another woman and 
having an affair with her she said 
mrs trump had also sought to have the contract nullified 
because of alleged adultery by trump after december 1987 
trumps attorney goldberg told the daily news that decision is 
extremely valuable to mr trumps cause and solidifies his 
position that the 1987 agreement will be upheld

the prime minister has appointed nine men and 
a woman to a new cabinet that will assume power july 28 and include 
politicians representing a wide diversity of opinions and platforms 
prime minister juan carlos hurtado announced the 10 appointments 
thursday and said the ministers of labor justice and industry 
would be announced later 
the 10 ministers represent a range of political parties and 
reflect presidentelect alberto fujimoris plans for a government 
of conciliation that will replace that of president alan garcia 
fujimori of the centrist change 90 party on wednesday named 
hurtado a former agriculture minister to be his prime minister 
and economics minister hurtado had announced his resignation from 
the centerright popular action party wednesday morning 
fujimoris choice of hurtado was the strongest indication yet 
that in order to satisfy foreign creditors the new president will 
pursue a more marketoriented economic policy than he spoke of 
during his campaign 
before the june 10 election fujimori sharply criticized the 
type of marketoriented economic shock therapy advocated by his 
opponent novelist mario vargas llosa 
the cabinet members named thursday were luis marchand current 
ambassador to chile as foreign minister fernando sanchez as 
energy minister carlos amat y leon as agriculture minister dr 
carlos vidal as health minister eduardo toledo as transportation 
and communications minister 
army gen rodrigo alvarado was named as interior minister army 
gen jorge torres as defense minister gloria helfer as education 
minister retired navy admiral raul sanchez as fisheries minister 
and guillermo del solar as housing and construction minister 
hurtado said the people selected to head the ministries of 
industry and justice were out of the country and that their names 
would be announced later 
hurtado said a labor minister had not been selected and that he 
planned to consult with labor leaders before making that choice 
alvarado was the most controversial appointment as head of the 
interior ministry he will oversee the national police forces and 
analysts say the appointment could aggravate the longstanding 
rivalry between perus police and military 
the rivalry is strongest in the countrys emergency zones where 
the military has been given broad powers to fight leftist 
guerrillas more than onethird of the country is currently under 
emergency regulations 
the two major leftist guerrilla groups fighting the government 
are the maoistinspired shining path and the procuban tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement

richard t boggs meditated to calm himself 
as he sat in the electric chair for 12 minutes before he was 
executed for the 1984 murder and robbery of an elderly neighbor 
head tilted back and eyes closed boggs walked slowly into the 
death chamber at 1050 pm thursday he appeared sedated but 
state department of corrections spokesman wayne farrar said boggs 
27 had not taken any tranquilizers 
he was meditating said farrar he was into meditation 
guards strapped boggs into the wooden chair in the basement of 
the state penitentiary placed a brown leather mask over his face 
and attached electrodes to the crown of his head and his right calf 
comforted by prison chaplain russ ford boggs his shaven head 
still tilted backward occasionally touched thumb to fingers on his 
upwardly cupped hands as he waited for his execution which took 
place shortly after 11 pm 
prison officials said that condemned prisoners are usually not 
kept waiting on the chair but had no immediate explanation for the 
delay 
earlier in the evening gov l douglas wilder refused to 
commute boggs sentence to life in prison after the us supreme 
court denied a stay 
the execution was the first during the 6monthold 
administration of wilder a former death penalty opponent who 
successfully pushed for an expansion of the states capital 
punishment law this year 
boggs was sentenced to death for the jan 25 1984 robbery and 
slaying of his portsmouth neighbor treeby m shaw 87 whom he had 
known all his life 
she had just poured tea for boggs when he beat her with a metal 
bar and stabbed her because he needed money for drugs he told 
police he took diamond rings from her fingers and family silver 
from the house 
boggs back arched as he was hit with the first 2500volt surge 
of electricity the electricity was administered for 55 seconds 
stopped for 5 seconds and turned on for an additional 55 seconds 
boggs who had no final words was pronounced dead at 1107 pm 
the execution was the ninth since virginia resumed executions in 
1982 and the 135th nationwide since the supreme court reinstituted 
the death penalty in 1976 it was the 15th this year 
us district judge richard l williams turned down boggs 
request for a stay of execution thursday morning and a threejudge 
panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the ruling 
late in the afternoon 
defense lawyers claimed the states electric chair might 
malfunction and that boggs suffers from brain damage 
boggs attorney david bruck told williams that virginias 
electric chair is virtually identical to the one in florida that 
malfunctioned during the electrocution of jesse tafero in may 
flames and smoke appeared from under the mans head covering 
florida officials contend that the problem was that a synthetic 
sponge rather than a natural sponge was used under the hood they 
have replaced the sponge but defense attorneys who argue that the 
chair is still not fixed are continuing to raise objections to 
executions in that state

burmas most prominent opposition 
leader marked a year under house arrest today and the military 
government sent troops and armored cars into the streets to quash 
any calls for her freedom 
burmas military rulers were overwhelmingly defeated in may 27 
elections but have so far refused to hand over power or free aung 
san suu kyi whose national league for democracy won the balloting 
ms suu kyi was put under house arrest july 20 1989 after the 
government accused her of subversion a government spokesman said 
at that time she would serve a oneyear term which could be 
renewed 
there was no word from the government today on prospects for her 
release 
diplomats contacted by telephone said troops with automatic 
rifles and armored cas patrolled the streets of the burmese 
capital rangoon apparently to deter rallies by ms suu kyis 
supporters 
security was especially tight around her lakeside compound they 
said 
on thursday 150 youths staged a march in rangoon shouting for 
ms suu kyis release and hoisting the national league for 
democracys symbol 
the league has asked the government to release ms suu kyi but 
has also been trying since the election to avoid antagonizing the 
military 
a military spokesman has said the government would not bow to 
foreign pressure for her release 
in a july 13 letter 39 members of the us congress and 19 
senators urged military leader gen saw maung to hold a dialogue 
with civilian political parties and rapidly transfer power 
the us lawmakers called on the burmese government to lift 
martial law free all political prisoners including ms suu kyi and 
take steps to ensure basic human rights are protected 
ms suu kyi was a leader of the national prodemocracy uprisings 
that military officers crushed in september 1988 by killing 
hundreds of people 
the may elections were the first multiparty balloting allowed in 
three decades the military severely restricted campaigning by the 
opposition but ms suu kyis party still won 396 of the 485 seats 
in parliament

martyrs day which marks the the assassination 43 years ago of 
independence leaders those leaders include gen aung san ms suu 
kyis father

attorneys say they have settled out of court a 
30 million lawsuit filed against television personality geraldo 
rivera by a woman who was arrested during a drug raid carried live 
on national television 
terry rouse 32 of suburban channelview filed the libel suit 
against rivera in 1987 stemming from the dec 2 1986 telecast of 
american vice the doping of a nation 
the settlement involving an undisclosed amount of money came 
after rivera was questioned for six hours during a deposition 
thursday 
before the settlement rivera had said he suspected the lawsuit 
was pursued by attorneys with greedy motives 
the lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial aug 20 state district 
judge ann cochran on thursday ordered rivera to turn over a copy of 
his most recent financial data but she also ordered that it would 
remain confidential 
dale jefferson attorney for ms rouse speculated the other 
side settled because it did not savor discussing riveras salary in 
open court 
during the 1986 program rivera was broadcasting live outside a 
duplex where ms rouse was staying when harris county sheriff 
johnny klevenhagen and several deputies raided the home rivera 
said that the people inside were an alleged pimp and prostitute who 
were supplying drugs to truckers 
ms rouse was dragged from the duplex and handcuffed as an 
estimated 15 million viewers watched she said in the lawsuit 
ms rouse has maintained she was hired to paint the house which 
belonged to a friend cocaine possession charges against her 
stemming from the televised bust were later dismissed 
attorney wayne fisher representing rivera and the production 
companies said the settlement was the result of all the parties 
sitting down together in one place

a strict lowfat vegetarian diet can reverse 
damage caused by heart disease according to the findings of an 
american study published in the weekly british medical magazine the 
lancet 
the lifestyle heart trial was conducted on 41 heart disease 
patients by the preventive medicine research institute in 
sausalito calif 
the study found that 82 percent of the heart disease patients 
who adopted such a diet quit smoking and attended 
stressmanagement classes reversed their coronary artery blockages 
what were finding is that heart disease may be completely 
preventable for most people if they are willing to make changes in 
their lifestyle the studys coordinator dr dean ornish said 
in a telephone interview 
the patients all from the san francisco area were recruited 
from pacific presbyterian medical center and from moffitt hospital 
at the university of california at san francisco for the study 
published in lancets july 21 issue 
the 41 aged 3575 were randomly divided into two groups 
the experimental group comprised 22 of the 41 the 22 followed a 
lowfat vegetarian diet took regular exercise attended stress 
management classes and did not smoke eighteen of the 22 or 82 
percent of the group showed an overall reversal in coronary artery 
blockages the study found 
the other 19 among the 41 were assigned to a control group which 
followed the standard program recommended for people suffering from 
coronary artery disease a diet of 30 percent fat moderate 
excercise and no smoking 
ten of the 19 53 percent of the control group experienced a 
worsening of their artery blockages the study found 
this finding suggests that conventional recommendations dont 
go far enough for many people ornish said the guidelines may 
be enough to prevent heart disease but not to reverse it 
the lowfat vegetarian diet included fruits vegetables grains 
and beans the report said 
the only animal products allowed were egg whites and a cup a day 
of nonfat milk or yogurt cholesterol intake was limited to five

an american team is heading to luanda at the 
invitation of angolas marxist government to discuss how to get 
food aid to all areas of the country including those held by 
usbacked rebels 
the fourperson team will leave saturday for the wartorn 
country where hundreds of thousands of people are starving the 
team also will focus on efforts to achieve peace in the region 
guarded optimism that a solution could be found to the impasse 
over food aid came thursday after angolas ambassador to the united 
nations manuel pedro pacavira met with state department officials 
and rep tony hall dohio chairman of the house select committee 
on hunger 
pacavira in an apparent turnaround in his governments 
position said his country is willing to work closely with 
state department officials to bring food to hundreds of thousands 
of people suffering hunger because of drought 
what i heard was that the government of angola is interested 
in working with the united nations to deliver food through 
corridors of safe passage to all hungry angolans whether they 
are in governmentheld or unitaheld territory hall said unita 
is a usbacked rebel group headed by jonas savimbi 
that is a turnaround from what we were hearing a few weeks ago 
and it is very very encouraging hall said 
angolan officials have said they are concerned that food 
deliveries to people in unitaheld territory in southern angolan 
could be used as a cover for supplying weapons to savimbi 
unita which has waged a civil war for more than 15 years 
against the sovietsupported central government controls major 
portions of land in southern angola where some of the 250000 
angolans are at risk because of food shortages 
the state department was similiarly encouraged by pacaviras 
statements a spokesman said the ambassador had a frank and 
honest discussion with jeffrey davidow deputy assistant 
secretary of state and one of the four people who will travel to 
angola the official said 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
logistics of actually delivering food to parts of angola could be 
sticky 
generally an agreement on corridors of safe passage calls 
for both sides to stop hostilities on clearly marked airways and 
roads 
if the united nations is to monitor the arrangement the angolan 
government will have to contact officials of the international 
agency an aide to hall said 
the united states had criticized the angolan government for 
blocking food shipments to unitaheld territory some 2 million in 
aid is already to be moved to areas where people are starving 
officials said 
although the united states does not have diplomatic relations 
with angola state department officials say since 1980 some 4 
million in food has been sent to people in governmentheld 
territory as a humanitarian gesture 
pacaviras visit coincided with secret deliberations in congress 
over how much military aid to provide savimbi in 1991 a house 
subcommitee started marking up the intelligence authorization bill 
which includes aid to angola on thursday

measles vaccination programs should target all 
eligible people but especially hispanics who recently immigrated 
to the united states federal health officials say 
a report issued thursday by the centers for disease control also 
said measles continues to be transmitted in medical settings 
especially hospital emergency rooms because cases often are not 
diagnosed and isolated promptly 
the cdcs weekly report which highlighted information gathered 
by the washington state department of health said at least 26 
percent of the measles cases recorded there this year were acquired 
in mexico or linked to cases acquired there 
in contrast 15 percent of the 55 cases reported in 1989 were 
linked to mexico 
washington health officials reported 266 cases of measles during 
the first 26 weeks of 1990 nearly five times the number of cases 
reported statewide during all of 1989 and the largest number in the 
state since 1979 
nationwide 7653 cases were reported during the first 20 weeks 
of this year the cdc said 
nearly half the cases in the washington epidemic occurred among 
unvaccinated people the cdc said of those unvaccinated more than 
half were hispanics who account for 4 percent of washington 
states population of 45 million and make up its largest ethnic 
minority group 
detailed data available for 218 of the cases showed 97 cases or 
45 percent occurred among hispanics hispanic children showed the 
highest incidence rate with 59 or 81 percent under 5 years old 
of those 32 were younger than 16 months old 
although measles vaccination coverage for washingtons total 
hispanic population was unknown the high attack rate for hispanics 
suggests that coverage was low the cdc said noting that the 
states hispanic population increased by nearly 40 percent from 
1980 to 1988 
barbara baker washingtons immunization director said many of 
the states hispanics are migrant workers who take seasonal jobs 
harvesting fruit crops including apples cherries peas and 
asparagus and hops used to flavor beer 
in response to the measles epidemic the state department of 
health spent 11 million for 76000 doses of measles vaccine this 
spring ms baker said the vaccination clinics were publicized in 
spanish and english on radio and television in newspapers and by 
sound trucks driven through areas with a high number of hispanic 
residents she said

a judge said he does not have the authority to 
change the x rating given to the spanish film tie me up tie 
me down 
but acting state supreme court justice charles ramos in his 
ruling thursday also denounced the system that issued the x 
rating the state supreme court is manhattans trial level court 
the movies american distributor miramax films corp and its 
producerdirector pedro almodovar asked the court to change the 
rating they said the x designation was arbitrary capricious 
unfair and a form of censorship 
ramos agreed that the rating system used by the motion picture 
association of america sevenmember ratings board is an effective 
form of censorship but he said the petition before his court was 
not the proper vehicle for relief 
the mpaa says its rating system is a guide for parents to make 
judgments about which movies they want their children to see it is 
not designed to rate the merits of a film the mpaa says 
the mpaa said almodovars movie whose spanish title is 
atame was rated x because of a prolonged and graphic 
sex scene photographed from numerous angles and accompanied by an 
explicit sound track 
ramos said nothing supports the mpaas claim that its ratings 
are designed to protect children no physicians child 
psychiatrists or child care professionals are on the board nor is 
guidance from such professionals sought the judge noted 
ramos said that the rating systems categories have been 
fashioned by the motion picture industry to create an illusion of 
concern for children imposing censorship yet all the while 
facilitating the marketing of exploitive and violent films with an 
industry seal of approval 
notably absent from the ratings system is any sensitivity to 
the offenses suffered by women minorities the disabled and those 
who may not share the values of the average american parent 
ramos said 
a film may be viewed by children that may contain hard 
violence and drug use but not explicit sex he said it may 
be that the mpaa ratings are skewed toward permitting film makers 
huge profits pandering to the appetite for films containing hard 
violence and drug use while neglecting the welfare of children 
the judge also said the mpaa needs a system that would 
distinguish between movies for adult audiences like tie me up 
tie me down and pornography 
william kunstler lawyer for miramax and almodovar said he will 
appeal the decision 
as the rest of the world moves toward freer and open 
expression in politics and art it is deeply disturbing that in 
the united states the censors bigots and blue noses exert 
increasing control over what we may see and what we may say 
kunstler said

palestinian guerrillas ringed a stronghold 
of proiranian militiamen today after three plo fighters were 
killed by grenadethrowing fundamentalists police reported 
they said seven other palestinians were wounded as fighters of 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god charged out of the 
hilltop town of jarjou overnight and staged six hitandrun grenade 
attacks on the guerrillas 
the plo responded by rushing in 200 more guerrillas with 
multibarreled rocket launchers from its main bases near the port 
city of sidon police said 
a 600member palestine liberation organization force arrived 
tuesday in iqlim altuffah or the apple province in a vain bid to 
halt a new round of fighting between hezbollah and the prosyrian 
amal militia 
the 5dayold battle between the two shiite moslem factions in 
jarjou and a cluster of surrounding villages overlooking israels 
selfdesignated security zone in southern lebanon has left 70 
shiites dead and 232 wounded by police counts 
lt col anwar madi commander of the plo intervention force 
reported the palestinian casualties in hezbollahs attack he also 
told reporters at his headquarters in the village of houmine that 
we have shot and killed or wounded many of them but did not 
provide a specific figure 
hezbollah wrested jarjou from amal on monday in renewed fighting 
in the 3yearold power struggle for control of lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest sect 
todays casualties raised the overall toll to 1114 killed and 
3374 wounded 
red cross teams managed to get into jarjou on thursday for the 
first time since the clashes began and removed 11 bloated corpses 
that had been sprawled in the village square for four days 
but the fighting flared anew forcing them to dive for cover as 
shells exploded around the village they fled jarjou in a sevencar 
convoy 
red cross officials said there were many other bodies lying 
around jarjou 
officials of the international committee of the red cross said 
today they did not know when they would try again to evacuate dead 
and wounded 
most of the regions 50000 inhabitants fled their villages in 
january when hezbollah began a campaign to break out of its 
mountain enclave and reach the mediterranean coast to open up a new 
supply route 
a 600man palestine liberation organization force was deployed 
tuesday along a fourmile line between amal and hezbollah 
ostensibly to stop the fighting 
but the primary objective of yasser arafats plo which has its 
main bases in the port city of sidon 10 miles northwest of jarjou 
was to block hezbollahs push to expand its area of control 
a thrust toward sidon would allow hezbollah to link up with 
antiarafat palestinian radicals and threaten arafats forces 
if hezbollah reached the coast it would cut off amals 
stronghold in the south from beirut the fundamentalists want a sea 
outlet to bring in weapons and supplies from iran 
their main supply route is vulnerable because it runs through 
the bekaa valley in eastern lebanon which is controlled by the 
syrian army 
the apple province covers 50 square miles of a rocky panhandle 
and abuts the supply route into the christian town of jezzine from 
the israeliheld border zone 
jezzine 11 miles east of sidon is controlled by an 
israeliarmed militia the south lebanon army its 3000 mainly 
christian fighters patrol the 440squaremile israeli enclave 
the south lebanon army commander retired lebanese army gen 
antoine lahd warned thursday night that his force might intervene 
in the shiite fighting if it escalates and threatens his territory

a report blaming newfoundlands roman catholic 
church for failing to stop priests who were sexually abusing boys 
has led archbishop alphonsus penney of st johns to offer his 
resignation to pope john paul ii 
penney made a public apology to the victims and their families 
on wednesday after the scathing report accused him of ignoring and 
then denying claims that boys in newfoundland an island province 
off the east coast of canada had been sexually abused by priests 
for more than a decade 
penney 65 said he accepted full responsibility for failing to 
deal with the scandal which first became public in 1987 five men 
including priests and former priests have been convicted on 
sexual abuse charges in the past three years several others are 
awaiting trial 
for 2 years penney refused calls to step down while more than 
20 of his priests and lay members of the newfoundland catholic 
community were charged with or convicted of sexually abusing boys 
the report written by a commission set up by the archbishop a year 
ago said church officials showed little compassion for the victims 
and aligned themselves with the accused 
we are sorry for the times you were not believed were not 
supported or were ostracized in any way in our community penney 
told a catholic audience in st johns for every word and action 
which may have deepened your pain we are profoundly sorry 
the commission said the church adopted a policy of minimal 
response to the scandal even though it was receiving complaints 
about some sexually deviant priests from parishioners police 
officers social workers and other priests that response the 
report said was woefully inadequate and may have been 
psychologically damaging to all concerned 
the boys it said were the victims of men they had been brought 
up to trust men who abused their position of priestly status and 
power by acting out their regressed sexuality with children 
the commissions findings stunned newfoundlands 120000 roman 
catholics 
it pulled no punches on the state of affairs within our 
diocese said barbara crosbie vice chairman of a committee 
established to help the church respond to the report the 700page 
document will be sent out to parishes for study a public meeting 
is scheduled for oct 11 
i think the essence of the report will be embraced mrs 
crosbie said

penney made no defense of his actions he has said in the past 
that he had no knowledge of allegations of sexual abuse by priests 
until november 1987 but the report found evidence he heard 
allegations in 1979 and in 1984 
the 55 recommendations the commission made included the 
following 
that the church formally acknowledge its portion of guilt and 
apologize to the victims 
that the church compensate victims financially 
that it should revise policies on reacting to sexual abuse 
complaints 
that the canadian conference of catholic bishops be asked to 
fully directly hontestly and without reservation examine 
problems created by forcing priests to be celibate

us policy is still helping the khmer rouge 
in cambodia despite changes announced by the bush administration 
this week witnesses told a senate committee today 
senators of both parties and private witnesses said continued 
us financial aid to a rebel coalition that includes the khmer 
rouge and a continued us economic embargo against cambodia lend 
indirect support to the feared rebel group 
sen frank murkowski ralaska a member of the intelligence 
committee said bushs withdrawal of recognition for the rebel 
coalition is insufficient 
he called on bush to help forge a coalition against the khmer 
rouge between the noncommunist rebel factions and the current 
cambodian government which they are fighting 
are we supporting a coalition we hope will win asked sen 
bob kerrey dneb who made a trip to cambodia earlier this year 
i think the answer is likely no because a rebel victory would 
almost certainly install the khmer rouge the faction with the 
strongest military force he said 
former secretary of state edmund muskie who traveled to 
cambodia last year as chairman of the liberal center for national 
policy said he believed the bush administration will make further 
policy changes because the administration finally understands 
that the us government could have on its record if not on its 
conscience the death of a nation 
us intelligence reports show a pattern of military activity by 
the khmer rouge much like the moves that led them to power 15 years 
ago say sources familiar with the reports 
the information including indications of military cooperation 
and shared supply lines between the khmer rouge and the usbacked 
noncommunist rebels was contained in briefings the cia and 
defense intelligence agency gave to congressional and executive 
branch officials the sources said 
the khmer rouge presided over a massive agrarian reform 
experiment in cambodia during its 3year rule that resulted in the 
deaths of more than 1 million countrymen from execution starvation 
and disease 
fearing a comeback by the communist guerrillas the 
administration announced wednesday it was withdrawing support for a 
united nations seat for the threeparty resistance that includes 
the khmer rouge the forces of prince norodom sihanouk and the 
faction of former cambodian prime minister son sann 
secretary of state james a baker iii also said the united 
states would open talks with vietnam which installed the current 
cambodian regime 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said us 
intelligence sees the events in 1974 and 1975 that led to the 
takeover of cambodia by the khmer rouge as a virtual model for 
events occurring now 
those events include attacks on provincial capitals and other 
significant targets a nearpermanent presence in the northern part 
of the country and deeper penetration since vietnamese occupation 
forces withdrew last year 
the steppedup rebel attacks pose a threat to the hun sen 
government and there are reports that in some instances the 
governments soldiers have stopped fighting according to the 
analysis the khmer rouge has about 30000 to 40000 troops while 
government forces number 60000 to 100000 
soviet and vietnamese aid to the cambodian government has 
declined and while phnom penh remains a bustling capital with a 
robust economy the economy in governmentcontrolled parts of the 
countryside is fragile and inflation is rising the analysts said 
some government workers and military personnel are not being paid 
they said 
us intelligence believes that all of the 140000 vietnamese 
troops who were in cambodia have been withdrawn with only a few 
advisers remaining 
the intelligence agencies estimate chinas military aid to the 
khmer rouge at about 100 million a year 
other sources have said the united states provides 13 million a 
year in covert aid to the noncommunist resistance forces together 
with 7 million in public nonlethal aid singapore gives an 
additional 10 million yearly to the noncommunist forces 
the us aid remains the subject of hot debate on capitol hill 
where the senate intelligence committee has voted to end the covert 
program some congressional opponents of past us policy say it 
makes no sense to continue to send aid while withdrawing 
recognition of the resistance coalition

a us customs service worker was been charged 
with passing confidential information from a nationwide computer 
network to a second man who shared it with a suspected drug 
smuggler officials said 
assistant us attorney tom stahl said the alleged leak scuttled 
a drugsmuggling investigation 
the loss to the government is that a drug smuggler learned 
that he was being investigated for drug smuggling and the 
investigation was impaired and subsequently dropped stahl said 
thursday 
the compromised drug investigation involved no undercover 
agents and apparently no law enforcement figures were endangered 
by the alleged leak stahl said 
a fivepage indictment identified the customs service worker as 
david henry brown 48 of san diego the customs service said brown 
is an information management specialist employed in the agencys 
san diego computer center 
customs service spokesman mike fleming said that brown who had 
worked for the customs service since 1972 was placed on 
administrative leave thursday and a decision was pending on whether 
he would be fired 
the information brown allegedly passed came from the treasury 
enforcement communications system a nationwide computer network 
containing confidential law enforcement intelligence information 
the data pool provides awide variety of information to 
customs service agents fleming said 
included in the network is information on warrants pending 
criminal investigations and smuggling operations 
none of the information is classified for national security 
purposes but the network contains confidential law enforcement 
information and thus is sensitive in a general sense fleming 
said 
the indictment alleged that brown passed the computer 
information to joseph philip souza 47 of newport ri in 1988 
and earlier this year souza was charged with brown both men face 
one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states and two counts 
of conversion of government property 
neither brown nor souza has been arrested both are expected to 
appear early next week for arraignment before a us magistrate in 
san diego stahl said 
the indictment said souza passed the confidential information to 
a third man jerald bacal 33 of escondido who was the target 
of the scuttled customs service drugsmuggling investigation 
if convicted brown and souza could each face maximum prison 
terms of 25 years and fines totaling 750000 according to the 
government

the united states is postponing an annual 
meeting with israeli representatives to review joint defense 
projects but officials say the move is not related to us efforts 
to prod israel into accepting peace talks with the palestinians 
the talks known as the joint security assistance program were 
scheduled to be held in washington next week 
diplomatic sources said today however that secretary of state 
james a baker iii has scheduled a meeting in washington with david 
levy the new israeli foreign minister 
the session could set the stage for a new bush administration 
drive to propel israel into talks with palestinian arabs 
baker and levy had planned to meet in paris last week but levy 
was recuperating from surgery for a circulatory ailment his 
physicians advised him against traveling to france 
the us postponement of the joint security assistance program 
talks took israeli officials by surprise coming as it did shortly 
before the director general of israels defense ministry david 
ivri and the new defense minister moshe arens were scheduled to 
arrive in washington said a source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
a state department official said the postponement was caused by 
the budget meetings under way between the administration and 
congress which he said have created some uncertainty about the 
amount of money that will be available for foreign aid 
the session with israel was to focus on us aid for fiscal year 
1992 that starts oct 1 1991 we still dont know what our 
budget will look like then how can we discuss it with the 
israelis said the state department official 
israel is the largest recipient of us aid getting 3 billion 
annually in military and economic assistance 
we are not sending any signals said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the official said israel had agreed to 
the us suggestion that the talks be held in september 
last march a formula devised by baker for talks between israel 
and palestinian arabs was rejected by the israeli government which 
collapsed over the dispute levy a hardliner has since taken 
over as foreign minister 
baker preparing to try again has met in washington with 
egyptian and jordanian officials but talks with the palestine 
liberation organization held through us ambassador robert 
pelletreau jr in tunisia were broken off after a failed terrorist 
attack against israel 
the secretary of state has been pressing israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to agree to peace talks with palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip but shamir has resisted 
the pressure and baker has in recent weeks displayed marked 
impatience 
arens was scheduled to arrive in washington today for talks with 
defense secretary dick cheney 
israeli and us officials insisted arens visit was not 
connected to the postponement of the talks despite the fact that it 
had only been arranged within the past week and officially 
announced on thursday 
israeli officials said arens had taken cheney up on an 
invitation delivered by telephone soon after arens took office last 
month 
but other officials said arens was anxious to discuss with 
cheney the question of continued us financing for the 
israelideveloped arrow antimissile project 
arens also wants to discuss with cheney recent threats by iraqi 
president saddam hussein against israel and against kuwait 
the annual sessions are designed to review joint defense 
projects such as research and development of weapons systems 
exchange of military and intelligence information and the 
allocation of us money for various projects in israel 
the talks involve representatives from israels treasury 
department its defense and foreign ministries along with their 
us counterparts

a university professor says he has developed summer 
jackets with matching hats to shield cows from the sun insects and 
diseases and allow them to produce more milk 
the outfit consists of three straw pieces that cover the head 
back and abdomen mosaku sakurai of the tokyo university of 
agriculture said friday 
he said he had developed the jackets after observing cows for 
more than eight years sakurai an agriculture professor said cows 
lose their appetites and produce less milk when they are exposed to 
the sun during summer 
the back of a blackhaired cow can reach 140 degrees if it is 
outside for about 20 minutes in summer he said 
by wearing the jacket a cow can spend more time eating grass 
and can produce more milk he said the jacket is not yet being 
produced commercially

marion barry spent a virgin islands vacation 
working and playing with his son not drinking and using cocaine as 
prosecutors allege a police bodyguard testified today at the 
mayors drug and perjury trial 
but the witness detective ulysses walltower also testified 
that he was not in barrys presence during much of the time that 
government witness charles lewis has said he used drugs with the 
mayor 
testifying on the second day of the defenses presentation 
walltower said barry split his time between official duties and 
playing with his son christopher during the fourday trip to the 
virgin islands in 1988 
lewis has testified that during barrys first afternoon in the 
virgin islands the two smoked crack cocaine together when others 
were absent from the mayors hotel room 
the detective said that on that afternoon he accompanied barrys 
son and the boys companion to a nearby beach they went down 
several times for 30 or 45 minutes walltower testified then 
they would go back to the room mess around and go back down to 
the beach 
walltower also acknowledged he spent little time with the mayor 
in the evenings periods where lewis and other witnesses have said 
drugs were used 
walltower a 20year police veteran also said he saw barry in 
the company of only two women lewis a convicted drug dealer has 
testified that he brought three women to barrys hotel room 
on thursday two of the mayors other security guards said they 
frequently drove the mayor to the homes of people who allegedly 
provided him with drugs 
and a contract supervisor said he understood the mayor was 
interested in a city contract for barrys girlfriend former model 
rasheeda moore 
outside the courthouse barry characterized some of the 
governments questioning as satanic dirtlike tactics 
the two security guards who are city police officers and the 
supervisor were called by the mayors lawyers in an attempt to 
attack the credibility of prosecution witnesses who said they saw 
barry use drugs 
instead officer james stays testified reluctantly that he took 
barry to the homes of alleged drug suppliers lloyd moore and jeff 
mitchell and the restaurant of a man who said he gave drugs to 
barry about 30 times 
officer warren goodwine testified that he drove the mayor to the 
home of doris crenshaw on at least two occasions crenshaw 
testified she saw barry use drugs about a dozen times 
assistant us attorney judith retchin questioned stays about 
allegations that he had used cocaine stays denied that and also 
denied telling another security officer that a friend of the 
mayors was providing him with cocaine 
retchin said a witness had given grand jury testimony that stays 
had used cocaine she also said that stays earlier this year had 
refused to undergo a urinalysis for drugs 
goodwine told investigators earlier this year that he did not 
want to know what the mayor was doing and that he stayed away from 
barrys activities as much as possible 
those statements were probably taken out of context 
goodwine testified thursday he said he felt he should stay out of 
barrys personal business that was not my business 
stays testified that he never delivered money to rasheeda moore 
so that she could buy drugs for the mayor 
darryl hardy of the citys summer youth program said his boss 
had given him the impression that barry and top city officials 
wanted a nobid 57000 contract awarded to moore for a modeling 
project 
hardy also told investigators earlier this year that he 
understood that barry wanted the dollar amount of the contract 
doubled in 1987 but he testified that he couldnt recall making 
the earlier statement 
hardy said he judged moores program on its merits and that 
there was no interference to approve it in 1986 and 1987 or cancel 
it in 1988 moore has testified that barry refused to help her get 
it renewed in 1988 because she rejected his request for sex 
barry 54 is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession one 
count of conspiracy count and three felony charges of lying to a 
grand jury about his alleged drug use

a quickthinking chemical plant foreman very 
likely saved a lot of lives when he sounded an alarm just seconds 
before explosions ripped through the building killing one worker 
and injuring 68 authorities said 
one of the maintenance foremen noticed a vapor cloud 
immediately ran over and pulled the alarm ron leisner a quality 
assurance manager for basf corp said at a news conference he 
was very calm under pressure and very likely saved a lot of lives 
by doing so 
leisner said the foreman joe brock was outside the resin 
building when he saw the vapor what leisner described as being 
similar to the shimmering effect above a blacktop road on a hot day 
our fire alarm went off i got about five steps the 
explosion hit and it knocked everybody off their feet said 
thomas borst a chemist who was working in an adjacent building at 
the plant when the blast hit 
larry jameson president of basfs coatings and colorants 
division said the company had not determined the cause of the 
explosion but suspected that something went wrong with equipment 
that processes chemical polymers into paint 
he said the process is used at other basf plants and there were 
no plans to suspend those operations we really have no reason to 
suspect that this is an unsafe practice jameson said 
firefighters continued to douse the building with water today to 
prevent chemicals from reigniting fire chief bill miller said it 
took about 2 hours to bring the fire under control 
about 2000 residents were evacuated from their homes thursday 
night while inspectors checked for structural damage 
by this morning norwood fire chief david cartuyvelles said 
everyone was allowed to return to their homes only some businesses 
near the plant remained closed today he said 
most of the evacuees were in norwood a suburb surrounded by 
cincinnati the plant is on the line between the two municipalities 
i thought an airplane hit the building said charles moore 
a resident who said he was in his 80s the concussion knocked me 
out of my chair it sounded like a bomb 
the cause of the explosions in the building on the 9acre site 
remained under investigation 
we dont have any idea what started the blaze basf 
spokesman helmut von moltke said 
the first explosion sent a cloud of thick black smoke pouring 
from a fourstory brick building containing resins and solvents 
about 150 people were in the plant which makes coatings for the 
insides of soft drink cans and for paper cups said kenneth 
diedenhofer a plant production manager 
diedenhofer said the building was engulfed in flames i saw 
one guy hanging from the steps outside the building the steps were 
blown out from the wall his leg was tied into the steps i was 
able to get him out 
a second blast about a halfhour later blew out storefront 
windows as far as a quartermile away in the neighborhood of small 
twostory homes smaller explosions sent balls of fire rolling into 
the sky 
malcolm adcock assistant city health commissioner said 
preliminary findings by city investigators suggested that 
volatile and explosive industrial solvents leaked from a mixing 
vat and were ignited by a spark 
police chief lawrence whalen identified the dead man as lawrence 
d krechting 55 of norwood a basf maintenance worker he 
apparently was killed by flying debris in the building where the 
explosions occurred whalen said 
hospitals in the city reported treating 68 people for burns 
broken bones and cuts caused by flying glass 
three people remained in critical condition today 
the company has accounted for all of the workers who were in the 
plant miller said 
tests by the city and by the ohio environmental protection 
agency showed no toxic fumes in the smoke from the fire miller 
said

the spray of an open fire hydrant for 
generations an escape from urban summer swelter is going the way 
of such lost childhood pleasures as marbles and mumbletypeg 
newark is among a small group of cities that have turned to the 
custodian a magnetic locking device to crack down on the illegal 
diversion of city water from hydrants 
hydrants have long offered children the easiest cheapest way to 
cool down on a summers day but the practice has a dangerous 
downside it diverts water that may be needed to fight fires 
some children say they know about the dangers in opening 
hydrants but they need some relief from the sweltering conditions 
of the city 
they should and they shouldnt do it said latasha harris 
14 who used to play under open hydrants in a way its 
dangerous because people could be hurt in a fire if theres no 
water 
but its hot i mean some people cant afford to go places to 
go swimming they should at least let people use the sprinklers 
that doesnt waste as much water 
officials in newark paterson and passaic in new jersey and in 
boston chicago and kansas city mo say the magnetic lock that 
slips over the top of a fire hydrant has sharply reduced the amount 
of water loss the lock comes equipped with a key wrench which is 
needed to open the hydrant they are also used in washington dc 
and new haven conn 
this is the first thing weve found so far that has worked 
said bob kerns director of the kansas city board of public 
utilities 
installing 1500 caps on the most popular of the citys 5200 
hydrants saved newark enough money on salaries repairs and water 
to pay for the devices said andrew pappachen a supervising 
engineer in the water department 
hydrashield manufacturing inc of irving texas sells the 
custodian and its special wrench for about 500 said salesman ron 
green sales primarily have been in northeastern cities he said 
the average number of open hydrant reports on a typical summer 
weekend dropped from 200 two years ago to 10 this summer said 
newark fire department spokesman larry krieger 
vandals have used blow torches chain saws drills and 
sledgehammers to damage the locking device officials said but 
only on a few occasions have they succeeded in getting water from 
the hydrants 
some people really attack them said mark durham of the 
chicago water department there have been cases where hydrants 
were damaged and rendered inoperable but no water was lost 
the custodian is an improvement over earlier hydrant security 
devices said wendell inhoffer general superintendent of the 
passaic valley water commission which installed 400 caps in 
paterson and passaic 
some early devices needed scissor wrenches to open so we made 
sure all the fire departments had them the kids found a way to 
open them with coat hangers inhoffer said 
illegal taps were virtually eliminated in boston after the caps 
were installed on all hydrants in public housing projects said 
fred famolare an aide to the fire departments deputy chief 
but nothings foolproof weve noticed lately that some people 
are putting a large magnet on top of the hydrant and then using a 
plumbers wrench famolare said 
boston firefighters also have discovered a new problem 
outoftown fire companies helping boston units have found they 
cannot open the hydrants famolare said wrenches are being supplied 
open hydrants can spew more than 1000 gallons of water a minute 
and reduce water pressure in a system a potentially dangerous 
problem when there is a fire 
in newark krieger said community groups are no longer allowed 
to open hydrants with sprinkler caps the drain on the water 
system was tremendous he said

two federal health agencies say they 
wont investigate an outbreak of a rare cancer suffered by three 
babies here unless asked to do so by the state health department 
the cancer neuroblastoma strikes the adrenal glands and 
nervous system and occurs primarily in children under age 10 
usually found in just nine of every million children three 
children under the age of 22 months in this central illinois city 
of 11000 suffer from it 
earlier this week some residents petitioned the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta to study whether the cancer might be 
linked to a hazardous waste site in town which the ill children 
live near 
some residents of the town 50 miles south of springfield fear 
the cancer may be caused by a former coal gasification plant of 
central illinois public service co where contamination was found 
in surrounding soil and water 
on thursday representatives of the cdc and the federal agency 
for toxic substances and disease registry said the petition for 
help probably wont bring an immediate response 
the illinois department of public health this spring completed 
an initial health assessment and is reviewing all cancer cases 
childhood cancers and the neuroblastoma in taylorville it doesnt 
plan to ask for federal help until the studies are completed in 
two to three months 
the taylorville children diagnosed with neuroblastoma since 
march 1989 are 8monthold erika may 22monthold zachary 
donaldson and 7monthold chad hryhorysak erika and zachary have 
been successfully treated chad is undergoing chemotherapy 
the condition can be fatal if left untreated but usually can be 
caught in time all three children lived within three miles of the 
abandoned plant when they got sick

communist north korea on friday 
dismissed as propaganda a south korean proposal to open temporarily 
the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula for 45 
years 
south korea offered to open its border at the border village of 
panmunjom for five days beginning aug 13 allowing north koreans 
to travel freely anywhere in the south 
the korean border is the last major outpost of the cold war 
guarded by more than 1 million troops on either side behind 
concrete bunkers and barbed wire 
neither side has ever allowed citizens to freely visit the other 
side and there is no telephone mail or any other communications 
between the two 
only once in 1985 the koreas exchanged 151 people from each 
side for the first reunion of separated families in their capitals 
south koreas president roh taewoo suggested the fiveday 
border opening as a trial period it would include aug 15 
symbolically important to both koreas as the day that ended 35 
years of japanese colonial rule 
panmunjom the korean war truce village is in the demilitarized 
zone located 35 miles north of seoul the village is manned by 
us south korean and north korean soldiers and is the site for 
sporatic northsouth talks 
no civilians can enter the area without approval 
the time has come to end total division roh said in a radio 
and television address korea must not remain the worlds only 
land still partitioned by cold war politics 
north koreas pyongyang radio monitored in tokyo called rohs 
offer a fradulant propaganda ploy 
the official north korean news agency reacting to rohs offer 
urged the demolition of barriers along the border the repeal of 
south korean security laws that forbid unauthorized travel to the 
north and the release of prisoners jailed for making such visits 
but the korean central news agency report used unusually polite 
and restrained language typically the agency refers to roh as a 
traitor however fridays story referred to him as the south 
korean chief executive 
south korea said it had suggested the two sides meet july 30 to 
discuss the borderopening offer two weeks ago north korea 
offered to open a small portion of its border beginning aug 15 at 
panmunjom but with passage to be restricted 
the two koreas have already scheduled a meeting july 26 to sign 
an accord setting up the first meeting of the two countries prime 
ministers expected to be held in seoul as early as august 
radical south korean students claimed rohs announcement was 
aimed at diverting public attention from troubled domestic 
politics they demanded the immediate release of all political 
prisoners including a student and a pastor jailed last year for 
travel to north korea 
lee hongkoo one of rohs top aides said those arrested for 
making illegal trips to north korea would not be released 
korea was divided into communist north korea and capitalist 
south korea in 1945 at the end of world war ii the two fought a 
threeyear civil war in the early 1950s

democratic rep lindy boggs announced today 
she is retiring ending a husbandandwife congressional dynasty 
spanning nearly half a century 
this chapter in my service to the public is ending mrs 
boggs 74 said in a statement released this morning announcing her 
decision not to run again 
this is not the end of my career i will continue to actively 
participate in community activities here and in washington 
the statement said although there are challenges that remain to 
be met together we will go forward 
later she was applauded by a gathering of 150 colleagues 
supporters friends and family when she said i am proud of my 
small role in opening doors to blacks and women 
it had been widely reported in the new orleans media that mrs 
boggs would retire to spend more time with her daughter barbara 
sigmund who is suffering from cancer mrs sigmund is mayor of 
princeton nj 
at the tulane university gathering mrs boggs made no specific 
reference to her daughters illness however she did say that the 
decision to retire was a wrenching one because so many people 
offered to help run her office and campaign and let her take care 
of family obligations 
i dont think i can share with you all of the things that ran 
through my mind because some of them are very personal she said 
mrs boggs is the only white member of congress representing a 
blackmajority district she has been on capitol hill 17 years and 
her withdrawal would offer an opportunity for louisiana to elect 
its first black congressman 
her husband hale then a young new orleans lawyer won the 2nd 
congressional district in 1940 the district covers most of new 
orleans 
he lost a reelection bid in 1942 but reclaimed the job in 
1946 beginning a string of 22 consecutive victories by him or his 
wife 
hale boggs eventually became house majority leader he was 
presumed dead in the disappearance of a plane in alaska in 1972 
mrs boggs took over his seat in march 1973 after winning a 
special election 
she was reelected nine times never getting less than 60 
percent of the ote she was appointed to the house appropriations 
committee which approves federal spending 
apart from her political strength some black potential 
candidates have not challenged mrs boggs out of respect for the 
familys steady support of civil rights issues 
but two blacks have already announced their candidacies this 
year state sen jon johnson and lawyer marc morial a son of the 
late mayor dutch morial state sen william jefferson had said he 
would probably enter the race if mrs boggs stepped out

federal and state environmental officials 
announced an agreement today intended to clear the way for the 
cleanup of dioxincontaminated times beach which has been an 
untouched ghost town since 1983 
morris kay regional director of the federal environmental 
protection agency announced the settlement with syntex 
agribusiness inc a palo alto califbased chemical and animal 
health company at a news conference 
todays agreement calls for syntex to incinerate the 
dioxincontaminated soil from times beach and 27 other sites in 
eastern missouri syntex will design and build the incinerator at 
times beach and then tear it down and remove it when the cleanup 
is complete 
times beach about 20 miles southwest of st louis made 
headlines seven years ago when health officials discovered that 
dioxin in waste oil had been sprayed on the towns streets 
the federal government bought out the town 801 homes and 
businesses in 1983 and began trying to figure out how to clean up 
the contaminated streets 
syntex which was not the producer of the dioxin became 
involved in the settlement because it leased a plant owned by one 
of its subsidiaries to a company that produced the dioxin as a 
byproduct in making a disinfectant 
under federal environmental laws syntex is considered a 
responsible party 
we very pleased with the agreement and we believe the 
agreement addresses the local peoples concern kay said were 
not going to allow anything thats unsafe 
the epa has said the entire cleanup of times beach and other 
missouri sites will cost about 118 million and could take up to 10 
years syntex estimates it will take seven years 
the company declined to say how much it expects to spend on the 
cleanup 
we have accepted this settlement because it allows us to use 
our scientific and technical expertise to help rid missouri of 
contamination said syntex spokesman ray forrester 
the agreement was first proposed in 1988 but negotiations 
public hearings and other required procedures had to be held before 
todays settlement could be reached 
although the settlement brings the start of work closer it 
remains unclear when the first loads of soil will actually be 
burned 
a 30day comment period is required before the company can even 
take the next step which is to look for a company to design and 
build the temporary incinerator 
and some people who live near times beach have threatened to 
file lawsuits to block the project saying that the incinerator is 
unsafe and may never be dismantled 
theres no doubt in my mind that it will be permanent said 
barney nelson mayor of nearby eureka

a bomb blew a hole in the london stock exchange on 
friday but no one was injured and trading hummed along without 
interruption on computers a telephone caller earlier had warned of 
an ira bomb 
authorities rushed to the exchange and evacuated scores of 
traders and other employees just minutes before the market was to 
open to hundreds of visitors 
glass and chunks of concrete showered down on old broad street 
in the heart of the citys financial district the stock exchange 
index was up for the day but options trading was suspended until 
monday 
five hours after the blast employees returned to the building 
if the purpose of this callous act was to bring the city 
financial district to a halt they have failed singularly said 
andrew hugh smith chairman of the stock exchange 
george churchillcoleman commander of scotland yards 
antiterrorist unit said the bomb had been planted in a mens 
restroom in a visitors area and contained 5 to 10 pounds of high 
explosives 
asked if he believed the irish republican army was responsible 
churchillcoleman said that is a reasonable assumption 
police evacuated the building and cordoned off streets after the 
first warning was received at 802 am the bomb exploded at 849 
just 11 minutes before the visitors area was scheduled to open 
we had only half an hour to reach the scene evacuate the 
building and clear the surrounding streets said police commander 
hugh moore if we have been a few minutes later getting there it 
would have been too late 
police firefighters evacuated workers and sightseers jammed 
the districts narrow streets marked out centuries ago for foot 
and horse traffic hundreds of commuters were delayed in cars and 
buses caught in traffic jams 
churchillcoleman said a man with an irish accent made warning 
calls to a newspaper a news agency the fire brigade police the 
salvation army and the stock exchange police said the caller used 
a code word to confirm that it was an ira attack 
there had been no warning before the iras bomb attack june 25 
at the carlton club a gathering place for britains governing 
conservative party the ira seeking to undermine support for 
british rule in northern ireland generally has concentrated its 
attacks on government and military targets 
churchillcoleman said it was the first time in recent years 
that a code had been given with the warning 
police said the bomb destroyed the mens room next to the public 
visitors gallery which was heavily damaged 
the explosion tore a jagged hole about 20 feet high and seven 
feet wide in the modern concrete building about 10 feet above 
ground level 
liz rowe 26 a trader at sumitomo trust in the royal bank of 
scotland building opposite the exchange said police told her to 
run but she had only traveled half a block when the bomb went off 
it was not as loud as i would have thought it sounded like 
loads of scaffolding falling ms rowe said 
joe phillips a 21yearold options trader said a recorded 
warning was broadcast inside the exchange 
normally they say this was a test but a proper voice came on 
the tannoy address system saying this is not a test get out of 
the building he said 
there had been 30 to 40 people on the trading floor standing 
around reading the financial times looking at their screens and 
waiting for trading to start phillips said 
churchillcoleman said the restroom had been cleaned friday 
morning but nothing suspicious had been reported by the cleaning 
crew it was not known when the device had been planted he said 
a uniformed guard normally searches bags and parcels carried by 
visitors before they enter the gallery which accomodated up to 100 
people 
stock exchange staff enter through a separate entrance and are 
required to show their photo identification cards a spokeswoman 
for the stock exchange said 
security television cameras are used in the exchange but they do 
not make videotape recordings churchillcoleman said he said 
police had found no witnesses to the planting of the device 
churchillcoleman said posters advertising a confidential 
telephone number to report suspicious activities were going up 
around london 
the public must be our eyes and ears he said somebody 
out there knows where these individuals are 
police have made similar pleas after other ira bombings 
there is clear evidence that people are being vigilant said 
a scotland yard press spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity we are attending a large number of false alarms we 
have always said wed rather attend a large number of false alarms 
and it is clear people are keeping their eyes open and being 
careful

president corazon aquino on friday 
defended her government against criticism that it has been tardy 
and ineffective in aiding victims of a devastating earthquake that 
killed nearly 700 people 
let us not blame others she said in a nationally televised 
address her first since mondays quake what we need to do now 
is help each other 
five days after the earthquake measuring 77 on the richter 
scale officials said reports of damage and deaths were still 
trickling in from remote areas by latest counts 674 people were 
killed and more than 2600 injured 
mrs aquino ordered several aides to take over relief 
operations apparently bypassing the disastercoordinating agency 
led by defense secretary fidel ramos 
the president already beset by communist rebels rebellious 
military officers and popular discontent has come under criticism 
for a government rescue effort described by many as inadequate 
the rescuers for their part battled poor communications 
fatigue supply shortages and and equipment problems 
on friday a us marine ov1 observation plane taking part in 
rescue operations crashed near baguio killing one of the two 
crewmen the victims name was not released pending notification of 
kin and the cause of the crash was under investigation 
also friday a helicopter carrying ramos on an inspection tour 
made an emergency landing after a cockpit warning light came on 
ramos transferred to another aircraft and continued his tour 
both incidents were near the mountain resort of baguio 130 
miles north of manila 
rescuers in baguio dug through the night after finding fresh 
blood in a tunnel they had dug under the rubble of the hyatt hotel 
indicating there could be victims alive in the debris 
but they found only the bodies of a man and a woman as many as 
50 people were believed to have been caught in the hotel when the 
quake struck 
members of a british rescue team said it was unlikely there were 
any survivors in the rubble of seven other baguio hotels that 
collapsed during the quake 
at least 224 people including two americans were killed in 
baguio during the quake in addition more than 120 were feared 
dead in eight factories of the baguio export processing zone which 
caught fire during the quake 
power was restored to parts of baguio and banks resumed 
operations but more aftershocks rocked the city terrifying the 
citys 120000 people many refused to sleep indoors 
more than 100 people were believed stranded on highways near 
baguio and marines and philippine troops mounted rescue operations 
officials said more than 900 people also were feared stranded in 
a mountain pass along the border of nueva vizcaya and nueva ecija 
provinces 
rebels who tried to topple mrs aquino in december offered a 
truce to help with the relief effort 
the underground revolutionary alliance of the massessoldiers of 
the filipino people said in a statement that during this time of 
national tragedy the rebels would suspend antigovernment 
activity 
many leaders of the rebel movement are graduates of the 
philippine military academy located in hardhit baguio 
heavy casualties were also concentrated in cabanatuan 60 miles 
north of manila where more than 60 students and teachers were 
killed at the philippine christian college 
one girl who was injured at the college told abscbn television 
that her class was in the middle of a lesson on earthquakes when 
the quake struck and the classroom collapsed

the mayor stopped selling bat guano 
because of health concerns but officials say small amounts of the 
natural fertilizer pose little danger 
mayor jay deyoe stopped filling orders for the bat droppings 
this week after a delaware woman warned that the brown gritty 
substance could spread the fungal disease histoplasmosis 
i got to thinking that if there was any possibility we might 
be doing something that might be hurting somebody we ought to 
check it out deyoe said thursday 
however histoplasmosis is very rare in the west and the chance 
of getting it from a small amount of bat guano is remote said gary 
stevens program manager for jackson county health departments 
environmental health services 
the disease is normally common in individuals exposed to large 
quantitites of chicken manure or bat guano and some type of 
disruptive activity such as mining it or removing large quantitites 
where there is lots of airborn potential exposure he said 
jacqueline burgess called city hall from marydel del after 
reading about the bat guano in her local newspaper which also 
published a picture of deyoe sniffing a bag of droppings 
it really concerned me that he was doing this she said in a 
telephone interview years down the line he could get it 
eight years ago burgess underwent laser surgery to repair a 
blood vessel in her eye damaged by histoplasmosis she said she 
probably contracted it as a child when she lived near chicken coops 
in southern delaware 
histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal disease that begins in the 
lungs and can spread to other organs according to the encyclopedia 
and dictionary of medicine nursing and allied health it can cause 
pneumonia and is sometimes fatal 
the disease is caused by the inhalation of contaminated dust and 
is common in the rural midwest the dictionary said 
stevens said he was working with the national centers for 
disease control and the state health division to learn how to 
sterilize the bat guano and make it safe to gather if all goes 
well sales could resume by next week he said 
more than 20 orders of the 1 and 5 bags are waiting to be 
filled said deyoe 
an employee of this 1000resident town discovered a mother lode 
of bat manure in a gold hill cave recently and deyoe decided to 
sell it to help support the police department which has only one 
paid officer and six volunteers

a problem with ground equipment 
delayed todays blastoff of an atlas rocket at least an hour 
putting off the rockets commercial launch debut on a flight to 
carry a satellite that will illuminate earths magnetic field 
nasa and general dynamics had planned to launch the unmanned 
rocket from cape canaveral air force station sometime between 333 
and 346 pm but workers could not start a compressor that 
furnishes gaseous nitrogen to the rocket to keep the satellite cool 
if the compressor can be started in time officials planned to 
try to launch the rocket during the next opportunity a 12minute 
period beginning at 449 pm that will be the last chance for 
liftoff until saturday afternoon 
the threeyear science mission costing about 258 million 
comes at a critical time for nasa the space agency is under attack 
for the crippled hubble space telescope and a shuttle fleet that 
until this week had been grounded by fuel leaks 
i dont think weve felt any additional stress nasa manager 
sid saucier said thursday but we have a job to do and we know 
what is required to get the job done weve tried to make sure that 
everything was done according to the game plan 
the atlas 1 rocket was to boost the combined release and 
radiation effects satellite known as crres to an elliptical orbit 
217 miles by 22236 miles high 
the satellite is a joint program of the national aeronautics and 
space administration and the defense department 
nasa is overseeing the satellites release of 24 aluminum 
canisters at various altitudes during the next year one or two 
canisters will be ejected at a time releasing chemicals that will 
form large glowing clouds similar in appearance to the aurora 
borealis or the northern lights 
the clouds will spread along earths invisible magnetic field 
lines making them visible to the naked eye 
scientists will study the clouds interaction with charged 
particles in the ionosphere and magnetosphere 
the first canisters will be released in september over the south 
pacific the first releases visible over north america will be in 
early 1991 
two such releases already have been made over northern canada 
originating from a pegasus airlaunched rocket in april unmanned 
sounding rockets will drop similar canisters this summer and again 
in 1991 
air force instruments aboard the 2ton satellite will probe the 
van allen radiation belts encircling earth microelectronic 
components also will be exposed to space radiation to determine 
whether they could fail in future flights 
the satellite originally was to have been deployed in 1987 from 
the space shuttle but the 1986 challenger disaster pushed back the 
mission by more than five years and program managers opted for a 
quicker launch and redesigned the satellite to fit into the atlas 
under a barter agreement the san diegobased general dynamics 
space systems division received atlas spare parts and ground 
support equipment from nasa in exchange for two launches 
the atlas 1 rocket was to have gone up in june a series of 
problems including a damaged pressurization line and 
malfunctioning software delayed the mission until july 
todays launch was to be the eighth commercial rocket launch by 
an american company 
mcdonnell douglas sent up the nations first commercial rocket 
a delta last august martin marietta followed four months later 
with its titan

in one of the worlds most 
quakeprone nations the study of earthquakes and their effects 
commands so little government attention that only one of its 12 
seismic stations has a telephone 
the us geological survey said about 30 significant earthquakes 
have struck the philippines since 1976 including a strong quake 
that devastated central luzon island last monday killing nearly 
700 people 
raymundo punongbayan director of the institute of vulcanology 
and seismology acknowledged that despite frequent quakes there 
was little interest in studying then 
we have to know how to deal with earthquakes and prepare for 
this punongbayan said we are so helpless 
while modern seismological institutes use computers digital 
monitoring devices and acoustical sensors to measure quakes 
punongbayan said his staff must rely on 15yearold instruments 
the institute operates 12 seismological stations nationwide the 
station on leyte island 350 miles south of manila is the only one 
with a telephone he said 
the philippines lies along the socalled pacific ring of fire 
where 80 percent of the worlds quakes occur between 1966 and 
1988 the philippines which lies on 10 faults and tremor tracks 
recorded 9678 quakes or an average of five a day 
first reports of earthquakes in the philippines often come from 
monitoring services in hong kong or the united states 
last february a quake measuring 69 on the richter scale shook 
central philippine islands the quake was first reported by 
seismologists in australia 
punongbayan says his institute got first word of it when manila 
radio stations telephoned for confirmation 
punongbayan said his institute established in 1986 is alloted 
less than 1 percent of the 114 billion national budget before 
1986 the onstitute was an obscure department of the manila weather 
service

mayor marion barry on friday signed a law 
requiring larger businesses to provide up to four months of unpaid 
leave for workers seeking time off to care for ill family members 
including gay partners 
too many employees have had to choose between caring for their 
families and keeping their jobs barry said 
the legislation which sponsors said was the broadest of its 
kind in the country would apply to workers who want leave to care 
for a family member including newborns ill relatives or 
partners in committed relationships federal workers are not 
covered 
this is a very compassionate piece of legislation designed to 
protect those who are often most vulnerable working women gays 
children the elderly said ivy young spokeswoman for the 
national gay and lesbian task force 
the measure also would provide the same leave for an employee 
unable to work because of serious illness 
district officials could not say how many of the estimated 
320000 civilian work force would be affected 
the district measure is broader than legislation passed by 
congress but recently vetoed by president bush that bill 
envisioned leaves up to three months in fewer circumstances 
the house is scheduled to vote wednesday in an attempt to 
override the presidential veto but bill supporters say they 
probably wont have enough votes 
the district law would apply immediately to businesses with at 
least 50 employees including the city government compliance 
would be required after three years by businesses with 20 employees 
claudia withers spokeswoman for the womens legal defense fund 
a public policy advocacy group that monitors laws dealing with 
family and womens issues praised the bill 
although we always think that paid leave is best we think 
itll be the best in the nation she said 
however pedro alfonso president of the local chamber of 
commerce said the bill goes too far 
its going to be a tremendous burden on many of the small 
businesses which wont be able to afford to carry the costs of 
just letting employees go he said 
all district of columbia legislation is subject to override by 
congress but there was no immediate indication whether an attempt 
would be made to do so in this case

hundreds of prodemocracy campaigners held 
their first legalized public meeting friday and said they would 
form an alliance to fight for the end of two decades of oneparty 
rule 
the changes in the soviet union eastern europe and south 
africa have woken us up from years of indifference and 
despondency said former finance minister arthur wina 
in what wina called an atmosphere of utmost urgency labor 
leaders businessmen lawyers academics and at least two other 
former ministers attended the gathering at a motel hall outside 
lusaka the capital 
the meeting follows president kenneth kaundas end tuesday to a 
ban on multiparty campaigning for the oct 17 referendum on 
zambias political future in recent months protests have broken 
out in zambia and several other subsaharan african states 
demanding an end to traditional oneparty rule 
speakers who denounced oneparty rule and demanded an end to a 
26yearold state of emergency received prolonged applause from 
about 300 people in the crowded motel hall 
conferees gave a standing ovation to a founder of the ruling 
united national independence party who declared a new allegiance to 
reform 
i was once an advocate of a oneparty system said farmer 
and businessman simon zukas however i would like to apologize 
to the nation for the stand i have taken because it was wrong 
the ruling party has been zambias only legal political 
organization since 1973 
frederick chiluba head of the powerful zambia congress of trade 
unions said reformers were demanding the government give up its 
emergency powers before the october referendum 
he said their were fears the referendum would not be conducted 
fairly and called for the presence of international observers to 
monitor the polling 
last month south africa ended a state of emergency in all but 
one province and neighboring zimbabwe earlier this week said it 
would give up 25yearold emergency powers on wednesday 
in april kaunda announced plans for the referendum and banned 
public debate on the issue until arrangements for the vote were 
worked out 
the government drew sharp criticism from conferees friday for 
apparently refusing to update the voters roll 
voters were last registered in 1987 for parliamentary elections 
that took place the following year 
many of those attending the meeting friday said they would not 
be allowed to vote in the referendum because they deliberatly had 
not registered under the oneparty system 
about 26 million people in this southern african nation of 75 
million are registered as voters 
the gathering organized by a group calling itself the emerging 
alliance for democracy and development disputed claims by kaunda 
that pluralism will cause tribal strife and factional fighting 
we represent a new breed of zambians for whom tribe is not a 
factor in politics we are talking about national issues said 
akashamba lewanika head of the zambia economics association a 
private business lobby 
zambia in june experienced the worst civil unrest since 
independence from british colonial rule in 1964 
at least 26 people died in police and army gunfire during 
studentled demonstrations protesting food price increases and 
continued oneparty rule

the city horticulturist wants thieves to 
leave the municipal parks alone 
the theft of plants from the parks is growing so fast the 
citys greenhouse sometimes gets bare 
park director melvin miller said that shrubbery seems to be the 
most popular loot because the plants are easy to yank tulips 
roses and trees also are stolen 
no sooner do we plant a bush than someone comes and rips it 
out miller said 
along one boulevard the average life of a shrub is about an 
hour and a half said alex vare landscape architect 
i guess when everybodys yard is filled up theyll leave the 
parks alone said carl mattil birminghams horticulturist 
we used to be able to go out once a month with about 25 plants 
and replace all the ones that had died or been stolen he said

the founder of the movie industrys rating 
system said friday that moviegoers can be assured the system will 
continue to operate despite a judges recommendations it be revised 
or abandoned 
there is no evidence that american parents are clamoring for 
change said jack valenti president of the motion picture 
association of america and creator of the 22yearold rating system 
valenti said that film critics and a few movie distributors 
criticize the system but that parents have consistently praised it 
as very useful in deciding what movies their children should 
see 
the mpaas rating system was upheld but strongly criticized 
thursday by new york supreme court judge charles ramos who said he 
lacked the authority to change the x rating given to a spanish 
film tie me up tie me down 
the movies american distributor miramax film corp and its 
producerdirector pedro almodovar had asked the court to change 
the rating saying the designation was arbitrary capricious 
unfair and a form of censorship 
earlier this week the national society of film critics in a 
letter to valenti and richard heffner head of the ratings board 
recommended a new a rating for nonpornographic adultsonly movies 
in his ruling ramos strongly advised there be some 
revisions or abandonment of the present system 
the rating systems categories have been fashioned by the 
motion picture industry to create an illusion of concern for 
children imposing censorship yet all the while facilitating the 
marketing of exploitive and violent films with an industry seal of 
approval he added 
the judge noted there are no physicians child psychiatrists or 
childcare professionals on mpaas 11member ratings board 
valenti contended that the judge and others err in concluding 
that the system was designed to protect children 
our mission is very simple we try to give some advance 
cautionary warning to parents and parents make the decision about 
what pictures their children should and should not see he said 
the association said its ratings board is comprised of 
parents but wont reveal the identities or other details of 
individual members 
the plan provides for five rating categories g for general 
audiences with all ages admitted pg13 which cautions parents 
about viewing by children 12 and under pg for mature audiences 
with parental guidance suggested r for restricted audiences in 
which children under 16 must be accompanied by parent or guardian 
and x in which no one under 16 is admitted

republican chairman lee atwater named his best 
friend as chief spokesman for the party on friday saying the gop 
needs a highprofile presence that he cant provide while hes 
fighting a brain tumor 
atwater 39 said gop consultant charles black would serve as 
his and the partys spokesman until he can return to work fulltime 
atwater said his medical treatment does not allow him to be a 
daily spokesman and that role is too important to let slip as we 
head toward election day 
the gop move comes as the party tries to cope with internal 
splits on taxes and abortion as well as assaults from the democrats 
on the savings and loan scandal and other issues 
atwater who has been spending his limited work time developing 
strategy and advising the white house has urged the party to take 
the offensive against the democrats 
for the last 18 years charlie black has been my best friend 
and political eyes and ears ive now asked him to also be my 
mouthpiece atwater 39 said in a statement charlie speaks 
for me and for the party 
black has been the senior consultant to the republican national 
committee since atwater became chairman 18 months ago in his new 
more public role black will be available to the media and give 
occasional speeches 
atwater said his recovery is going well but he still must spend 
several hours each day in physical therapy 
a parade of officials including black vice president dan 
quayle rnc chief of staff mary matalin and others tried to put 
the party on the offensive as the republicans held their midyear 
meeting in chicago last week 
atwater pronounced the meeting a roaring success 
watching it all made it clear to me the need to have the 
strongest possible spokesmen available to carry our message to the 
public on a daytoday basis he said 
black said the chicago meeting and the approach of the campaign 
season prompted atwaters move we need more spokesmen more 
people out there carrying the ball he said 
asked in atwater was being supplanted black said no not 
since its me hes designated to speak for him ive been his alter 
ego all along even before he got sick if he was too busy or 
traveling or something id be the guy to do it a lot of times 
this is just formalizing what ive been doing 
black said atwater would do occasional interviews but he said 
the rnc chairman would spend most of his limited time and energy as 
a behindthescenes party strategist 
rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said blacks new visibility will 
be an enhancement of his role not a diminution of anybody 
elses he will continue his work as a gop consultant and attend 
to party business as needed she said 
in his statement atwater said his doctors have determined that 
my tumor has stopped growing and is dying in an interview this 
week with the columbia sc state he said he might be able to 
work five to eight hours a day by midaugust 
i feel good the doctors are optimistic im optimistic 
atwater told the newspaper but this is a big enemy im not 
going to say anything premature

the federal government will ask private groups 
and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the 
nations historic battlefields interior secretary manuel lujan 
said friday 
the american battlefield protection plan eventually will 
cover all wars fought on us soil but will begin by focusing on 
25 key civil war sites lujan said 
because the government cant afford to buy all the land 
involved he said a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the 
farms and fields where union and confederate soldiers fought arent 
overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks 
we want the governors local governments foundations 
corporations and owners to all join lujan said in an interview 
on nbctvs today program 
some of the battlefields for example would be purchased but 
some of them can be commemorated simply by easements some of them 
maybe the owner would want us to put a plaque there commemorating 
that particular battle he said we dont have enough money 
just to go off and buy all these sites 
details of his plan which includes a request for 15 million in 
seed money will be explained saturday when lujan speaks at 
manassas national battlefield park in virginia in ceremonies 
marking the 129th anniversary of the first battle of bull run 
lujan said he also planned to discuss his ideas with the 
governors of the states where the sites to be protected are located 
florence kennedy director of the battlefield preservation drive 
for the private conservation fund praised lujans project 
i think the secretarys initiative is a very important one 
because its placing great importance on partnership she said in 
an interview this partnership cooperation will be a catalyst to 
encourage private sector cooperation 
a bitter fight broke out in 1988 over a developers plans to 
build a mall on land adjacent to the manassas park congress later 
voted to add the disputed tract to the park with a final cost 
expected to exceed 100 million 
i was in the congress when we went through the manassas 
fight said lujan who represented a new mexico district in the 
house of representatives for 20 years 
at that time i thought it was the worst way to do it its 
more expensive you have to file suits if we have a planned 
program everything works much better he said 
as an example of the better way lujan cited the richard king 
mellon foundations donation to the federal government three weeks 
ago of 10 parcels of land including important sites from the civil 
war battles of antietem and gettysburg 
lujans plan has four parts 
encouraging creative public and private landuse tools such 
as zoning easements landbanking and historic district 
designation to protect imminently threatened sites 
distribute information on public and private projects to 
protect battlefields 
use limited federal funds to encourage land purchases by 
private conservation organizations and other public agencies 
develop a national strategy to protect other significant 
battlefield sites that arent imminently threatened but may be in 
the future

east germanys defense minister told a batch 
of army recruits friday to put justice ahead of blind obedience and 
remember the officer who once tried to kill adolf hitler 
people in east and west germany marked a rare moment of 
resistance to an evil dictatorship by commemorating the 46th 
anniversary of a famous attempt on the nazi rulers life 
rainer eppelmann a clergyman and pacifist who is now defense 
minister in east germanys new democratic government used the 
anniversary to make a point as he swore in 400 new soldiers 
he told them not to let unthinking obedience to authority dull 
their sense of right and wrong he said soldiers should reconcile 
the need for order and obedience with law and conscience 
with that members of the national peoples army stand in the 
tradition of the men who opposed the nazi dictator he said 
eppelmann at a ceremony in the city of strausberg just outside 
berlin swore in the first batch of army recruits who were asked to 
defend democracy rather than communism 
the traditional pledge of the peoples army was rewritten to 
reflect the democratic revolt that overthrew the communist 
government last autumn 
the july 20 1944 attempt on hitlers life was supported by a 
group of highranking german officers some of whom had earlier 
supported the dictator 
it came after the german army had suffered several military 
reverses during world war ii 
col claus schenk von stauffenberg a german count put a 
briefcase containing a bomb at hitlers feet during a conference 
then went outside the headquarters room to answer a prearranged 
phone call 
another officer then inadvertantly moved the briefcase because 
it was in his way it was placed behind a partition that shielded 
hitler from the blast he survived and staggered from the rubble 
the attempt was one of several made on hitlers life but it was 
the one that came closest to success 
in east berlin east german lawmakers stood up in a salute to 
the wouldbe assassins 
the heritage of these men and women of july 20 should oblige 
us to fight dictatorships in every form to keep peace in germany 
and europe forever said a declaration endorsed by all parties in 
parliament 
west german chancellor helmut kohl also praised the 
assassination plotters in a statement from the west german capital 
bonn 
the men and women of the german resistance gave in dark times 
a shining example of their unshakeable yearning for freedom he 
said 
hitler killed himself in 1945 as allied troops marched on 
berlin nazi germany was divided and now east germany and west 
germany are preparing to unify in december 
kohl sought to put the anniversary in a historical perspective 
of german unification fortysix years after july 20 1944 we 
are entering a new epoch in the history of our nation

the house ethics committee recommended today 
that rep barney frank dmass be reprimanded for aspects of his 
relationship with a male prostitute 
committee chairman julian c dixon dcalif said the committee 
voted unanimously for a full house reprimand of frank an 
acknowledged homosexual the recommendation will go to the house 
floor next week for a vote on whether to accept it 
the committee said frank violated a house rule stating that a 
member shall conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall 
reflect creditably on the house of representatives 
frank violated that rule the committee said when he 
used his congressional privilege to fix 33 parking tickets 
incurred by male prostitute stephen l gobie when gobie was using 
the lawmakers automobile for nonhouserelated business frank 
who used gobie as a personal aide paid with the lawmakers own 
funds was ordered to make restitution of an unspecified amount to 
the district of columbia 
frank has admitted there were occasions when he had parking 
tickets waived but he said that only happened when gobie used the 
congressmans car for official business frank said tickets gobie 
received for nonofficial business were paid 
wrote an april 16 1986 memorandum to the commwealths 
attorney in alexandria va that contained misleading statements 
favorable to gobie the misleading statements could be perceived 
as an attempt to use political influence to affect the outcome of 
the administration of mr gobies probation the committee said 
there was no immediate reaction from frank who was traveling to 
boston and scheduled a news conference for late in the afternoon 
expulsion is the most severe punishment the committee have 
recommended the next most serious would be censure in which a 
member stands before his colleagues to hear the speaker read a 
letter condemning his conduct the third most serious is reprimand 
the decision followed a 10month investigation that was one of 
the most troubling in the history of the committee on standards of 
official conduct 
in considering whether franks behavior brought discredit upon 
the house the panel had to judge conduct that largely was personal 
between the liberal lawmaker and gobie 
two key aspects of the case involved official actions however 
frank said he paid gobie 80 for sex in 1985 and then hired him 
as a housekeeper and driver with personal funds in an effort to 
improve his life 
he said he fired gobie in august 1987 after learning that his 
aide was running a prostitution ring out of the lawmakers capitol 
hill apartment 
frank repeatedly has denied gobies allegation that he was aware 
of the prostitution operation and submitted testimony by his 
landlady saying the lawmaker was stunned to learn of the 
activity 
for months the committee was unable to reach a consensus and 
for a time those favoring a milder letter of rebuke appeared to 
have the upper hand but it gradually became apparent to chairman 
julian c dixon dcalif and others that the rebuke lacked the 
necessary votes 
a reprimand would not satisfy the houses most conservative 
lawmakers however 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif will be ready when the 
committee report reaches the floor to propose expulsion instead 
said his spokesman paul mero that normally is reserved for those 
convicted of serious crimes 
frank a fiveterm liberal democrat from suburban boston is one 
of two acknowledged homosexual members of the house the other 
member rep gerry studds dmass was censured for an affair with 
a male page 
frank is seeking reelection in a race against republican john 
soto who has never held public office and who was soundly defeated 
two years ago in a bid for state representative in his home town 
six members of the house have been reprimanded previously a 
relatively recent punishment that was first used in 1976

julianne delio said her husband made her 
promise she would never let him live in a vegetative state 
connected to artificial life support machines 
keeping that promise took more than a year of court battles 
cost delio her job and left the 36yearold new york woman 
emotionally brutalized she told a senate subcommittee on friday 
you cannot imagine the psychological trauma involved in 
pleading for the death of the person you love most in this entire 
world she said 
delio urged lawmakers to pass a bill that would help inform 
people of their right to determine their own medical treatment 
through such things as living wills and other advance directives 
that legally enable others to speak for them if they cannot speak 
for themselves 
but an official of the health care financing administration 
which handles medicaid and medicare said the bill could allow some 
patients to be pressed into making a hasty choice 
living wills moved to the forefront of medical issues with the 
supreme courts decision last month denying the family of nancy 
cruzan their request to have her feeding tubes removed cruzan is 
permanently unconscious but is not terminally ill and could live 
for years in this condition doctors say 
julianne and her husband daniel were well educated both with 
doctorate degrees and working in the medical field but he like 
nancy cruzan did not have a living will and had never put his 
wishes in writing delio said 
we were young and enjoying a happy life she said who 
would have known what was to happen to us 
in 1986 when danny delio was 33 he underwent a minor operation 
because of a problem with the anesthesia he was left brain dead 
permanently unconscious she said 
his life was essentially over she said of her husband a 
phd in exercise physiology an expert in cardiac rehabilitation 
and until then a marathon runner 
she and her husband had had extensive discussions about 
vegetative states and he made me promise never to let him live 
even one day in such a condition she said 
she requested that his lifesupport systems be shut off and he 
be allowed to die but the westchester county medical center 
refused and she filed a lawsuit shortly after that she was fired 
from her job as an assistant professor of medicine at new york 
medical college which is affiliated with the hospital where her 
husband was being treated 
an appeals court eventually agreed with delio and ordered the 
hospital to terminate treatment or transfer her husband to another 
facility that would abide by her wishes ten days after he was 
transferred he died in her arms 
even though the court system eventually worked for us we were 
brutalized by it she said no one should ever have to go to 
court under these circumstances court is the last place a family 
belongs when they are facing their darkest hours 
delio urged the senate finance subcommittee on medicare and 
longterm care to approve legislation that would require the 
federal department of health and human services to develop an 
educational program to give people information about their options 
in determining their own medical treatment 
hospitals nursing homes and other facilities that provide 
services to medicare and medicaid patients would be obligated to 
provide such information as a condition for participating in these 
programs under the bill 
what this issue is about is peoples ability to make their 
wishes known so when they can no longer speak for themselves 
they will already have spoken said sen john danforth rmo 
sponsor of the bill 
this is a communications problem he said its an issue 
of letting people know how they can take steps so that worst 
nightmare doesnt come to pass 
rep sander levin dmich who is sponsoring similar 
legislation in the house said the bill is about empowerment of 
the individual without knowledge there is no power 
gail wilensky who heads the health care financing 
administration testified that while she agrees with the goal of 
educating people about living wills and other advance directives 
she opposed making such activities a federal requirement 
she said the bill does not provide adequate safeguards for poor 
and vulnerable patients who could be pressured into making hasty 
decisions decisions about living wills should be made before 
someone gets to a hospital she said 
wilensky said awareness of living wills was not directly and 
immediately related to quality of care and therefore should not 
be made a requirement for participation in the medicare or medicaid 
programs 
delio took strong exception to that saying if informing 
patients of their rights is not quality of care i dont know what 
is

a man jailed on charges of threatening to 
shoot president bush said friday he did not even know bush was 
going to be in cheyenne 
gregory joseph hill 34 of fremont nh was charged with the 
felony of making a threat to kill the president and was ordered 
held without bond at least until bush completed his trip to 
cheyenne on friday afternoon 
hill is accused of twice telling someone in a cheyenne bar 
wednesday im here to shoot the president 
but the unemployed data processor told us district judge 
clarence brimmer on friday that when he arrived in cheyenne as part 
of a crosscountry trip he did not know the president was planning 
to visit 
i realize the seriousness of this he said i cant 
believe something like this could happen to me im not a violent 
person 
hill was arrested at a motel thursday evening after the man he 
spoke to in the bar reported his statements to secret service 
agents 
a complaint filed in us district court on friday said at the 
time of his arrest hill admitted making the statement 
oh god i should have never said what i did hill was 
quoted as saying at the time of his arrest 
us attorney richard stacy said hill possessed no weapons when 
he was arrested 
brimmer ordered hill held without bond after stacy argued he 
posed a threat to the community and would likely flee the state if 
released on bail 
the judge also agreed with stacy that hill should be held at 
least until bushs departure friday evening and said he would hold 
a bail hearing for hill on saturday or monday 
because this is such a serious matter i will order you to be 
detained without bond at least until the presidents visit is 
over he said while you speak well look well and dont appear 
to be a violent person i have no way of judging that except 
through what you say 
the safest bet for the sake of the nation is to have you 
detained 
if convicted hill could face a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine

a federal appeals court panel today vacated 
oliver norths three irancontra felony convictions and ordered a 
lower court to determine whether his trial was tainted by 
congressional testimony he gave under a grant of immunity one of 
the three was reversed outright 
the 21 ruling ordered a witness by witness hearing into 
whether the evidence presented at norths trial violated his 
constitutional right against selfincrimination 
the former national security council aide was convicted on may 
4 1989 of three of 12 counts stemming from the reagan 
administrations clandestine effort to sell arms to iran and aid 
the nicaraguan contras 
the divided threejudge panel reversed norths conviction on the 
charge of altering and destroying sensitive nsc documents finding 
that us district court judge gerhard gesell gave erroneous jury 
instructions north also was convicted of accepting an illegal 
gratuity and aiding and abetting the obstruction of congress 
the court held that north was entitled to a full hearing on all 
three counts delving into whether his nationally televised 
testimony seeped into the case 
the ruling also could signify problems for the conviction of 
former national security adviser john poindexter who was convicted 
earlier this year of five felonies in the scandal poindexter like 
north gave immunized testimony to congress 
independent counsel lawrence walsh who supervised the 
irancontra investigation said he was considering what his next 
step will be 
everyone familiar with these proceedings has recognized the 
difficulties presented by the grant of immunity by congress he 
said in a statement we have diligently tried to work around 
these difficulties 
he said the irancontra investigation was continuing the grand 
jury hearing the matter was in session friday 
neither north nor his lawyer brendan sullivan was immediately 
available for comment 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel described for 
congress and a spellbound national television audience in july 1987 
how the reagan administration secretly sold arms to iran and then 
used the profits to aid the nicaraguan contras he was guaranteed 
that his testimony would not be used in any criminal case against 
him 
if gesell determines at the hearing that such tainted evidence 
was used to convict north on the other two charges the court said 
he would be entitled to a new trial on those counts as well 
gesell must hold a hearing that will inquire into the 
content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial 
witnesses testimony said the court 
that inquiry must proceed witnessbywitness if necessary it 
will proceed linebyline and itembyitem said the appeals 
court 
we readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior 
to such an undertaking the appeals court said of the prospect of 
such a hearing 
such a proceeding could consume substantial amounts of 
time personnel and money only to lead to the conclusion that a 
defendant perhaps a guilty defendant cannot be prosecuted 
the court said 
the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that 
no use whatsoever was made of any of the immunized testimony 
either by the witness or by the irancontra prosecutors office 
in questioning the witness said the court 
this burden may be met by establishing that the witness was 
never exposed to norths immunized testimony or that the allegedly 
tainted testimony contains no evidence that wasnt obtained 
before north testified the panel added 
unless the district court can make express findings that the 
government has carried this heavy burden as to the content of all 
of the testimony of each witness that testimony cannot survive the 
test said the opinion 
the major rulings were supported by two reagan administration 
appointees david sentelle and laurence silberman chief judge 
patricia wald a carter administration appointee dissented 
north was convicted on may 4 1989 by a federal court jury 
after a twomonth trial and placed on two years probation north 
also was fined 150000 and ordered to perform 1200 hours of 
community service 
the obstruction of congress conviction focused on norths 
concealment of the fact that us officials knew about a 
ciaassisted shipment of hawk missiles from israel to iran at the 
time the delivery was occurring in november 1986 
the gratuity involved his acceptance of a 13800 home security 
system from richard secord whom north had enlisted to airlift arms 
to the contras secord is a retired air force major general turned 
businessman north said he had received terrorist threats against 
his family and that the security system was not compensation for 
his official duties 
on the conviction that it reversed the court held that gesells 
jury instruction allowed the jury to convict without unanimously 
concluding that north committed any one of the criminal acts 
charged in that count 
the jury could have found that north violated the statute in 
several different ways without agreeing unanimously that he 
committed a single illegal act the court said 
the circumstances of his destruction alteration and removal 
of documents were distinct any of those activities could serve as 
an underlying criminal act the court said in its unsigned 
opinion 
the verdict makes it impossible to determine whether the jury 
agreed unanimously that north who claimed that he considered his 
actions lawful actually intended to violate the law when he 
altered or destroyed documents the majority said 
wald said that i am satisfied that north received a fair 
trial not a perfect one but a competently managed and a fair 
one she said north received all of the constitutional 
protections to which he was entitled 
as in all trials of this magnitude a few errors were made 
but i do not find singly or cumulatively that any of them 
rose to the status of reversible error said wald

associated press writerequals 
washington ap the senate on friday voted down a proposal to 
allow farmers to grow additional amounts of grain before being 
subjected to government management controls 
the amendment to the 1990 farm bill was offered by sen rudy 
boschwitz rminn who said the acreage reduction program in the 
legislation hurts the ability of us farmers to compete in the 
world market 
but supporters of the acreage reduction plan prevailed in their 
arguments that it was needed to control the size of surpluses and 
stabilize prices the amendment was defeated 5037 
boschwitz said the program requires farmers to idle some of the 
most fertile land in the country 
we have foregone production and in the process given the 
markets to the europeans said boschwitz 
sen bob kerrey dneb argued that the export enhancement 
program was designed to get those markets back and could be used 
more effectively by the bush administration 
kerrey said huge grain surpluses are expensive for the 
government 
one of things were trying to do is balance the taxpayer 
desire to keep costs down and producers need for stability he 
said 
the boschwitz amendment was the second major attack on the bill 
designed by the senate agriculture committee to set farm policy for 
the next five years 
the first came thursday in the 6630 defeat of an amendment 
offered by sen harry reid dnev that would have eliminated 
subsidies to farmers with gross sales over 500000 a year 
an agriculture committee source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said defeat of the two amendments was a good indication 
that the general provisions of the committees bill would stand 
debate will continue next week with a battle over the sugar 
program expected tuesday sen bill bradley dnj has introduced 
an amendment that would reduce the loan rate on raw sugar from 18 
cents to 16 cents a pound it is supported by the bush 
administration 
the sugar program is one of the most controversial support 
systems in us agriculture policy though it does not require 
direct government payments it controls supply by limiting the 
amount of sugar that can be imported thereby keeping prices high 
candy makers and other sugar users dislike the program because 
they are kept from buying the cheaper worldprice sugar foreign 
policy makers say it works against us objectives in places like 
central america where sugar is so easily grown 
while the taxpayers shell out considerable sums of money for 
military and foreign assistance to the region the sugar program 
blithefully undermines our national security by closing our market 
to one of the few ways these same countries have to earn money 
said bradley 
the house begins debate on its version of the farm bill on 
monday

a senatepassed bill would reimpose 
advertising time limits on childrens television shows and require 
stations to provide some programs just for kids 
the bill sent to the house after a unanimous consent vote late 
thursday would limit commercials to 105 minutes per hour on 
weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kids programs on 
both broadcast stations and cable similar restrictions were lifted 
from broadcasters in 1984 
the measure also would 
require the federal communications commission to complete an 
investigation that could affect socalled programlength 
commercials that feature toys 
require broadcasters to provide more educational and 
informational programming for kids 
establish a 10 million public tv endowment for childrens 
educational programs 
broadcasters were able to water down provisions that would have 
required stations in order to gain an fcc license renewal to show 
they had substantially increased airings of programs specifically 
designed for kids educational and informational needs 
the bill would allow the fcc to consider nonbroadcast efforts 
on behalf of kids by stations such as programming guides 
despite the lastminute compromises the bill marks a sharp 
turnaround from reaganera deregulation of childrens tv and 
post1984 fcc policy that childrens needs can be served by the 
broad marketplace including cable tv public television and 
vcrs 
the bill also represented a personal victory for longtime 
advocate peggy charren head of bostonbased action for childrens 
television 
ive only been waiting for this for something like 22 years 
for children to be part of the audience the broadcast licensee is 
obligated by law to serve charren who founded act in 1968 said 
in a telephone interview 
we think this is the first step in getting millions of points 
of educational light into american living rooms without raising the 
deficit im sure that everyone who cares about children will be 
applauding the president when he signs the bill into law she 
said 
a similar bill is pending in the house where quick passage also 
is expected president bush has not indicated whether he would sign 
a childrens tv bill but the justice department last year 
recommended that he veto the bill because it intrudes into program 
content president ronald reagan vetoed a similar measure in 1988 
the national association of broadcasters generally has supported 
the bill but resisted a competing measure by sen tim wirth 
dcolo that would have imposed tighter ad limits required the 
larger amount of educational and informational programs and 
outlawed programlength commercials 
nab maintained that familytype programs such as the cosby 
show or national geographic specials should count towards 
broadcasters obligations to children the house bill allows 
broadcasters to serve the needs of children through their overall 
programming 
nab spokesman walt wurfel said the compromise bill does a lot 
to protect the interests of children but it still recognizes that 
the essential element of broadcasters being able to provide this 
programing is a healthy flow of advertising revenue 
until 1984 the fcc had limited commercials on childrens tv 
programs to 95 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays 
during congressional hearings on the house and senate bills there 
was testimony that the amount of commercial ad time has grown 
dramatically on kids shows since 1984 while the amount of 
informational and educational programs for kids had declined 
sharply

nbc entertainment chief brandon tartikoff 
went so far as to perform a rap duet with fresh prince in 
acknowleding the challenge posed by fox broadcasting co and his 
own networks subpar performance last year 
tartikoff 41 and rapper prince aka will smith of nbcs new 
fall series fresh prince of bel air closed their rap duet 
thursday with were hungry and we got a taste for fox 
the simpsons the highestrated fox broadcasting co show 
is scheduled against nbcs toprated cosby show this fall 
tartikoff has dismissed it and other fox hits as tasteless appeals 
to the lowest common denominator 
nbcs biggest hope for new steam is the fresh prince series in 
which smith plays an inner city youth who moves to the affluent los 
angeles enclave 
nbcs 1989 fall schedule had our share of disappointments 
tartikoff said those disappointments he said including 
mancuso fbi and hardball which have been canceled 
we got off our game he said 
much of thursdays news conference concerned nbcs plan to start 
its fall season early 
last week fox announced plans to air one of its highly 
publicized fall series babes on thursday aug 23 the same 
night the simpsons moves to 8 pm thursday against the cosby 
show 
on thursday nbc said its series ferris bueller a spinoff 
on the hit teenage feature film will preview on august 23 against 
babes 
others of nbcs nine new programs including parenthood 
working it out and law and order also will be 
doublepumped or shown twice before the traditional fall 
schedule begins tartikoff said 
most of tartikoffs remarks concerned his newly created job as 
nbc entertainment group president 
he said his new job as a kind of network guru for all 
programming and nbcs inhouse production company comes at a time 
when he was growing tired of the daily grind 
tartikoff said even though he is credited with making nbc the 
no 1 network he has been doing it for 10 years and felt i may 
get to a point where i dont want to do this anymore 
four toplevel managers have new titles but the realignment 
apparently means only that tartikoff no longer will be involved in 
daytoday network entertainment and if you have a new pilot to 
pitch ask for warren littlefield not tartikoff 
littlefield former executive vice president of prime time 
programming takes tartikoffs old title of entertainment 
president replacing littlefield is perry simon formerly senior 
vice president of prime time shows 
john agoglia executive vice president of nbc productions takes 
on the additional duties of heading the recently formed nbc 
enterprises which handles international distribution and satellite

arab leaders worked friday to try to settle a 
persian gulf dispute that flared when iraq launched a series of 
verbal salvos at its neighbor and former ally kuwait 
kuwaiti officials and diplomats have suggested iraqs sudden 
outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors 
including kuwait to write off billions of dollars in debts from 
the 19801988 iraniraq war 
the arab leagues secretarygeneral chedli klibi flew to 
kuwait friday and king fahd of saudi arabia and president hosni 
mubarak of egypt have also appealed for moderation 
mubarak urged the two states to settle their differences by 
brotherly constructive dialogue 
baghdad has denounced kuwait for what it says are border 
violations and oil overproduction 
kuwait denies border encroachments and has asked an arab league 
committee to help settle the longstanding border dispute 
iraq has also demanded compensation for an estimated 24 
billion worth of oil it says kuwait stole from a border field 
kuwait denies the charge 
iraqs president saddam hussein has accused kuwait and the 
united arab emirates of costing iraq 14 billion in oil revenues by 
overproducing and driving down prices 
saddam said production by the united arab emirates and kuwait 
beyond ceilings set by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries caused a recent fall in oil prices he threatened use of 
force to retaliate 
in reports on the dispute kuwaits progovernment media played 
up the noble kuwaiti stance and sacrifices during the iraqiran 
war when the emirate was a target of iranian missile attacks 
attacks on its vital oil shipping lanes and terrorism by 
proiranian activists 
kuwait was second only to saudi arabia in an arab effort that 
pumped about 40 billion into iraqs coffers during the war the 
united arab emirates also contributed 
gulfbased diplomatic sources said saudi arabias king fahd 
using the strong personal link he forged with saddam during the war 
years has been in frequent contact with baghdad over the dispute 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also said 
united arab emirates president sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan in 
morocco on a private visit had expressed willingness to help 
settle the financial aspects of the dispute 
the kuwait government thursday night called off a state of alert 
for its armed forces which had been declared wednesday 
iraq with a population of 17 million has a 1millionman army 
as well as an arsenal of chemical weapons kuwait with only 17 
million residents has 20300 members of the armed forces 
despite the apparent cooling down officials in baghdad reported 
that thousands of kuwaitis visiting iraq were heading home iraqi 
media continued to accuse kuwait and the united arab emirates of 
usurping iraqs rights 
the gulf region includes about twothirds of the worlds proven 
oil reserves so instability in the area brings nervous reactions 
among oil consumers 
however the prospect that kuwait and the uae will stop 
producing over their opec ceilings has brought a rally in oil 
prices

so you say your favorite charitys hurting for a 
good fundraiser masquerade balls are a bore bachelor auctions 
are passe cow pie bingo has come and gone catch hold of the 
latest craze rubber ducky races 
in such places as nashua nh san jose calif kansas city 
mo and chicago men women and children are flocking to 
reservoirs rivers and ponds to cheer on the little yellow 
critters according to a company that has leased the nontoxic 
ducks to organizations in those communities 
its all in the interest of their favorite good cause 
weve had the golf outings the dinner dances pretty 
standard things northern illinois medical center administrator 
bob blazier said friday but this this is different 
on saturday about 5000 ducks hit the waters of boone creek in 
mchenry 20 miles northwest of chicago on the hospitals behalf 
for the past few weeks hospital supporters have been buying 
duck adoption papers at 5 a pop or a flock of 10 ducks 
complete with duck tshirt for 50 adoption papers sport a 
number corresponding to a number on a rubber duckys bottom 
on saturday the duckies themselves will be ceremoniously dumped 
from a truck into boones creek for a race to the finish line 
first duck through the duck trap a contraption rigged 
across the finish line that pulls the ducks in order from the water 
wins 
but thats not until after the guess the ducks in the truck 
contest to determine just how many of the fistsized rubber ducks 
will be paddling for the finish line 
boone creeks duck race is just a drop in the bucket compared to 
illinois masonic hospitals august duck dash in which participants 
can for 250 become vids very important ducks 
in that contest about 30000 rubber ducks will be dropped off 
chicagos michigan avenue bridge for a race down the chicago river 
if the current isnt strong enough that day a chicago fire 
department boat will be standing by with water cannons to propel 
the ducks forward 
the fundraising ducks are largely the brainchild of a phoenix 
ariz company that says it drew on a 19th century irish pastime 
for its inspiration 
three years ago during their first year in business great 
american duck races managed to convince just eight organizations 
that duck racing was the way to raise money this year 95 groups 
have gone to ducks and next year 103 have already been scheduled 
racing rubber ducks it sounds so silly but it is serious 
michele brown the companys event coordinator said friday 
unlike cow pie bingo in which fields are divided into squares 
and players guess on which square a cow will leave its mark much 
planning has gone into the duckrace business 
were still working on perfecting the duck said brown 
among the considerations ducks that can withstand high 
temperatures and strong blowing winds 
ducks that have paddled too far are even retired spending their 
golden years as promotional ducks sold as part of the fundraiser 
but the birds are no laughing matter brown said 10 races were 
conducted last year for a youth charity childrens miracle 
network the races raised 13 million for the group she said

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee is poised to oppose the b2 bomber according to 
congressional sources but rep les aspin questioned about his 
plans friday was coy 
stay tuned the wisconsin democrat said in response to 
persistent queries from reporters aspin did confirm that he will 
deliver a major speech on the house floor monday 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said aspin will 
likely announce his support for an amendment that calls for ending 
the stealth bomber program at the 15 planes now in production 
meeting with reporters aspin cited five strategic weapons 
systems the b2 bomber the advanced tactical fighter the 
advanced tactical aircraft the c17 transport plane and the light 
helicopter which together would cost more than 300 billion 
you cant have declining defense budgets and buy full bore 
aspin said 
opposition to the stealth bomber has grown in congress where 
lawmakers have criticized the price tag of about 860 million a 
plane faced with a declining soviet threat and fiscal constraints 
defense secretary dick cheney announced in april a revised plan for 
the program that cut the total number from 132 to 75 and reduced 
this years purchases from five planes to two 
the revised proposal has had little effect in congress 
especially in the house where opponents of the northrop 
corpmanufactured aircraft say they are a handful of votes short 
on a measure to terminate the program 
the armed services chairman made the comments days before his 
panel crafts a defense bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the house will draw up legislation based on 283 billion in 
military spending 24 billion less than president bush proposed in 
january 
to reach the lower total the committee plans to cut 11 billion 
from weapons procurement and 19 billion from research and 
development of those systems 
in crafting its version of the bill the senate armed services 
committee last week approved a 289 billion defense budget that 
trims 1 billion from bushs request of 47 billion for the 
strategic defense initiative and cuts active duty troop strength by 
100000 including 50000 troops in europe 
aspin predicted that his committee will produce a lower number 
for sdi commonly known as star wars than the 37 billion the 
senate panel approved 
the chairman also indicated his support for a reduction of at 
least 100000 troops from the armed forces current level of 21 
million the committee is looking to cut 800 million from the 
pentagons military personnel budget for fiscal 1991 which amounts 
to a cut of around 120000 people plus the cost of benefits 
packages severance pay for enlisted personnel and other programs 
aspin also used the session with reporters to renew his support 
for an independent commission to determine what military bases 
should be closed the chairman vowed to include an amendment 
calling for a commission to the defense bill 
earlier this year aspin criticized cheneys list of base 
closings as an attack on democrats in congress

executed at dawn friday for kidnapping the son of taiwans richest 
tycoon the justice ministry said 
relatives of the three men including ma xiaoqin a sister of ma 
xiaobin who defected to nationalistruled taiwan in 1986 spent 
five hours on their knees outside the residence of president lee 
tenghui pleading for clemency 
they ignored presidential guards who told them lee was out of 
town 
ma wang shihchieh and doung lung a chinesevietnamese were 
convicted of kidnapping chang kuomin 33 the son of shipping 
magnate chang yungfa for a ransom of 19 million last year chang 
was eventually released unharmed and the ranson recovered 
a statement from the justice ministry said the three men all 
27 were executed by shots fired into their backs at taipeis 
tucheng prison they were sentenced to death earlier this year 
forbes magazine this month listed the elder chang chairman of 
the evergreen group a conglomerate based on shipping as taiwans 
richest man his fortune was estimated at more than 2 billion 
the taiwan government granted ma xiaoqin special permission 
earlier this month to enter taiwan to see her brother before his 
execution she said he told her he kidnapped chang to get money to 
return to china 
ma and 18 other chinese defected to taiwan four years ago after 
sailing a fishing boat to south korea

executions they criticized laws that dictated executions for 
kidnappers saying this could encourage kidnappers to kill their 
victims to avoid recognition

the court that set aside oliver norths 
irancontra convictions warned congress that compelling the 
testimony of suspected wrongdoers in major scandals is likely to 
scuttle future prosecutions 
the court in effect told congress that it must choose between 
its desire to quickly air the details of a major scandal such as 
watergate or the irancontra affair or wait quietly while 
prosecutors investigate the participants and put them on trial 
by compelling testimony of witnesses such as north lawmakers 
are taking a great chance that the witness cannot 
constitutionally be indicted or prosecuted because of fifth 
amendment protections against selfincrimination the court said 
the ruling dealt a severe blow to the work of independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh raising the possibility that the 
conviction of former national security adviser john m poindexter 
could meet the same fate as norths 
both men testified before televised congressional hearings on 
the irancontra affair under limited grants of immunity from 
prosecution 
this use immunity guaranteed that north and poindexters 
words would not be used as evidence against them 
but the court felt norths testimony received so much publicity 
that his words might have influenced the memory of the witnesses 
who gave evidence against him at his 1988 trial 
it may be that it is possible in the present case to separate 
the wheat of the witnesses unspoiled memory from the chaff of 
norths immunized testimony but it may not the ruling said 
the court ordered the federal judge who presided over the north 
case gerhard a gesell to conduct a witnessbywitness and if 
necessary a linebyline review the trial testimony to make 
that determination 
the 21 ruling by the panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here made it clear the majority believes that walsh will have a 
difficult time proving that the evidence was not infected with the 
taint of norths congressional testimony 
the fact that a sizable number of grand jury witnesses trial 
witnesses and their aides apparently immersed themselves in norths 
immunized testimony leads us to doubt whether what is in question 
here is simply stimulation of memory by a bit of compelled 
testimony the ruling said 
whether the governments use of compelled testimony occurs in 
the natural course of events or results from an unprecedented 
aberration is irrelevant to a citizens fifth amendment right 
if allowed to stand the ruling would give hard choices in the 
future when it is in a race with prosecutors to get to the bottom 
of a scandal that shakes the nation like a watergate or an 
irancontra affair 
the government must occasionally decide which it values more 
immunization perhaps to discharge institutional duties such as 
congressional factfinding and information dissemination or 
prosecution the ruling said 
as congress prepared to hold hearings in 1987 walsh warned that 
it would create serious and perhaps insurmountable barriers 
to the prosecution of the immunized witness 
in these situations you must weigh in the balance whether a 
public disclosure of all the facts is more important than a 
criminal prosecution said rep henry hyde rill a member of 
the irancontra committee 
its very difficult to have both without trespassing on 
immunized testimony we made a judgment congress did that we 
wanted the public hearing hyde said 
the ruling on friday makes the dilemma even harder for lawmakers 
it makes it almost impossible to have both a public 
congressional inquiry and a subsequent court proceeding against the 
wrongdoers said paul rothstein a criminal law professor at 
georgetown universitys law school 
one or the other is going to have to do rothstein said 
but when the next scandal breaks there is really no way of 
restraining congress said gerald caplan a george washington 
university law professor 
i am not sure in a matter of this importance whether public 
information about what happens isnt more important than 
guaranteeing the accuracy of the jury verdict he said 
we lawyers tend to think that guaranteeing the integrity of 
the factfinding process is the most important thing caplan said 
but i think in matters of national importance watergate or 
irangate there is arguably an overriding public need for 
information to make judgments for example electoral judgments

state health officials complained friday that 
the agriculture department has left them to their own devices in 
the fight against salmonella enteritidis a potentially fatal form 
of bacteria found in raw or undercooked eggs 
the absence of a coordinated federal response has left states 
with no alternative but to take strong action to protect their 
citizens from contaminated food often produced in other states 
john j guzewich of the new york state health department told a 
congressional oversight panel 
robert flentge of the illinois public health department 
complained about mixed signals at the federal level and 
interference with his department 
ab park of the maryland agriculture department said state 
officials began tracing eggs and testing chickens while federal 
officials were debating whether salmonellosis is a poultry disease 
the witnesses appeared before the oversight and investigations 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
the panels chairman rep john d dingell dmich alleged 
that the agriculture department was late in recognizing the growing 
number of outbreaks traced to the bacteria and withheld information 
from the food and drug administration which also regulates the 
food supply 
poisoning from the enteritidis form of salmonella has been 
increasing steadily since 1982 and is most likely to be fatal among 
the very old the very young and others whose immune systems are 
weak according to the centers for disease control 
the agency says the increase is directly related to 
contamination of grade a eggs that are eaten raw or undercooked 
infection has been spread through scrambled poached and overeasy 
eggs as well as in homemade ice cream cole slaw sauces and 
dressings 
since 1985 there have been 217 outbreaks responsible for 7370 
cases of infection of those cases 44 resulted in death cdc says 
health officials say tracing the food poisoning to a particular 
flock is by nature difficult and is made more difficult by the lack 
of effective regulation 
even an infected flock may produce only one contaminated egg in 
1000 said dr robert tauxe of the centers for disease control 
testing all chickens before allowing their eggs to be shipped is 
also impossible for now he said organ cultures are required to 
find the bacteria 
the problem can become worse when the eggs reach a restaurant 
nursing home or institution said tauxe one contaminated egg can 
contaminate a bowl of 500 he said 
the state officials complained that federal inspections are 
limited to brood hens that produce the laying hens even though 
environmental contamination remains a real risk 
they also complained that no recall provision exists for eggs 
that have reached the market and that no effective way exists for 
tracing eggs

costs of a popular farm conservation program 
are expected to be higher and its benefits lower than previously 
estimated an agriculture department report said friday 
a reassessment of the conservation reserve program or crp 
shows federal outlays may be 66 billion to 93 billion over the 
lifetime of the program 1986 through 1999 
meanwhile the report said benefits may be 42 billion to 9 
billion 
the conservation reserve program is a longterm plan designed by 
congress in 1985 to take 40 million to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible cropland from production for 10 years planting it to 
grass and trees 
in return farmers get onetime assistance to plant the 
protective vegetative cover plus annual rental payments averaging 
about 50 per acre 
an earlier assessment had put net benefits of the program 
assuming the full 45 million acres to be retired at 34 billion 
to 11 billion and net federal costs at only 26 billion to 66 
billion 
the reassessment is based on current enrollment of 34 million 
acres and reflects the reduced crops stocks and higher prices 
caused by uneven weather other the past few years the report 
said higher prices lessened the commodity program savings that 
might otherwise have been attributed to the crp

an indianapolis radio station has been fined 
10000 for broadcasting sexually explicit material in violation of 
federal indecency rules the federal communications commission said 
friday 
the action against wfbqfm owned by great american television 
and radio co in cincinnati was the latest in a spate of moves in 
the past year by a newly constituted fcc bent on cracking down on 
disc jockeys often called shock jocks 
the fcc led by new chairman alfred sikes has issued a number 
of warnings and fines against stations most recently a 20000 
fine in june against a san jose calif radio station ksjofm 
in all cases the commission cited indecent material 
involving sexual innuendo or descriptions of sexual organs 
broadcast between 6 am and 8 pm 
the commission earlier this month repeated its intention to try 
to extend the ban on indecent broadcast material to 24 hours a day 
a court ruling on a 24hour ban is pending 
the fcc warned great american officials a year ago that material 
broadcast in 1987 on a show featuring disc jockeys bob kevoian and 
tom griswold on wfbqfm and its sister station wndeam may have 
violated the fccs indecency rules 
those rules prohibit the broadcast during daylight hours of 
language or material that depicts or describes in terms 
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards 
for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities or 
organs 
the commission also reviewed material the station broadcast in 
1989 and considered the companys arguments 
in a letter to great american officials dated thursday the fcc 
agreed with the companys assertion that two skits in question were 
not indecent 
but the commission said that material in several other programs 
fit squarely within our definition of indecency 
station manager chris wheat said the company had not decided 
whether to appeal 
the fines stem from a complaint filed by john r price a 
carmel ind lawyer who founded decency in broadcasting

one of barney franks earliest campaign posters 
showed the rumpled pudgy bespectacled candidate under the caption 
neatness isnt everything 
later the liberal congressman cleaned up his act he lost 
weight spiffed up his wardrobe and shed glasses for contact lenses 
thats also when frank whose life had been dominated by 
political work turned to a sex ad on his 45th birthday the ad 
put him in contact with stephen gobie the male prostitute whose 
disclosure of the relationship became the big blot on franks 
10year career in congress 
two years later in 1987 frank publicly disclosed his 
homosexuality 
observers have said that the sharptongued politician was naive 
about private personal relationships frank himself said he took 
gobie under his wing believing he could help reform the man he 
acknowledges he paid for sex 
before the gobie affair frank was best known as one of the most 
liberal members of congress with a deadly political wit 
it was frank who once quipped of the conservative bent of the 
antiabortion lobby sure theyre prolife they believe that 
life begins at conception and ends at birth 
frank 50 a graduate of harvard law school cut his political 
teeth as chief of staff to then boston mayor kevin white in the 
years 19681971 frank then went to work as a congressional aide 
frank first entered the political arena on his own in 1980 
winning the old 4th congressional district seat after the rev 
robert drinan was ordered to retire by the roman catholic church 
then in 1982 franks district was folded into a new area that 
stretched from the workingclass mill city of fall river to the 
rich yankee suburbs of boston the race pitted frank against 
incumbent margaret heckler a republican who had carved out a 
strong political base in the suburbs where some of the states most 
affluent families live 
most of the new district was on hecklers turf but frank raised 
1 million and won with a 60 percent margin 
now despite his troubles over gobie frank is considered a safe 
bet to win this years election frank is still popular with 
constituents his lone republican challenger john soto is a 
lawyeraccountant from attleboro with no experience in elected 
office and a stormy relationship with the state gop hierarchy 
soto has played up franks homosexuality in the race calling on 
the congressman to take a test for aids and make the result public 
but the move has backfired audiences have booed soto and he has 
drawn criticism in the media 
james nuzzo another republican challenger considered a more 
serious threat to franks seat recently dropped out of the race 
soto called the house ethics panels decision to reprimand frank 
a slap on the wrist mr franks admitted highrisk behavior sets 
a terrible example for the youth of america that is in desperate 
need of positive role models he said 
although frank has a strong hold on his district in this years 
race he could face a tougher fight in the next election if 
massachusetts loses a congressional seat because of its lack of 
population growth in comparison to the sun belt 
massachusetts could lose two seats in congress according to 
some demographers basing their predictions on census projections 
the legislature will decide which seats go and conservative 
legislators may be inclined to take franks seat 
if the state loses only one seat and if rep silvio conte the 
lone republican in the massachusetts delegation retires after more 
than 30 years representing the 1st congressional district franks 
seat could be safe 
but a loss of two seats or a decision by conte to stay on 
could pit frank against another incumbent democrat 
for now though frank has regained the fiesty attitude he 
admits he lost in the first moments of embarrassment over the gobie 
affair 
there is no question about it i was unhappy and disappointed 
and angry with myself frank said recently it brought back a 
whole lot of things that i had been dealing with in terms of 
emotions and some in terms of action that i thought i had dealt 
with

the nations savings institutions lost 199 
billion in deposits during the first two months of 1990 nearly 
matching the record outflows of a year earlier the government said 
friday 
depositors at institutions still under private ownership 
withdrew 137 billion more than they deposited during january and 
february the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
said in a longdelayed statistical report account holders at 
failed institutions under government control withdrew a net 62 
billion 
at all institutions net withdrawals totaled 133 billion in 
january a record topping the previous mark of 109 billion in 
january 1989 and 66 billion in february 
the twomonth total fell just short of the 20 billion drain in 
januaryfebruary 1989 february marked the 20th deposit drain in 21 
months and left the industrys total deposit base at 9265 billion 
economists attributed the outflow to three factors 
deliberate shrinkage by solvent sampls trying to meet stringent 
capital requirements imposed by last augusts bailout bill 
a cut in the high interest rates offered by failed institutions 
after they come under government control 
lingering confidence problems among depositors at failed 
thrifts despite government insurance guaranteeing each account up 
to 100000 
i would expect well have deposit outflows for quite some time 
to come i dont think well see the end of it until next year 
this industry is undergoing monumental restructuring said 
economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions 
fridays report was the first 1990 data released for thrifts 
normally by this time deposit flow information current through may 
would have been available but computer problems plus disarray 
caused by the reorganization of the sampl bureaucracy under last 
years law delayed the reports 
economist james barth of auburn university a former chief 
economist at the thrift office criticized the information drought 
and said it may even be hurting the governments efforts to find 
acquirers for failed thrifts 
it makes it more difficult to induce people to come to the 
table to do deals if they dont have timely information if 
youre going to buy an institution you need to know how it 
compares to the rest of the industry he said 
the thrift office also reported that sampls wrote 237 billion in 
new mortgages during january and february down from 294 billion 
in the same period of 1989 
regalia attributed the decline partly to a deliberate pullback 
by sampls to meet new financial standards and partly to an anemic 
housing market in many areas of the country 
the housing market is really atrocious he said

mylene and joseph liggett are living a 
richestorags existence sleeping in a 1977 cadillac to publicize 
their claim that a bank fraudulently snatched their 425 million 
townhouse 
were trying to get a message across that the bank has 
stolen our money liggett 67 said as he stood beside his 
decaying sedan de ville in front of the house friday the 
humiliation doesnt bother me all i want is justice 
the bank denied all allegations made by the liggetts 
the fivestory townhouse is just off exclusive sutton place 
where the liggetts say they have lived for 14 years the 
treeshaded street is just large enough for cars to park in front 
of the tony townhouses that overlook the east river 
they claim that bank leumi trust co took possession of their 
home wednesday changed the locks and installed roundtheclock 
guards forcing the liggetts and their poodle ferrari into the 
cadillac 
two guards at the house friday acknowledged the 24hour presence 
taped to a front window is a november 1989 order from state 
judge burton s sherman giving bank leumi the property and ordering 
the liggetts out 
the bank has since bought the house for 50000 at an 
unadvertised auction where it was the sole bidder all illegal 
according to the liggetts 
bank president richard kane said every single allegation they 
are making now they have made in a series of courts over the last 
six years every time they have been thrown out there continues 
to be no substance to the claims they make 
the couples older son john said liggett made his money from 
plastics patents used by a company he founded in the late 1950s and 
then sold for millions of dollars in the late 1970s 
the couple once had manhattan and westhampton condominiums and 
traveled abroad on the concorde next to the cadillac is a 
nonworking mercedes also from 1977 
the couple claims they now have no money because they have been 
defending themselves for years against what they say are the banks 
fraudulent claims 
they said the bank claims it is owed more than 1 million 
because they did not repay a 327000 business loan from 1979 mrs 
liggett said they never got the loan money and on top of that she 
deposited 327000 in certificates of deposit as collateral which 
the bank has taken 
they also claim that the bank continuously removed money up to 
36 million from their accounts without their permission 
they locked me out of my house the only thing i got out of my 
house is what i have on all the records i need to fight them are 
in the house liggett said 
i feel very angry very hurt very upset said mrs liggett 
who is french and according to her husband 50something 
the liggetts said they could stay somewhere else but they wanted 
the publicity from living in the cadillac so they could get a good 
lawyer 
we have a good case against the bank mrs liggett said 
any attorney who works for us would be rewarded handsomely 
her husband concurred 
they blew us away he said now we will blow them away

a proposed uniform libel law under which courts 
would decide whether statements are true or false before 
determining appropriate damages would not guarantee first amendment 
rights for defendants critics say 
the uniform defamation act is the first proposal for a 
nationwide standard in libel disputes it was discussed friday by 
the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws a 
group appointed by the nations governors to draft model 
legislation 
the 28page draft outlines a twostage procedure for libel 
trials a court would first determine whether a statement under 
question is true or false only later during the trials second 
stage would a court decide what if any damages to assess 
safeguards for the press protection if a reporter acted 
without malice or allowances made if a plaintiff is a public 
official would not apply in the trials first stage 
the substantive question is whether constitutional privileges 
can be delayed until the truth is determined said the drafts 
author harvey perlman dean of the university of nebraskas 
college of law 
the committee said the draft was based on the premise that 
plaintiffs are more interested in clearing their names than in 
receiving damages 
perlman said the proposed laws intent was to protect 
plaintiffs reputations better but it also would benefits news 
organizations 
under the proposal news organizations could print retractions 
or pay a plaintiffs legal fees after the first stage a provision 
proponents say would shorten trials and reduce the amount of 
damages awarded 
we wanted to create some incentives for the plaintiff to stop 
early perlman said 
but critics argue the committees desire to design safeguards 
for a persons reputation would create a chilling effect on the 
first amendment 
one of our central concerns is the committees desire to move 
the law in favor of the plaintiff said henry r kaufman counsel 
for the libel defense resource center there will be a chilling 
effect if the media believes it is going to face higher costs and 
greater burdens of libel and litigation 
others at the annual conference questioned creating one standard 
for an intricate field of first amendment law and court decisions 
i dont feel its an area of the law where you can provide a 
uniform act said delegate john mcclaugherty a lawyer from 
charleston wva the first amendment is constantly being 
reinterpreted and by the time a law was passed it would already be 
out of date 
some delegates said they feared legislators with a grudge 
against the press would attempt to draft legislation unfavorable to 
the media 
but perlman said the criticism did not worry him 
traditionally it is the people that have concerns that stand 
up he said but i would be naive not to think there is 
substantial concern about it 
the earliest a proposal would be redrafted and returned to the 
350member conference would be next year he said but no date was 
set for a vote

immigration authorities have resumed issuing 
letters of denial to nicaraguans seeking asylum in the united 
states after a fivemonth suspension a spokesman said friday 
in coming months letters will go out to some 12000 nicaraguans 
whose requests for asylum have been rejected said duke austin a 
spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service 
the ins stopped sending the letters last february to see whether 
nicaraguas sandinista government would fulfill its pledge to hold 
free elections austin said 
the ins also wanted to evaluate the performance of the new 
government elected to replace the marxist sandinistas he said 
having satisfied themselves that the usbacked government of 
violetta chamorro has asserted control over the country and 
resisted several challenges by the sandinistas us authorities 
decided to resume sending the denial letters on july 1 
this does not mean that these people are in imminent danger of 
being sent home involuntarily austin said 
applicants denied asylum have recourse through a lengthy appeals 
process which often takes several years 
another estimated 25000 asylum requests from nicaraguans are 
still pending 
privately immigration officials concede a successful switch to 
democracy in nicaragua may sharply curtail us granting of asylum 
in addition improved conditions may lessen the number of 
applicants 
but robert boyer an immigration attorney in miami who 
specializes in nicaraguan cases said hes been flooded with calls 
from worried nicaraguan refugees who have received notices from the 
ins 
to wait only three months with the new situation in nicaragua 
and decide that things are stable enough to move ahead on this now 
is really imprudent he said 
in fiscal year 1989 the ins granted just under 6000 requests 
from nicaraguans for asylum denying more than 10000 between 
october 1989 and january of this year about 500 were granted and 
650 denied 
the united states provides asylum to people who can prove they 
will face persecution if they are sent back home most denials 
occur because analysts rule applicants are economic rather than 
political refugees 
ins officials predict 65000 foreigners will ask for asylum this 
year most of them from latin america the ins announced this week 
it was improving its system for examining such requests by forming 
a corps of 7090 examiners who will deal only with asylum and be 
versed in international affairs

searchers found the wreckage of a missing air 
force plane near the syrian border friday along with the body of 
the reservist pilot who stole the craft the army said 
the discovery ended the largest air land and sea search in 
israels history launched a week ago following the first theft of 
an israeli air force plane 
the plane was stolen from an air base in central israel by a 
33yearold reservist pilot hagai morry who made an unauthorized 
takeoff shortly before he was scheduled to fly on a routine mission 
a military communique said morrys body was found near the 
remains of the plane on the western slopes of the golan heights 
which were annexed from syria after being captured in the 1967 
middle east war 
the theft had fueled speculation that morry a captain in the 
reserves might have defected to a neighboring arab country 
but maj gen avihu bin nun the air force commander told 
reporters friday he believed morry intended to commit suicide by 
crashing his plane 
the aircraft was a westgerman made twinengine dornier28 a 
common reconnaissance plane 
officials said earlier they believed morry had personal 
problems newspapers said he had been having marital problems and 
was was not living with his wife 
morry who was studying for a doctorate in physics reportedly 
flew over most of the country before disappearing he buzzed his 
home in the northern city of haifa and was last seen flying north 
toward the lebanon border newspapers said

a lowfat vegetarian diet clean living and stress 
management can reverse heart disease in many patients in as little 
as a year according to a study published in this weeks edition of 
the lancet 
dr dean ornish of the preventive medicine research institute of 
sausalito calif who coordinated the lifestyle heart trial 
said it is the first evidence that heart disease can be reversed 
without surgery or drugs 
comprehensive lifestyle changes may be able to bring about 
regression of even severe coronary atherosclerosis after only one 
year the study said 
researchers stressed that adherence to this lifestyle program 
needs to be very good for overall regression to occur although 
more moderate changes have some beneficial effects 
the study noted only two other controlled studies had shown 
regression of coronary atherosclerosis and both used 
cholesterollowering drugs as the main treatment 
the 10 researchers participating in the study cautioned that 
important questions remained unanswered 
the study involved only 41 patients and the researchers said it 
was important to determine whether these results can be sustained 
in large numbers of patients with coronary heart disease 
further research is also needed to determine the relative 
contribution of each component of the lifestyle program the 
researchers said 
scientists should also study just how the disease regresses and 
compare the results of changing lifestyles vs using drugs or 
surgery they said 
the study said 41 patients from the san francisco area aged 
3575 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a 
control group 
the 22 patients in the experimental group ate a lowfat 
vegetarian diet smoking and caffeine were banned and alcohol was 
limited to two drinks a day although drinking was not encouraged 
they exercised regularly and attended stress management training 
classes 
eighteen of the 22 patients showed a reversal of coronary artery 
blockages three showed slight deterioriation and one patient with 
poor adherence to the diet became markedly worse the study 
reported 
the 19 control group patients stuck to a program generally 
recommended for heart disease patients they ate a diet of 30 
percent fat did not smoke and had moderate exercise 
ten of the 19 patients in the control group experienced 
worsening of their coronary artery blockages eight improved one 
showed no change 
this finding suggests that conventional recommendations dont 
go far enough for many people ornish said in an interview the 
guidelines may be enough to prevent heart disease but not to 
reverse it 
the amount of chest pain improved within a week or two and 
there was a 91 percent reduction in chest pain when you feel that 
much better you are willing to make the changes the healthier 
lifestyle becomes selfreinforcing 
by contrast the study found the control group patients 
experienced a 165 percent rise in the frequency of chest pains 
ornish said the study turned up two unexpected findings 
we found that women didnt have to change their lifestyle 
completely to see a change ornish said men may have to do 
more 
four of the eight patients in the lowfat control group who 
improved were women he said while 17 of the 18 in the 
experimental group who improved were men 
but he added that with only five women participating in the 
study additional research on a possible gender variable was needed 
ornish said researchers were also surprised to find that the 
more severe artery blockages showed the most improvement 
though the finding was unexpected they severe blockages are 
the most dangerous he said 
ornish said followup testing will continue for four years to 
see whether blockages continue to reverse 
the study was funded by the national heart lung and blood 
institute of the national institutes of health and more than 16 
other organizations and foundations

interest on fixedrate home mortgages dipped 
below 10 percent this week for the first time in six months 
raising hopes that the sluggish real estate market may pick up 
slightly as a result 
the fixed rate for 30year mortgages averaged 999 percent this 
week down from 1011 percent last week said the federal home loan 
mortgage corp the corporation is a congressionallychartered but 
shareholderowned company indirectly financing about one in eight 
american home purchases 
it was the lowest since fixedrate mortgages averaged 990 
percent during the week ending jan 19 
oneyear adjustablerate mortgages fell from 845 percent to 
839 percent also the lowest since jan 19 when the average was 
an identical 839 percent 
the rates which do not include addon fees known as points hit 
a high in may for the year so far of 1067 percent for fixedrate 
loans and 863 percent for adjustable loans 
its always encouraging to see rates decline a little bit 
particularly to drop below the doubledigit level said economist 
thomas holloway of the mortgage bankers association of america 
the housing market certainly needs a shot in the arm 
sales of existing homes as tracked by the national association 
of realtors have declined in four of the first five months of the 
year to an annual rate of 329 million units in may 
new home sales meanwhile rose in may for the first time in six 
months to an annual rate of 532000 units but were still depressed 
to levels not seen since the 1982 recession 
holloway said his trade group was forecasting continued 
sluggishness in housing markets and saw little prospect for further 
interest rate declines 
right now there is a huge inventory of homes available for 
sale the economy is not collapsing but its not going gang busters 
either he said this recent small move in rates is not 
likely to do that much

a bipartisan group of senators pressed the 
bush administration friday to make more changes in its cambodia 
policy including lifting a trade embargo and opening direct talks 
with the communist government 
lawmakers at a senate foreign relations subcommittee hearing 
said administration moves to rescind recognition for a threeparty 
rebel coalition fighting the cambodian government wont slow a 
resurgence by the khmer rouge rebels 
the khmer rouge remain the primary beneficiaries of our 
policy said sen john kerry dmass 
an economic embargo imposed in 1975 when the khmer rouge were 
in power is weakening the government that replaced that regime 
kerry said 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 undertaking a 
massive social experiment that forcibly scattered city dwellers 
through the countryside and resulted in the deaths of more than a 
million countrymen from execution starvation and disease 
it is time to rethink our policy said sen frank murkowski 
ralaska it is necessary to go further 
murkowski a member of the senate intelligence committee said 
the administrations policy changes have left a contradiction 
opposition to a khmer rouge return to power but support for their 
participation in elections 
he called for the united states instead to work with other 
governments to forge a coalition between the phnom penh government 
of hun sen and the ussupported noncommunist resistance 
factions isolating the khmer rouge 
the united states provides about 20 million a year through 
covert and open channels to the two noncommunist groups fighting 
the hun sen government in a loose alliance with the khmer rouge 
murkowski said aid should be continued to keep alive a 
noncommunist alternative that cambodians could vote for in an 
election but he said all us aid should be given openly and 
should be primarily nonmilitary 
sen alan cranston dcalif said military aid should end with 
us dollars channeled into support for building a democratic 
political opposition 
he spending 64000 to set up a training facility for 200 boys 
ages 12 to 16 at a resistance base camp was a misue of us aid 
the policy of supporting the rebel coalition is courting 
disaster said sen bob kerrey dneb the potential for a 
tragic outcome is great 
the bush administrations intention to open talks with the 
vietnamese government will only worsen matters kerrey said citing 
the intense hatred between vietnamese and cambodians he said us 
talks with hanoi will only fan the nationalistic fervor that is the 
basis of the khmer rouge political appeal 
the khmer rouge will be able to point to the talks and tell 
peasants look the american imperialists and the vietnamese are 
trying to take over your country said kerrey a vietnam veteran 
who visited cambodia earlier this year it is very risky 
cranston said 50 senators so far have signed a letter circulated 
by senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine calling on 
president bush to make stopping the khmer rouge the primary aim of 
us policy 
fearing a comeback by the communist guerrillas the 
administration said wednesday it was withdrawing support for a 
united nations seat for the threeparty resistance that includes 
the khmer rouge the sihanouk forces and the faction of former 
cambodian prime minister son sann

the soviet union is tightening its border controls 
because of smuggling and profiteering that has stripped store 
shelves in the western part of the country premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov announced friday 
also friday mikhail s gorbachevs top advisers huddled in the 
kremlin to outline longdelayed reforms for salvaging the soviet 
economy gorbachev said his concept for a union of sovereign 
republics and the transfer to a market economy are linked 
in a nationally televised address ryzhkov said the border 
restrictions which were relaxed in september 1988 are being 
tightened temporarily because of the abnormal situation on the 
western soviet border he did not elaborate on what the tighter 
restrictions would entail 
ryzhkov said soviets and residents of unspecified neighboring 
countries were taking advantage of the considerably cheaperpriced 
soviet consumer goods and engaging in smuggling and rampant 
blackmarketeering 
he said the situation has the potential to become uncontrollable 
ryzhkov said he signed a decision thursday to repeal the 
simplified rules for crossing the soviet border until such time as 
border and customs services can ensure normal relations with 
neighboring nations 
the simplified rules loosened restrictions on residents of 
border areas to cross the frontier and export goods recently 
however customs officials have been rigorously searching vehicles 
to look for goods being taken out of the soviet union 
on thursday the polish government said it was seeking the 
lifting of travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors to the 
western ukrainian city of lvov where authorities have barred 
tourists cars and said scarce goods will be confiscated if 
foreigners try to take them away 
in recent months poles have gained a reputation as voracious 
traders buying up statesubsidized goods in the soviet union such 
as televisions jewelry caviar and gasoline 
but many soviets have gone west as well buying clothes and 
other consumer goods not easily available in their country 
at the kremlin meeting of the presidential council and the 
federation council gorbachevs top two advisory groups ryzhkov 
outlined his governments plan for the transfer to a market economy 
beginning in 1991 the tass news agency reported 
the official news agency said the plan includes freedom of 
economic activities and enterprise developing a system of 
protecting citizens from increasing prices and unemployment 
decentralizing property and establishing antimonopoly measures no 
specifics were given 
an economic program presented by ryzhkov in may caused panic 
buying that made empty store shelves even barer a new version of 
the plan was ordered with the first phase of food price increases 
put off until 1991 
ryzhkovs new plan outlined friday is to be presented to the 
soviet parliament when it reconvenes in september 
gorbachev stressed that the transfer to a market economy and the 
drawing up of a new union treaty involving the 15 soviet republics 
were two sides of the same coin according to tass 
the treaty which would ensure increased autonomy of the 
republics would also create a single marketoriented system in 
which all component parts will complement each other tass quoted 
gorbachev as saying 
separatist trends only make even more complicated the situation 
both in the republics and the nation in general gorbachev said 
according to the news agency 
to keep the soviet union from splintering gorbachev in june 
proposed the 15 republics agree on a new looser union of 
sovereign states 
since gorbachev began his reforms in 1985 many soviet republics 
have sought to exercise more and more independence from moscow 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia have made 
outright moves toward independence the russian federation the 
ukraine moldavia and uzbekistan have declared their sovereignty 
proclaiming that local laws take precedence over soviet law

the state department on friday announced it 
had invited israels new foreign minister david levy to talk 
about moving forward the stalled peace process between israel and 
its palestinian neighbors 
the defense department meanwhile informed israel that the 
united states would contribute to the second phase of the arrow an 
antimissile missile being developed in israel in cooperation with 
the us star wars program 
israeli defense minister moshe arens said he was informed of the 
decision at a meeting with secretary of defense dick cheney 
israeli officials said arens and cheney did not discuss the 
amount of the us participation in the 240 million second phase 
but israel was pleased by the us commitment to support the 
project 
the arenscheney meeting came as the administration tried to 
defuse speculation that its decision this week to postpone 
defensecooperation talks with israel was an attempt to wrest 
concessions in the peace process 
the postponement was an agreement between the united states 
government and the israeli government said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler the annual talks will take place in 
september instead she said 
the administration is busy negotiating future budgets with 
congress and is uncertain about how much money it will have 
available for foreign aid in fiscal year 1992 tutwiler said 
the administration has already asked congress for 3 billion in 
fiscal 1991 for israel which is the largest recipient of us aid 
the postponement is purely a practical matter united 
statesisraeli relations remain strong our commitment to israels 
security and to the preservation of its qualitative edge remains 
unshakeable tutwiler said 
israeli officials also insisted arens brief visit which was 
only announced thursday was unrelated to the postponement of the 
annual talks on the joint security assistance program 
nonetheless the postponement caught israeli officials by 
surprise and created unease in light of several expressions of 
impatience from secretary of state james a baker iii about what he 
described as israeli foot dragging on the peace process 
bakers talks with levy who came into office when a government 
of the hard line likud bloc was sworn in last month will take 
place on aug 9 or 10 tutwiler said 
a us official said levy was still weak from surgery he 
underwent for a circulatory ailment and may break the talks with 
baker into two sessions one each day 
levy and baker were supposed to meet last week in paris but levy 
was advised by his doctors to stay home 
last march israel rejected a formula devised by baker for talks 
that would lead to elections among the 17 million palestinians in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip an internal israeli 
dispute over the baker plan led to the governments collapse 
baker determined to try again met here last month with 
egyptian and jordanian officials and also urged the new israeli 
government in public and private to accept his plan 
secretary baker wants to work with the new government of 
israel to create a common and credible basis on which to move on 
the peace process tutwiler said

ford engine including 12 on school buses agency spokesman tim 
hurd said no injuries have been reported 
ford spokeswoman lynn tuttle said as has always been our 
policy ford motor co will cooperate fully with these 
investigations 
in its monthly auto defects report the agency said it also had 
upgraded to engineering analysis status the investigations of 
reports that safety belt retractor malfunctions in about 
100000 chevrolet corvettes from the 1985 through 1987 model years

serbian authorities on friday fired 
194 ethnic albanian employees of the radio and television company 
in kosovo the troubled province that has been a hotbed of ethnic 
violence 
yugoslavias official tanjug news agency said that the workers 
mostly journalists were dismissed for abandoning their jobs 
after serbian police on july 5 took over broadcasting facilities in 
pristina kosovos capital 
the police takeover followed serbias decision to dissolve the 
the troubled provinces assembly and government both dismantled 
bodies were dominated by ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent 
of the provinces 19 million people 
kosovo administratively is part of serbia but had been largely 
autonomous 
serbian authorities explaining the crackdown claim that ethnic 
albanians are seeking independence from yugoslavia and that they 
want kosovo to join neighboring albania 
kosovo albanians deny those claims they say serbias hardline 
communist leader slobodan milosevic has used the issue a highly 
emotional one for serbs who consider kosovo the ancient heartland 
of their culture to gain popular support for his hardline 
policies 
at least 60 ethnic albanian protesters have died in clashes with 
serbianled security forces in kosovo since march 1989 when 
serbias authorities first introduced strict limits on the 
provinces selfadministration

nasa workers tightened most of the 
48 bolts on one of space shuttle atlantis fuel lines friday but 
the space agency wont know whether that fixed a hydrogen leak 
until a tanking test next week 
the shuttles classified defense department mission is on hold 
until the problem is resolved 
all the bolts checked out fine said nasa spokeswoman lisa 
malone everything looked normal she said 
discovery meanwhile has joined the other two shuttles with 
problems 
one of 14 thrusters on discoverys right orbital maneuvering 
system pad was dented when it fell off a work stand thursday a new 
600000 thruster which weighs 20 pounds and is about the size of 
a football will be installed 
the accident occurred during routine maintenance work malone 
said 
theyre looking into how the whole thing happened she said 
the replacement of the thruster will not jeopardize discoverys 
scheduled launch with the sunprobing ulysses satellite in october 
malone said the damaged thruster was being returned to the 
manufacturer for repairs 
nasa officials believe that on atlantis hydrogen is escaping 
from a flange on the external tank side of a 17inchdiameter 
valve the valve is in a pipe that carries fuel from the tank to 
the main engines 
before tightening the bolts around the flange workers made mold 
impressions to check the distance between each one and to measure 
the flatness of the bolts heads everything appeared within 
specifications malone said 
technicians overtorqued 38 of the 48 bolts by 10 percent 
malone said the remaining 10 already were overtorqued and so were 
not tightened she said the flange welds were to be checked late 
friday and saturday 
a pressurized helium test on the massive tank thursday showed no 
evidence of any leaks said malone the leaks were detected in late 
june and again last week when supercold liquid hydrogen was pumped 
into the tank earlier tests with roomtemperature helium had 
failed to uncover any problems 
nasa plans to launch atlantis in midaugust if the shuttle 
passes a third tanking test with liquid hydrogen on wednesday 
officials are doubtful however that the problem will be resolved 
by simply tightening bolts at the launch pad 
if hydrogen continues to escape from atlantis the shuttle will 
be returned to the hangar for repairs if a new tank is attached to

the following are excerpts from the house 
ethics committees report on its investigation into rep barney 
frank dmass and his relationship with male prostitute stephen 
gobie 
 
both gobie and frank agreed that there was a dimension to 
their relationship that transcended employment mr gobie spoke of 
his personal admiration for representative frank and 
representative frank said that mr gobie was good for his ego and 
that the relationship was not entirely arms length 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
frank was not totally candid and forthcoming in a 1986 memo to 
an alexandria va prosecutor in describing either the nature of 
or the events giving rise to his relationship with stephen l 
gobie as well as mr gobies activities during probation it is of 
critical importance that such issues were directly relevant to any 
consideration of whether mr gobies probation should have been 
extended the misleading statements could be perceived as an 
attempt to use political influence to affect the administration of 
mr gobies probation that the memorandum had apparently had no 
such effect does not detract from the inappropriateness of 
communicating misleading statements which could have affected the 
administration of mr gobies probation

frank either sought or received the administrative dismissal of 
33 parking tickets for which representative frank himself instructs 
that there was no adequate basis indicating his automobile was 
being used for official purposes the committee further concludes 
that representative frank should take steps to negate fully any 
such financial benefit

on gobies testimony that he and frank had sex in the house 
gym frank testified the whole notion the way they were 
describing it out in the locker room which is where the doors 
open from the swimming pool that is the craziest notion i will 
agree that i behaved in ways that were inappropriate and stupid 
for which i feel very badly but i never had sex in the gym with 
mr gobie or anyone else

in numerous instances where an assertion made by mr gobie 
was investigated for accuracy the assertion was contradicted by 
thirdparty sworn testimony or other evidence of mr gobie himself

the committee discounted as inconclusive testimony from a 
female prostitute who stated that because she believed the 
individual with whom she spoke on the telephone was representative 
frank because she recognized the voice maybe slightly a lisp 
and a northern accent and based upon the conversation 
described above she personally concluded that the congressman knew 
that his apartment was being used by mr gobie for business 
purposes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the committee has taken into consideration the fact that during 
his dec 11 1989 interview the congressman clearly and 
unambiguously expressed regret for his actions and accepted full 
responsibility for any parking tickets that were dismissed 
regardless of whether he initiated such administrative action

the energy department has failed to prove that 
its plutonium processing plant near richland wash can be operated 
safely or that it should even be restarted congressional 
investigators said friday 
the department has failed to show that the plant on the hanford 
nuclear reservation is needed to produce plutonium or to help 
manage radioactive wastes said the report by the general 
accounting office 
the plant is called the purex plant short for plutonium 
extraction it uses chemical methods to separate plutonium for 
nuclear weapons produced by the irradiation of uranium nuclear 
reactor fuel rods it has been shut to improve safety since 
december 1988 
doe has not demonstrated that a need exists for the remaining 
weaponsgrade plutonium that could be extracted and it has not 
fully compared purex with other waste processing alternatives to 
determine whether purex is the best approach the gao said 
does plans for restarting purex are inadequate said the 
report requested nearly a year ago by rep mike synar dokla 
chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on 
environment energy and natural resources 
a more important question is whether purex should be restarted 
at all given the costs to operate purex in combination with the 
costs to prepare a supplemental environmental statement the time 
and costs associated with correcting identified safety and training 
deficiencies the fact that most plutonium for new weapons will 
come from old weapons being retired and scrap on hand at weapons 
plants and the possibility that a better alternative exists to 
dispose of the fuelgrade plutonium in the unprocessed fuel rods 
at hanford 
if a decision is made to continue with plans to restart purex 
we believe that a supplemental environmental impact statement 
should be prepared prior to restart of the plant the gao said 
a spokesman for the energy department said watkins had not seen 
the gao report and would have no immediate comment however 
spokesman tim tomastik said the report makes the assumption that 
doe has made a decision about restarting purex the doe has not 
made a decision at this time with respect to whether or not to 
restart purex 
synar said friday his subcommittee estimates that putting the 
plant in mothballs would save the government more than 750 million 
over the next 15 years

sen dave durenberger should be denounced for 
abusing his office and misusing public funds even though 
emotional and traumatic events impaired his judgment a report 
released friday recommended 
the senate ethics committees report explained the panels 
recommendation announced wednesday that the minnesota republican 
be denounced on the senate floor by a vote of his colleagues 
the committee found that durenberger knowingly violated senate 
rules and federal statutes in a book deal in transactions 
involving the minneapolis condominium he partly owned by failing 
to report expense reimbursements and by accepting free limousine 
rides in violation of gift limits 
the sixmember panel also recommended that durenberger make 
restitution of up to 122780 29050 to the senate for improper 
reimbursements for his condominium and 93730 to charity less 
state and federal taxes already paid for exceeding limits on 
speaking fees the charity figure is about 1000 less than the 
amount announced wednesday 
durenberger has admitted violating senate rules but said he 
never intend to do so he contended also that he always followed 
the advice of his personal lawyers 
the 12year veteran senator also said his judgment was 
influenced by tragedies in his life the death of his first wife 
and the killing in vietnam of his current wifes first husband 
the committee finds that sen durenberger did encounter severe 
emotional strain from events in his personal life the report 
said 
it found that the severe emotional and traumatic events 
impaired his judgment the committee finds that these factors do 
not excuse the senators conduct 
the report said durenberger generated 248300 in speaking fees 
that he classified as promotions for his two books but the 
appearances actually were normal honoraria speeches subject to 
income limits 
durenberger during a great many of these speeches did not 
mention the books he supposedly was promoting when he did 
mention them his only reference was extremely brief or was 
belittling of the books contents the committee found 
while durenberger contended the federal election commission 
approved his book promotion speeches the committee concluded the 
senator misled the agency 
durenberger did not tell the fec he would be making book 
promotion speeches that were strikingly similar to honoraria 
appearances subject to earnings limits and he did not say that his 
promotion appearances would result from invitations to deliver 
traditional honoraria speeches 
the committee found that durenberger placed his minneapolis 
condominium in a partnership as a means of permitting him to 
claim senate reimbursements 
durenberger took his name out of the partnership and as a 
result the senators ownership interest was concealed from the 
senate according to the report 
when his lawyer cautioned durenberger that he could not find a 
legal basis for the reimbursements under the partnership the 
senator failed to take any action and only asked the senate for 
advice after news articles surfaced on the condominium in 1989 
durenberger also arranged a purported sale of the residence 
in 1987 to a business operated by a personal friend and former 
campaign manager 
the friend admitted that he would not have bought the unit but 
for durenbergers agreement to rent it this was an arrangement 
which both parties understood would be financed at least in part 
through senate reimbursements the report said 
durenbergers attorney jim hamilton filed a brief with the 
committee that called the recommended punishment too strong and 
said a strong reprimand would be more fair 
hamilton called the book deal a goodfaith venture and the 
condominium transactions legitimate real estate deals they were 
not shams he said

federal and state environmental officials 
friday announced an agreement intended to pave the way for cleanup 
of the dioxincontaminated ghost town of times beach after seven 
years of study and negotiations 
morris kay regional director of the us environmental 
protection agency announced at a news conference that a cleanup 
agreement had been reached with syntex agribusiness inc a 
chemical and animal health company 
the settlement is subject to a 30day public comment period and 
then approval by us district judge john f nangle but both kay 
and syntex spokesman ray forrester said preliminary work could 
begin within days of the judges decision 
under the settlement syntex will build and later demolish an 
incinerator to burn the tons of dioxintainted soil from times 
beach and 27 other sites in eastern missouri contaminated in the 
1970s when waste oil containing dioxin was sprayed on roads to keep 
dust down 
syntex based in palo alto calif did not produce the dioxin 
but the government considers syntex a responsible party because the 
dioxin was produced by a tenant in a verona plant owned by a 
company syntex later acquired 
i think this agreement is a good compromise forrester said 
it allows the problem to be solved and allows the money to be 
spent on the solution rather than litigation 
the company declined to say how much it expects to spend on the 
cleanup but kay said syntex would do at least half of work the epa 
has estimated would cost 200 million 
under the agreeement syntex must pay the government 10 million 
over five years to cover part of the cost of prosecuting the case 
in return all federal and state lawsuits against the company will 
be dismissed 
we believe that this is a safe effective permanent solution 
to this dioxin contamination and we certainly look forward to the 
day when we can say this cleanup is finished said missouri 
department of natural resources spokeswoman anita randolph 
times beach about 20 miles southwest of st louis has been 
deserted since 1983 when the federal government bought up all 801 
homes and businesses and moved the people out 
guards patrol its fenced perimeter to keep vandals out of 
dilapidated buildings now taken over by weeds and wild animals 
announcement of the settlement brought angry words from 
opponents of the incinerator plan who criticized the secrecy of 
the negotiations and who believe the incinerator will be unsafe and 
will become a permanent fixture 
we will have created the central hazardous waste site of the 
united states if this goes through said state rep jim murphy 
who with several other opponents showed up at the news conference 
a recently passed state law limits an incinerator permit to five 
years 
the epas kay who said the agreement called for the cleanup to 
be completed in five to seven years said all concerns had been met 
we are very pleased with the agreement and we believe the 
agreement addresses the local peoples concerns kay said 
were not going to allow anything thats unsafe 
he said the epa would continue to pursue other potentially 
responsible parties 
dioxin an unwanted byproduct in the manufacture of chemicals 
like disinfectant is suspected of causing disorders of the nervous 
system liver kidneys and bladder it has been found to cause 
cancer in laboratory animals 
the epa says the incinerator would roast the contaminated soil 
so the dioxin molecules break up into carbon oxygen chlorine and 
hydrogen 
the treated soil would no longer be hazardous and would be 
buried in a landfill on site the area would then be safe again for 
habitation although federal flood plain regulations enacted since 
times beach was founded would prohibit building houses there 
randolph said 
as part of the cleanup agreement syntex will demolish all 
buildings on the site and restore it for public use possibly as a 
park or walking trails

the school immediately announced it would appeal the oneyear 
ban on postseason play which the the national collegiate athletic 
association imposed as the final resolution of a bitter battle with 
head coach jerry tarkanian that stretches back 13 years 
i think its a miscarriage of justice unlv president robert 
maxson said were being penalized twice for the same offense and 
that violates one of the basic principles of justice 
the sanction will have no effect on television appearances or 
the number of athletic scholarships unlv is allowed to give the 
postseason ban would also include the nit tournament 
after unlv and tarkanian were found guilty of recruiting 
violations in 1977 the school served a twoyear probation and 
tarkanian was suspended for two years by the school as ordered by 
the ncaa but he sued to block the suspension 
the case reached the us supreme court in 1988 in a 54 
ruling the high court reaffirmed the ncaas right to discipline 
member schools but ruled that only the school can discipline a 
coach however a nevada state court injunction still effectively 
bars the school from taking any action against tarkanian 
kansas was the first champion barred from defending its title by 
the ncaa it received sanctions after winning the 1988 national 
championship

a federal grand jury demanded campaign 
spending records from all 46 state senators friday expanding the 
scope of an investigation into allegations that lawmakers traded 
votes for cash 
fbi agents delivered the grand jury subpoenas to the senate 
ethics committee two days after asking for similar campaign records 
from all 124 house members those records were turned over thursday 
the probe involves an fbi sting operation in which a lobbyist 
working undercover offered legislators cash in exchange for votes 
on parimutuel betting legislation in the general assembly agents 
videotaped some lawmakers accepting money a source who requested 
anonymity told the associated press 
it will cut deep both parties are involved it crosses 
everything an unidentified source told the charlotte nc 
observer for an article published friday 
the newspaper reported that sources called the probe one of the 
justice departments top whitecollar investigations this year 
the investigation apparently involves possible violations of the 
hobbs act a federal anticorruption law banning acceptance of 
money or gifts in return for votes or other favors 
us attorney bart daniel and fred verinder the fbis top agent 
in south carolina confirmed only that an investigation was under 
way into allegations of illegal conduct involving certain members 
of the south carolina legislature 
there will be no further comment until charges are filed 
they said in a statement 
ron l cobb a former house memberturnedlobbyist is at the 
center of the probe according to lawmakers they said cobb offered 
at least three legislators money in exchange for their help on a 
bill that would have allowed parimutuel betting in south carolina 
the general assembly failed to act on the measure before adjourning 
in june 
cobb who served in the house from 1977 to 1984 did not return 
telephone messages left at his office thursday or friday his home 
telephone number is unlisted 
among cobbs clients is alpha group an atlantabased concern 
interested in promoting parimutuel betting in south carolina 
campaign contributions to legislators from cobb alpha group and 
cobbs company government business associates totaled at least 
12950 since 1987 contributions ranged from 100 to 3000 
cobb failed to meet this weeks deadline to file an expense 
report of his activities on alphas behalf as required by law the 
secretary of states office which monitors lobbying activities in 
south carolina is looking into the matter deputy secretary of 
state john stokes said 
just who is behind alpha group remains a mystery 
the telephone at alpha groups office went unanswered thursday 
and friday no street address is listed with directory information 
the computer at the georgia secretary of states office where all 
incorporated companies must register was not working friday an 
official said 
rep paul derrick who accepted 1000 from cobb in a columbia 
motel room earlier this year said he now believes the cash payment 
was part of an fbi sting 
the republican said cobb did not ask him at the time for his 
vote on parimutuel betting but the lobbyist had earlier sought 
his support for that bill 
rep ennis fant a democrat said he also discussed parimutuel 
betting with cobb who told the lawmaker let me give you a 
little gas for your tank and produced 1000 from his briefcase 
fant said he accepted two cash contributions totaling 1300 
from cobb in march or april and reported them on his ethics 
disclosure forms 
cobb is under investigation by richland county prosecutors who 
contend the lobbyist received several checks from an account at the 
south carolina petroleum marketers association that may have been 
used to pay off legislators solicitor james anders said

the house ethics committees recommendation 
friday that rep barney frank be reprimanded for some of his help 
for a male prostitute prompted some republicans to call for stiffer 
punishment even expulsion 
barney frank will certainly not consider it a slap on the 
wrist said ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif at 
a news conference outlining the committees findings the 
committee certainly does not consider it a slap on the wrist 
but republicans said they would seek a vote to expel the 
massachusetts democrat or censure him for his official actions on 
behalf of male prostitute stephen l gobie 
frank a fiveterm liberal said in a newton mass news 
conference i accept the judgement of the committee report 
the ethics committee unanimously reported that aspects of rep 
barney franks relationship with a male prostitute reflected 
discredit upon the house and recommended that he be reprimanded 
before the full house next week 
but the panel also sharply criticized the credibility of gobie 
franks chief accuser saying that much of his testimony had been 
contradicted when investigators checked it out gobies lack of 
credibility weighed heavily in the committees conclusions the 
report stated 
the panel also gave frank credit for expressing regret for his 
actions its report quotes the congressman as testifying 
i will tell you again with chagrin that i did not handle the 
pressures of having a public life of being a closeted gay man 
nearly as well as i should have i do think i managed to confine 
most of the damage to myself but when you are in a public 
position inevitably something spills over 
frank is one of two acknowledged homosexuals in the house 
in his news conference he said i think i am justified in 
saying that this report bears out that i told the truth 
i dont think anyone who has judged the way this process has 
gone i dont think theyd say theyre being soft on me 
he noted that work of the committee led to the resignation of 
former speaker jim wright of texas this has been a tough group 
gobie meanwhile told boston radio station weei he was pleased 
the committee was not harder on frank 
frank paid gobie 80 for sex and then hired him in july 1985 as 
a housekeeper and driver paying gobie with personal funds frank 
says he ended the relationship in august 1987 after learning that 
gobie was operating a sexforhire ring out of franks capitol hill 
apartment 
the panel which has been investigating the case since sept 11 
unanimously concluded that frank improperly fixed parking tickets 
some of them accumulated by gobie using franks car on personal 
business and the panel said frank set in motion a memo 
containing misleading information about gobie sent to a virginia 
prosecutor and which could have affected mr gobies probation 
members of congress do not have to pay parking tickets gathered 
on official business in washington 
the committee rejected gobies accusation that frank knew of a 
prostitution ring that gobie ran out of franks capitol hill 
apartment and the 12member panel said it found no evidence 
indicating that frank and gobie had sex in the house gymnasium as 
gobie had alleged 
the recommended reprimand is one of the milder sanctions 
available to the house censure the next most severe punishment 
would require that frank stand in front of his colleagues while a 
resolution condemning his activities is read 
every member is going to have to vote his or her conscience 
said rep william dannemeyer rcalif who said he would propose 
that the house expel frank the conduct of mr frank failed to 
meet the standard all of us must that we reflect creditably on the 
house of representatives we live in a fishbowl in this 
business 
republican rep henry hyde of illinois said he expected there 
would also be a motion to censure frank 
house speaker thomas foley dwash predicted that the lasting 
damage to frank from the 10month probe would be minimal 
i think this matter will be soon put behind us foley said 
adding that the house would begin debate on the committees 
recommendation next week 
barney frank remains one of the most effective and i think 
throughout the house highly regarded members here foley said 
his abilities his intelligence his capacities are well 
respected and hes going to continue to be an extremely important 
and significant member 
a summary of the committees findings outlined in five 
conclusions 
despite gobies testimony the weight of the evidence does 
not indicate that representative frank had either prior or 
concomitant knowledge of prostitution activities alleged to have 
taken place in his apartment involving third parties 
neither a sex therapist nor a probation officer overseeing 
gobie who is a convicted felon on drug and sodomy charges was 
pressured by frank to be lenient toward gobie again despite 
gobies testimony 
although frank did not send the memo to the prosecutor in 
alexandria va he did set into motion a series of contacts 
resulting in that document being sent the panel said the april 
16 1986 memo contained misleading statements favorable to gobie 
the committee concludes that representative frank acted 
improperly in connection with 33 parking tickets the committee 
directed frank to repay the tickets because there was no adequate 
basis indicating his automobile was being used for official 
purposes 
in another rejection of gobies testimony the committee said 
there was no evidence indicating that the two had sex in the house 
gymnasium 
the misleading statements in the 1986 memo focused on statements 
about how frank met gobie and false assertions that gobie was 
obeying the law 
what prompted frank to prepare the memo is unclear in the 
committees report but the result the committee said was a 
document sent to a prosecutor which could be perceived as an 
attempt to use political influence to affect the outcome of the 
administration of mr gobies probation 
specifically frank said in the memo that he met gobie through 
mutual friends concealing the fact that he met gobie through an 
advertisement for escort services in a gay publication frank 
also indicated in the memo that he believe gobie was obeying the 
law while on probation 
the congressman acknowledged to the committee that he was 
aware that during the period in question mr gobie was engaging in 
prostitution the committee said in its full report it is 
therefore clear that representative frank was not totally candid 
and forthcoming in describing either the nature of or the events 
giving rise to his relationship with stephen l gobie as well as 
mr gobies activities during probation 
frank told his news conference he was less than candid in the 
memo because he did not want to reveal his homosexuality 
frank is running for a sixth term from a suburban boston 
district he faces a lone republican opponent who has never held 
elective office

president f w de klerk and 
nelson mandela of the african national congress met for an hour 
friday and agreed the government and the black nationalist movement 
would hold a second round of talks next month 
fridays meeting was their first since just before mandela left 
on a sixweek threecontinent tour urging the world to maintain 
sanctions on south africa until irreversible changes in apartheid 
have been achieved 
the aug 6 meeting announced by de klerks office is to 
discuss obstacles in the way of formal negotiations on a new 
constitution and the end of white minority rule the anc and 
members of de klerks cabinet reached preliminary agreements in 
their may 24 meetings on such issues as violence political 
prisoners and returning exiles 
a joint committee since then has made recommendations on how to 
overcome disagreements such as defining political crimes and who 
would qualify for amnesty from prosecution 
the two sides will consider the recommendations at the aug 6 
meeting 
de klerk partially met one anc demand by lifting the 4yearold 
national state of emergency in three of the countrys four 
provinces he also signed executive orders allowing all members of 
the anc executive committee and many other officials to return to 
south africa without being arrested 
the anc says south african exiles number about 20000 including 
about 5000 guerrilla fighters who would be subject to prosecution 
under current law 
the release of prisoners convicted of politically motivated 
crimes or of acts connected to their affiliation with the anc has 
stalled recently after scores were freed earlier 
de klerk and his ministers have said they want speedy progress 
toward negotiations with the anc and other groups representing the 
black majority mangosuthu buthelezis zulubased inkatha party and 
some other groups say they are ready to negotiate now the pan 
africanist congress and some other groups insist on elimination of 
apartheid and other demands before they will agree to talks

the way jeff daniels tells it his first 
reaction to the proposal of a film called arachnophobia was 
negative 
my agent called and said well its about spiders the

terrific ill pass 
when the agent explained that coproducers frank marshall 
kathleen kennedy and steven spielberg were involved in the project

anybody can do this in a firstclass way those guys can

boys nine inches across with the legs spread out the kind that 
spit at you 
they had a spider orientation on the second day of shooting 
we were all supposed to go and basically learn how to become 
friends with the spiders and have them crawl on you as pets i blew 
that off if were supposed to be afraid of spiders lets be 
afraid of spiders 
if theres any opportunity at all to eliminate acting im all 
for it in the second half of this movie theres not a lot of 
acting going on its personal terror 
danile said 90 per cent of the spiders in arachnophobia are 
the real thing the rest are mechanical the actor was fascinated 
by the special affects thats one of the reasons i did this 
picture i wanted to see how they did it and i had the best seat 
in the house 
with his gangly frame and bland blond looks jeff daniels often 
goes unrecognized for his solid contributions to films he was fine 
as debra wingers errant husband in terms of endearment but he 
was neglected in the shower of academy nominations for the film 
i think even the guy who combed my hair was nominated 
he rationalized when i saw rain man i said hoffman is 
great but cruise is the guy who makes the movie work the guys 
who win the awards are the guys who get the flashy roles its 
always been that way 
its the same thing with arachnophobia somebodys gotta 
keep it all together im the hub that goes through the movie 
people see the movie through me 
hey the whole point is to make a scene look as though its 
not acting the phone keeps ringing people keep hiring me i must 
be doing something right its okay im glad to play the straight 
man for a spider

a black man walking with his white girlfriend 
was chased by a white man into the path of a truck that hit him 
leaving him critically injured in what police said was a racially 
motivated attack 
daniel porter 21 of baltimore was charged with assault and 
reckless endangerment for chasing herbert jennings 38 also of 
baltimore on thursday night porter was being held friday pending 
a bail hearing 
jennings and his 32yearold white girlfriend whom police would 
not identify were taunted shortly before 10 pm thursday by two 
white men in a pickup truck as they walked on a street in the 
highlandtown neighborhood of southeast baltimore not far from 
where the girlfriend lives police said 
moments later porter and two other white men approached the 
couple and porter yelled to the men in the truck asking if they 
wanted him to attack jennings whom he called by a racial epithet 
police said 
a man in the truck yelled yes and jennings ran with 
porter in pursuit said police spokesman dennis hill 
after running a short distance jennings slipped and fell and 
was accidentally struck by another pickup truck hill said the 
driver of that truck was not charged 
the girlfriend was not injured the first truck whose occupants 
started the incident sped away hill said 
hill said police dont believe that porter who lives about six 
blocks from where the incident occurred knew either jennings or 
the girlfriend jennings lives in a nearby neighborhood 
jennings was listed in critical condition friday at the 
university of maryland shock trauma center with a severe head 
injury and cuts and bruises

expressing their regret that something like that would happen over 
there

generally have improved in the city since the riots of the 1960s 
in a separate incident early wednesday in a neighborhood 
several miles away a black man was stabbed to death when he and a 
friend were attacked by a group of white men police had no clear 
evidence that that incident was racially motivated hill said but 
he added we are treating it as if it were 
thursday nights incident provoked comparisons with one in new

canadian indian chiefs on friday called 
for police to withdraw from barricades where they are locked in an 
armed standoff with mohawks who claim land there as ancestral 
territory 
the indians from across canada made the call at the end of a 
threeday conference at the kahnawake reserve south of montreal 
they called the conference to seek solutions for the crisis that 
has left one police officer dead prompted indians from around the 
nation to rally and touched off an antiindian backlash 
at the end of their meeting the indian leaders issued a 
resolution calling for provincial police to pull away from the 
barricades at oka a town 18 miles west of montreal 
the indians are trying to block a plan by municipal officials to 
build a golf course addition on the disputed land 
at fridays conference the indian leaders also asked prime 
minister brian mulroney to reconvene parliament immediately to deal 
with the national crisis 
mohawk chief joe norton said both police and indians should 
withdraw from barricades in oka and from a bridge between montreal 
and its southern suburbs where a sympathy blockade has been set up 
by other indians the bridge blockage has set off angry protests by 
local residents who have burned indians in effigy and made 
antiindian slurs 
norton also said the mohawks at the blockades must be assured of 
amnesty for a settlement to be reached 
however quebec provincial premier robert bourassa has already 
said officials will not agree to amnesty for indians involved in a 
shootout at oka on july 11 a provincial police officer was killed 
but it is not clear if he was killed by gunfire from indians or 
fellow officers 
tom siddon the federal indian affairs minister added friday 
a federal minister cannot set aside the rule of law and deal with 
an element which is using weapons and raising blockades on public 
thoroughfares to achieve their ends 
indians have been manning their barricade at oka for four months 
on thursday federal officials said they would try to acquire 
the disputed land to block the golf course but only if indians 
agree to lay down their arms 
one mohawk negotiator in oka mavis etienne said friday that 
giving up their guns is out of the question 
you wouldnt ask your army or police officers to lay down 
their arms this has been done before and they have put our young 
people into jail for defending their own land the negotiator 
said 
however only a handful of indians manned the barricade in oka 
during the day one was seen carrying a gun

the roman catholic leader of newfoundland offered 
his resignation after a commission he formed blamed him and the 
provinces church for mishandling accusations that priests were 
sexually abusing boys 
alphonsus penney archbishop of newfoundland made a public 
apology wednesday to the victims and their families after the 
report was made public earlier in the day he tendered his 
resignation to pope john paul ii 
however a vatican spokesman said the pope was on vacation and 
no decision had been made on the resignation penney can resign 
only if the pope allows him to do so 
five priests or former priests have been convicted in the 
eastern province on sexual abuse charges the past three years 
several others are awaiting trial in the scandal which first 
became public in 1987 
we are very sorry for the times you were not believed were 
not supported or were ostracized in any way in our community the 
archbishop said accepting full responsibility for failing to deal 
with the scandal for every word and action which may have 
deepened your pain we are profoundly sorry 
for 2 years penney refused calls to step down while more than 
20 of his priests and lay members of the newfoundland catholic 
community were charged or convicted of sexually abusing boys for 
more than a decade 
the fivemember commission created by penney a year ago said 
the church adopted a policy of minimal response to the scandal 
even though it was receiving complaints about sexual misconduct by 
some priests from parishioners police social workers and other 
priests it said church officials showed little compassion for the 
victims and rallied behind the accused 
the report stunned the 120000 catholics of newfoundland an 
island province off the east coast of canada 
it said the boys were the victims of men who abused their 
position of priestly status and power by acting out their regressed 
sexuality with children 
penney 65 had denied he was aware of the charges against 
priests before november 1987 but the report said there was 
evidence he had been informed of the accusations in 1979 and 1984 
among the recommendations made by the commission were that the 
church formally acknowledge its share of guilt and apologize to the 
victims that it revise policies on reacting to sexual abuse 
complaints that the canadian conference of catholic bishops be 
asked to examine the problems created by forcing priests to be 
celibate 
the commission also proposed that a fund be established to 
compensate victims but it gave no dollar amount 
the 700page document will be sent out to parishes for study a 
public meeting is scheduled for oct 11

rep lindy boggs the powerful 
plantationborn dean of louisianas congressional delegation 
announced friday she wont run again for the seat she and her late 
husband held for 46 years 
with my husband i have devoted half a century to one of the 
most noble pursuits i know public service today i am 
announcing that this chapter in my service to the public is 
ending mrs boggs told 150 colleagues and supporters including 
former archbishop philip hannan and former mayor vic schiro 
mrs boggs her daughter cokie roberts and politicians 
including mayor sidney barthelemy and sen j bennett johnston 
dla spoke in a tulane university building named after the 
democratic congresswoman 
the room was small and less than half the audience was seated 
another crowd milled about and chatted in the lobby outside a few 
people stood outside looking through the floortoceiling windows 
that made up two walls of the room so they could see mrs boggs 
mrs boggs 74 wouldnt discuss details of her decision to 
retire after 17 years in washington 
i dont think i can share with you all of the things that ran 
through my mind because some of them are very personal she said 
it had been widely reported that she wanted to spend more time 
with her daughter princeton nj mayor barbara sigmund who is 
suffering from cancer 
mrs boggs did not refer to ms sigmunds illness asked if she 
was retiring because of the strain of travel between new jersey 
washington and new orleans mrs boggs said youve been talking 
to some of my family but added no 
she did say the decision was a wrenching one because so many 
people offered to help run her office and campaign so she could 
take care of family obligations and some of her colleagues 
appeared to refer obliquely to ms sigmunds illness 
with the dignity and grace that marked her outstanding career 
in the congress lindy boggs has announced her retirement from the 
congress words cannot adequately describe how much all of us will 
miss lindy or the regret we feel at the reasons for her 
retirement said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
shell be missed beyond my ability to say there is no member 
whom ive served with in 25 years whose departure from congress i 
more sincerely or deeply regret than lindy boggs said house 
speaker thomas foley with intelligence grace charm 
commitment compassion she has served the people of her district 
the state of louisiana and the united states with extraordinary 
dedication 
mrs boggs took over the seat in march 1973 after winning a 
special election to succeed her husband the powerful house 
majority leader whose plane disappeared during a flight over 
alaska six months earlier 
hale boggs had won the seat in 1940 as a young lawyer he lost 
a reelection bid in 1942 but reclaimed the job in 1946 after 
returning from military service beginning a string of 22 straight 
victories by him or his wife 
mrs boggs the only white representing a majorityblack us 
house district said she hasnt decided whether to endorse anyone 
in the campaign for her seat in a brief interview she said she 
makes endorsements only in specific runoffs or where theres a 
huge difference between the candidates 
im enthusiastically for bennett johnston she added 
johnston is running for reelection this year against david 
duke an exku klux klan leader running as a republican and state 
sen ben bagert the gops endorsed candidate and sponsor of 
louisianas new workfare law 
mrs boggs announcement was interrupted by applause when she 
said i am proud of my small role in opening doors to blacks and 
women 
the civil rights and voting rights acts that hale and i 
supported were key to this progress but so were the educational 
and economic opportunities we helped to create 
she listed the head start program her sponsorship of bills to 
guarantee access to credit for women and minorities and her work 
to ensure participation of businesses owned by women and minorities 
in major federal projects such as the superconducting supercollider 
and the space station 
i rejoice in my role in bringing about changes in the way we 
think about our environment she said clean air clean water 
controls of hazardous materials protection of our precious 
wetlands and the acknowledgement of the global warming trend are 
now accepted policy objectives not wishful thinking 
blacks have been reluctant to challenge mrs boggs in the past 
both because of her power she has taken 60 percent of the vote in 
every election since the special election in 1973 when she was 
first elected and her staunch support of civil rights throughout 
her career 
as the moderator was about to end the session friday an elderly 
black stood up you supported civil rights when civil rights was 
decidedly unfashionable you worked for the first subdivision 
so blacks could own their own homes the black community says 
thank you lindy for all you have done for us said phillip 
baptiste a businessman and longtime community and civil rights 
activist 
mrs boggs power was not only at the polls johnston reps 
billy tauzin and jimmy hayes also democrats and other speakers 
told story after story of how the softspoken congresswoman won 
concessions that no other representative could get for his or her 
city and state 
when housing and urban development money was frozen during a 
scandal in the department mrs boggs got secretary jack kemp to 
release money for two projects for senior citizens said 
barthelemy later he said one of kemps associates told him she 
asked so sweetly and so nicely that the secretary couldnt turn her 
down he turned everybody else in the country down but lindy 
boggs 
ms roberts who covers congress for national public radio said 
rep jamie l whitten dmiss chairman of the appropriations 
committee on which her mother sits told her recently that your 
mama can get anything she wants out of me 
i said mr chairman he said yeah just like my wife 
i wouldnt dare say no to either one of them 
however at least two prominent black democrats had already 
announced they were running in the district which has a 60 percent 
black voting majority and a third is likely to join them 
state sen jon johnson kicked off his campaign for the oct 6 
primary in april marc morial a lawyer and the elder son of the 
late mayor dutch morial had a gala reception thursday night to 
formally announce his candidacy state sen william jefferson who 
said earlier that he probably would enter the race if mrs boggs 
stepped out scheduled a tuesday news conference to announce his 
candidacy said his wife andrea 
if no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote a runoff 
would be held nov 6

the department of energy has agreed to not burn 
mixed plutonium and hazardous wastes in two incinerators at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant without getting a permit from 
colorado or the environmental protection agency 
the consent agreement approved thursday by us district judge 
lewis t babcock and announced friday settles a lawsuit brought by 
the sierra club against the federal agency egampg inc which 
operates rocky flats for the department was added to the action 
later 
the settlement and the courts order remove the threat that 
doe will resume its trial burn plans without a hearing before the 
public eugene demayo chairman of the sierra clubs rocky 
mountain chapter said in a statement 
we are happy that doe agreed that a permit is necessary in 
this instance he said 
the doe had said it had authority to operate the incinerators 
while awaiting a permit but the sierra club challenged that claim 
in its june 1989 lawsuit 
rocky flats 16 miles northwest of denver makes plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons plutonium processing there has been 
suspended until the plants safety procedures are upgraded 
david simonson doe deputy director of rocky flats said in a 
telephone interview friday that the agency agreed to drop its 
contention that it did not need a permit before using the 
incinerators 
the incinerators never have been used to dispose of wastes mixed 
with plutonium at the plant and simonson said there are no plans 
to use them for that purpose 
the sierra club and doe have been at odds since 1987 when the 
doe first proposed a trial burn employing the incinerators 
over whether the federal government needed to get a permit before 
burning the wastes 
following the announcement the sierra club filed a lawsuit it 
was settled later in 1987 after the doe agreed not to use the 
incinerators until 45 days after completing an environmental 
assessment report 
but the agency continued to maintain even after that 
settlement that it had authority to start up and operate the 
incinerators while it went about getting a permit said adam 
babich the denver attorney who represented the sierra club 
as a result the sierra club brought its second lawsuit on june 
2 1989 just four days before scores of fbi and epa agents raided 
rocky flats looking for evidence of violations of hazardous waste 
disposal laws a federal grand jury was convened in august 1989 to 
examine the allegations but no indictments have been returned

a security guard for marion barry testified 
friday that he saw no drugs during the mayors 1988 virgin islands 
trip 
the testimony by police detective ulysses walltower contrasted 
sharply with that of prosecution witnesses who described heavy drug 
use and drinking by barry during the fourday visit 
however walltower said under crossexamination by the 
prosecution that he was not with barry during much of the time 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis has said he used drugs with the 
mayor 
in a related development defense lawyer r kenneth mundy 
alleged that lewis had contacts with the family of convicted 
district of columbia drug kingpin rayful edmond iii 
the jury was out of the courtroom when mundy made his 
statements which came as he questioned an fbi agent 
mundy said he brought up lewis alleged connection with edmond 
to impeach lewis testimony however us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson said mundy could impeach the testimony only if he 
called lewis as a witness 
after the court session barry said he was happy with the way 
his case was proceeding 
we are up against an awesome power the us government 
barry said but our strategy is to prove that the government has 
not proven beyond a shadow of a doubt the charges against me 
lewis testified earlier in the mayors cocaine possession and 
perjury trial that barry asked him on the first afternoon of the 
virgin islands trip to buy crack cocaine the request came when 
there was no one else in the room lewis said 
walltower testifying on the second day of the defenses case 
said that on that afternoon he accompanied barrys son 
christopher and the boys companion to a nearby beach 
they went down several times for 30 or 45 minutes 
walltower said then they would go back to the room mess around 
and go back down to the beach 
barry walltower said spent his time on official business and 
playing with his son 
walltower also said he spent little time with the mayor in the 
evenings periods during which lewis and other witnesses have said 
drugs were used 
lewis testified that he bought 300 worth of crack cocaine that 
he the mayor and others smoked during barrys fourday visit 
walltower a 20year police veteran also said he saw barry in 
the company of only two women lewis testified that he brought 
three women to barrys hotel room 
one of those women linda maynard testified that barry sexually 
assaulted her another zena mattias said she rebuffed barrys 
sexual advances 
walltower who said he did not now the names of either woman he 
saw also testified that he thought one of them was with lewis 
mundy also said friday he will show a videotape he said places 
barry in a government meeting at a time when a government witness 
has testified she delivered drugs to the mayor in washington 
one possession charge against barry stems from the testimony of 
lydia reid pearson who said she delivered cocaine and a city job 
application to barry at a government office building sept 7 
1988 
mundy said the tape is of a meeting between barry and top fire 
department officials that occurred at the time pearson said she met 
with the mayor 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and 
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use

president bushs next move to keep the khmer 
rouge from regaining power in cambodia will likely be direct talks 
with the government in phnom penh not just with its longtime 
sponsor vietnam 
that would mean going beyond this weeks opening to hanoi a 
move that reversed us policy crossed china the major supplier 
of the communist khmer rouge and drew plaudits from capitol hill 
it is a step policymaking insiders said urged by secretary of 
state james a baker iii but opposed by brent scowcroft the 
presidents national security assistant when bush considered his 
options at a white house meeting last friday 
baker backed by others in the state department proposed bush 
deal with cambodian prime minister hun sen whose government the 
united states has tried to overthrew for years by helping a 
guerrilla coalition 
baker argued that dealing with phnom penh might help break the 
link between china and the khmer rouge the murderous and most 
powerful of the three antigovernment factions in the coalition 
the khmer rouge which massacred hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians when it ran the country from 1975 to 1978 now holds 
much of the northern part of the country and is advancing toward 
the capital 
scowcroft supported holding talks with vietnam but advised 
against going further at this time he was willing however to 
leave that door open if doing so would speed up elections in 
cambodia 
to hold direct talks with phnom penh now he cautioned could 
have the opposite effect and draw china and the khmer rouge even 
closer together 
disagreements between the state department and the national 
security council are not unusual its been said the only time a 
secretary of state and a national security adviser were in total 
accord was when henry a kissinger held both posts under presidents 
nixon and ford 
still baker and scowcroft have been working in harmony since 
the administration took office 18 months ago 
but the disagreement over direct talks with the cambodian 
government is not upsetting officials at the state department 
i think at one point we will take that step an official who 
requested anonymity said given that we got most of what we 
wanted it wasnt so critical 
while bushs decision will mean talking to the vietnamese about 
holding multiparty elections in cambodia it may also lead to us 
recognition of vietnam lowering a 15year trade embargo and 
perhaps a slowdown of the tragic exodus of boat people 
for now bush has given up trying to isolate vietnam 
diplomatically even though he isnt ready to normalize relations 
with hanoi or authorize talks with the cambodian government he is 
no longer shunning the two countries as puppets of moscow 
congress was moving to choke off aid to the cambodian guerrillas 
when bush acted american foreign policy can succeed only when it 
enjoys bipartisan support baker wrote senate democratic leader 
george mitchell of maine on wednesday 
bush and baker also were guided by other practical 
considerations one was successful cooperation with the soviet 
union which also backs the cambodian government in other regional 
disputes the next dividend could be an agreement on how to end the 
12year war in afghanistan 
the most practical reason of all however was to try to staunch 
the bloodletting in cambodia 
the guerrillas were unable to contain the khmer rouge baker 
said in announcing the policy shift wednesday the fighting 
continues cambodians continue to suffer and cambodians continue to 
die

the national endowment for the arts has agreed 
to let artists also funded by the rockefeller foundation sign a 
modified version of its controversial antiobscenity pledge both 
parties said friday 
joint grantees can add wording to the current nea pledge that 
they will comply with its provisions to the extent that such 
terms and conditions and the requirement to accept them are 
lawful under the constitution and the laws of the united states 
the rockefeller foundation opposes the nea pledge which 
requires grantees to promise not to create obscene works 
in a letter to recipients released friday the foundation said 
it believed the pledges were unconstitutional unfair and 
dangerous to artists and that they limit the range of art 
produced 
the modified language provided a measure of protection for 
artists funded by both agencies it said 
the foundation first disclosed the agreement in a 
friendofthecourt brief filed late wednesday on behalf of the new 
school for social research which sued the nea and refused to sign 
the antiobscenity pledge to get a grant 
the nea confirmed the agreement on friday a spokesman said it 
agreed to the modified language late last month 
because of the comingling of private and public money the 
endowment agreed to a modification of the guidelines said 
spokesman josh dare 
only artists and organizations receiving money from the nea and 
the foundation would be eligible to sign the revised agreement he 
said 
we arent including it for any others dare said its a 
unique funding situation so it turns into a unique compliance 
situation 
the endowment decided earlier this month to use the definition 
of obscenity established in 1973 by the supreme court rather than 
broader language adopted by congress last year dare said 
the antiobscenity language included in the endowments fiscal 
1990 appropriation forbids the nea to fund work that might be 
deemed obscene including but not limited to depictions of 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts which when taken as a whole do 
not have serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
the endowment and the rockefeller foundation jointly fund the 
new forms regional initiative which gives grants to emerging 
artists meet the composer which sets up collaborations with 
composers and the fund for us artists at international 
festivals dare said 
the endowments funding for these projects in 1990 totaled 
54000 while the foundation put up 791000 he said 
the rockefeller foundation expects to give out more than 90 
million in grants this year of which 15 million will be for the 
arts and humanities said foundation spokesman frank karel 
the neas appropriation for 1990 was 153 million

many of the nations leading filmmakers 
including francis ford coppola barry levinson and paul mazursky 
will ask the motion picture association of america to change its 
movie rating system 
in a petition to be delivered to the mpaa offices here tuesday 
more than a dozen top directors ask that a new rating be 
established for adultoriented films that are not pornographic 
according to a copy of the letter 
the taint of an x rating clearly results in massive and 
arbitrary corporate censorship the petition says failure to 
address this problem will help foster a new era of mccarthyism in 
the arts as during the 50s when the networks claimed it was not 
they who blacklisted artists but the sponsors 
the letter says the x rating has come to be universally 
recognized as pertaining simply to pornography we therefore 
strongly suggest that a new rating of a for adult or m for 
mature be incorporated into the system to indicate a film contains 
strong adult themes or images and that minors are not to view 
them 
a number of critically acclaimed films included tie me up 
tie me down portrait of a serial killer scandal and 
the cook the thief his wife amp her lover have been rated x 
in recent months 
the petition also was signed by spike lee rob reiner jonathan 
demme jim jarmusch ron howard john sayles penny marshall john 
waters edward zwick and john landis among others it follows a 
similar request made this week by the national society of film 
critics to the mpaa asking they create a new rating for mature 
films 
mark lipsky the president of film distributor silverlight 
entertainment said he organized the directors petition because 
films with x ratings are denied newspaper and television 
advertisements and are refused by many theaters films carrying the 
x rating he said often are ignored by adult viewers who might 
enjoy them because the rating has such negative connotations 
and thats censorship lipsky said the mpaa is being 
irresponsible if they dont face the issue 
a spokeswoman for the mpaa in washington said the organization 
would not be able to comment on the letter until next week earlier 
in the day jack valenti the mpaa president said the rating 
system works 
a new york judge ruled thursday that the mpaas x rating 
unfairly brands films for mature audiences as pornographic and 
called for the organization to devise a new rating system 
judge charles ramos while saying he did not have the authority 
to change an x rating given to the acclaimed spanish film tie me 
up tie me down called the mpaa ratings system an effective 
form of censorship 
in a scathing 15page opinion ramos wrote that unless the mpaa 
reforms the rating system it might find itself subject to legal 
challenge he called on the organization to consider the 
proposals for a revised rating system that provides a professional 
basis for rating films or to cease the practice altogether 
he said the problem is the need to avoid stigmatizing films of 
an adult nature which ought not to be seen by children but which 
are clearly not pornographic 
tie me up tie me down features one sex scene and a brief 
masturbation scene and was given an x rating many newspapers and 
movie theaters prohibit advertising and exhibition of xrated 
movies

in his 34 years on the supreme court justice 
william j brennan has left his mark in majority opinions that 
helped shaped the law and in dissents that offered tributes to 
individual liberties 
here is a sampling 
in 1957 brennan wrote for the court as it first attempted to 
define obscenity and ruled that obscenity is not constitutionally 
protected he said material is obscene if to the average person 
applying contemporary community standards the dominant theme of 
the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest 
in 1962 the court established its oneperson onevote standard 
of equal representation brennan said judges have authority to 
strike down stateapproved legislative district lines the right 
asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the 
fourteenth amendment he said 
in 1964 the court granted constitutional protection to the news 
media when it is sued for libel brennan wrote the 
constitutional guarantees require we think a federal rule that 
prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a 
defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he 
proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is 
with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of 
whether it was false or not 
when the court ruled against prison inmates in a littlenoted 
case during the 198687 term brennan wrote in dissent 
prisoners are persons whom most of us would rather not think 
about it is easy to think of prisoners as members of a 
separate netherworld nothing can change the fact however that 
the society these prisoners inhabit is our own when prisoners 
emerge from the shadows to press a constitutional claim they 
speak the language of a charter upon whicch all of us rely to hold 
official power accountable 
when the court ruled that a former soldier who unknowingly 
ingested lsd in secret chemical warfare experiments could not sue 
due the government brennan dissented and said 
the subject of experimentation who has not volunteered is 
treated as an object a samplesoldiers ought not to be asked to 
defend a constitution indifferent to their essential human 
dignity

president bushs savings and loan bailout fund 
will be nearly out of money if officials reach their goal of 
closing or selling 77 institutions by sept 30 a federal agency 
says 
figures provided thursday by the resolution trust corp 
oversight board indicate that unless congress authorizes more 
borrowing regulators could have as little as 73 billion in 
borrowing authority left when the new federal fiscal year begins 
oct 1 
the bottom line is it would cause us to very 
significantly reduce the pace of resolutions said peter monroe 
president of the oversight board 
in addition to the 73 billion the agency could spend any 
money it can get by selling repossessed real estate and sour loans 
inherited from previous sampl bailouts he said

moderate socialists are taking 
over from latin americas doctrinaire communists who were cast 
adrift when eastern europe threw out the old guard and the moscow 
line was reeled in 
reform leftists say old models of socialism based on such 
principles as oneparty rule and state control of the entire 
economy have become obsolete 
that has created a tremendous shock for those of us who 
considered the past soviet model to be a basic reference said 
luis maira a leading chilean intellectual and member of a 
christian marxist group 
leftist guerrilla movements common in the region 20 years ago 
have all but disappeared only peru el salvador and guatemala have 
significant insurgent groups and us fears of cubaninspired 
revolutions have gone the way of the cold war 
the left is a thing of the past said guerino andreoni an 
argentine labor leader ideologically it expresses a feeling we 
all share but structurally it has remained stagnant 
parties in the old soviet style got no more than 7 percent of 
the vote and usually far less in elections held over the last few 
years in argentina venezuela colombia peru paraguay ecuador 
brazil chile mexico and bolivia 
leftofcenter parties are springing up to carry the banner of 
the new moderate socialism 
the socialist models in eastern europe fell because they were 
centralized bureaucractic and authoritarian said roger capella 
mateo treasurer of causa r a venezuelan party founded in 1983 it 
won three seats in the national congress last year 
our party anticipated perestroika by creating a grassroots 
socialist model from the bottom up and not the other way around 
he said referring to the reform program of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in colombia former guerrilla leader antonio navarro finished 
third in this years presidential election he described his m19 
party named for his former guerrilla group as nationalist and 
committed to democratic capitalism 
leftist parties received 23 percent of the vote in the 1989 
chilean congressional elections that was a decline from 40 percent 
in the 1970 election the last free vote before the 1973 coup that 
overthrew president salvador allende an avowed marxist 
chiles socialist party which got most of the lefts vote last 
year espouses moderate views similar to the social democrats of 
western europe 
only nicaragua brazil mexico and uruguay have wellentrenched 
leftist political movements 
nicaraguas sandinista movement was voted out of office in 
february after more than 11 years in power but is a strong force 
in opposition to the government of president violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
in brazil luis inacio lula da silva of the workers party 
coalition of trade unionists members of the progressive wing of 
the roman catholic church and intellectuals fell just short of 
defeating conservative fernando collor de mello in the december 
presidential election 
a mexican new left was born during the 1988 presidential 
campaign when leftist parties formed an unprecedented alliance to 
back cuauhtemoc cardenas who ran a strong second to carlos salinas 
de gortari candidate of the ruling institutional revolutionary 
party 
socialist and other leftist parties in uruguay allied in the 
broad front won 21 percent of the vote in elections last year 
luis alberto lacalle a conservative won the presidency but broad 
front candidate tabare vazquez became mayor of montevideo the 
capital 
many traditional communist parties have suffered major 
defections in the past year 
the communist party will no doubt continue to exist but will 
have no future to speak of since it continues to suppress ideas 
said angelino carzon head of a major colombian labor union he 
quit the party in april 
in several other countries liberal communists inspired by 
gorbachev have either taken control of the parties or are trying to 
do so 
sen jaime perez leader of the uruguayan communists said the 
collapse of communism in eastern europe took his party by surprise 
we believed those regimes were consolidated but reality has 
shown the parties were isolated from the people he said 
despite their more moderate approach latin americas new 
leftists remain convinced capitalism is largely responsible for the 
regions inequities and still put much of the blame on the united 
states 
they see president bushs recent call for increased economic 
integration in the hemisphere as an attempt to dominate latin 
economies 
his plan would submit our economies to the control of foreign 
capital and governments said joao machado of the workers party 
in brazil 
deciding what they are for seems more difficult for leaders of 
the new left than declaring what they are against 
socialists speak of a major redistribution of wealth agrarian 
reform and stopping payments on the regions 400 billion foreign 
debt but offer few specific plans 
the position of the left based on its traditional discourse 
has been completely weakened unfortunately the left has not 
come up with an alternative discourse said herbert mueller a 
bolivian political consultant 
some signposts have emerged 
leftist reformers have expressed a commitment to westernstyle 
elections which oldguard communists scorned as bourgeois 
democracy 
we have to denounce the crimes of eastern europe the crimes 
of the gulag and the lack of liberty said rep jose genoino a 
former guerrilla who fought brazils military governments of 
19641985 
prominent socialists have even urged fidel castro to hold direct 
elections in cuba 
while leftists still seek a substantial role for the state many 
say they also favor a role for private enterprise 
contemporary socialism doesnt sanctify the state or the 
market and looks for an equilibrium said sen enrique bernales 
of the socialist left a reformist peruvian party these days we 
cant reject the similiarities with social democracy 
some leftists have shown an openness to foreign investment 
which previously was considered a threat to national sovereignty 
in the brazilian presidential campaign last year da silva said 
foreign companies offered better conditions to workers than 
brazilian firms 
foreign capital has to come to brazil he said the only 
restriction we make is there has to be greater control 
even hardliners recognize the need for change 
socialism has lost a battle because it underestimated the 
importance of democracy said patricio echegaray head of the 
argentine communist party which followed the moscow line 
faithfully

while movie theaters on the main 
drag play the loud and violent films of summer a quiet gentle 
show called pageant of the masters is doing turnaway business 
a few blocks away 
this annual stage spectacle coupled with a colorful art 
festival is such a boxoffice hit that it needs no help from the 
national endowment for the arts instead it will be giving money 
back to the community which plays host to this cultural jewel 
as far as i know this is the only town that is paid by the 
arts said jacquie moffett president of the festival of the 
arts who noted that the city of laguna beach receives about 
300000 a year from the sevenweek art extravaganza which runs 
from july through aug 26 
were a nonprofit organization and we do make money she 
said explaining why much of the income from admission tickets is 
given away both to the city and in scholarships to talented 
residents 
the pageant of the masters centerpiece of the laguna beach art 
festival is an outdoor twohour production in which great 
paintings sculpture and even pieces of jewelry are reproduced 
larger than life size on a carefully lit stage 
if the people in these art works appear lifelike its because 
they are real people the concept of living pictures once an 
entertainment of the french court first came to laguna beach 58 
years ago residents their faces and bodies painted and costumed 
pose in exact duplicates of famous works of art 
in an outdoor bowl under the stars these frozen images are 
accompanied by lyrical music and narration which tells the history 
of the art work on view 
with advanced makeup and lighting techniques its often hard to 
tell that living breathing individuals are wearing the paint and 
costumes of the scene standing without visibly blinking or 
breathing 
they are taught a shallow method of breathing and you really 
cant see them breathe said sally reeve longtime public 
relations director for the festival who used to appear in the 
pageant herself 
staying still is stressed above everything said moffett 
noting that this years show features several small children who 
managed to not move a muscle 
sometimes the performers ability to stand still is severely 
tested 
once a pigeon came and landed on a nude moffett recalls 
she just stood there like she was a statue 
because the show is held outdoors she said theres the added 
problem of insects which sometimes land and get stuck in a 
performers makeup 
thats particularly difficult if its one of the nudes she 
said 
the pageant is an allyear project for laguna beach residents 
who not only perform but help select the works to be depicted a 
staff of detectives searches out the owners of paintings or 
sculptures to obtain permission for its use in the pageant of the 
masters 
moffetts own children appeared in the pageant in their younger 
years community participation increases every year she said 
noting everyone likes to be part of a success 
as for audiences many of them are perpetual fans 
a lot of people love the show and come back every year 
moffett said they are probably the same people who dont like to 
watch car chases in movies the people who do like car chases 
she concedes find the pageant too static 
moffett an artist who has exhibited on the grounds of the art 
festival for 23 years noted that many laguna beach resident 
artists support themselves on the works they sell during the summer 
festival the juried show selects the most talented members of the 
resorts huge art colony to exhibit here last year one painting 
shown on the grounds sold for 15000 
some of those who do not win admission to the festival show 
their works across the road at two commercial exhibits the sawdust 
and the art afair which cater to tourists and those wanting a less 
costly art souvenir 
the festival of artspageant of the masters is the only 
nonprofit exhibition in town its success is measured by the 
creation this season of the festival of arts foundation started 
with 15 million in festival money 
the taxexempt foundation will provide funding for the arts in 
laguna beach including scholarships and grants to cultural 
institutions its first grants went to such groups as the laguna 
beach chamber music society the laguna playhouse and the art 
institute of southern california 
moffett hopes that future plans will include construction of 
artist studios and residences for those unable to afford pricey 
real estate in this beachfront community 
some artists move here just to be part of the festival she 
said but lately some have had to move away because its such an 
expensive place to live

its a summer school like no other 
students immerse themselves in the works of duke bird and 
miles the dean of faculty once cavorted with cab swung with 
count and bebopped with dizzy 
since 1988 the skidmore summer jazz institute has brought six 
renowned jazz artists and professors to skidmore college to teach 
and play that most of american of music 
no more than 40 musicians ranging in age from 14 to 50something 
pay 1000 each to spend two weeks eating sleeping playing and 
talking jazz with such prominent figures as milt the judge 
hinton considered the elder statesmen of jazz bassists 
hes jazz history walking around here said buddy baker 
another faculty member youre getting it from the guy who lived 
it 
the skidmore summer jazz institute held this year from june 25 
through july 6 is unique because it places such importance on the 
history of jazz and not on the hot new young players baker 
said 
on the institutes fourth day music filters through the walls 
of the janet kinghorn bernhard theater where 36 students divided 
into five groups rehearse in separate rooms 
in one studio a teenager with shaggy blond hair slides his 
fingers up and down a standup bass while his combo of high school 
students works through a tune he wears black pants and a black 
tshirt decorated with white skulls an earring protrudes from one 
nostril 
nearby the judge listens intently then passes down his 
sentence 
ok lets try it again says hinton a bouncy 80yearold 
who brings six decades of jazz experience to skidmore 
tshirts sneakers and shorts are the uniform of the day two 
teenagers in hintons morning class wear their baseball caps 
backward hinton keeping with the casual theme wears blue slacks 
white polo shirt sneakers maroon chintz jacket and golf cap 
he nods toward the blond bassist a very avantgarde dude 
who gave up his electric guitar for the acoustic bass the tune 
ends and hinton is quick to praise 
thats much better mike much better he says 
another bass player steps in this one a tall skinny teen in a 
new york mets tshirt as the boys long fingers pluck out a 
throaty bass line hinton nods his head in satisfaction 
hes really going to make it he says 
hinton knows about making it 
the son of a chicago music teacher he gave up the violin for 
the bass after the introduction of talking motion pictures in 1929 
put him and many other musicians playing in silent movie theaters 
out of work 
a string is a string so i traded a small string for a big 
string hinton said 
in 1935 he signed on with cab calloways band and stayed with 
the flamboyant bandleader until the early 1950s cab calloway 
borrowed me for a while he borrowed me until he could get to new 
york and get a good bass player and i stayed in his band for 16 
years 
afterward came stints with count basie and louis armstrong 
along the way he accompanied everyone from duke ellington and paul 
mccartney to billie holliday and aretha franklin he uses his 
experiences along with some of the tens of thousands of 
photographs he snapped over the years to teach younger generations 
the joys of jazz 
the idea for the institute came from don mccormack dean of 
special programs at skidmore mccormack envisioned a program that 
would allow budding jazz musicians to play with and learn from some 
of the best in the business he took his idea to jerry zaffuts 
then a jazz instructor at skidmore now director of the institute 
zaffuts put together an allstar faculty that could handle a 
classroom as well as a c note except for vince dimartino who 
could not attend last year the faculty has been the same since the 
institute began three years ago 
in addition to hinton the faculty includes ed shaughnessy 
drummer don menza a grammynominated saxophonist dick katz a 
pianist record producer and jazz historian baker a former 
trombonist with the stan kenton and woody herman bands now a 
professor the university of north colorado and dimartino a 
trumpet player who also teaches trumpet and jazz at the university 
of kentucky 
guest artists such as pianist barry harris and bassist rufus 
reid give master classes 
the facultys impressive resumes arent lost on the students 
its like having einstein prove his theory to you while youre 
sitting there said joel mott a 19yearold trumpet player from 
oklahoma city 
most of the applications come from high school and college 
students although this years group included a dentist engineer 
state trooper and quite a few music teachers 
each applicant must submit an audition tape and each undergoes a 
live audition once they arrive at skidmore the students then are 
formed into bands based on their ability their stay is highlighted 
by the two free concerts they perform at the bernhard theater 
in the morning the faculty works with the bands in rehearsals 
later students get oneonone lessons with the faculty member 
specializing in their instrument 
everybody has a really good attitude about trying to give a 
lot to the kids nobody just puts in their time shaughnessy said 
good jazz musicians dont always make good jazz teachers said 
shaughnessy who has performed more than 600 lectureclinics at 
high schools and colleges across the nation 
jazz clubs used to be the training ground for aspiring 
musicians but except for such jazz hotspots as new york and new 
orleans jazz clubs are few and far between 
i really got my education in those clubs i listened to all 
the greatest drummers i watched them for hours said 
shaughnessy who as a teenager in the 1950s frequented the famed 
jazz clubs that lined new york citys 52nd street 
the problem today is finding serious jazz musicians with whom to 
play many of the students said the institute gives them that 
opportunity 
often the advice shaughnessy and the others offer cant be 
found in a text book 
i was telling a quitar player dont try to play so many 
notes when you improvise play more spare shaughnessy said 
he says to me afterward you know thats just what i needed 
thats a bit of street advice 
teaching also takes place in the classroom in katzs history of 
jazz class students delve into its origins and changes listening 
to classic recordings of such greats as earl hines armstrong and 
miles davis hinton also conducts a class a kind of eyewitness 
account of the golden age of jazz peppered with names such as 
calloway armstrong and basie 
those people seem fictitious until you talk to milt said 
mott 
but the faculty does more than teach they perform three times 
during the two weeks once at the newport jazz festival in saratoga 
springs and twice for free at skidmore where its standingroom 
only for the groups electrifying concerts 
for hinton the institute is more than an opportunity to bring 
the jazz club to the jazz student its our responsibility to be 
sure to give them something something that they can leave here

the urge to run away and hide or at least 
cringe at the prospect of a television family drama usually is 
justified 
television after all gave us eight is enough when four or 
five of them would have been too many 
most tv scriptwriters dont seem to understand the drama of 
families they give us the unrelenting bummer of family or 
huxtablesgonebad or headline demons so disfiguringly evil as to 
be unrecognizable as human 
happily thats not true of rising son a madefortv movie 
monday night on turner network television a jewel of a cast 
creates an uncompromising remarkably intelligent portrait of a man 
and his family in crisis 
big bearish brian dennehy plays gus a proud workingclass 
hero whos made his way up from the factory floor to production 
manager we meet him in 1981 while the demise of his aging 
rustbelt factory looms ever nearer 
matt damon plays his son charlie a 19yearold whos no longer 
a boy and not yet a man he wants to drop out of premed studies at 
penn state and work in the factory but cant work up the nerve to 
tell dad 
piper laurie in one of her richest performances in recent 
memory plays gus wife martha although her part is written 
small she creates a fully realized character in every gesture and 
glance 
dennehy has never been better or subtler in showing us a man 
in grave trouble when guss factory closes we see his humiliation 
in his stubborn refusal to adapt his face fills with chickens 
coming home to roost 
just like alcoholism or drug dependency his crisis wrecks the 
familys precarious equilibrium 
the movies producers said they wanted to create a kitchen 
sink drama like those of the postwar theater particularly arthur 
millers all my sons and death of a salesman 
they got more than they bargained for in screenwriter bill 
phillips subtle unhistrionic script and its delivery by actors 
who dont need to shout to convey their emotions 
the strong supporting cast especially tate donovan as older 
brother des and carol longstreth as charlies exgirlfriend give 
us immediate lifesize characters 
sandy sissels photography especially in the last scene when 
night steam rises from a luminous blue lake is beautiful she 
shows the grace and dignity in the faces of workers without 
resorting to beercommercial sentimentality 
gary changs score is unobtrusive beautiful counterpoint to the 
night moods of the film 
director john coles making his second feature film made the 
kind of movie that big studios wont do nowadays because it has no 
blockbuster potential no chase scenes and its uncomfortably 
close to real life 
given the poor quality of theatrical movies this summer 
rising son is a good reason to stay home to watch a fine movie 
with real characters a believable story that says something about 
life and families 
families are messy theyre loud riddled with conflicts and can 
be very uncomfortable sometimes theyre even crazed and 
pathological and yes theyre often the only comfort between us 
and the long cold dark

a hundred japanese ignored the giant flashing video 
screens around shibuya square and listened intently as hank hirshs 
alto saxophone danced around sunny side of the street 
afterward spectators approached shyly and dropped 1000yen 
bills worth about 670 each into his open case hirsh bowed 
thanked them in japanese and launched into a jazzy autumn 
leaves with his bassist fukuro kazuya 
down on the street i make the same money id make in a 
regular gig but its much more fun said hirsh a 39yearold 
chicagoan who lives in kyoto im communicating with people 
the people who like it stop and listen 
hirsh who also plays in nightclubs and teaches saxophone said 
he and kazuya had split 340000 yen 2270 in six days on the 
streets of tokyo 
he is among hundreds of western musicians performance artists 
jugglers mimes puppeteers and street merchants drawn to japans 
largest city by its generous tippers and relatively safe streets 
there are risks including gangsters who demand payoffs from 
performers on their turf and an occasional belligerent drunk 
competitors sometimes inform on each other but police generally 
leave the westerners alone unless they create a disturbance 
david findlay a mime in whiteface from vancouver british 
columbia was performing on a street in the shinjuku entertainment 
area he had a sign saying i am a pantomime please use your 
hands to move me freely 
theres no way id do this in canada he said theyd 
treat me too badly but in japan there is a certain respect for 
the body 
giggling teenage girls moved his arms and legs into funny 
positions others whooped in delight when he pointed at them 
silently inviting them to participate 
he is very tough an admiring man said we cannot do 
this 
findlay 36 said foreigners can make incredibly good money in 
japan if theyre any good its the fact that youre a foreigner 
if a japanese were doing it theyd get a different reaction 
japanese do perform on the streets but usually not for money 
dozens of rock bands play sidebyside on a crowded street near 
yoyogi park teenagers in greasedback hair black leather and 
sunglasses dance to 1950s music blaring from boom boxes 
saxophonists trombonists and conga players practice jazz riffs 
and rhythms under bridges and in parks but most seem to play for 
the sheer joy of it 
many street westerners live in rooming houses for about 400 a 
month with other denizens of the lowend western subculture 
teachers writers drifters occasional smugglers and women who are 
paid 20 an hour in nightclubs to pour drinks and talk to 
businessmen 
western street merchants sell everything from jewelry and 
massproduced oil paintings to batterypowered pandas 
i tell people im an art student and i painted these in paris 
these in hawaii said a young canadian woman selling landscapes 
seascapes and pictures of horses in shinjuku the real sad thing 
is i have a degree in art history 
she would not give her name 
in harajuku a fashionable shopping area freelance journalist 
bill balfour of sheffield england was selling soviet army 
watches pins and patches he bought during a reporting trip to 
sakhalin in the soviet union 
he was dressed in a soviet army uniform and his pitch was 
excuse me sir do you know what time it is in moscow people 
admired the watches but balfour acknowledged the fad had not 
caught on 
street westerners say japanese underworld gangs known as 
yakuza demand 3000 to 10000 yen a week 20 to 66 depending 
on the area 
its worth it findlay said because if a competitor is in 
my patch i dont have to do anything about it 
other performers say the yakuza have pushed them around kicked 
their instruments even thrown firecrackers in an effort to get a 
payoff 
grego a oneman band and puppeteer from northern california 
said the yakuza once summoned police when he refused to pay 
the cops said were sorry but please go home you can come 
back later said grego who asked that his last name be withheld 
because he did not have a work permit 
japanese spectators stood back and watched but everyone 
cheered when the yakuza left they love seeing us buck the yakuza 
but they cant stick their necks out 
findlay said he was performing in shinjuku one night when a 
very large japanese man rammed me 
another guy stood up for me but the big guy slammed him into 
a shop door he said the crowd attacked the big guy pummeled 
him kicked him in the head afterward people shook my hand 
hirsh said a bagpipe player in ueno park once accused hirsh of 
taking his place and brought in the police 
about 500 people were waiting for us to play he said 
this one radical guy got the people together and they were booing 
the police it was a powerful thing i was amazed to see it in 
japan 
we played one tune took in 1500 yen 10 and the police 
escorted us to the train

they fled the suffocating world of hanoi to 
pursue their love of music and now two young vietnamese violinists 
are delighting hong kong with the strains of mozart while the 
colony decides whether to send them back 
nguyen sam thi 26 and her 19yearold brother nguyen khac 
uyen gave their first local public recital in early july 16 
months after a harrowing sea journey to this british colony to 
escape their communist homeland 
i dont think my performance was great i was a bit nervous 
thi said after playing a mozart violin sonata before an 
appreciative lunchtime audience at the academy for performing arts 
reviews from arts officials were much more positive theyve 
got good technical background and good music instincts said the 
academys director john hosier 
they are both highly talented musicians with great 
potential said angus watson head of music at the academy 
both believe the vietnamese refugees would be accepted by any 
topnotch conservatory 
but musicianship is not all that the siblings have on their 
minds these days since they are among the 44000 boat people who 
have landed in hong kong after june 1988 they must prove a 
wellfounded fear of persecution back home or face repatriation as 
illegal immigrants 
immigration officials interviewed the two musicians last month 
a decision on whether they will be allowed to resettle in the west 
has yet to be made 
im not too sure about my future a softspoken uyen said 
during a recent interview at the academy i just keep playing my 
violin and i believe music would lead me somewhere 
according to the nguyens who spoke in english it was their 
love for music and the repeated attempts by vietnamese authorities 
to interfere in their artistic development that forced them to flee 
the country 
both have received musical training since early childhood first 
from their father who they said was the chief violinist with the 
vietnamese symphony orchestra and then at the hanoi conservatory 
thi said she was handpicked by a team of soviet music experts in 
1981 and sent to moscow for music studies before being suddenly 
summoned back in 1985 with no explanation uyen said the vietnamese 
authorities nixed numerous offers for him to study in moscow and 
rejected an invitation for him to perform in poland 
eventually they said their parents decided the children had to 
escape vietnam if they were to pursue a career in music 
having paid an agent gold worth more than 1000 thi uyen and 
their mother boarded a 63foot fishing junk that set sail from the 
northern vietnamese port of bai chay in march 1989 with 29 people 
aboard the father stayed behind and has since been fired because 
of the escape his children said 
the group made occasional stops along the chinese coast to take 
on food supplies and for repairs after about 20 days the boat 
reached hong kongs shores 
it may seem silly to other people that i took along my violin 
during the dangerous journey to hong kong but the instrument is my 
most valuable property uyen said 
thi stressed that they intended to continue practicing as soon 
as they reached the territory music has become part of us 
wherever we go whatever situation were in we continue to play 
at first the youths practiced daily at a laundry hut in a 
detention center in rural hong kong but the official in charge of 
the camp quickly appreciated their talent and a battle followed to 
provide thi and uyen with proper musical training 
they have since been granted special permission to live with a 
local german woman and her american husband during the week to 
practice at the academy on weekends they are sent back behind the 
imposing fences of the high island detention center where they 
live in cramped bungalows with thousands of other boat people 
the two violinists say they would gladly go to any country 
willing to offer them refuge 
uyen dreams of becoming a soloist and composer while his 
sisters goal is to play with an orchestra 
let us wait and see we need to practice but we are hopeful 
all the time thi said

laura ingalls wilder was 65 when at the 
urging of her daughter author rose wilder lane she began writing 
her memories of pioneer life on the virgin prairie 
at a desk in a tiny room in the ozarks home she shared with her 
husband almanzo wilder crafted little house on the prairie 
and 10 other related books that have sold millions of copies and 
entertained children worldwide 
some mornings almanzo would find laura asleep on a sofa in her 
study exhausted from a night spent writing about the homesteading 
adventures of ma and pa ingalls and sisters mary carrie and grace 
william t anderson has written several books about the wilder 
and ingalls families and when hes in the wilders twostory home 
nestled in woods just east of this small town he says he almost 
expects to look up and see lauras diminutive 5foot frame coming 
through the door 
its like theyve stepped out for a minute and youre walking 
right in said anderson virtually everything has been 
preserved in the home just as it was the day she died in 1957 
rose donated the home which took her parents nearly 20 years to 
complete after arriving here from de smet sd in 1894 to the 
laura ingalls wilder home association after her mothers death at 
age 90 
in 1971 three years after rose died at age 81 the association 
dedicated a museum next to the house 
today about 30000 people tour the laura ingalls wilderrose 
wilder lane home and museum each year the museum is filled with 
original artifacts familiar to fans of the little house books 
and the little house on the prairie television series 
perhaps the best known exhibit is the fiddle pa ingalls played 
to entertain his family on the vast lonely prairie 
people sometimes are overcome with emotion when they see pas 
fiddle because the books are so real to them anderson said 
coming here is like visiting close and dear relatives for a lot 
of people 
demoralized by four years of cropwithering drought the death 
of a newborn son and illness laura and almanzo left south dakota 
hoping for a better life in missouris ozarks the land of the 
big red apple 
lauras first published article is in the museum a letter in 
the aug 23 1894 de smet news amp leader describing to folks back 
home their 45day 650mile journey to mansfield in a covered wagon 
the building also houses manuscripts of four of the little 
house books which laura wrote in pencil on springfield grocer 
co school tablets that cost a nickel 
the display also features a sewing cabinet almanzo made for his 
wife out of cigar boxes family photographs and heirlooms the 
bible ma and pa ingalls gave laura and almanzo on their wedding day 
and a ninepatch quilt made by mary ingalls 
laura named their 200acre farm where they lived happily for 
more than a half century rocky ridge farm she and almanzo had a 
successful livestock and poultry business and shipped fruit from 
their apple and peach orchards to markets in kansas city st louis 
and memphis tenn 
almanzo who lived to be 92 made much of the furniture in their 
home which is on the national register of historic places 
mansfield did not have a sawmill so he and laura cut planed and 
finished tall oaks for paneling and the living room ceiling beams 
laura boasted the most modern country kitchen in the ozarks 
after almanzo piped water from a spring through their 1908 
montgomery ward stove and into the sink for both hot and cold 
running water 
rose wilder lane became an acclaimed and wealthy author 
journalist and essayist she wrote biographies of henry ford and 
herbert hoover and traveled extensively as a foreign correspondent 
including a wartime visit to vietnam at age 79 
in her later years laura lived alone at rocky ridge farm but 
wasnt lonely she visited friends in mansfield autographed books 
at bookstores into her mid80s and answered mail from adoring fans 
there is still an insatiable interest in laura ingalls wilder 
all around the world anderson said the little house series 
ended with her marriage to almanzo people come here because they 
want to know what happened in her life after that

rip van winkle did not sleep the sleep of 
the enchanted snoozing 20 years away in the haunted catskill 
mountains 
the lovable rogue of washington irvings story was a real man 
who abandoned his wife and children to become an 18th century 
barfly in new york city claims literary detective steven press 
real or not rip was not so lovable says press a theater 
professor at dutchess community college in poughkeepsie and rip 
should be an example for today when alcoholism is acknowledged as 
a disease and the drunks loved ones are recognized as victims 
its wrong that we have romanticized the drunk and castigated 
the woman who tries to hold the family together press says 
true or false press theory reflects societys growing sympathy 
toward alcoholics said david musto a professor at yale 
universitys medical school even the fact that hes writing 
about this and people are interested is a reflection of our 
times musto says 
in the early 1800s heavy drinking was considered a sign of 
individuality rather than a disease says jeffrey hon of the 
national council on alcoholism 
in the early part of the 19th century there was a lot more 
public drunkenness hon says thats what gave rise to the 
temperance movement 
alcohol consumption hit a peak in 1830 when average americans 
drank three times as much as they do today said musto who has 
studied drinking patterns of the time 
when washington irving was writing it was a time of enormous 
alcohol consumption for almost any purpose and at any time 
musto said alcohol was considered a food or medicine he said 
alcoholism was widespread because the tavern was a community 
center in those days a lure to men with unhappy home lives such as 
rips press said in an interview at his home in poughquaq 50 
miles north of new york city 
press is writing two musicals based on his version of rips 
story passion plays sympathetic to the plight of dame van winkle 
and other wives abandoned by drunken husbands press has written 
offbroadway plays and hopes to get his musicals produced in new 
york 
through files gathered from the museum of the city of new york 
local libraries and other sources press determined rip was born in 
1727 near the ulster county town of gardiner press says hes not 
sure if the name rip van winkle was real or if washington irving 
made it up for convenience press uses rip 
at 16 rips father died leaving the boy a fortune in land and 
cash the carousing rip went on a 24year binge and drank up his 
inheritance in the meantime he married dame van winkle the 
shedevil of irvings story and fathered two children judith and 
rip jr 
dame van winkles efforts to reform rip failed one day rip 
wandered off and heres where press version differs with 
irvings story irving had rip wander into the mystical catskills 
where the ghost of explorer henry hudson casts him into a 20year 
sleep 
according to press rip fled home in 1767 and headed south on 
the hudson river to new york city there amid the dutch taverns 
rip lived off bar owners and patrons who came to hear his tavern 
songs and stories his long lost weekend had begun 
no one goes to sleep for 20 years press says but we 
certainly consider alcoholic stupor a sleep we could survive for 20 
years 
after 20 years rips daughter found him performing in a stage 
show billed as the old dutcher she took him home and rip 
concocted the story of his long sleep to conceal his 20year drunk 
from neighbors 
we paint an image of rip as a wonderful guy but thats a 
terrible image press says he abandoned his wife and kids the 
ogre of the story is dame van winkle the shrew who died of a heart 
attack dame van winkle was no ogre she deserves to be pretty damn 
angry at this guy 
while rip inherited a fortune rip jr inherited his fathers 
drunken ways irving said rip jr became a drunk which is 
interesting because of recent findings about genetic inheritance of 
alcoholism press says 
historians and irving scholars doubt press version 
thats a new one on me says dan porter director of the new 
york state historical association hes got to have some pretty 
strong evidence because irving dealt in fiction not fact 
im sure there were people at the time who fit that pattern 
said robert wells an english professor who holds the washington 
irving chair at union college in schenectady there may well have 
been people like rip van winkle who were drunkards and were 
irresponsible like that but thats a long way from proving the man 
really existed 
but if it was true irving a regular at the hudson river 
taverns himself was bound to encounter the story like rip 
irving was a sponge for both alcohol and the folk tales of the 
catskills and the hudson valley irving may even have heard the 
story from rip himself press says 
press rip died in 1818 when irving was 35 irvings sketch 
book which contained rip van winkle was published in 1819 
my feeling is that irving met him they may have talked 
press says 
press began his search for the real rip in the 1950s while 
studying theater at new york university while press was directing 
dion boucicaults 19th century play rip van winkle a professor 
told him rip really lived and showed him papers about the old 
dutcher 
rips type the irresponsible boozer has a long tradition in 
american literature whether he really lived and ran off to hide in 
new york citys taverns doesnt matter press says the fact is 
alcoholic husbands have abandoned their families in all ages and 
there were surely a few rips among the 18th century dutch settlers 
everybody knows that in irving there is always the germ of 
truth press says but he would put layer upon layer of fantasy 
over it well never know the real truth

if you harbor any doubts that things happen much 
faster than they used to in the world of finance consider the 
recent rise of the dow jones industrial average to the 3000 level 
the familiar gauge of trends in stock market prices was more 
than 100 years old before it surpassed 1500 for the first time on 
dec 11 1985 
the next 1500 points took less than five years thanks to the 
bull market still raging on wall street 
but as impressive as that performance may look it is partly the 
result of a sort of optical illusion created by the math used to 
calculate the average 
the average that appears today in news headlines and 
computerized market reporting systems is a far more complicated 
entity than anything charles henry dow must have had in mind when 
he set out in 1884 to construct a yardstick for measuring the ups 
and downs of stocks 
dow cofounder of dow jones amp co and the first editor of the 
wall street journal picked 11 stocks he deemed representative 
befitting the makeup of the american economy in those days nine of 
his choices were railroads 
by simply adding up the most recent prices of those stocks and 
then dividing by 11 he could figure and publish a market 
average 
in 1896 dow devised an average of industrial stocks separate 
from the railroads with 12 components it was expanded to 20 in 
1916 and 30 in 1928 
as the dow evolved it also had to change its membership 
roster at intervals to keep up with changes in the american 
business scene 
early component stocks such as pacific mail steamship central 
leather and standard rope amp twine yielded in time to the likes of 
american telephone amp telegraph international business machines 
exxon and other of todays corporate giants 
amid all this activity a continuous average could not be 
calculated without making adjustments in the formula 
so the number used as the averages divisor was changed not 
only every time the number of stocks was increased or one was 
substituted for another but also whenever a stock split occurred 
instead of 30 the divisor shrank by stages to about 10 in 1949 
less than two in 1969 and on downward to about 05 today 
in a straight average a rise of 1 each in the price of all the 
component stocks would produce a onepoint increase with todays 
divisor by contrast gains of 1 apiece in the components would 
raise the average about 60 points 
that has given rise to complaints from some observers that the 
average overstates the volatility of todays stock market 
other critics say no sample of 30 stocks can accurately 
represent what happens to investors in more than 1600 issues 
traded on the new york stock exchange and many thousands more 
bought and sold in the various other us markets 
when professional investors compare the results they achieve 
against a market measure they seldom use the dow but refer 
instead to a broader alternative like standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index 
still in news reports and conversations at all levels of the 
economy the industrial average continues to fill the role for 
which it was created as a shorthand symbol of the market 
it stands wrote victor j hillery in a 1986 book on the dows 
history as the most widely recognized measure of the stock 
markets gyrations

some of americas highestpaid athletes are 
squaring off without benefit of shoulder pads in highprofile bids 
to win another kind of game 
the line between show business and sports blurred long ago but 
the proliferation of national football league players bullying 
their way through the television and movie landscape may be at an 
alltime high 
former players such as jim brown joe namath lyle alzado john 
matuszak merlin olsen ed marinaro and alex karras achieved 
varying degrees of acting success mostly though their roles came 
in lowbudget party flicks or tv series 
indianapolis colts placekicker dean biasucci is out to change 
that trend the pro bowl kicker wants an acting career in the most 
serious of theatrical forms the stage 
earlier this summer biasucci completed his role as marc antony 
in the indiana repertory theatres production of julius caesar 
michael gross of tvs family ties headed the cast 
ive been playing football since i was 9 years old and its 
just so natural to me acting is becoming more comfortable to me 
biasucci said after close games im mentally exhausted after 
you give a good performance youre that way too 
tackling shakespeare was scarier to biasucci than getting rushed 
by a bunch of burly defensive linemen 
i was kind of afraid of it because id never done it before i 
didnt start getting a hold of the marc anthony thing until two 
weeks into the role he said now i feel like i can be good 
you know when you have it 
the 27yearold shared a dressing room with veteran stage actor 
michael lipton caesar and cleopatra sleuth separate 
tables who played the title role of the fallen roman leader 
as anthony i said to him nothing will be as difficult to you 
again hes got guts hes a very talented young man lipton 
said at the moment he has a wonderful honesty on the stage and 
hes simple he certainly has the actors gene 
biasuccis passion for acting erupted when he took a drama class 
during his sophomore year at western carolina university in 
cullowhee nc 
i was going to major in business like everyone else i took an 
acting class and it was fun i decided i may as well do something i 
like said biasucci who acted in about 10 college plays while on 
a football scholarship 
his thesis analyzed arthur kopits the end of the world 
which had a brief run on broadway in 1984 early in his pro career 
he returned to do summer stock at western carolina 
with his muscular build and dark looks biasucci seemingly would 
be a natural for lucrative commercials instead he is pursuing 
roles in lowprofile local productions 
he made his professional debut last season in the indiana 
repertory theatres production of luigi pirandellos six 
characters in search of an author and drew favorable notices for 
his portrayal of the angry son this time critics praised him for 
his handling of antonys funeral oration but criticized his 
monotone voice 
at first my plan was to be in the nfl for four years and then 
i could act now i want to play longer and i want to still pursue a 
career as an actor said biasucci who is looking for an agent 
his goal is simple to be a wellrespected actor where you 
have steady work and you call the shots thats probably all any 
actor wants 
but for now he must sandwich his love for acting around his 
meaty football career hes been with the colts since 1985 
biasuccis summer acting stint ends thursday when hes due in 
training camp his current contract is up for renegotiation on the 
offchance he doesnt reach agreement biasucci could return to the 
footlights earlier than he planned 
its a disadvantage to doing one show a year because youre 
just getting the rust off for the first two weeks when my football 
career is over that will change he said 
despite his success on the field biasucci prefers the nightly 
polite applause of a small theater audience to the onceaweek 
roars of 60000 fans at colts games 
if i could only do one i think i would act as an actor you 
have a script youre using your imagination to create their voices 
and their actions you have to have a creative mind 
but he still battles the stereotype of a dumb jock who knows his 
sport and little else 
they say hes not going to be that good they say hes 
another one of those football players trying to act and im 
fighting it all the way biasucci said 
he has plenty of company in his suffering 
brian bosworth whose career as a seattle seahawks linebacker 
has been cut short by shoulder injuries currently is shooting a 
10 million movie in florida called the brotherhood he plays 
an fbi agent seeking to stop a political assassination by a 
motorcycle gang 
i see in him marlon brando james dean and gary cooper all 
rolled in one package hes got the same appeal of a stallone or 
schwarzenegger director bruce malmuth enthuses 
former los angeles defensive end fred dryer recently completed 
his seventh season in the television cop series hunter 
you have to kill that football guy off because he cant help 
you dryer has said in a published interview the mistake a lot 
of athletes have made is they dont get rid of that guy they march 
that ego their fame their name right in there and they expect to 
be given work because they are famous football players 
biasucci shudders at such shoot em up examples i dont want 
to do anything stupid 
he is the exception rather than the rule among his acting peers 
nfl kickers earned an average salary of 240000 in 1989 which 
explains why biasucci squirmed slightly as other members of the 
julius caesar cast worried aloud about their next job he 
performed for free 
lipton began his career 42 years ago on broadway and says he 
thinks he understands the lure of an acting career to an athlete 
since their careers are so tenuous they miss a lot of that 
hoopla they miss the commercials and going on the road theyre 
like big kids lipton said 
biasucci says the challenge of translating a script into 
riveting dialogue equals the thrill of successfully executing a 
move from the colts playbook 
you can act until youre 75 and never stop learning youre 
always finding new things even in one particular show he said 
ive got a long way to go i started late but i dont think 
thats going to hurt me too much

washington ap when jesse jackson describes his career plans 
he says he is running for us senator from the district of 
columbia theres no such office but he thinks there should be 
jackson actually is running for shadow senator an unpaid 
lobbyist post for dc statehood the crusade has been a magnet for 
scorn and skepticism 
hes been labeled his shadowship by one acerbic commentator 
and deemed increasingly irrelevant by another futile playacting 
some say a phony job when he could have had a real one outdated 
protest politics outside the mainstream the kiss of death for a 
third presidential bid 
theres a certain contempt factor in high places jackson 
allows it doesnt discourage him or dim his customary eloquence 
why dc statehood why not mayor he asked last week at a 
gathering of democratic women because my life commitment is to 
expand democracy my quest is not employment its empowerment 
later he says no one expected lech walesa or nelson mandela to 
settle for jobs within the oppressive systems they were trying to 
change 
the district is an occupied zone with its single nonvoting 
house delegate and limited authority over its own affairs he says 
its humiliating to have to grab senators in hallways and plead for 
help he says bitterly running around as if we had on waiters 
outfits waiting to get what was left over from the dinner 
theres no question that jackson feels strongly about dc 
statehood makes the case well and will win one of the districts 
two shadow senator slots in november 
yet his choice so soon after the electoral triumphs of 
virginia gov douglas wilder and new york mayor david dinkins so 
soon after shunning the dc mayoral race has puzzled many 
the ultimate political irony of 1990 could be the election of 
jackson to that artificial position at the same time that former 
charlotte mayor harvey gantt is being elected to a real seat in the 
us senate columnist mark shields wrote recently 
the mayors job is a real job to avoid that and run for a 
phony lobbyists job shows youre interested in playing protest 
politics and not mainstream real politics said al from 
executive director of the conservativeleaning democratic 
leadership council 
jackson says his support for dc statehood part of the 
democratic platform is mainstream democratic party politics 
challenge his relevance and he mentions the 7 million votes he 
got in his 1988 presidential bid he cites a recent poll that shows 
him the frontrunning democrat for 1992 he talks of the hundreds 
who come to hear him speak the unmet needs of the poor and 
downtrodden 
public servants are relevant as long as people need public 
service he says 
yet some observers see jacksons influence waning with the rise 
of black politicians like wilder north carolinas gantt and 
georgia gubernatorial candidate andrew young 
they seem to be eclipsing him as spokesmen for a broader 
political movement theyre not just black politicians and 
increasingly it seems to me that he is said stuart rothenberg 
editor and publisher of the political report 
jackson argues it is racist to compare him to other black 
politicians and resists the suggestion he is the candidate of only 
one group 
he still talks of rainbow coalitions including one for dc 
statehood he sees this mission as a logical extension of his other 
efforts to expand democracy registering voters organizing 
workers protesting apartheid pushing for new domestic priorities 
like urban reinvestment 
many agree the shadow senator job is compatible with jacksons 
work aims and personality he can keep traveling promoting his 
causes earning his living moving ahead with a syndicated 
television show scheduled to debut in september 
and while analysts dont think statehood will expand his base 
most dont see him losing support over the issue either 
but can he get any respect will he be taken seriously 
its unlikely that anyones going to call him senator 
jackson said linda williams a black politics specialist at 
harvards john f kennedy school of government its going to be 
extremely difficult for him to be seen as an elected official 
much less a senator hes really got a hard sale 
but ann lewis an adviser to jacksons 1988 campaign said 
jackson has always made the most of his opportunities and if 
anybody can make the job work he can do it 
at least six states tennessee michigan california 
minnesota oregon and alaska sent shadow senators to washington 
before they became states according to the senate historians 
office the first and last to be granted access to the floor of the 
senate were the tennesseans in 1796 
thats precedent said jackson who is seeking the same 
privileges for the two dc shadows counters from its a 
terrible precedent to let a lobbyist pretend hes a senator 
when it became clear that dc mayor marion barry was going to 
be preoccupied with his drug and perjury trial many looked to 
jackson to run for mayor he could heal the city they said he 
could gain experience in an elective office 
had jackson gone that route democrats would not now be 
wondering how to handle this formidable shadow and to the 
relief of party moderates and conservatives he would have been 
otherwise engaged during the 1992 presidential race 
but jackson has never bowed to or become part of the party or 
any other institution and so he is still at large seemingly 
everywhere marching with strikers in las vegas organizing 
textile and chicken workers in the south protesting the savings 
and loan bailout in chicago welcoming mandela in washington 
exhorting democrats in iowa and indiana 
what hell be doing in 1992 he wont say

while other asian nations work around the 
clock in quest of prosperity residents of vientiane still take 
midday siestas and jealously guard their weekends 
vientiane never the briskest of capitals virtually came to a 
halt after the communists took over in 1975 
although people who live here say things have picked up in 
recent years children play in the dry fountain of a central plaza 
and tethered goats munch the tall grass nearby chickens and 
turkeys peck in the muddy compounds of government ministries 
japanese vehicles are replacing old soviet and french models 
but traffic remains sparse offices close for lunch from 1130 am 
until 2 pm and weekends are reserved for family and friends 
since 1986 the government has pursued westernstyle reforms in 
one of the worlds poorest economies relaxing rigid policies that 
caused businessmen and tens of thousands of other laotians to flee 
the country 
political reform is nowhere in sight however and diplomats 
note that relations between laos and china its huge hardline 
northern neighbor have become especially cordial 
the chinese merchant class is reemerging in vientiane and new 
small enterprises have sprouted but there is none of the urgency 
seen in such other southeast asian countries as booming thailand 
just across the mekong river 
asias full of dynamism but thats not laos a western 
development expert said speaking anonymously i think that in 
the long term it will remain a unique case more like an african 
country than an asian one 
officials acknowledge much needs to be done to develop the 
country but their watchwords are step by step 
no significant manufacturing base has been created despite 15 
years of aid from moscow and eastern europe and help more recently 
from japan sweden australia and other western countries the 
annual per capita income is less than 170 
officials blame the malaise on the incentivenumbing central 
planning of the past and on inefficient use of aid from communist 
allies 
one program sent 50 laotians to the soviet union to become 
railroad engineers a western diplomat said laos has no railroad 
trade is hampered by lack of direct access to the sea and by 
derelict road and telephone systems the nations 4 million people 
are spread over an area the size of britain and most educated 
laotions have fled 
infant mortality is among the worlds highest 200 per 1000 
births in some areas vannaret rajaprop vice minister of health 
said it is a very important problem for us we need the labor and 
manpower for development 
among the countrys assets are rich supplies of timber and 
minerals 
analysts say the unspoiled countryside and tropical climate 
provide great potential for tourism but the government shows no 
enthusiasm for foreigners it eliminated the drug culture and 
prostitution that attracted western hippies before 1975 and 
now limits the number of visitors 
vientiane has few hotels in phone savane a town on the 
legendary plain of jars the only hotel is made of moldering 
plywood 
when an aging soviet antonov aircraft crashed on landing late in 
1989 laos was left with only five domestic passenger planes 
officials say they havent enough money to replace the antonov 
in hopes of obtaining foreign cash to fill some of the gaps the 
national assembly recently passed laws intended to increase 
investor confidence the first laotian constitution is to be 
adopted by december 
an estimated 80 million has been pledged from abroad for future 
projects but diplomats say most is from small companies in 
thailand some predict there will be no major investment without 
political change 
there have been a lot of new words but people see the same 
old faces responsible for past conservative policies a western 
development worker said some refreshing at high levels might 
convince people there are some real changes going on 
kaysone phomvihane 69 has led the communist party since 1955 
and has been premier since it gained power 
somphavan inthawong a member of the national assembly and the 
senior economic planner said the governments priority was to 
raise living standards not reform the political structure 
we should not think about building a rocket to go to the moon 
when we are one of the worlds 10 least developed countries he 
said questions that are relevant in other countries might not be 
relevant in our society at the moment 
diplomats said some intellectuals privately favor a multiparty 
system and some journalists want relaxation of the rigid press 
controls but no organized political opposition is evident

just off a red clay track beside 
the sparkling tchepone river is the reborn hamlet of ban dong nai 
which american bombers pounded into oblivion a generation ago 
today the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors but the 
older ones still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that 
rained from the skies between 1964 and 1973 
american planes attacked ban dong nai during the indochina war 
because the clay track was part of the ho chi minh trail the 
network of jungle paths through eastern laos and cambodia used by 
communist north vietnam to move men and supplies into usbacked 
south vietnam 
not far across the vietnamese frontier is the former us base 
at khe san which gen william westmoreland called the key to 
stopping fullscale infiltration from the trail us marines held 
it during a 1968 siege that cost the lives of about 500 americans 
and 10000 vietnamese 
the ho chi minh trail was the main target of americas secret 
war in laos which involved 242000 bombing sorties in 1969 
alone more than 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on laos 
altogether surpassing the us total in world war ii 
lahoun maprayvong a former guerrilla and now an administrator 
in tchepone town recalled the first day of bombing during a 
buddhist festival in late 1964 
we were warned but we just didnt know what to expect he 
said and the bombardment grew steadily worse the planes came 
every day for nine years sometimes four or five times then also 
at night 
lahoun said villagers were most afraid of the huge b52 bombers 
the united states began using extensively in 1967 
they flew so high you couldnt see them so there was no 
warning he said they dropped bombs in line bam bam bam 
bam like that if you were next in line then that was it 
each b52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in boxes half a mile wide 
and two miles long gouging out permanent craters 
when they bombed like that people ran away to the mountains 
to live in caves lahoun said some years we had to change 
places five times when we came back there was nothing left 
ban dong nai and tchepone were destroyed by 1973 
noi who was a young girl in the 1960s said her father was 
killed in one attack i just dont understand why the americans 
did what they did you couldnt escape the bombs she said 
khamlai was in her 20s in 1968 when she and her younger brother 
walking to a rice field stepped on american mines 
she looked down at the ugly metal and rubber left leg she has 
worn for 22 years and said can you tell me how to make it more 
beautiful 
her brother lost both legs 
people along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks 
lahoun said some still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and 
phosphorous bombs many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants 
remain bare 
after south vietnams unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971 
all the trees and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed 
with the wreckage of tanks helicopters and guns said phou 
wattana a district official and former guerrilla 
villagers pointed out the hulk of an americanmade tank and 
chopped away long grass to uncover an artillery piece children 
played near piles of rusty shells and bombs 
theyre only dangerous if you put them in the fire a 
policeman said with a shrug 
xoun an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to watch 
the children of ban dong nai used a machete to uncover unexploded 
250 and 500pound bombs 
many bomb craters remain in and around the village and xoun said 
thousands of small unexploded antipersonnel bombs still kill and 
maim farmers 
when the planes came we had to go and live in the forest for 
many years he said 
as you can see we are used to living peacefully around here 
there used to be lots of fruit trees jack fruit coconut banana 
but after the americans came there was nothing left we had to 
rebuild everything but the fruit trees wont grow anymore 
lahoun said the united states should help 
we hadnt done anything to hurt the americans and they came to 
drop bombs on us he said we ask the us government to do 
something to cure the damage they have done

children found two metal spheres the 
size of tennis balls and were playing with them when the toys 
exploded killing a 7yearold boy and seriously wounding another 
child 
that was in april in ban na dee village nearly two decades 
after the air war ended small antipersonnel bombs dropped on laos 
by american planes kill and maim dozens of people a year 
the plain of jars a remote region of central laos named for the 
hundreds of ancient burial urns spread over its undulating hills 
was one of the most heavily bombed areas of indochina between 1964 
and 1973 
american planes rained bombies as the laotians call the 
antipersonnel bomblets and thousands of tons of conventional 
bombs on areas under the control of laotian communist guerrillas 
the small round bombs designed to kill or disable people 
explode and spew ball bearings tiny darts or slivers of metal or 
plastic many that did not go off lie hidden in rice paddies and 
long grass throughout the plain of jars 
xieng khouang province officials said 19 people had been killed 
and 39 wounded by the bomblets so far in 1990 boua van a 
provincial administrator said more than 1000 people had been 
killed in xieng khouang since the bombing ended in 1973 twothirds 
of them children 
western aid workers say villagers are afraid to farm in many 
parts of the province 
the villagers are subsistence farmers who have to go out and 
dig for their living a laotian official said on condition of 
anonymity 
when they go out to plow their fields or dig latrines they 
risk uncovering a bombie in some cases the decision where to dig 
an irrigation ditch depends on whether there are bombies around 
some of the wars leftovers have been welcome scrap merchants 
say they will be in business for years with the debris littering 
the plain of jars 
kham meuang said he sells tons of bomb scraps and aluminum from 
downed us aircraft to buyers in thailand and vietnam 
ball bearings from bombies can be used to repair bicycles 
he said and aircraft aluminum brings a profit of 1 a kilogram 
22 pounds when sold to thai buyers 
its best quality better than the stuff they can get over 
there the merchant said 
aluminum scrap of lesser quality is made into the spoons found 
in noodle stalls livestock wear bells crafted from bomb parts 
underwing fuel tanks from jet fighters have become elegant 
canoes in savannakhet province 
hmong hill people make traditionalstyle jewelry from aircraft 
aluminum which they say is lighter more plentiful and cheaper 
than silver 
villagers say large unexploded bombs are relatively easy to 
avoid or defuse but that some of the bomblets have no external 
fuse mechanisms and may explode without warning 
when they are on the surface it is not so bad but when they 
are buried deep in a field it is difficult to avoid casualties 
said boua van the provincial administrator 
in the savannakhet provincial hospital a farmer lay in agony 
from head chest and foot wounds suffered when he struck a bomblet 
with a stick while planting rice a few weeks earlier an xray 
showed ball bearings inside him 
the explosions usually kill the people who cause them said dr 
vath vongsouthi who has treated dozens of victims 
boua van said most casualties occur during the planting season 
and of course people are afraid but when they are working they 
have no other choice except to try to avoid them the children 
especially dont know how dangerous they are 
he said he had defused at least 500 of the bomblets but that 
other people without his knowledge and luck had been killed trying 
it 
local officials and western aid workers say the us government 
should help solve the problem 
us diplomats in vientiane said washington had proposed sending 
experts to train bomb disposal teams but the government had 
declined the offer for reasons that were unclear

congressional negotiators must resolve a host 
of disputes over how far government and industry should go to clean 
the air from placing emission restrictions on small factories to 
helping workers laid off because of tougher pollution controls 
the sheer size of the 148member housesenate conference 
committee more than a quarter of the congress points to the high 
stakes in the political battle the legislation is expected to cost 
more than 21 billion a year in new pollution controls 
there will be clean air legislation this year i dont think 
anyone disputes that asserts sen max baucus dmont chairman 
of the conference 
baucus said in an interview that he considers separate clean air 
bills passed by the house and senate by and large very similar 
with identical goals of significantly cutting urban smog reducing 
acid rain and curtailing the industrial release of toxic chemicals 
by the end of the decade 
but there remains much dispute over details of tergy and commerce 
committee 
the senate negotiators on the other hand number only nine 
four of them senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
baucus sen john chafee rri and sen david durenberger 
rminn led the senate battle for clean air legislation seven of 
the nine are members of the senate environment committee and they 
are expected to balk at any proposals that would significantly 
weaken the legislation 
the separate bills that breezed through both the house and 
senate last spring would impose stiff new requirements on industry 
to control toxic chemicals on factories to reduce smogcausing 
pollution and on electric power plants to curb sulfur dioxide 
which causes acid rain they also would direct automakers to build 
cleaner cars and oil companies to provide cleaner fuels to reduce 
urban smog 
but the house and senate versions often differ on how far 
companies should go to control toxic releases what polluters 
should be covered or in some cases what measures should be taken 
to comply 
the final negotiations on these details will determine whether 
you have a good clean air bill or a bill thats not very good at 
all said richard ayres chairman of the national clean air 
coalition an environmental umbrella group 
industry meanwhile makes no secret that it will push the 
congressional negotiators to scuttle some of the strongest 
requirements in either bill 
we know the goals of the two bills are about the same were 
trying to make it the most affordable to the american business 
community and to the consumer said william fay executive 
director of the clean air working group the industrys lobbying 
coalition 
fay calls the governments estimated 215 billion price tag for 
the clean air bill unrealistic and maintains the cost will be much 
higher if some of the provisions found in either the senate or 
house bills survive 
according to lawmakers congressional aides and lobbyists here 
are a number of the most contentious issues that will have to be 
resolved by the house and senate negotiators 
</TEXT>

both the house and senate bills would require tougher tailpipe 
emission controls but the senate bill would trigger a second round 
of even tighter requirements automatically if air quality did not 
meet federal health standards in a dozen pollutionplagued cities 
by the end of the decade 
the automakers argue they cannot meet the second phase of 
controls with current technology and hope the house version will 
prevail they have a strong ally in dingell 
at the same time however the automakers plan to fight another 
house provision not in the senate bill that would require them 
to build and market at least some alternative fuel cars

both bills would require that industry adopt new technology to 
curb industrial releases of toxic chemicals into the air but the 
senate bill would go another step by establishing minimum cancer 
risk levels that would be allowed after the new equipment was 
installed if those risks could not be achieved a plant could be 
ordered shut down 
the house version considered by industry to be less onerous 
than the senate requirements would leave it to the environmental 
protection agency to establish an ample margin of safety beyond 
installation of the new equipment many environmentalists also 
favor the house version fearing the plantbyplant assessment of 
risk included in the senate bill would be less effective

containing assistance for workers saying it would be difficult to

athletes such as runner joan benoit samuelson and basketballs 
michael jordan attested to jacksons ability in their specialities 
there were dissenters in last years ad hockeys wayne gretzky 
and guitar man bo diddley to name two but a revised version of 
the commercial six months later indicated bo made diddley a 
believer as well 
the ad catapulted jackson to the top of the list of the years 
most persuasive sports figures in a commercial according to an 
annual survey of 22000 people questioned by the research firm 
video storyboard tests inc 
and it was the main reason consumers cited in making nike the 
sixth most memorable admaker during the first quarter of 1990 
another video storyboard tests survey said earlier this year 
but last years success created a problem for jim riswold 
associate creative director at nikes ad agency wieden amp kennedy in 
portland ore 
it was a hard act to follow said riswold copywriter on 
both campaigns 
we kept coming back to the question how does bo do all these 
things and we decided well bo is more than one person we 
decided to use the dumbest joke in the history of advertising 
riswold said 
for the new ad nikes admakers decided to have jackson don gear 
used in a dozen different sports not only his kansas city royals 
baseball uniform and his los angeles raiders football suit but 
tennis cycling surfing soccer cricket golf cricket and 
crosstraining gear 
each of the bos were shot separately skillful editing made it 
appear they were gathering one by one in a locker room 
bo football tries to guess bo baseballs name bo cyclist 
screeches to a halt and asks wheres that tour de france thing 
bo hockey sports le bo stitched across his jersey bo golfer 
has a bo caddy to carry his clubs and search for his 
jacksonautograph golf ball 
jackson put on a jockeys outfit to lead a horse across the set 
and he got behind the wheel of an indystyle racing car that was 
pulled across the set 
chers onetime beau sonny bono wandered into the act i 
thought this was another bo knows commercial he said 
by the time bo director joins the scene and calls cut at the 
end of the ad the tv screen is full of bos 
there is some method to all this madness the ad showed off an 
array of nike apparel as well as its shoes nike makes clothes for 
each of the sports jackson demonstrated except horse and auto 
racing hockey and cricket according to nike ad manager bill zeitz 
he said nike plans to spend about 10 million on buying 
television time for the new ad he declined to say how much jackson 
is being paid

a new satellitetransmitted information 
system is beaming the names of buyers and sellers to farmers with 
too many green peppers or too little sweet corn 
the pilot program by the illinois farm bureau is seen as one 
possible solution to the eternal problem of balancing supply and 
demand in perishable produce as well as possibly boosting profits 
sometimes we have too much and sometimes we dont have 
enough said ron friend who raises cantaloupe and watermelon 
near havana in westcentral illinois along the illinois river i 
remember one day in 1973 it came out exactly right 
fruit and vegetable growers scramble to find wholesale buyers 
when they harvest more fresh commodities than they can sell at 
their roadside markets or to regular customers and they search for 
other farmers with extra produce when their own harvests are short 
the growers seem to be very excited about the system said 
don naylor a specialist in fruit and vegetable marketing who 
manages the new project for the farm bureau were trying to 
bring farmers together who might be separated by hundreds of 
miles 
the farm bureau already had the foundation of the new service 
its farmdayta system for delivering weather market information and 
agricultural news to about 5000 illinois grain producers 
farms receive the data via satellite dish and read it on a 
computer screen twentyfive fruit and vegetable growers were added 
to the system this summer to see if it could help them buy and sell 
produce 
those farmers call a tollfree number to list their names 
locations telephone numbers and crops they wish to buy or sell 
they then must contact buyers or sellers and agree on terms 
we dont raise our own fruit and at times there are local 
shortages said don zeldenrust who grows vegetables and sells 
produce at his chicago heights roadside market 
we might have to go to michigan missouri or arkansas when 
there are guys in southern illinois who have what we need said 
zeldenrust it doesnt make sense to ship the fruit a long way 
its better for them and better for us 
the buyerseller information along with prices being paid at 
chicagos south water street wholesale produce market is 
transmitted to subscribers who pay 100 for six months service 
during the pilot stage of the project 
im using it to keep uptodate on the market said carl 
weissert who grows vegetables near fairview heights in the 
metropolitan area east of st louis 
he said when the system is fully operational the speed at which 
the information is available should be a big plus to farmers 
you wont find out next week what was available said 
weissert 
growers say a limited amount of information now is on the 
system but they hope more farmers will sign up and that it will 
help all of them increase their profits 
right now you just cant find sweet corn anywhere said 
dennis harms who raises and sells fruits and vegetables in mchenry 
county northwest of the metropolitan chicago area 
if this system works we can help each other cut out the 
middleman lower our prices and compete with the big chain stores 
theyre killing us

a sept 4 trial date has been set for former 
thrift executive edwin t mcbirney iii but his attorney says 
publicity surrounding the case may make it difficult to get a fair 
trial in dallas 
to schedule two press conferences to announce the 
indictment we think that exacerbates an already bad situation 
attorney paul coggins said thursday earlier in the day his 
client the former chairman of sunbelt savings association of 
texas was arraigned on charges of bank fraud misapplication of 
funds false entries and making false statements 
coggins has until july 30 to ask us district judge robert 
maloney to move the trial 
mcbirney who entered an innocent plea is one of several former 
thrift executives targeted for prosecution in investigations 
looking for fraud in the multibilliondollar collapse of the 
savings and loan industry 
he was indicted last week by one of three federal grand juries 
in dallas hearing bank fraud cases the charges were announced in 
simultaneous news conferences in dallas and washington where us 
attorney general dick thornburgh conducted the briefing 
mcbirney 37 faces up to 85 years in jail and a fine of 45 
million if convicted he remains free on his own recognizance 
dallasbased sunbelt nicknamed gunbelt savings for its 
freewheeling deals grew 5000 fold from 1982 when mcbirney and 
five associates bought the thrift until 1986 when government 
regulators forced him out 
sunbelt failed two years later in a bailout regulators estimate 
will cost taxpayers 2 billion 
the 17count indictment accuses mcbirney of promising another 
thrift a 6 million profit on one transaction in return for help in 
financing a 700 million real estate deal in california 
investigators say the deal was one of the reasons sunbelt failed 
according to the indictment mcbirney guaranteed western savings 
association also of dallas a 6 million profit on any property it 
wished to sell in return western was to provide 30 million to 
help finance the 700 million deal by sun cal a sunbelt subsidiary 
mcbirney directed sunbelt officials to loan 226 million to an 
unidentified purchaser to buy a 708acre tract north of dallas 
valued at 13 million the indictment says 
the indictment claims mcbirney made additional loans to keep the 
original loan out of default and then altered records to hide the 
deals from sunbelt and government auditors 
thirteen former sunbelt executives borrowers or mcbirney 
associates have been convicted as a result of the 2yearlong 
sunbelt investigation 
sunbelt western and six other thrifts were declared insolvent 
in 1988 and packaged into a new institution sunbelt savings 
federal savings bank owned by depositors

for 825 million 
gm has said it does not plan to sell its main defense 
subsidiary gmhughes electronic corp which includes hughes 
aircraft co and delco electronics corp 
rhoades said one of the three bids came as a joint effort 
between gmhughes and alcatel co of france 
the others are from loral corp a new york defense electronics

investment firm carlyle group and aerospatiale of france which is 
connected with the airbus aircraft

house democrats plan quick committee approval 
of a major civil rights bill for workers while remaining open to a 
compromise aimed at heading off a presidential veto over hiring 
quotas 
we will listen respectfully to any administration proposals 
rep don edwards dcalif said thursday as lawmakers laid the 
groundwork for action on the bill in the judiciary committee next 
week 
he suggested though that changes designed to ease 
administration concerns could be fairly modest were going to be 
discussing one or two items that could make them feel a little 
better he said 
the measure which tops the civil rights movements legislative 
agenda won senate approval 6534 wednesday night the margin of 
approval was two votes short of the twothirds needed to overturn a 
presidential veto 
despite the plan for quick committee action house speaker 
thomas foley dwash said the measure probably would not reach 
the floor until september he said the reason was a logjam of bills 
awaiting action 
provisions of the bill which would effectively reverse five 
supreme court decisions last year range from a ban on racial 
harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for discrimination 
victims in extreme cases 
the sharpest clashes have come over a provision designed to 
overcome a supreme court ruling that favors companies in certain 
discrimination suits 
in these suits companies are charged with discrimination 
because their percentage of minority employees is smaller than the 
percentage of qualified minority workers in the local labor force 
until last year companies could win if they proved that the 
employment practices leading to the disparity were required by 
business necessity the new ruling made it easier for 
employers placing on those filing suit the burden of proving the 
practices in question were not business necessities 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the chief senate sponsor said 
he and white house officials bargained for weeks over the 
definition of business necessity but could never fully cement an 
agreement 
kennedy said that in the final hours before the vote they spoke 
of including two definitions but could not agree on which one would 
cover issues such as hiring firing and promotions 
the administration maintains that in its current form the 
definition would force employers to hire by quota as a way of 
making certain that they comply with the law 
attorney general dick thornburgh said today the administration 
was regrouping and was prepared to continue negotiations with 
the bills supporters to reach a compromise 
the president wants to rule out quotas and rule in maximum 
employment opportunities for americans thornburgh said on cbs 
this morning he added however the president will not sign 
a quota bill thats not in the american tradition 
president bush has said repeatedly that he wants a bill to fight 
job discrimination but not one that would lead to quotas 
im still hopeful that eventually well get something worked 
out i think its important for the country kennedy told 
reporters 
republicans suggested that democrats have to be concerned about 
the possibility that they could not override the presidential veto 
that has been threatened if the bill reaches bush in its current 
form 
its obvious that 34 senate votes are enough to sustain a 
veto said rep james sensenbrenner rwis 
rep jack brooks dtexas chairman of the judiciary committee 
said he expected the panel to approve the bill without any changes 
tuesday but added there could be compromise eventually 
they havent worked out any compromise with me or mr 
edwards he said i want it written down i want to take a look 
at their suggestions

kuwait has canceled a state of alert it 
declared in an oil dispute with iraq a kuwaiti source said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity claimed thursday 
that the crisis appeared to have passed like a summer cloud 
however officials in baghdad reported that thousands of 
kuwaitis visiting iraq were heading home and iraqi dailies 
continued to accuse kuwait and the united arab emirates of 
usurping iraqs rights 
the alert followed iraqi charges that kuwait had stolen iraqi 
oil worth 24 billion and iraqi threats of retaliation kuwait 
had appealed to other arab states for support in the dispute with 
its much more powerful neighbor 
iraqi president saddam hussein on thursday tightened his grip on 
power winning support from his rubberstamp parliament for a 
presidency for life 
the developments underscored simmering tensions in the persian 
gulf the region includes about twothirds of the worlds proven 
oil reserves so instability can pose a threat to the worlds oil 
supply 
baghdad in recent days had denounced kuwait and the united arab 
emirates for exceeding production quotas set by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries or opec 
iraq says falling oil prices brought on by the oil glut have 
robbed it of 14 billion in revenues the past year and saddam this 
week accused quota violators of stabbing iraq in the back with a 
poisoned dagger 
in seeking to defuse the crisis kuwait on thursday solicited 
arab league help in settling its longstanding border dispute with 
iraq the small sultanate enlisted the help of influential saudi 
arabia in easing tensions and its diplomats fanned out across the 
middle east 
a major factor in the kuwaiti and saudi responses has been fears 
that the quarrel could disrupt an opec conference set to begin 
next thursday in geneva on production and pricing policy 
both kuwait and the uae have promised to cut oil production 
in line with the quotas decreed by the 13member cartel also oil 
prices which had dipped to 14 a barrel recently have recovered 
to around opecs benchmark level of 18 a barrel 
some kuwaiti officials and diplomats suggested that saddams 
accusations are aimed at winning a writeoff of a debt of 30 
billion to kuwait and saudi arabia the two poured the money into 
iraq during the 198088 war against iran to prop up its economy and 
pay for weapons 
kuwaits appeal for help in settling the border dispute was made 
in a memorandum sent to the arab league headquarters in tunis the 
kuwait news agency quoted the memo as suggesting that a committee 
be formed to resolve the question on the basis of treaties and 
existing documents 
iraq this week accused kuwait of border incursions including the 
pumping of 24 billion worth of oil in the past decade from an 
iraqi oil field near the boundary 
kuwaits foreign minister sheikh sabah alahmed said kuwait 
was producing oil from fields well within its territory 
meanwhile the official iraqi news agency reported that the 
iraqi parliament had expressed support for saddam becoming 
president for life 
the iraqi news agency said the 250member legislature dominated 
by saddams party called for changes in a new draft constitution 
that would have provided for presidential elections iraq has held 
no such balloting since becoming a republic in 1958 
the constitution is subject to public vote expected later this 
year 
saddam who has been in power since july 1979 exercises 
neartotal rule over iraqs 17 million people through his vast 
security apparatus 
he has turned his reign into a personality cult that has reached 
the realms of nearmythology photos and posters of him are seen 
everywhere in iraq and it is a capital offense to insult him 
publicly

president bushs savings and loan bailout fund 
will be nearly out of money if officials reach their goal of 
closing or selling 77 institutions by sept 30 a federal agency 
says 
figures provided thursday by the resolution trust corp 
oversight board indicate that unless congress authorizes more 
borrowing regulators could have as little as 73 billion in 
borrowing authority left when the new federal fiscal year begins 
oct 1 
the bottom line is it would cause us to very 
significantly reduce the pace of resolutions said peter monroe 
president of the oversight board 
congress last year allocated 50 billion to cover sampl losses and 
the oversight board estimates that after the 77 resolutions are 
finished 37 billion of that will have been used however the 
agency will hit a cash crunch before the 50 billion is exhausted 
because of legal caps on its shortterm borrowing 
in addition to the 73 billion the agency could spend any 
money it can get by selling repossessed real estate and sour loans 
inherited from previous sampl bailouts he said 
if congress doesnt provide more money before adjourning for the 
november elections the government will be forced to slow the pace 
of the bailout or dramatically increase the pace of asset sales 
monroe said 
his comments combined with the new figures are the clearest 
indication yet from the administration about the urgency of 
providing additional bailout funds 
in appearances before congressional panels in may and june 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady roughly doubled the 
administrations august 1989 estimate of the bailout cost from 50 
billion to between 90 billion and 130 billion he had said 
additional money would be needed by the end of december or early 
next year 
monroes figures indicate that at the current pace the bailout 
will run out of money soon after sept 30 
so far the trust corporation has resolved the cases of 210 
sampls leaving roughly 250 insolvent thrifts open and under 
government control at least an additional 250 institutions still 
under private ownership are expected to fail 
were twosevenths of the way through monroe said 
because money is scarce officials will concentrate this quarter 
on closing the sampls that are losing money the fastest he said 
in any case officials will never go back to the type of 
deals done in 1988 by the nowdismantled federal home loan bank 
board monroe said because the bank board lacked cash to pay off 
depositors it attracted sampl acquirers through guarantees and other 
subsidies extending up to 10 years 
the 1988 transactions are coming under increasing criticism in 
congress because they virtually ensured lucrative returns to sampl 
buyers who made only a small investment 
the oversight board authorized the trust corporation to borrow 
up to 34 billion through the treasury for the 77 resolutions in 
the julyseptember period this working capital borrowing would 
be repaid as the government sells sampl assets 
in other developments thursday 
angry northeastern and midwestern house members said they were 
introducing a bill to force states with a disproportionate share of 
troubled thrifts such as texas and california to pay a bigger 
portion of bailout costs if a state declines to pay its 
statechartered thrifts no longer would be eligible for federal 
deposit insurance 
other legislation sponsored by rep joe kennedy dmass would 
force wealthy americans to pay more of the cost his bill would 
raise 100 billion over five years by imposing new income taxes on 
individuals earning more than 100000 a year and corporations 
earning more than 75000 a year it also would eliminate a 
provision that forgives inheritance taxes on capital gains at death 
the justice department said it had uncovered certain sampl 
cases where thrift institutions had swapped bad loans with each 
other to avoid regulatory scrutiny but spokesman doug tillett said 
the department has no evidence at this time that suggests the 
existence of a largescale conspiracy among thrifts to trade bad 
loans 
in dallas former sunbelt savings association chairman edwin t 
mcbirney iii known as fast eddie pleaded innocent to bank 
fraud charges sunbelt failed in 1988 at an estimated cost to the 
government of 2 billion

national contract negotiations between the united 
auto workers and the nations big three automakers got into full 
swing as talks began today between the union and chrysler corp 
uaw president owen bieber and chrysler motors president robert 
lutz reached across a large table to shake hands and both sides 
then got down to business 
the uaw started negotiations for new threeyear labor agreements 
on wednesday with general motors corp and thursday with ford motor 
co all three current contracts expire sept 14 
at chrysler the union will be dealing with the automaker in the 
worst financial shape of the big three 
since oct 1 chrysler has been involved in a 15 billion 
costcutting program designed to boost profits but car and truck 
sales for the automaker were running 13 percent behind 1989s pace 
at midyear while fords sales were off 78 percent and gms were 
down 35 percent 
in may the automaker reported it earned 71 million in the 
first quarter of this year down 80 percent from the same time last 
year in the second quarter analysts expect chrysler to make a 
little more than half of the 341 million it earned during the 
second three months of last year 
in 1989 chrysler made 359 million far less than the 38 
billion ford made and the 42 billion gm earned chryslers 
earnings were too small to kick in profitsharing provisions for 
its hourly workers and consequently bonuses for salaried 
employees 
nonetheless the unions initial demands are expected to be the 
same at chrysler as at gm and ford enhanced job security wage 
and pension improvements and protection of healthcare benefits 
the reaction from chryslers management however is likely to 
be far different from responses at gm and ford 
chrysler vice president anthony st john who heads the 
companys negotiating team has said if current contract provisions 
simply are rolled over for another three years it would boost the 
automakers labor costs by 16 percent 
st john said chrysler cant afford that 
his statements have given rise to theories that the death of 
pattern bargaining in the auto industry may be at hand if 
tradition holds sometime around labor day the uaw will choose one 
company and focus negotiating efforts there 
after an agreement is reached that contract would be used as a 
model for talks at the other companies but st johns gloomy 
outlook for the talks may indicate the no 3 us automaker doesnt 
think it will be able to match contract provisions negotiated 
between the union and ford and gm 
there were no such dire economic predictions from gm or ford 
management after hearing uaw statements earlier this week 
as expected the union said it was outraged at gms closures of 
four assembly plants during the past three years and it criticized 
ford for its extensive use of overtime 
the companies said they were looking for more flexibility in 
work rules schedules and the way plants work forces are 
structured 
the contracts between the union and the big three cover more 
than 450000 workers and nearly as many retirees its the first 
time since 1979 that all of the contracts have expired at the same 
time

caterpillar inc reported today its earnings 
fell 67 percent in the second quarter a confirmation of the 
companys earlier projection of a sharp decline in profits 
the construction equipment manufacturer said it earned 46 
million or 46 cents per share down from 141 million or 139 
per share in the same period of 1989 
revenue for the quarter totaled 295 billion a 3 percent drop 
from the same period last year when caterpillar recorded 3 billion 
in revenue 
the company attributed the decline to an 8 percent drop in sales 
volume which was offset in part by higher prices and a 19 million 
improvement in revenue from caterpillars financial subsidiaries 
in a statement the company blamed its sagging profits on a 
lower demand for machines among many industrial nations 
on june 25 caterpillar announced that new economic policies in 
brazil were having a disastrous impact on the companys profits 
the company projected a dramatic decline in second quarter 
earnings which were less than half the 99 million earned in the 
first quarter it also revised its economic outlook for the year 
saying its profits for the entire year would be stagnant when 
compared to 1989 
sales inside the united states were 13 billion for the 
quarter a drop of 59 million from last year sales outside the 
united states were 15 billion a decline of 54 million from the 
second quarter 1989 
for the first six months of the year caterpillars profits 
stood at 145 million or 143 per share down from 282 million 
or 278 per share in the first half of 1989 
revenue for the first half totaled 58 billion up from 572 
billion a year earlier

an explosion in a restroom caused extensive damage 
at the stock exchange today 40 minutes after a telephone warning 
of an irish republican army bomb police said no injuries were 
reported 
city of london police said the building in the heart of londons 
financial district was evacuated before the blast at 849 am 
the explosion tore a hole about 20 feet high and seven feet wide 
in the modern concrete building about 10 feet above ground level 
facing old broad street glass and hunks of concrete littered the 
street 
hugh moore commander of city of london police said warnings 
were telephoned to his department the exchange and to the reuters 
news agency george churchillcoleman commander of scotland yards 
antiterrorist unit said there were eight warning calls in all 
the bomb which contained 5 to 10 pounds of high explosives was 
in a mens restroom near the visitors gallery said 
churchillcoleman asked whether the ira was responsible he told 
reporters thats a reasonable assumption 
churchillcoleman said the visitors gallery had not open at the 
time of the explosion he said it was not known when the device was 
planted 
people would have been killed if they had been in the building 
at the time moore said 
a uniformed guard normally searches bags and parcels carried by 
visitors before they enter the gallery which accommodates up to 
100 people 
the national westminster bank near the exchange was cordoned 
off and searched following another bomb warning police said the 
royal bank of scotland building across from the exchange was also 
evacuated 
press association britains domestic news agency reported that 
one caller who telephoned a warning said this is the ira the 
bomb is due to go off in half an hour at the stock exchange 
the caller then gave a code word recognized by police and said 
clear the building the news agency reported 
the ira is fighting to end british rule of northern ireland 
i am horrified that any group would take the risk of so many 
peoples lives in a public building said andrew hugh smith 
chairman of the stock exchange the timing of the bomb and the 
warning they all could have gone very wrong 
the exchanges computerized stock trading system was not 
interrupted but options trading was suspended smith said options 
trading would resume monday he said about 600 people normally work 
on the options floor 
share prices rose marginally following the explosion 
sharon reilly who was among those evacuated from the exchange 
said there wasnt panic people were in high spirits curious 
they just thought it was a fire 
police initially reported that the explosion started a fire 
inside the structure but a spokesman for the london fire brigade 
said we believe there is no fire situation in the building 
joe phillips a 21yearold options trader said a recorded 
warning was broadcast inside the exchange normally they say this 
was a test but a proper voice came on the tannoy address system 
saying this is not a test get out of the building he said 
there had been 30 to 40 people on the trading floor standing 
around reading the financial times looking at their screens and 
waiting for trading to start phillips said 
a large proportion of the stock exchanges staff of almost 2600 
work in the building there has been no stock trading there since 
the exchange was computerized in 1986 but options are traded in 
the building 
on june 25 an ira bomb injured more than 20 people two of them 
seriously at the carlton club a gathering place for the ruling 
conservative party

supporters of government management of grain 
supplies fought off an effort in the senate today to change the 
1990 farm bill so farmers can plant more acres 
the senate voted 5037 against a proposal by sen rudy 
boschwitz rminn to amend the acreagereduction program in the 
bill 
boschwitz said the program would hurt us ability to compete on 
the world grain market by requiring farmers to idle some of the 
most fertile land in the country 
we have forgone production and in the process given the 
markets to the europeans said boschwitz 
but supporters of the bills provision said it was needed to 
keep prices for grain stable by controlling the size of surpluses 
stability is the object of the farm bill said sen robert 
kerrey dneb 
the boschwitz amendment was the second major attack on the 
senate agriculture committees bill to set farm policy for the next 
five years 
the first came thursday when sen harry reid dnev tried 
unsuccessfully to eliminate subsidies to farmers with gross sales 
over 500000 a year 
the american taxpayer shells out 12 billion each year to 
millionaires who own farms reid said why are we concerned 
about protecting these farmer fat cats 
he said his amendment would affect only onehalf of 1 percent of 
the farmers in the country 
but the idea was opposed by senate agriculture committee members 
who said it would inevitably hurt family farms 
sen david boren dokla said farmers who gross 500000 dont 
necessarily net any more than a factory worker once expenses are 
paid 
sen richard lugar of indiana the ranking republican on the 
committee added it is not hard to see how farmers could 
subdivide their businesses to evade this amendment if they were so 
inclined 
he said the amendments requirement that farmers submit their 
tax returns to county agents as proof of gross earnings would be an 
invasion of privacy 
it would also lead to an auditing problem that is very 
substantial if what was once a farm of 500000 now becomes 10 
farms of 50000 and 10 returns where various relatives are 
involved lugar said 
the amendment was defeated 6630 
the senate did however reduce the overall cost of the bill to 
bring it into line with tight budget demands 
an amendment offered by agriculture committee chairman patrick 
leahy dvt and passed on voice vote reduced proposed commodity 
supports in the senate bill to a fiveyear cost of 54 billion 
thats 8 million below the amount approved for agriculture in the 
senate budget resolution last month 
its unlikely however that the cut will satisfy the bush 
administration which has threatened a veto unless substantial 
multiyear savings are made 
the administration doesnt want congress to finish its bill 
until negotiations with white house over the budget are complete 
agriculture and defense are two key areas expected to be cut 
significantly 
the administration expects the budget summit to achieve 
substantial multiyear savings said a statement from the office 
of management and budget it would be a mistake for congress to 
complete action on a bill that gives producers the wrong impression 
by sending them inaccurate signals about likely program 
parameters 
leahy said he couldnt predict what would be included in a 
summit agreement 
but this much is certain he said the senator from 
indiana lugar and i are committed to making necessary budget 
savings 
among major provisions the bill would 
freeze current target prices and loan rates 
create mandatory marketing loans on wheat and feed grains 
moderately increase planting flexibility 
establish a new program for oilseed production 
improve the quality of grain 
ban the export of pesticides that are outlawed for use in the 
united states 
give better protection to fragile wetlands 
give farmers incentives to prevent contamination of groundwater 
encourage reduced use of pesticides 
establish a labeling system for organically grown products 
change the foreign food aid program to make giveaways to needy 
countries easier 
revise forestry laws

mca inc reported its 
secondquarter earnings rose 7 percent and that it had agreed to 
buy a minority stake in harvey comics creator of casper the 
friendly ghost richie rich and baby huey 
the entertainment conglomerate earned 448 million up from 
419 million during the same period in 1989 
pershare earnings fell from 58 cents to 54 cents because of 
mcas purchase of geffen records in april mca bought the company 
by issuing david geffen 1 million shares of preferred stock 
convertible to 10 million shares of common stock that diluted the 
earning power of shares issued earlier 
mcas revenue reached record levels jumping 15 percent from 
828 million to 950 million heavy contributors were theatrical 
film revenue which rose from 93 million to 143 million due to 
the successful back to the future iii and bird on a wire 
and music entertainment up from 197 million to 250 million 
mca includes domestic home video fees in the latter category 
revenue from mcas universal studios tour in universal city fell 
from 382 million to 359 million last year when the popular 
earthquake attraction opened 
notably absent were results from a 630 million studio theme 
park that mca opened six weeks ago in orlando fla some 
attractions including the king kong and earthquake rides have 
been knocked out by software problems 
mca said it did not report results because the park was not 
fully operational 
its rival walt disney co has run a separate studio theme park 
not far away for a little over a year and mcas attraction had 
been seen as possibly taking away visitors there but disney said 
tuesday that attendance at its park was up 20 percent in may and 
june compared with the year before 
for the first six months of the year mcas net income rose 10 
percent to 764 million or 96 cents per share from 693 
million or 95 cents per share 
revenue rose 22 percent to 186 billion from 153 billion 
mcas agreement in principle to buy an interest in harvey comics 
entertainment is a clear if minor example of how crucial wellknown 
characters are to entertainment giants like mca or disney 
characters such as casper richie rich and baby huey can be 
exploited around the world in movies tv home video theme parks 
and books separately or in combination with characters to which 
mca already owns rights said thomas p pollock the chairman of 
mcas motion picture group 
in a telephone interview pollock said mca was impressed with 
jeffrey a montgomery who was just 25 when he raised money to buy 
the dormant familyowned harvey last year 
pollock said mca was supplying funds marketing and distribution 
and some manufacturing as part of the deal exact terms werent 
announced but montgomery reportedly paid 6 million for harvey 
last summer 
were helping them to help themselves pollock said were 
a minority partner in the deal making an equity investment he 
owns the characters and hes running it

financier alan bond has been making 
money on borrowed money since completing his first land deal in 
1960 at age 22 it appears the bill finally has come due 
thirty years after he took out a loan on five acres of land at 
perth in the first step toward building a multinational empire the 
businessman and yachtsman has offered to quit as chairman of his 
flagship bond corp holdings ltd to appease the companys anxious 
creditors who are owed 6 billion 
the agreement under which bond will step down and relinquish 
control of his vast empire was reached thursday although final 
details must still be worked out the deal could clear the way for 
refinancing arrangements that could ultimately save many of bonds 
businesses 
it has been a long fall for bond known for brash and flamboyant 
dealings in business and elsewhere he financed the australian 
sailing teams stunning triumph over the united states in the 1983 
americas cup race 
only three years ago he bought vincent van goghs irises 
from sothebys for what was a thenrecord 539 million a sale 
that the auction house helped him finance in march he sold the 
painting for an undisclosed amount amid reports he had taken a loss 
bond has never been lacking in confidence after emigrating from 
britain with his father to perth in western australia state he 
quit school at age 14 and took a job with a signpainting company 
convincing the owner to take him on even though he did poorly on a 
spelling test 
when things didnt work out he and his father started a 
competitor nusigns that provided the cash for some of his later 
deals 
according to the biography released this week by journalist paul 
barry the rise and fall of alan bond the financier developed 
a strategy of keeping creditors at bay while buying and selling 
land in rapidly developing perth 
he reportedly was close to bankruptcy in 1962 after stringing 
along nusigns creditors too long but managed to work out an 
arrangement at the last minute the next day he made a large 
purchase at a land auction 
barry wrote that with rising land prices bond often would agree 
to buy a plot promising a small deposit then have it immediately 
revalued at a higher price so he could borrow more money than had 
to be paid to the vendor 
with a flair for picking the best development sites and 
promoting them well he had been successful enough to make his 
first 1 million by 1969 at age 29 
he took advantage of eager bankers peddling expensive credit 
particularly after australias financial deregulation in 1983 and 
a stock market full of hungry investors 
at its peak bond corp holdings included interests in brewing 
media natural resources and property he rode out the 1987 stock 
market crash on the cashgenerating strength of his beer businesses 
that actually may have led to his downfall however as bond 
corp holdings picked up steam and eventually ran up debts now 
estimated at about 6 billion 
rising interest rates and bad business decisions alienated 
bonds bankers and creditors put his australian brewing interests 
into receivership and has forced him to sell assets ranging from a 
hong kong office development to a coal mine 
there is speculation that the final straw for bond may have come 
when he tangled with londonbased financier rw tiny rowland 
he bought 204 percent of rowlands lonrho plc in 1988 in a move 
that appeared to presage a takeover attempt 
he was forced to sell a year later telling australian 
television that he underestimated the venom on tiny rowland 
who waged a campaign focusing on bonds debt 
rowland is quoted in barrys book as saying he decided to 
destroy bond after the australian tried to take his yachts parking 
place on the french riviera

chrysler corp proposed a 
multiemployer healthcare system friday as it joined the rest of 
the big three automakers in contract negotiations with the united 
auto workers union 
but the proposal drew a cool reception from general motors 
corp which opened negotiations with the uaw on wednesday and 
ford motor co which began contract talks thursday the uaw 
offered no reaction friday 
chrysler vice president anthony st john said at a news 
conference following a ceremonial handshake to open talks that he 
proposes forming a trust to administer healthcare programs for 
employees of several companies including auto suppliers 
negotiators from each of the big three say containing 
healthcare costs is a high priority in the current round of talks 
in 1989 gm said it spent about 3 billion in health care costs 
ford spent about 813 million and chrysler paid 684 million 
st john said under a multiemployer program the size of the 
group covered by the plan could be huge keeping costs down he 
said participating companies could also avoid anticipated higher 
costs in 1993 when new financial accounting standards board 
regulations may take effect 
the new regulations would require companies to set aside money 
for anticipated health costs chrysler figures that would be about 
7 per hour per employee or just under 200 million a year 
chrysler says it currently pays for heath care and pension costs 
on a payasyougo basis 
chrysler in the worst financial shape of the big three is 
expected to report by the end of the month that its secondquarter 
earnings were about half of the 341 million it made during the 
period last year 
wall street analysts have speculated that chrysler will lose 
money in the third quarter because its two minivan plants will be 
shut down for a month each to retool for 1991 models the minivan 
is chryslers most profitable vehicle 
chrysler has acknowledged it expects a substantial 
thirdquarter loss 
gm ford and union negotiators so far have declined to talk 
about proposals which may have been advanced in the earliest stages 
of the talks uaw contracts with each of the big three expire sept 
14 
in addition to the healthcare proposal st john said he 
proposed an employee ownership plan which he declined to detail 
and something he called gain sharing which would reward workers on 
a plantbyplant basis based on the financial performance of that 
factory 
in a separate news conference uaw president owen bieber said 
the union issued the same broad proposals friday as it had at gm 
and ford the two days before those involved the need for more job 
security wage and pension improvements and more time off 
if negotiations proceed as they have in the past the uaw will 
bargain with all three companies until sometime around labor day 
and then select a strike target talks at the other two companies 
would be suspended 
a contract reached at the target then would be taken to the 
other two companies in what is called pattern bargaining 
there has been speculation chrysler may break the pattern 
because of its financial problems st john has said simply rolling 
over the current contract would add 16 percent to the companys 
labor costs 
bieber said friday the union had no intention of giving up its 
pattern bargaining strategy 
abandoning the pattern concept will not solve problems he 
said it will create even more chrysler would gain nothing but 
lose a great deal of morale

g heileman brewing co australian 
entrepreneur alan bonds bestknown us business has serious 
financial problems that a reorganization of its parent wont help 
analysts say 
bond agreed to resign as chairman of his bond corp holdings 
ltd to appease creditors under an agreement announced thursday 
the resignation was part of a plan for refinancing arrangements 
company director peter lucas said in disclosing the pact after a 
bondholders meeting in london 
heileman officials said bonds financial problems do not affect 
heileman directly because the brewer has its own loan arrangements 
currently being renegotiated with creditors 
bond corp holdings australian brewery assets will be sold for 
about 14 billion to bell resources an independently managed 
affiliate of bond corp holdings heileman would not be included in 
the sale lucas said 
bell resources has felt that the maximum capacity in the 
brewing industry that it could undertake ought to be restricted to 
the australian assets at this time he said it heileman is 
going to remain with bond corporation 
new leadership at bond holdings wont help heileman with its own 
debt problems said george thompson an analyst with 
prudentialbache 
theres nothing i can think of that is going to solve the 
problem at g heileman thompson said no matter who it was 
theyre confronted with an extraordinarily difficult task and a 
change of management is not going to make a difference 
the la crosse wisbased company has been strapped by debt 
created when bond bought the company in 1987 for 13 billion 
analysts have said he paid too much for the brewer and cannot 
service the 850 million debt with heileman earnings 
the brewer has closed or sold several of its breweries over the 
past few months to pay its bills 
heileman which produces old style lone star rainier henry 
weinhard colt 45 and special export light is the no 5 us 
brewer the company also produces kingsbury a nonalcoholic brew 
and la croix sparkling water the no 2 domestic bottled water 
robert s weinberg a st louis marketing consultant said 
bonds resignation and his companys restructuring may have an 
indirect impact on heileman 
if it has any impact the bond companys reorganization would 
spur a reorganization of heilemans assets he said

john obrien who resigned suddenly as 
head of the grumman corp is under investigation by a federal 
grand jury for possibly accepting loans from a grumman defense 
subcontractor a source said friday 
a grand jury at us district court in uniondale has been 
hearing testimony for about a year the source told the associated 
press the case stems from a broader investigation by the us 
justice department into wrongdoing in defense contracting 
records seized at the offices of the late james kane a grumman 
defense subcontractor indicated that obrien and family members 
accepted more than 450000 in loans and loan guarantees from kane 
the source said 
it would be a violation of federal antikickback laws for a 
defense contractor to accept loans from a subcontractor 
the source who is close to the investigation and spoke on 
condition of anonymity called obrien a subject rather than a 
target of the grand jury investigation and said no indictment 
was imminent 
being a subject doesnt mean that he wont ultimately be 
charged the source said but right now the net is very broad 
newsday which reported the nature of the investigation friday 
noted that obrien denied wrongdoing in may when the newspaper 
asked him whether he or people closely associated with him had 
taken loans from kane 
because this is a pending investigation it is not prudent for 
me to discuss the facts he said then however i want to 
assure you that i have every reason to believe that when all the 
facts are known it will be clear that there has been no wrongdoing 
on my part 
obrien could not be located friday to comment grumman 
spokesman robert harwood said he did not know where obrien was a 
call to the offices of brendan sullivan reported to be obriens 
lawyer was not returned 
harwood said he could neither confirm nor deny the existence of 
an investigation he declined to comment on the reasons for 
obriens departure from the aerospace giant beyond the company 
statement 
kane who died of cancer in february was thought to be a 
central figure in a scheme to bribe pentagon officials for defense 
contracts kane and obrien were friends and kane founded and 
operated the long island aerospace political action committee a 
lobby group for grumman 
obrien grummans chairman and chief executive officer for the 
past two years was under pressure to quit from the grumman board 
the source said that pressure increased as the investigation 
intensified in the last few months 
they felt if charges were eventually brought against obrien 
it would do more damage to the company to have him in place than 
out the source said 
newsday quoted a former grumman board member orville l 
freeman as saying that he was told the board wanted obrien out 
obrien 60 cited personal reasons in resigning thursday at 
the boards regular meeting he was replaced immediately by renso 
caporali 57 a grumman vice chairman 
the source said the grand jury has subpoenaed many records 
from grumman over the last few months obrien has not been called 
to testify before the panel 
generally the activity has been increasing the source said 
mary jo white spokeswoman for andrew maloney the us attorney 
for the eastern district of new york declined to comment

kirk kerkorian pocketed 180 million 
in deposit money friday as part of his deal to sell mgmua 
communications co to italian financier giancarlo parretti 
kerkorian a beverly hills billionaire who became rich buying 
and selling planes and casinos received 4 per share for his 
mgmua stock as did other mgmua shareholders 
he owns about 35 million of mgmuas 51 million shares of common 
stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock he established a 
foundation last year to which he gave another 5 million shares of 
the common 
parrettis pathe communications corp has agreed to buy mgmua 
for 2150 per share or 13 billion 
he had been making nonrefundable down payments since march for 
a total of 253 million that money was sent to shareholders and 
holders of options to buy shares friday with the lions share to 
kerkorian the remaining 1750 per share is due in october 
the moneys good and were in the process of making the 
distribution said scott tagliarino mgmuas spokesman 
mgmuas common stock was unchanged friday at 1825 per share 
on the new york stock exchange 
mgmua has been on the auction block for two years australias 
qintex group bid 15 billion for it last year 100 million more 
than media magnate rupert murdochs news corp but qintex missed a 
50 million down payment and the deal fell apart 
parretti desperately needs financing help for his purchase time 
warner inc agreed april 9 to lend him 650 million in return for a 
lien on the valuable united artists library and extensive movie 
distribution rights 
but that agreement also collapsed and time warner and pathe 
have filed countersuits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars 
each for alleged breach of contract 
despite his 253 million in down payments there is considerable 
skepticism that parretti can come up with the rest of the money 
hes waited four months and now were into the fifth month and 
were not any closer to the conclusion of the transaction than we 
were at the start said jeffrey logsdon an analyst with siedler 
amdec securities inc in los angeles 
pathe had offered 20 per share about 12 billion for mgmua 
but was unable to raise the money in time for the closing date a 
month ago in return for a fourmonth extension on the deal 
parretti raised his offer to 2150 per share and to the 
4pershare distribution 
under the latest agreement parretti must make another 50 
million deposit on aug 21 50 million on sept 20 and come up 
with the balance by oct 23 
the 100 million in additional down payments is to be put into 
escrow along with it goes 119 million new unregistered shares of 
mgmua common stock in pathes name 23 million after the august 
payment is made another 96 million after the september payment 
that money and stock would be the subject of litigation if the 
latest deal between parretti and kerkorian falls apart

caterpillar inc on friday reported a 67 
percent drop in secondquarter earnings but said no layoffs or pay 
cuts are planned to offset the companys plunging profits 
caterpillar the worlds largest manufacturer of construction 
equipment reported earnings of 46 million or 46 cents per share 
down from 141 million or 139 per share in the same period of 
1989 
profits slumped despite revenue levels that are the second 
highest for any quarter in the companys 75year history 
revenue for the quarter totaled 295 billion a 3 percent drop 
from the same period last year when caterpillar had a record 304 
billion in revenue 
the company had projected plunging profits in june but that 
made the results no easier to stomach 
the quarter turned out about exactly the way we had said it 
would in the revised outlook said caterpillar spokesman gil 
nolde 
results are not satisfactory no question about that 
fortysix million dollars profit on sales of 295 billion is not 
good 
it was the fifth consecutive quarter in which caterpillar 
profits have fallen below performance in the same period of the 
previous year 
nolde disputed rumors circulating the company about possible pay 
cuts or layoffs as costsaving measures labeling the employees 
concerns absolutely unfounded 
there are no such plans i can say that categorically nolde 
said 
on june 25 caterpillar announced that new economic policies in 
brazil where caterpillar employs 5100 workers at two plants were 
having a disastrous impact on company finances 
the brazil operations provided a reported 20 percent of 
caterpillars 1989 profits 
because of the brazilian governments efforts to slow inflation 
and increase competition caterpillar said its secondquarter 
earnings would be less than half the 99 million earned in the 
first quarter 
nolde said friday the brazil turmoil accounted for about 25 
percent of the companys reduced profits 
the company said about half of its decline in profit was caused 
by an 8 percent drop in sales volume which nolde attributed to 
reduced demand for construction equipment in industrialized nations 
caterpillars remaining troubles have resulted from a weaker 
japanese yen and higher operating costs 
one bright spot was a 19 million improvement in revenue from 
caterpillars financial subsidiaries 
for the first six months of the year caterpillars profits 
stood at 145 million a decline of 137 million from last year 
profit per share was 143 compared to 278 for the first six 
months of 1989 
revenue for the first half totaled 58 billion an improvement 
of 163 million or 3 percent from last year 
caterpillar also disclosed that a classaction lawsuit was filed 
in federal court on wednesday by new york stockholder dorothy kas 
the lawsuit accused the company of misleading investors by 
withholding pertinent information and lying about its financial 
condition in the first two quarters of this year to attract 
investors 
our lawyers have advised that we not discuss secondquarter 
results other than whats in the news release nolde said we 
believe the suit is without merit but we cant discuss it further 
at this time

people in the heart of the cornbelt believe 
farmers produce healthy food but dont think the farmers do a good 
job helping protect the environment according to a survey released 
friday 
the survey found that 65 percent of the people surveyed think 
the dangers of pesticides outweigh their benefits and that 15 
percent want all farm chemicals banned 
the illinois farm bureau commissioned the april telephone survey 
of 400 champaign county residents 
farmers are interested in peoples attitudes on using the 
technology thats been put into their hands said dennis vercler 
spokesman for the farm bureau 
vercler said farmers are concerned about food safety and the 
environment and many have changed their farming practices to 
reflect that attitude yet many people are unaware of such changes 
because farmers have not told them he said 
they should acknowledge that peoples concerns are real even 
if they dont feel they are justified by the actual risks 
involved said vercler farmers need to communicate better with 
consumers and deal with their perceptions 
vercler was joined at a news conference at the edge of a corn 
field by champaign county farmers who are working to protect the 
environment a display board showed photographs of their new 
practices 
the farm bureau survey found that 51 percent of the people 
surveyed strongly agree that farmers produce healthy food but that 
just 16 percent strongly think farmers are protecting the 
environment 
farmers though have the most to lose if they are careless with 
pesticides or allow chemicals to pollute water and contaminate 
food said tom wolf who raises grain 
i live here with my family and im concerned about our 
safety said wolf and i dont want the next generation to have 
any problems farming the land 
the champaign county survey was similar to a national poll 
conducted by the american farm bureau federation and released 
earlier this week 
other findings in the champaign county survey 
sixty percent of the people said they were very concerned about 
pesticides in drinking water 
fortynine percent of the respondents said farmers use too 
large a volume of chemicals and 14 percent said they use far too 
much 
twentynine percent said farmers are too easily persuaded by 
chemical companies to use more pesticides and 26 percent said 
farmers favor economics over safety 
thirtyseven percent said they think the trend among farmers is 
to use more chemicals 
actually from 1978 to 1988 farmers cut their use of herbicides 
by 21 percent and insecticides by 60 percent in response to both 
environmental and economic concerns the farm bureau said

masayuki takaura senior foreign exchange manager at sanwa bank 
ltd in london said the yen was due for a modest correction after 
recent gains however he said the dollars move through 14850 yen

dollar buying 
dean witters gibbs said she feels the path of least 
resistance is still down for the dollar 
she said that the federal reserves relaxation of credit 
conditions a week ago made us interest rates unattractive 
globally and that fed chairman alan greenspans expressed 
willingness to lower rates further if a budget compromise is 
reached and the economy remains weak keeps downward pressure on the 
dollar 
she said greenspans remarks showed they are not going to 
tighten and that would be the only thing making the dollar more 
attractive

crude oil futures prices were mostly higher 
friday due largely to technical factors 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude rose 62 cents to 1961 a 42gallon barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange after rising 44 cents a barrel 
thursday 
but contract prices for later months were up by far less or down 
slightly frank p knuettel an energy analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc said this shows the trading was dominated by 
technical factors involving the august contract 
traders said rumors circulated that the 13member organization 
of petroleum exporting countries had agreed to limit production 
until crude prices reach 20 a barrel the rumors may have helped 
boost prices 
the opec ministers are to meet next thursday to discuss 
production cuts 
also friday the united arab emirates rejected accusations by 
iraq that it was exceeding its opec quotas the two opec members 
have been involved in a dispute over iraqi claims that the uae is 
pumping oil from iraqi territory 
news that the flow of crude through the alaska pipeline resumed 
at normal levels had a moderating influence on prices but it soon 
was surpassed by concern about opec reaching an agreement on 
output traders said 
on thursday operators of the pipeline took steps to shut it 
down over an air quality dispute but operations were restored to 
normal thursday night after the operators and state regulators 
agreed to negotiate and after a federal judge temporarily blocked 
enforcement of a pollutionrelated ban on operating the pipeline 
prices for refined products traded on the mercantile exchange 
ended the day lower 
unleaded regular gasoline for august delivery fell 011 cent to 
6296 cents a gallon while later contract months were even lower

state regulators on friday approved a 23 
billion takeover plan and a new rate structure for public service 
company of new hampshire paving the way for the utility to emerge 
from bankruptcy 
the public utilities commissions 200page report following 21 
days of hearings ended in late may found connecticutbased 
northeast utilities acquisition consistent with the public 
good 
the reorganization plans rate agreement projects seven annual 
rate increases of 55 percent beginning in 1990 testimony during 
commission hearings that rates actually could go as high as 85 
percent prompted a public criticism of the deal which was approved 
by the state legislature 
special commissioner john nassikas appointed to oversee the 
hearings said the commission was confident assumptions behind the 
55 percent figures are realistic 
i would hasten to add that theres no guarantee that this 
would be a 55 percent increase over the sevenyear life 
nassikas said it would be irrational to say that their 
projections are invulnerable and that youre not going to have an 
increase over 55 percent 
leading democrats and the campaign for ratepayers rights said 
thats just what they were worried about 
i think we will clearly see in the future rate hikes far in 
excess of the 55 percent said state house minority leader mary 
chambers detna 
she said commissioners clearly were going to rubberstamp what 
has already been agreed to by the governor northeast and the 
republican leadership in the legislature 
the campaign for ratepayers rights is considering appealing the 
decision to the state supreme court said interim director robert 
cushing 
gov judd gregg in a statement called the rate agreement a 
major victory for new hampshire ratepayers that will save hundreds 
of millions of dollars he said with the seabrook nuclear power 
plant now running rates would have been significantly higher if 
there were no rate agreement 
commission approval was needed to allow public service to emerge 
from bankruptcy and pay back its creditors shortly after 
northeasts plan was approved in us bankruptcy court in april 
the management of public service was taken over by a 
northeastappointed board 
clearly were going to spend a lot of hours combing the 
report but our first indication is that its a very positive 
development for ending this 2 year bankruptcy said northeast 
spokesman jeffrey kotkin its a long involved decision which 
is right because it was a long involved and at times torturous 
process 
the bankruptcy court approval is under appeal and the commission 
allows 20 days for appeals to be filed on its decision once both 
decisions are final public service officially will be out of 
bankruptcy 
the actual merger of northeast with public service wont be 
complete until it gains necessary federal approvals including that 
of the federal energy regulatory commission expected by next spring

a federal judge highly critical of the manville 
trust fund was granted broad powers friday that could ensure his 
ability to overhaul the system for paying asbestos victims 
in an order by the chief judge of federal courts in southern new 
york us district judge jack b weinstein received the power to 
rule on any bankruptcy court appeal involving manville corps 1988 
reorganization or the trust 
the future of the 3 billion trust created as part of 
manvilles court reorganization has been up in the air since it 
disclosed it had run out of money to pay 130000 pending and any 
new claims asbestos lawsuits represent the largest product 
liability litigation in us history 
its essential to get some case management going in these 
problems chief judge charles l brieant said in a telephone 
interview from his office in suburban white plains these cases 
have been pending a long time 
brieant said the bankruptcy case remained before us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland but that weinstein now was supervising with 
power to transfer any appeal to his own courtroom 
weinstein last week ordered a plan to be drawn up by aug 6 to 
refinance and restructure the trust he also froze all payments by 
the trust until the plan was ready 
separately thomas d lambros chief judge for us district 
court in cleveland this week consolidated more than 100000 
pending lawsuits nationwide against the manville trust and about 40 
companies that made and distributed asbestos 
lambros on friday clarified his interim order saying it 
preserved current court jurisdictions pending discussions on the 
possibility of achieving a universal resolution through a national 
class action 
lambros scheduled a nov 1 hearing he said judges plaintiffs 
and defense lawyers and claimants would meet before then to try 
and reach a solution 
the order giving weinstein expanded power over the manville 
bankruptcy case and the reorganization of the trust rebuffs 
plaintiffs lawyers who dont want the trusts payment mechanism 
altered weinstein and lambros both have criticized the amount of 
trust money that has gone to lawyers 
one attorney eugene locks of philadelphia filed a motion 
challenging weinsteins authority friday with the 2nd circuit court 
of appeals in manhattan 
another challenge was filed earlier this week in district court 
on behalf of 1100 virginia shipyard workers who already have 
settled with the trust and dont want 60 million in payments 
delayed that motion also seeks to bar restructuring of the trust 
hasnt this manville bankruptcy been consummated if so even 
the bankruptcy judge has no authority to restructure or refinance 
the trust said richard glasser a norfolk va attorney 
representing the workers 
weinstein has called for replacing the trusts current scheme 
processing claims on a firstcome firstserved basis with one that 
takes into account the severity of disease and the financial need 
of victims 
asbestos was widely used for decades in shipbuilding 
construction and other industries for its natural insulation and 
heatresistant properties workers who breathed asbestos fibers 
have contracted lung cancer and other severe and oftenfatal 
diseases 
manville once the nations largest asbestos maker sought 
bankruptcy court protection in 1982 because of thousands of 
lawsuits seeking compensation under its reorganization manville 
is separate from the trust but must contribute regular payments 
starting in 1991 
the trust has paid 974 million to settle more than 22300 cases 
so far at an average of 43000 per claim but is out of cash to pay 
new claims 
manville spokesman don ferguson said the company would cooperate 
with the courts on all issues

the boeing co which has never been content with 
its de havilland commuter aircraft division said friday it is 
discussing selling the canadian operation to aeritalia of italy and 
aerospatiale of france 
boeing canadas de havilland division based in downsview 
ontario builds the dash 8series turboprop commuter plane boeing 
bought de havilland from the canadian government in 1986 and 
company executives have since made no secret of their 
disappointment in the subsidiarys performance 
boeing corporate spokesman paul binder declined to give revenue 
or earnings figures for de havilland which employs 5400 but 
industry analysts say it has been a moneyloser 
in a news release boeing said any sale would involve an orderly 
transfer of responsibility to the buyers with continuing boeing 
support a sale would be subject to approval of the canadian 
government it said 
binder declined to elaborate beyond the companys twoparagraph 
news release 
at any time we get anything more firm we will make an 
announcement he said 
representatives of aerospatiale and aeritalia both 
governmentowned could not be reached for comment 
aeritalia has long worked with boeing to produce parts for 
boeings 767 jetliners aerospatiale is one of the companies in the 
european consortium airbus industrie one of boeings prime 
competitors for commercial jets 
aeritalia and aerospatiale are partners in avions de transport 
regional a company that produces the atr 42 and atr 72 turboprop 
commuter planes 
boeing bought de havilland for 90 million canadian dollars a 
price critics said was too cheap 
but boeing has since invested more than 400 million canadian 
dollars in new plant facilities equipment and research and 
development said de havilland president ron woodward boeing also 
brought millions of dollars of new business to de havilland and 
other canadian divisions meeting a provision of the purchase 
agreement 
boeing officials believed de havilland would be a good match 
despite the canadian companys longstanding economic and labor 
troubles boeing executives said de havillands commuter planes 
would complement the seattle plane builders broad line of jet 
aircraft 
boeing was able to boost de havillands production but poor 
profitability continuing labor problems including an 11week 
strike in 1987 and needed improvements to the plant near toronto 
soured some company executives on the acquisition dean thornton 
president of boeing commercial airplane group has said he 
personally regretted the purchase 
wolfgang demisch an aerospace analyst at union bank of 
switzerland in new york estimated de havillands 1989 revenues at 
750 million while bill whitlow of dain bosworth in seattle pegged 
it at 700 million both said boeing has been losing money on the 
division 
i would guess that boeing has come to the conclusion theyre 
not going to be able to turn it around as theyd like to whitlow 
said 
the commuter aircraft market has been ruthlessly 
competitive demisch said and boeing hasnt been able to get the 
prices it would like 
unlike large commercial jets where only boeing airbus and 
mcdonnell douglas dominate the market has 16 or more players 
demisch and whitlow said many of those companies are owned or 
heavily subsidized by their governments making it difficult for 
private companies to compete 
de havilland builds the 3640 passenger dash 8100 and the 5056 
passenger dash 8300 it plans to launch the 70seat dash 8400 
this december 
it had a backlog of 125 aircraft as of june 30 and planned to 
deliver 73 planes this year 
its planes compete directly with atrs aircraft demisch said 
but he said aeritalia and aerospatiale may be seeking to broaden 
their product mix in addition to absorbing a competitor 
in february boeing settled a lawsuit against the canadian 
government over the de havilland acquisition the agreement 
canadian industry minister harvie andre said called for boeing to 
receive up to 161 million canadian dollars in cash and incentives 
it also settled boeings claim that it had to spend more than 110 
million canadian dollars to improve health and safety at the 
downsview plant 
boeing had 1989 profits of 973 million on sales of 203 
billion in 1989

bond prices rose slightly friday in light 
trading as traders held ground because of uncertainty over the 
federal budget 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 316 point or 188 
per 1000 face amount its yield which falls when prices rise 
slipped to 853 percent from 855 percent late thursday 
the modest rally follows three consecutive declines in longterm 
bond prices that lifted 30year bond yields from 845 percent 
earlier this week 
elizabeth capo a futures analyst with stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc in princeton nj said prices moved up on 
speculation that chances may be improving for a compromise on 
reducing the federal budget deficit 
but she also said traders were reluctant to stake out new 
positions because of uncertainty on whether a compromise could be 
reached before congress recesses next month 
kathleen camilli chief economist for ramirez capital 
consultants inc said a report by the federal reserve bank in 
philadelphia indicated regional economic conditions had softened 
considerably 
that led to speculation that the purchasing managers survey due 
for release on aug 1 would point to economic deterioration 
a declining economy makes it more likely that the federal 
reserve will push interest rates lower a development that would 
boost bond prices 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 132 point to point intermediate maturities 
rose 516 point and longterm issues added as much as 316 point 
according to telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer gained 143 to 116061 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 777 percent as the 
discount dropped 1 basis point to 753 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 784 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point to 
745 percent yields on oneyear bills were unchanged at 784 
percent as the discount held at 733 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent unchanged from 
late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds up 332 point the average yield to maturity 
fell to 741 percent from 742 percent late thursday

texas instruments inc the second largest us 
semiconductor manufacturer friday reported sharply lower 
secondquarter earnings and raised the possibility of a loss in the 
third quarter 
the dallasbased company said net income in the period ended 
june 30 fell from 106 million last year to 11 million this year 
provisions for preferred stockholders further sliced income to 1 
million or 2 cents per common share from 96 million or 114 
revenues dropped from 163 billion to 159 billion 
the company blamed the results on sharply lower prices for 
semiconductor memories and substantially higher startup costs for 
new products and capacity 
the news sent tis stock tumbling on the new york stock 
exchange where shares closed at 3312 down 575 
the secondquarter decline follows an 847 percent drop in 
firstquarter earnings when profit plummeted from 85 million to 
13 million as revenue went from 16 billion to 154 billion ti 
said it avoided a loss then only because of the sale of its 
interest in another company 
chairman jerry r junkins had warned stockholders in april 
results would be unlikely to improve in the second quarter and in 
a letter friday he said the problems will continue 
for ti thirdquarter results will be affected by continuing 
research and development and startup costs for new products with 
minimal revenue and costs related to our baguio plant he 
said the semiconductor plant in the philippines suffered minor 
damage in this weeks earthquake but production was disrupted 
junkins said 
these factors will create additional pressure on tis 
financial performance in the near term and could cause a loss for 
ti in the third quarter he said 
junkins said the company is deferring some expenses to lessen 
the impact and will spend only 950 million in capital 
expenditures this year instead of the projected 1 billion 
the company also has been hit by decreases in defense spending 
and last month announced it would lay off 1000 workers at its 
defense systems amp electronics group which employs about 22000 
people primarily in the united states 
junkins told stockholders friday the defense market will 
continue to drop in the first half of the 1990s but the layoffs 
should lessen the impact on company profits 
for the first six months ti reported earnings of 24 million 
compared to 191 million last year after preferred stock 
dividends income was 6 million or 7 cents per share down from 
171 million or 204 last year 
revenue in the first six months dropped from 323 billion to 
313 billion

a savings and loan executive convicted 
of looting a failed thrift of more than 15 million and using the 
money to support a rollsroyce lifestyle was sentenced friday to 20 
years in prison 
janet faye mckinzie 41 of newport beach also was ordered by 
us district court judge alicemarie stotler to make restitution of 
nearly 14 million taken from north america savings amp loan of santa 
ana 
it was a very very appropriate sentence said us attorney 
paul seave fair in a sense that it works as a deterrent in other 
sampl crimes and whitecollar crime in general 
richard racehorse haynes mckinzies attorney pleaded for 
leniency 
you want to see a grown man cry he told the judge janet 
mckinzie is paying the price for the sampl bailout 
haynes had portrayed his client as a washedout zombie 
hooked on prescription drugs given her by north americas chairman 
dentist duayne christensen and duped into following christensens 
orders 
mckinzie had been the business manager for christensen who died 
in a car crash just hours after federal regulators took over the 
thrift in january 1987 declaring it insolvent 
christensen was named as an unindicted coconspirator in 
mckinzies case 
mckinzie the first person to be convicted under the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act in connection with a west 
coast savings and loan failure appeared composed as her sentence 
was read 
she wept in march when she was convicted of 22 counts of 
racketeering conspiracy bank fraud wire fraud and interstate 
transportation of stolen property she had faced a maximum 175year 
prison term but prosecutors asked for the term given 
mckinzie who held the title of consultant at north america was 
denied bail pending an appeal she will be eligible for parole in 
about seven years seave said 
the north america case was considered among the top in the 
widespread sampl crisis in terms of how egregious the fraud was 
william davis chief deputy of the california department of savings 
and loan has said 
the sampls collapse eventually cost taxpayers more than 120 
million 
federal prosecutors had painted mckinzie and christensen as a 
modernday bonnie and clyde stealing millions from north america 
to support their extravagant tastes 
each had a rollsroyce automobile and they treated themselves 
to such baubles as a 125000 gold eagle statue an 18500 letter 
opener and a 500 gold paper clip 
mckinzies 37th birthday was celebrated with a party at the 
newport beach marriott where hundreds of guests were entertained 
by sammy davis jr singing songs including happy birthday 
following criminal investigations into north americas 
operation mckinzie was sued in february 1987 for acting with 
christensen to defraud the institution and causing its collapse 
in march 1987 federal regulators operating the thrift estimated 
the amount missing at 40 million in june 1988 it was announced 
north america would be closed and liquidated 
federal prosecutors employed the rico statute so the government 
could try to claim the proceeds from christensens 10 million life 
insurance policy which named mckinzie as sole beneficiary 
three of mckinzies associates have pleaded guilty to criminal 
charges in connection with alleged fraud at north america
