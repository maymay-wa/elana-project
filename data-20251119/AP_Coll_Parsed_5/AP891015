said 
market and government officials in the united states continued 
their weekendlong huddle sunday mapping out strategies to prevent 
a financial disaster paralleling the events of two years ago when 
the dow plummeted 508 points on oct 19 black monday after a 
108point drop the preceding friday 
after what happened the powers that be will do a lot to 
avoid a major selloff said john tierney a vice president at 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
the tokyo activity was the first in a major foreign market 
following fridays plunge on wall street and was expected to help 
set the tone for trading as it opened in other markets around the 
world 
share prices in hong kong australia new zealand and taiwan 
also fell but not drastically in opening trading monday 
on the hong kong stock exchange prices declined about 6 
percent or 163 points to 2619 in the first 10 minutes of trading

percent in late morning activity after initially declining by 2 
percent 
the new york stock market suffered its worst setback since the 
black monday crash when prices plunged in the final hour of trading 
last friday and the dow jones industrial average lost more than 190 
points to finish at 256926 
since 1987 takeover rumors and leveraged buyouts had pushed the 
market higher but trouble with one of those deals friday the 
employeemanagement buyout of united airines parent ual corp 
raised fears of problems in the junk bond financing market and 
sparked fridays selloff 
the federal reserve sent signals over the weekend that it will 
move quickly to meet any demands for cash on monday when a deluge 
of sell orders is expected to hit the us markets 
we will be there with all the liquidity demand that is 
needed said a senior fed official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity if there are any doubts about liquidity being 
available there is no reason to be concerned 
the feds action could keep bankers from cutting off credit to 
brokerage houses and securities firms suffering heavy losses from a 
plunge in stock prices 
the fed official said the us central bank had been in touch 
with central banks in japan and europe and had received assurances 
from them that those officials stood ready to supply needed cash in 
their countries to counteract any possible fallout from fridays 
plunge in stock prices 
officials at both the fed and the treasury were closely 
monitoring developments in the overseas markets primarily tokyo 
and hong kong developments in those markets could set the tone for 
how us markets perform when they open monday morning 
the new york stock exchange planned to open its computers to 
receive orders at 730 am edt an hour earlier than usual 
thousands of worried investors called sell orders into their 
brokers over the weekend setting the stage for a flood of activity 
when wall street opens for business 
the exchange plans to institute a service at the opening which 
puts individual orders of up to 2099 shares in front of big 
institutional orders said the nyses chief spokesman richard 
torrenzano normally the service is offered only after the dow 
moves up or down 25 points 
you go on a red alert when theres a situation like friday 
said nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin we want to pave the way for 
the system to operate as smooth as possible were not anticipating 
any problem 
once the market opens a system of circuit breakers 
installed following the 1987 crash will automatically halt trading 
if the dow rises or falls 250 points 
gamsin said the exchange intends to let the market go 
rather than step in before the circuit breakers have a chance to 
work 
insiders say a drop on wall street might be cushioned if 
corporations and brokerages step in to buy stocks after the crash 
two years ago companies stepped in to purchase their own shares to 
bolster prices 
observers said the same thing could happen this time with 
brokerages joining in to support the stocks they have been touting 
through the markets recent recordsetting runup 
experts are quick to note that the economic landscape two years 
ago was markedly different higher interest rates and a weak dollar 
had the effect of creating expectations of a big economic 
slowdown and looming inflation tierney said 
but lower interest rates a strong dollar and continued growth 
are providing a firmer foundation this time around 
people have had two days to sober to the fact that the 
economy is not falling apart said hugh johnson senior vice 
president at first albany corp

a union official said saturday that allegations 
that pan american world airways ticket agents kept ticket money are 
part of a witch hunt by the airline 
four ticket agents at kennedy international airport have been 
charged with stealing about 1400 said bill cahill a spokesman 
for the port authority of new york and new jersey which runs the 
airport 
the port authority and pan am have determined that 48000 is 
in fact missing said cahill 
he said port authority detectives are investigating the four 
agents and and possibly others in the disappearance of the 48000 
cahill had previously indicated that the four arrested were 
charged with stealing the total 48000 but he said saturday he 
was mistaken 
the four agents were charged friday with falsifying records and 
larceny for allegedly selling oneway tickets and keeping the cash 
instead of putting the money in the register cahill said 
one of the agents cathy alam is charged with taking just 38 
cahill said 
an official of the union that represents the agents blasted the 
charges calling it part of a scheme by pan am to get rid of some 
union employees 
i think this is just a witch hunt said george miranda vice 
president of local 732 of the airline division of the teamsters 
i dont think these people were involved in a sophisticated 
scam involving that amount of money miranda said 
cahill said 48000 is missing in receipts for august and 
september and that port authority detectives believe ticket agents 
may have been keeping cash payments for about a year 
the investigation conducted at the request of the airline will 
continue and more arrests are expected cahill said 
a pan am spokesman didnt immediately respond to a telephone 
request for comment

the bush administration is unable to get rid of 
panamas gen manuel noriega because the military strongman has 
compromising films involving senior washington officials a british 
newspaper reported sunday 
the sunday correspondent a new independent weekly also said 
the united states asked noriega for help shipping arms to 
nicaraguas contra rebels according to secret documents 
declassified during the irancontra investigation 
the united states relationship with the general is curious 
and raises disturbing questions the paper said 
the newspaper said that for years noriega invited senior 
officials from congress the cia the defense department and 
administration to his pacific ocean villa on the azuero peninsula 
it didnt name any officials 
there he supplied his guests with girls or boys in bedrooms 
wired for sound and equipped with hidden cameras the paper said 
noriega stored the films as an insurance policy for the 
future according to the newspaper 
the weekly quoted curtin winsor us ambassador to costa rica 
from 1983 to 1985 as saying he received such an invitation from 
noriegas brother in 1985 
winsor told the paper he checked out the invitation with ted 
briggs us ambassador to panama who told him he would be 
spending the weekend in one of the most notorious honeytraps 
in latin america 
the report said winsor turned down his invitation but many other 
us officials accepted 
i cant give you names but look around the weekly quoted 
winsor as saying whos soft on noriega thats where you should 
look 
the newspaper quoted dick gregorie the former miami prosecutor 
who brough drugtrafficking charges against noriega as saying he 
was disgusted by what he called the sham nature of the us war on 
drugs 
the newspaper said documents released during the irancontra 
trials showed the us wanted permission to use noriegas secret 
drugs and arms airfields 
jack blum former counsel to the senate foreign relations 
committee was quoted by the paper as saying if drugs came back 
to the us as a result then the us administration turned a blind 
eye 
the paper also quoted blum as saying the united states gave 
noriega all kinds of mixed signals a mixture of public 
condemnation and private encouragement 
blum told the paper that a 1986 state department policy review 
recommending strong action against noriega was shelved after 
higher levels told the department to forget it 
the paper said sen john kerry dmass requested last year 
that the general accounting office ask government agencies for 
information on noriega the national security council however 
banned any agency from giving out information the paper said 
the sunday correspondent is only five weeks old it is not 
connected with any other british newspaper group but the chicago 
tribune company is among its financial backers

a regulation that put strict limits on the amount of assets thrifts 
were allowed to invest directly in real estate securities and 
other risky ventures without regulators approval

a real estate developer is getting some help from 
the feds in his quest to transform al capones former headquarters 
once an opulent palace of sin into a respectable hotel for 
business travelers 
the lexington hotel on chicagos near south side was the plush 
prohibition era haven where capone ruled his criminal empire in the 
late 1920s and early 30s before he was sent to federal prison on 
an income taxevasion rap 
today the abandoned building is a neighborhood eyesore despite 
its city and federal landmark status 
broken liquor bottles litter the boardedup main entrance next 
to an abandoned blues bar the masonry exterior is dotted with 
cracked terra cotta decorations and broken bay windows 
real estate developer ganesan visvabharathy wants to change all 
that 
the indianborn visvabharathy plans to transform the 10story 
building into a 258suite hotel geared to business people attending 
events at the nearby mccormick place exhibition center 
visvabharathy said he didnt know about the hotels past when he 
responded to a real estate ad in june 1988 he bought the property 
for 600000 from the sunbow foundation a nonprofit group that 
trains women for construction jobs 
but visvabharathy said capones legacy was an added incentive 
for him to proceed with plans for the 286 million rehabiliation 
project 
a lot of people would consider al capone something like a 
negative but in my opinion thats exactly why you should use it as 
a positive thing to market the hotel said visvabharathy in a 
recent interview 
if you go anywhere in the world people may not know anything 
about chicago but they know al capone said visvabharathy 41 
who left india in 1974 to study for his doctorate in business 
administration at the university of illinois 
last month the us department of housing and urban development 
awarded an urban development action grant to the lexington rehab 
project the 26 million grant will be used by the city to make a 
lowinterest loan to vilas investment properties inc the real 
estate development company visvabharathy started in 1982 
a partnership formed by vilas company is investing 3 million 
and the remainder of the money will come from bank loans and city 
development bonds 
visvabharathy plans to begin construction in late november and 
the restoration should be completed by november 1991 
joseph j james the commissioner of the citys department of 
economic development says hes excited about the project 
it will breathe some new life into a neighborhood that we are 
very interested in james said if we can facilitate some 
tourism and interest using one of our more notorious former 
residents i can certainly live with that 
the lexington opened in 1892 and was one of the citys first 
highrises president grover cleveland honeymooned there and 
societys elite once danced on the lavish ballrooms tiled floors 
when capone made the hotel his headquarters he occupied the 
fourth and fifth floors part of the hotel was converted to a 
brothel and there was a network of underground tunnels and secret 
stairways 
the lexington was renamed the new michigan hotel after world war 
ii a bordello and finally a flophouse it was closed by court 
order in 1980 
visvabharathy says little is salvagable inside except for some 
tile flooring from the ballroom and tiles in the bathroom of 
capones fourroom suite 
he plans to faithfully restore capones suite including its 
lavender bathtub but it wont be rented out to guests instead it 
will be a tourist attraction 
in 1986 the lexington drew attention when televisions geraldo 
rivera blasted open a sealed basement chamber billed as capones 
secret vault in a live tv broadcast all that was found were a few 
empty whiskey bottles and an old sign

walter sisulu senior leader of the 
african national congress and colleague of nelson mandela was 
freed at dawn sunday after 26 years in prison seven other 
political prisoners also were freed 
mandela the most prominent jailed leader of the outlawed 
guerrilla movement remains in prison although his release within 
the next months is widely expected 
sisulu 77 arrived under police escort at his home in soweto 
and embraced his wife albertina an activist who was under severe 
police restrictions until friday 
youths who had been waiting for sisulu lifted the whitehaired 
bespectacled black nationalist atop their shoulders before he went 
inside 
i feel very well sisulu told reporters i am inspired 
also freed early sunday were the seven other prisoners whose 
impending unconditional release was announced tuesday by president 
fw de klerk 
these include four other men arrested in 1963 and sentenced to 
life prison terms in 1964 along with sisulu and mandela andrew 
mlangeni 63 elias mostsoaledi 65 ahmed kathrada 60 and 
raymond mhlaba 68 as well as anc leader wilton mkwayi 67 who 
was sentenced to life in prison in a separate 1964 trial 
the group also includes 80yearyear anc activist oscar mpetha 
who had been hospitalized in cape town and jafta masemola 58 a 
member of the pan africanist congress guerrilla movement who lives 
outside pretoria 
mpetha was serving a fiveyear prison term for terrorism 
masemola was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1963 
sisulu who arrived home in a gray suit and blue tie emerged 
after about three hours to speak to reporters and give a 
clenchedfist salute to a crowd of 300 wellwishers outside his 
home some waving anc flags 
asked if he had feared he might die in prison sisulu said i 
was quite prepared for death but i knew the pressure was building 
for our release and i never despaired 
sisulu conferred at his home with several antiapartheid leaders 
the freed anc leaders are expected to apply for passports to 
travel to lusaka zambia for consultations with the guerrilla 
movements exiled leadership 
although the anc remains outlawed the release of sisulu and his 
colleagues has been widely viewed as a tacit acknowledgement by the 
government of the movements influence and popularity among south 
africas black majority 
even relatively conservative black leaders have said they will 
reject any negotiations with the government unless the anc is 
legalized and its jailed leaders freed 
in recent weeks the government has permitted anc flags and 
posters to be displayed openly at mass protests something not 
allowed before de klerk took power in midaugust 
symbols of the guerrilla movement were in evidence saturday 
when more than 100000 blacks joined in marches mationwide 
protesting government policy and celebrating the imminent release 
of the eight prisoners 
organizers said never before had so many large antigovernment 
marches been held in the country simultaneously 
mandela 71 conferred with justice minister kobie coetsee and 
other government officials before the announcement of the prisoner 
releases there has been increasing speculation that mandela does 
not want to go free until the government takes further steps to 
legalize anc political activity 
the anc leader clearly understands the power he wields 
wrote political analysist gary van staden in the star newspaper of 
johannesburg on sunday if by remaining in jail he can achieve 
the unbanning of his and other organizations and strengthen the 
ancs position in the negotiation process then his own history 
suggests he will opt for the tough choice 
de klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five 
years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised 
black majority but he envisions some arrangement in which whites 
would retain veto power over major decisions 
black leaders say meaningful talks cannot begin until the state 
of emergency is lifted the anc is legalized and all political 
prisoners are freed

a eulogy comparing ferdinand marcos to jesus 
christ was ridiculous absurd and an insult to the filipino 
people hawaiis top roman catholic official said saturday 
i sincerely regret the gross abuse of the catholic mass as a 
forum to make yet another blatantly political statement regarding 
the late ferdinand marcos former president of the philippines 
the roman catholic bishop of honolulu joseph a ferrario said in 
a written statement 
during a funeral mass friday at the cocathedral of st theresa 
monsignor domingo nebres a priest from the philippines eulogized 
his longtime friend as a man who suffered like jesus christ and 
forgave those who betrayed him 
christ was a victim of the peoples power so marcos was a 
victim of the peoples power he said referring to the 1986 
people power revolt that ended marcos 20year rule in the 
philippines 
after the mass nebres told reporters he was not comparing 
marcos to jesus in terms of power but in suffering 
ferrario said nebres who doesnt have a honolulu parish was 
allowed to say the mass only after agreeing he wouldnt to give a 
eulogy or say anything political 
he gave us his word that he would follow these directions his 
comments at the mass violated these instructions said ferrario 
furthermore we consider his comparison of marcos to jesus as 
ridiculous absurd and an insult to the filipino people 
nebres defended himself saturday saying his comments were 
personal not political and that he spoke only of marcos 
suffering especially during his threeyear exile 
as for the instructions against giving a eulogy nebres said 
when someone is dead in front of you you must give him a little 
glory as a comfort to his family and those who loved him 
marcos died sept 28 at age 72 after being hospitalized for 
nearly nine months his body was to be entombed sunday at the 
valley of the temples memorial park in what his family called a 
temporary resting place his widow imelda has vowed to return 
the body to the philippines someday for burial

the federal reserve is ready to move large 
amounts of cash into the american banking system on monday if the 
money is needed to prevent a financial crisis sparked by a sharp 
drop in stock prices it was reported sunday 
flooding the banking system with money could reduce the risk 
that fridays 190point fall in the dow jones average will turn 
into a more serious financial disaster on monday the washington 
post and the new york times reported 
markets will be able to count on us to make sure the financial 
system stays fluid the times quoted an unidentified official of 
the federal reserve board as saying 
on monday it should be quite evident to the market that we 
will satisfy liquidity needs our action in the market should make 
it clear an unnamed fed official told the post liquidity refers 
to the ready availability of cash 
the feds promise is aimed at preventing a repeat of the wall 
street situation two years ago when the market fell 508 points in 
a single day 
on the day before that fall the stock index had fallen 108 
points leading mutual fund shareholders to cash in their shares 
as the mutual funds ran low they had to sell more shares to raise 
money which in turn caused stock prices to drop even lower 
to calm the markets its important that institutions know 
there are adequate funds available the official told the times 
once the markets realize there will be no credit crunch we can 
resume normal business 
according to the unnamed official quoted by the times the feds 
decision was taken at a meeting late friday and was being 
communicated to officials in asia and western europe this weekend

most of the 6500 residents forced to flee 
when a frozen pizza plant leaked deadly ammonia gas were allowed 
back into their homes early sunday but people with breathing 
problems were told to wait 
authorities ordered a complete evacuation of the town saturday 
night when the gas used for refrigeration began leaking and 
spread quickly over an area of about half a mile said fire 
department lt ron winters 
twentyfour people affected by the gas were taken to hospitals 
and four were admitted officials said many others were given 
oxygen by paramedics who rushed to the scene from around the 
largely rural southeastern quarter of ohio 
the anhydrous ammonia leak at the pillsbury co jenos plant was 
brought under control by 1055 pm said mayor john carey 
assistant fire chief bob long said people started returning to 
their homes just after 5 am sunday 
the fog is still heavy its starting to lift up a little and 
it smells kind of funny you get a little odor of it long said 
the mayor warned that the elderly people with breathing 
problems and small children could be affected by remaining vapor 
and should remain away from the town until the ammonia dissipated 
completely

blacks remain disenfranchised 
and the white minority remains in charge but other aspects of 
south african politics have changed markedly in the quartercentury 
since walter sisulu and his colleagues went to jail 
black trade unions banned at the time sisulu nelson mandela 
and other african national congress leaders received life prison 
terms in 1964 now claim more than 2 million members and have the 
power to cripple the biggest industries 
a network of militant antiapartheid groups has formed in black 
townships across south africa linking churches students women 
and workers in an organizational framework that was not available 
to sisulu and mandela 
sisulus hometown the vast black township of soweto remains an 
allblack ghetto providing a work force for johannesburg but it 
now includes posh twostory homes as well as cramped matchbox 
houses and shanties more sowetans commute to work in blackowned 
taxis than in whiteowned buses 
in johannesburg itself several innercity neighborhoods have 
become thoroughly multiracial even though laws mandating 
residential segregation remain on the books 
when sisulu went to jail virtually every type of public 
facility in johannesburg was segregated toilets elevators 
parks libraries theaters restaurants blacks and whites waited 
in separate lines at post offices 
those segregation policies crumbled one by one and the citys 
final segregated amenities were opened up last month sisulu now 
can ride buses swim in swimming pools and patronize recreation 
centers that formerly were reserved for whites 
segregated facilities remain in some other parts of the country 
but the government has hinted that the law allowing such 
segregation may be headed for abolition 
public hospitals and schools remain segregated but the number 
of multiracial private schools has mushroomed since 1964 many more 
blacks have moved into professional and technical jobs including 
skilled mining jobs that until two years ago were exclusively for 
whites 
south africas international isolation has intensified steadily 
since 1964 that was the first year the country was barred from the 
olympics and it now is excluded from international competition in 
almost every sport a cultural boycott also is in effect as are 
numerous trade embargoes and south africa has been excluded from 
the un general assembly since 1974 
antiapartheid activism among south african whites was rare in 
1964 outside a small ciricle of communistoriented intellectuals 
aligned to the anc 
there was one antiapartheid legislator helen suzman in 
parliament now there are 34 with the antiapartheid democratic 
party having won 20 percent of the votes in the sept 6 general 
election 
whites produce lively antiapartheid newspapers perform in 
antiapartheid rock bands and in increasing numbers journey 
abroad to confer with the ancs exiled leaders 
major changes also have taken place within the governing 
national party in 1964 it unashamedly touted its grand 
apartheid policy of relocating blacks into rural tribal 
homelands theorizing that the blacks could satisfy their desire 
for political rights in the homelands while whites tightened 
control over the other 87 percent of the country 
the homelands still exist but the national party now 
acknowledges that the blacks in white south africa are 
permanent residents who must be given a political role 
efforts to stem the flow of blacks into urban areas have eased 
and the government abolished the socalled pass laws that required 
blacks in white areas to have permits 
the new president fw de klerk also is different from the 
government leaders of the 1950s and early 60s since taking power 
he has pledged to eliminate discriminatory laws and negotiate a new 
constitution within five years that would extend political rights 
to blacks 
however de klerk like his predecessors opposes a oneperson 
onevote system that would lead to black majority rule he 
envisions some mechanism through which whites would maintain a veto 
power over major decisions something sisulu and his freed 
colleagues are likely to find unacceptable

palestinian leaders met sunday in the iraqi 
capital seeking a common strategy toward us and egyptian 
proposals for direct palestinianisraeli negotiations 
plo chairman yasser arafat was expected to come under pressure 
from hardliners to reject recent peace proposals by israel egypt 
and the united states which have either ruled out plo 
participation in peace talks or left its role vague 
the central council convened at the plos embassy in 
downtown baghdad under tight security 
the council comprising 80 members acts as an intermediary 
between the plos policymaking body the palestine national 
council and the 15man executive committee 
plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman said it will discuss all 
peace ideas that have been floating in recent months and will issue 
a policy statement he did not say how long the meeting would 
last 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir proposed in may that 
elections be held in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to allow 
palestinians to choose their own representatives under a plan for 
limited selfrule 
but he ruled out israeli withdrawal from the territories the 
creation of a palestinian state or participation of palestinians 
outside the occupied territories in the elections 
egyptian president hosni mubarak proposed a modified 10point 
election plan that urged israel to accept the concept of trading 
land for peace and enter into direct talks with the palestinians 
mubarak did not mention the plo 
secretary of state james a baker iii invited the foreign 
ministers of egypt and israel esmat abdelmeguid and moshe arens 
for talks in washington but also ignored the plo 
radical palestinians mainly george habash and nayef hawatmeh 
have been pushing for outright condemnation of the proposals 
habash head of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine faction has warned mubarak he could suffer the same fate 
as his predecessor anwar sadat sadat was killed by egyptian 
radicals in october 1981 two years after he signed the camp david 
peace treaty with israel 
hawatmeh who leads the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine said we are totally opposed to the mubarak and baker 
plans which are only a new version of the illfated camp david 
accords 
only the plo can choose palestinian representatives to any 
dialogue he told the associated press in baghdad before the 
meeting began

last weeks annual conservative party convention 
revealed thatcherism to be in trouble and striving for a kinder 
more caring image 
conservative conventions traditionally are designed less to 
thrash out policies than to cheer the leader and unite the troops 
but this one seemed jinxed 
with the pound sagging and inflation resurgent interest rates 
were pushed up to 15 percent an eightyear high just five days 
before the convention opened in the seaside town of blackpool 
then as prime minister margaret thatcher was winding up the 
convention with a rousing defense of her record it was announced 
that the annual inflation rate had crept up from 73 percent to 76 
percent 
finally as the delegates headed home friday wall street 
slumped and left british business facing a jittery weekend 
to compound conservative worries the opposition labor party has 
been topping the opinion polls for the past four months and its 
lead averages seven points 
thats normal against a government in midterm say conservative 
loyalists but after a decade in the wilderness the socialists 
under neil kinnock are beginning to look like credible challengers 
again 
at labors convention the previous week votelosing doctrines 
like unilateral nuclear disarmament were formally dumped and the 
militant left which had frightened off many voters in the past 
was thoroughly sidelined 
moreover the centrist bloc in mrs thatchers party that has 
helped keep her in power by garnering votes from labor has 
disintegrated and britain is back to straight twoparty politics 
none of this means an imminent end to thatcherism with its 
hatred for socialism distrust of trade unions and faith in market 
forces 
no election need be held until mid1992 and mrs thatcher who 
turned 64 last week looked her usual vigorous combative self 
even after 10 years in office an eternity by british standards 
she remains securely in charge revered by her supporters as the 
warrior who slew the trade union dragon liberated the marketplace 
from socialist regulation and restored britains selfesteem 
but even her best friends are telling her shes in trouble 
when interest rates rose yet again the conservative daily mail 
demanded the resignation of chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson who only a year earlier was being hailed by conservatives 
as a miracle worker 
the prothatcher sunday times reversed its past assessments and 
concluded bluntly that there was no british economic miracle in 
the 1980s after all 
once again it said the country faced the perennial problems 
of the british economy rising prices balance of payments 
deficits inflationary wage demands slow growth and the huge 
structural rigidities which hold britain back 
at the convention many delegates were asking why after 10 
years of mrs thatchers harsh medicine inflation and high 
interest rates are still around 
many people are feeling rather let down delegate peter 
brown said thursday they are rather upset that after 10 years of 
conservative rule we should have got into these rather difficult 
times 
in the longer term the convention was significant for the 
signals it sent out that thatcherism is preparing for change 
speakers seemed at pains to present a more compassionate brand 
of conservativism even though that implies spending more 
taxpayers money on public services and would have been regarded 
with suspicion by thatcherite purists 
there was an unexpected government pledge of 16 billion to 
cushion britons against an unpopular new property tax 
mrs thatcher assured delegates that the cherished national 
health service was not going to be privatized on american 
lines as some had feared an expected promise to sell off the 
stateowned railroads never materialized 
the volatile issue of britains place in a united europe failed 
to stir any fuss promises to protect the environment and enhance 
the quality of life got big cheers 
former defense secretary michael heseltine a leading contender 
to succeed mrs thatcher railed against polluted rivers filthy 
streets bodies bedded down in doorways which are no 
advertisement for a prosperous and caring society 
the overall theme said the liberal guardian newspaper was the 
need to adjust to a coming decade where the old tunes have lost 
their resonance 
the more conservative times said that with conservatives and 
labor both moving to the center britain might have a quite 
different political landscape in the 1990s

pope john paul ii said sunday that 
technological advancements such as television are threatening 
traditional family life on this indian ocean island nation 
modern life has reached the shores of the island asphalt 
roads and electricity arrive the same time as the means of social 
communication such as television and videos the pope told a 
stadium full of roman catholics on the tiny island of rodrigues 
390 miles east of the main island of mauritius 
in itself this is praiseworthy progress but as in other 
societies rodrigues suffers in full from influences such as those 
of the video that threaten stability in the family the pontiff 
said 
the 36500 frenchspeaking inhabitants of rodrigues are mainly 
africandescended farmers and farm workers about 97 percent are 
catholic 
the pope expressed concern about the growing number of islanders 
leaving to seek jobs in the booming economy on the main island 
where he arrived saturday after eight days in korea and indonesia 
he returns to rome on monday 
for a long time rodrigues seemed to be living tranquilly as 
one big united family in which everyone knew everyone else and no 
one was an outcast said the pope and suddenly there is worry 
about the future 
he urged the islanders to safeguard traditional values in a 
country where tourism has doubled in the past six years to about 
200000 annually cardinal jean margeot has warned that the influx 
of outsiders is creating serious moral problems for mauritians 
as the pope toured the island topless european and south 
african women sunned themselves on beaches in a land where most 
native women wear long dresses and dont smoke or drink alcohol 
in the past six years 90000 jobs have been created on 
mauritius a democracy where people of several races and religions 
coexist peacefully 
the government of prime minister anerood jugnauth has actively 
courted foreign investment creating a special export zone to 
diversify the economy from its centuries of dependence on sugarcane 
but mauritians have become concerned about pollution as factory 
smoke begins to cloud the sharpedged mountains around the lagoons 
and gas stations appear alongside the palm trees 
the government last year created a department to monitor the 
quality of life and financed it from liquor and cigarette taxes 
mauritius also has become a transit point for drug smugglers 
signs at the international airport warn of a death penalty for 
trafficking in narcotics

if visitors to this museum get the feeling 
theyre being watched by hundreds of eyes theyre right after 
all theyre standing in the potato museum 
surely one of the smallest museums in washington if not 
anywhere in the world the potato museum occupies the basement of a 
yellowbrick rowhouse on capitol hill that is the home of tom and 
meredith hughes a funloving couple of spud fanatics and their 
5yearold son gulliver 
gullivers nickname naturally is tater tot 
filling the two tiny basement rooms are 400 items from the 
hugheses collection of 2000 potato artifacts from a bronzed 
heartshaped potato donated by a canadian woman to a north carolina 
inventors digital tater time clock which runs believe it or 
not on electrical current supplied by the acids in two attached 
potatoes 
the goodness of the potato knows no bounds the couple 
gushed in a tuber tome they wrote in 1986 titled the great 
potato book extolling the virtues of their favorite vegetable 
visitors to the private nonprofit museum are welcomed by mrs 
hughes with a slide show of potato folklore accompanied by tapes 
of such top tuber tunes as cold tater stomp or weird al 
yanokovichs addicted to spuds 
then her husband a schoolteacher in suburban mclean va 
invites guests to become couch potatoes and enjoy his videotape of 
great moments in potatoes from hollywood movies the scenes 
include marilyn monroe snacking on potato chips in the sevenyear 
itch and richard dreyfuss making a mountain of his mashed 
potatoes at the dinner table in close encounters of the third 
kind 
q what was the biggest potato ever grown 
a an englishman named thomas seddal is reputed to have 
harvested a monster spud weighing 18 pounds 4 ounces on feb 17 
1795 
q what was the biggest single serving of mashed potatoes in 
history 
a an 18260pound mound of instant mashed potatoes prepared in 
a cement mixer truck for the annual potato bowl football game at 
grand forks nd in 1982 
the museums shelves are stuffed with potato toys including a 
spudomatic air pistol that shoots potato pellets a burlap 
potato sack jacket potato posters dolls and postage stamps a 
1948 idaho world famous potatoes license plate and some 
4000yearold potatoes preserved in a jar 
theres also a cluster of antique potato chip cans a basket of 
deepfried potato skins woven by the chef at antoines restaurant 
in new orleans and a staggering assortment of implements and 
kitchen appliances potato mashers slicers peelers scrubbers 
hoes rakes planters baskets diggers and beetle sprayers 
one rack displays sample products made from potatoes polish 
vodka hand lotion ice cream bread a sheet of paper a necklace 
and autochromes an early color photographic process using 
potato starch which also is used to make candy and glue 
hughes says potatoes fueled german rockets in world war ii and 
once were used as money by the island people of tristan da cunha 
theyre good for treating acne sunburn and toothaches he claims 
and they make great chicken feed 
the potato museum began in 1975 when hughes asked his 
fifthgrade pupils at the international school of brussels to 
prepare an exhibit showing why potatoes are so important in 
belgium the belgians grow potatoes in backyard gardens the way 
americans grow tomatoes he says and their frites which 
americans mistakenly call french fries are the most delicious in 
the world 
artifacts from that classroom project formed the nucleus of the 
museum which moved to washington with the hugheses in 1983 the 
independent taxexempt museum gets most of its financial support 
from membership dues souvenir sales and a grant from a potato 
research center in lima peru 
for 20 a year members receive six issues of the museums 
newsletter peelings and invitations to occasional potluck 
dinners where the allpotato menu ranges from pickled potato hors 
doeuvres to a dessert made of chocolatelaced mashed potatoes 
hughes says he and meredith have two ambitions to visit the 
chilean island where spanish explorers found potatoes and 
introduced them to europe in 1570 and to take a cruise on a newly 
built japanese potato tanker 
the hugheses love potatoes because theyre not only good eating 
but theyre fun and friendly 
they are a comfort food when we feel lonely sick or sad but 
we also see something of ourselves in them said mrs hughes 
cuddling a spud in her hand look it has eyes a head a face 
its somehow almost human

while world war ii still raged an american 
serviceman had a burst of inspiration and painted a giant picture 
of the famed b17 bomber on a brick wall at a us airfield 
the b17 is ancient aviation history now and the airfield is 
used as a dragracing strip the name of the fatigueclad artist is 
barely remembered 
but the mural that stood in obscurity since 1944 has been taken 
down as part of a plan to restore it and move it to a permanent 
place of honor 
it was a thrill to see something that has been in the dark for 
more than 40 years come into the light again and be saved for 
posterity said richard nimmo one of a group of english 
enthusiasts who seek to perserve such relics 
the picture which shows the famous flying fortress 
unloading its bombs while antiaircraft shells burst around it 
was taken down saturday from its place at podington airfield an 
old base of the world war iiera us 8th air force 
podington airfield 65 miles north of london was one of about 
130 8th air force bases for bombers and fighters in the eastern 
england flatlands they were established to raid germany and 
germanoccupied territory 
after the war most of the podington field reverted to farming 
the brick huts used by the crews have remained as workshops for 
dragracing on the airfield runway and the control tower has been 
converted into a house 
the mural was on a piece of wall on farmland the removal team 
had to get permission from the farmer to take down the painting 
and they will have to rebuild the wall a benefactor has given them 
750 red bricks for the task 
with help from the us air base at alconbury near cambridge 
the mural is to soon be transported to duxford another old 8th air 
force field about 35 miles east of podington 
britains imperial war museum maintains duxford for its 
collection of historic aircraft and will set up the b17 mural as 
part of its display about the 8th air force 
the 12by8 foot painting was done in about 1944 by a staff 
sergeant named walderschmidt nimmo said 
we think he was on the ground crew he said we dont know 
anything else about him except that we heard he is still alive in 
the united states we dont know his first name or where he lives

route 69 cambodia ap following their capture of three 
towns cambodian guerrillas have begun a coordinated attack on the 
only big town blocking their advance to the strategic city of 
sisophon which is controlled by the vietnaminstalled government 
the guerrillas claim they already have taken frontline positions 
at svey chek the offensive began saturday and all day the area 
reverberated with hundreds of artillery blasts 
more than 1000 guerrillas were seen saturday trekking on the 
roads to svey chek from the recently captured towns of thmar puok 
banteay chmar and kandoul following them were convoys of people 
carrying ammunition and more than 50 ox carts full of ammunition 
mortars rockets and antitank weapons 
the khmer peoples national liberation front claimed it seized 
thmar puok and banteay chmar along highway 69 leading to sisophon 
and kandoul just west of the highway days after launching a 
general offensive on sept 30 
a 16hour 94mile tour saturday of the towns and several 
captured artillery bases showed they were firmly under the 
liberation fronts control 
field commanders said the liberation front was attacking svey 
chek in uncommon coordination with its two partners in the 
resistance coalition the khmer rouge and the forces of prince 
norodom sihanouk 
the guerrillas are trying to topple the government vietnam 
installed after it invaded cambodia in late 1978 their attacks 
intensified after vietnam made what it called the pullout of its 
last troops from cambodia on sept 26 
capturing sisophon a major military base for operations in 
northwestern cambodia would be a major victory for the guerrillas 
who have not seized any areas of such significance 
the tour began at a liberation front base along the thai border 
south of the dong ruk mountains where the guerrillas showed off 
captured equipment more than 1000 automatic rifles heavy 
machine guns mortars many cases of antipersonnel mines and 
teletype machines with soviet lettering 
the journey into cambodia was on motorcyles with about 20 
liberation front guerrillas it was slow and grueling covering 
roads drenched by monsoon rains 
everywhere were captured artillery positions virtually all 
capable of hitting site 2 the liberation fronts major civilian 
base just inside thailand three destroyed tanks four destroyed 
heavy trucks and heavy artillery guns were abandoned on the roads

just a few years ago opera audiences and 
critics were bemoaning the lack of any new verdi sopranos to fill 
the void left by the retirement of leontyne price 
then came a young american upstart named aprile millo 
on saturday came another alessandra marc 
even in a metropolitan opera season notable for exciting debuts 
marcs first performance as aida was something special as the 
standingroomonly crowd acknowledged with its repeated ovations 
here is the genuine article a dramatic soprano with an opulent 
voice that can be thrilling in its power or tender in its warmth as 
the occasion demands 
she has the gleaming tones to ride above the full forces of 
orchestra and chorus that verdi assembled for the triumphal scene 
of act 2 she has the artistry to create a portrayal of the 
tormented ethiopian princess in the aria o patria mia which 
opens the nile scene in act 3 
she also has a few problems 
vocally the lower register of her voice is undeveloped and 
colorless at the other end of her range she has trouble reining 
in the volume and seems unable to float the high pianissimos that 
are one of millos trademarks 
dramatically marc is hampered by being enormously overweight a 
condition that makes believable involvement with the other 
characters difficult in one of the operas most moving scenes her 
father amonasro is supposed to throw aida to the ground in angry 
rejection the most that baritone juan pons could do was push her 
gently and allow her to slump on a nearby rock 
marc who is in her early 30s grew up in the washington dc 
area as judith borden she changed her name a few years ago 
saying she was tired of being confused with the soprano judith 
blegen and wanted a name with a good international ring to it 
she has the name now its up to her whether she will have the 
career to match 
the rest of saturdays aida was workmanlike but 
undistinguished as the wooden hero radames tenor nicola 
martinucci strained at his high notes mezzo stefania toczyska was 
earnest if not thrilling as the villainous amneris and pons 
brought warmth and intensity to the brief role of amonasro 
christian badeas conducting was lively and sensitive 
marc is the second american singer to make a triumphant debut 
this season at the met a company often criticized for being too 
slow to engage promising native talent two weeks ago tenor 
richard leech sang rodolfo in puccinis la boheme to great 
acclaim millo who has been singing major roles at the met for 
several years got to open the current season as aida 
theres more to come the coloratura june anderson will debut in 
verdis rigoletto later this fall susan dunn another 
contender in the verdi sweepstakes sings in il trovatore in 
february and soprano ashley putnam will sing in gounods faust 
in march

a top secret government program known as the 
doomsday project is leaving a bitter legacy with a veteran 
counterintelligence expert alleging he is being harassed for 
reporting improprieties and poor management 
the program referred to at the pentagon simply as project 908 
is designed to ensure that even if top us civilian leaders are 
killed in a surprise nuclear attack the united states can still 
unleash its own atomic weapons on the soviet union 
so far the government has spent 4 billion to 5 billion to 
build supply depots underground bunkers and a communications 
network that has been plagued with problems say pentagon sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the army inspector generals office reviewed the program in 1987 
and interviewed army civilian employee w thomas golden 
golden chief of the operations security branch at the 
information systems command in fort huachuca ariz asserted to 
the ig that 
the communications network vital to the project didnt work 
properly was costing hundreds of millions of dollars to fix and 
project 908 officials on several occasions misled members of 
congress into believing that the system was operational when in 
fact it wasnt 
the son of army brig gen eugene renzi was doing work for 
betac corp an arlington va firm to which renzi had directed a 
solesource nobid contract in connection with project 908 
the betac contract specified that one of renzis aides would be 
a 400aday consultant to the company 
army regulations say the inspector general will protect the 
anonymity of witnesses but within weeks of goldens confidential 
discussions word had leaked to renzi that golden was making 
allegations against the general 
golden alleged that col ned bacheldor chief of the inspector 
generals intelligence oversight division had informed renzi that 
golden was the source of the allegation about renzis son renzi 
told army investigators in sworn testimony he had found out about 
goldens allegations from an aide not from bacheldor 
the army inspector generals office concluded that renzi had 
retaliated against golden by spreading word that golden would not 
be welcome at fort ritchie md where renzi directed the 7th 
signal command 
because of renzis action goldens effectiveness was 
diminished and he could not do his job according to an army 
memo obtained by the associated press 
golden requested reassignment and now handles 
counterintelligence matters in connection with the strategic 
defense initiative 
renzi was reprimanded for retaliating against golden but has 
since been promoted to the rank of major general and is stationed 
in hawaii 
renzi bacheldor and golden all rejected interview requests made 
through military spokesmen 
but the ap has learned that renzi told a house armed services 
committee investigator late last year that bacheldor had leaked 
goldens name to renzis boss lt gen emmett paige who passed it 
along to renzi 
golden told congress recently he still is being targeted for 
retribution two officials in project 908 have engaged in a smear 
campaign against me golden said in a letter to the house armed 
services committee obtained by the ap from sources on capitol hill 
security chief john hartford and legal counsel ernie peluso 
tried to obtain goldens telephone records in an effort to link him 
to a reporter for us news amp world report who wrote an article 
about project 908 golden alleged 
hartford and peluso work at the defense mobilization systems 
planning activity a key project 908 component where bacheldor is 
now chief of staff 
according to several sources army secretary john marsh 
intervened and stopped the effort to get goldens telephone records 
hartford and peluso declined requests for interviews to comment 
on the reports 
renzis son and the 400aday consultant who was renzis aide 
left the betac payroll early in 1988 according to pentagon sources 
the work betac does for the government is aboveboard theres 
been no wrongdoing by betac and this is all water over the 
dam said joseph royal the companys director of personnel

the soviet union is on schedule in withdrawing 
forces from eastern europe but has made little progress on military 
reductions within its borders says a congressional report released 
sunday 
the house armed services committee study found that since late 
april the soviets have been pulling back their forces as part of 
reductions proposed by president mikhail s gorbachev on dec 7 
1988 
however the withdrawal of six tank divisions 50000 men and 
5000 tanks from eastern europe has not been carried out as western 
observers expected 
rather than withdrawing a tank division in its entirety the 
motorized rifle regiment assigned to it is being transferred to a 
division that would remain in eastern europe and a tank regiment 
from that division withdrawn instead the report said 
a motorized rifle regiment is similar to a us mechanized 
infantry 
thirteen members of the committee traveled to the soviet union 
in early august a 13day trip that included visits to an east 
german military unit a motorized rifle division in yavorov and an 
intermediaterange nuclear forces elimination facility in sarny 
the report was based on observations by the legislators and 
defense experts who traveled with the delegation 
the committees assessment is consistent with comments made by 
defense secretary dick cheney last month in releasing the pentagon 
study soviet military power 
cheney said that while the soviets are unilaterally withdrawing 
some ground forces they are reorganizing and modernizing their 
general purpose forces upgrading their communications networks and 
researching future generations of weapons systems 
the congressional report said there is great uncertainty about 
what the soviets will do with the equipment being removed from 
their forces specifically the study found that tanks withdrawn 
from eastern europe and slated to be destroyed or converted will 
likely replace older equipment in units within the soviet union 
the study concluded that soviet forces are clearly being 
pulled back from eastern europe into the soviet union but little 
is known so far about what is happening to soviet forces inside the 
soviet union 
gorbachev had vowed to reduce soviet forces west of the ural 
mountains by 10000 tanks 8500 artillery pieces and 800 combat 
aircraft the timetable for the reductions and withdrawals is two 
years 
based on observations of its members the committee concluded 
that while nato must be careful to avoid taking any actions that 
are more difficult to reverse than those happening on the other 
side it is not too soon to take advantage of the changes already 
taking place on the ground namely the withdrawal of soviet forces 
from eastern europe 
rep les aspin dwis the chairman of the house armed services 
committee who headed the delegation said now that we have a 
good understanding of whats going on there we can figure out how 
to respond

nbcs remarkable command of the weekly tv 
ratings will almost certainly end this week as a resurgent abc 
helped by its world series broadcasts makes a bid for the nielsen 
pennant 
for the first time in 68 weeks even nbc is convinced it wont 
be no 1 in the ac nielsen co ratings issued tuesday ending a 
winning streak unmatched in television history 
im sorry its come to an end but i hope we start a new 
streak soon said brandon tartikoff nbc entertainments 
president id like to start a new one as soon as the last out is 
made at the world series 
odds are long though that nbc or any other network soon 
will assemble such a string of triumphs the previous record of 46 
weeks on top was set by cbs in the 196263 season 
not only is the network sweepstakes increasingly competitive 
but upcoming blockbuster sporting events like the super bowl on 
abc and next years baseball playoffs on cbs are divided more 
evenly 
i dont think were going to match real soon and i dont know 
if anybody will match it tartikoff said 
nbcs reign over the ratings used to determine advertising 
rates and thus the key to a networks fortunes stands apart for 
several reasons 
first nbc succeeded mostly without appealing to the lowest 
common denominator winning 25 emmys last month second only to 
cbs 27 
second the streak survived such highly touted miniseries as 
abcs war and remembrance and cbs lonesome dove 
third even last summers screenwriters strike which threw the 
198889 season into chaos didnt derail nbc 
raw numbers dont tell the whole story tartikoff said 
because the streak came in the most competitive environment 
thats ever existed 
cbs record ride as no 1 took place in a day and age when 
there was no world series in prime time there was no super bowl in 
prime time and there was no such thing as movies for television or 
miniseries he said 
bob wright a spokesman for abc said abc believes its expected 
ratings victory wont last long after the world series 
such modesty aside abc has started the new season strongly in 
last weeks ratings it had seven of network televisions top 10 
programs and finished within eighttenths of a ratings point of nbc 
for the week 
abcs workingclass situation comedy roseanne was the 
highestrated program of the week with a rating of 278 its 
highest ever the other abc shows in the top 10 were the wonder 
years whos the boss nfl monday night football 
chicken soup growing pains and head of the class 
the rating is the percentage of the 904 million homes with tv 
sets in the united states with each point equivalent to 904000 
households 
while abc is burdened by the lowrated mr belvedere 
homeroom and living dolls among others its schedule is 
fairly solid on every week night except thursday since 1984 nbc 
has dominated thursday with the cosby show 
cosby more than any other series was responsible for nbcs 
rise from the ratings trash heap so low had nbc fallen earlier 
this decade that in the 198182 season it didnt have one show in 
the top 20 
nbcs streak also was the result of sophisticated marketing 
promotion and scheduling last november against the upscale war 
and remembrance nbc delivered massmarket hits like back to 
the future the karate kid part ii and the vanna white 
quasimovie goddess of love 
although nbc didnt want the streak to end there is some 
consolation for the network in not having to maintain the 
succession any longer 
with the streak over we can nurture a fragile show 
tomorrows st elsewhere or tomorrows cheers now we wont 
get itchy trigger fingers and preempt shows to guarantee another 
ratings win tartikoff said

the education department is expanding the 
scope of its regional strategy sessions to include initiatives 
beyond choice after months of wrangling with the chairman of 
the house education committee about the meetings limited agenda 
education secretary lauro cavazos opens the first session monday 
night when he meets with east harlem ny parents a daylong 
session complete with a plenary and concurrent workshops will 
follow on tuesday 
our purpose in calling for these meetings is to ratchet up the 
debate about the importance of choice in the move to restructure 
schools said education undersecretary john sanders 
choice is the concept that allows parents to decide where their 
children will attend school it is based on the theory that 
competition will shake up and improve bad schools 
however rep augustus hawkins chairman of the house education 
and labor committee had argued that the education departments 
strategy sessions should address other proposals for education 
reform 
hawkins said he and several committee members object to 
choice because we believe its a new way of resegregating the 
schools he added that some disadvantaged children also may be 
forced to give up needed services in order to attend a school 
outside the district 
he said the department has relented and that the meetings will 
include other ideas and that opponents of choice will be 
allowed to talk 
hawkins dcalif bristles at the crosscountry choice 
blitz that will take the education secretary to minnesota north 
carolina colorado and california over the next two months 
why have they selected one program in education which is not 
authorized by congress and not included in the package that we 
passed last year said hawkins pointing to an outline of the 
school improvement act 
the new law reauthorizes virtually all major federal elementary 
and secondary education programs through fiscal year 1993 
including chapter one for the disadvantaged science and math 
programs magnet programs for specialized instruction bilingual 
education and child development 
hawkins said the new law provided for some accountability at 
school districts to document improvements over each year as well 
as local control 
full funding and implementation of the school improvement act 
of 1988 assures precisely that kind of choice and i urge you to 
make it your most immediate and top priority said hawkins in a 
letter to cavazos 
real choice comes about when all parents get involved on a 
daily basis with the education of their children whether they 
attend magnet schools or not said the letter administrators 
teachers parents and their children working together for school 
improvements in each school building as required in the chapter 
one for disadvantaged children for instance will help to bring 
about improvements for all children not just those who attend 
certain select schools 
sanders acknowledged that the new law addresses accountability 
and local control yes but stressed that it deals specifically 
with federal programs it gives new accountability measures within 
those programs were talking about something much broader were 
talking about the system itself 
since he could not stop the meetings hawkins said he worked for 
months before he got the education department to agree to allow 
other education reform programs to be discussed and opponents of 
choice to participate 
hawkins also received an invitation to attend but it was 
uncertain whether he would 
reps charles rangel dny and steve bartlett rtexas are 
expected to attend along with participants from maine vermont 
new hampshire connecticut massachusetts rhode island new york 
new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland west virginia 
district of columbia puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
cavazos and new jersey gov thomas kean will address the meeting 
the most controversial form of school choice is allowing parents 
to send their child to a school outside their school district but 
other initiatives include magnet schools that specialize in certain 
subjects alternative programs and teacherinitiated schools 
so far this year arkansas iowa and nebraska have joined 
minnesota whose open enrollment plan went into effect this past 
school year many other states offer more limited choice options 
aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic problems that 
only certain districts can handle 
chapter one is given to schools that have a large concentration 
of disadvantage students and are located in lowincome areas 
expected high transportation costs also will limited the options 
of lowincome parents hawkins said

shrimpers could be fined 8000 or more starting 
monday if caught with nets that lack turtle excluder devices gates 
that allow endangered sea turtles to escape from the nets without 
drowning 
shrimpers who had hoped that president bush would grant a 
lastminute reprieve complain that the devices known as teds 
cause them to lose nearly a third of their catch government 
studies have shown losses of 5 percent to 10 percent 
although shrimpers have been required to use teds since sept 8 
until sunday the federal government had forgiven the penalties at 
first in whole and later in part if a shrimper bought and 
installed a ted after being caught without one 
but beginning monday a shrimper can be fined 8000 for a first 
offense and 15000 for a second a third offense could cost 
15000 and confiscation of the shrimpers vessel catch or both 
the change in enforcement wont change how the us coast guard 
monitors shrimp boats said lt scott larochelle in galveston 
what weve been doing in normal law enforcement operations is 
stopping boats randomly while in the water larochelle said if 
we happen to stop shrimp boats well check for teds 
the coast guard reports violations it finds to the national 
marine fisheries service which imposes the penalties 
our policy remains unchanged we still continue to look for 
teds in routine boardings as far as the coast guard is concerned 
there was never a stoppage of that said coast guard petty 
officer 2nd class robert morehead in new orleans 
pat philben a coast guard spokesman in new orleans said 
compliance with the teds regulation is improving he and gene 
proulx a national marine fisheries service enforcement official 
agreed that compliance is very good off florida and good along 
texas but said it is poor off louisiana 
larochelle said coast guard officials in the galveston area have 
reported about 50 percent compliance of teds on shrimp boats they 
searched 
milton zirlott a fisherman in mobile county ala said most 
alabama shrimpers have tried teds but few continued to use them 
some shrimpers have very strong opinions about teds 
l jack smith of mobile ala a partner in southeastern 
fisheries inc said if ted regulations stand were just going 
to sell our equipment and turn our boats back to the banks because 
theres no sense in losing money anymore

sobbing refugees and their children 
scuffled with un troops sunday who blocked them from returning to 
turkishoccupied northern cyprus from the greek sector of the 
divided island 
police estimated the number of demonstrators at 3000 and 
stopped most of them from bursting into the unpatrolled buffer 
zone splitting cyprus into greek and turkish sectors 
but about 200 demonstrators mainly women and children managed 
to push through lines of police and british and danish un 
peacekeeping troops 
after repeated scuffles they broke through the three successive 
lines to penetrate about 500 yards into the buffer zone they were 
stopped before reaching the fortified turkish lines about 500 
yards away

greek cypriot refugees to return the buffer zone which splits the 
island effectively prevents any contact between the two sides 
it was the fourth attempt this year by greek cypriot refugees to 
walk back to their homes 
on two of the earlier attempts refugees were beaten by turkish 
cypriot police arrested and jailed for illegal entry into the 
breakaway turkish cypriot state which was proclaimed unilaterally 
in 1983 and has only been recognized by turkey 
unsponsored peace talks between president george vassiliou 
the greek cypriot leader and rauf denktash the president of the 
breakaway state have been deadlocked since june

prodemocracy activists said sunday they will 
demonstrate in the city of leipzig despite a politburo statement 
last week saying street demonstrations pose an obstacle to a 
dialogue on reforms 
also sunday there was growing speculation that a meeting of the 
ruling politburo later this week could determine the political 
future of hardline communist leader erich honecker 
a highranking lutheran church official called on the government 
to allow free elections by secret ballot and warned the communist 
leadership not to dismiss prodemocracy activists as enemies of 
the state 
activists in leipzig said the protest would go ahead as planned 
monday night despite the politburo statement condemning 
demonstrations last monday more than 70000 people took part in a 
prodemocracy march in leipzig the largest single protest in 
almost four decades 
the demands for more freedom in this rigidly controlled country 
have spurred more than 52000 east germans to go west in recent 
months 
the west german masscirculation bild newspaper reported sunday 
that the communist partys central committee in east berlin will 
hold a special session this week that could formally decide 
honeckers future 
bild quoting unidentified reliable sources in east berlin 
said the meeting would be thursday or friday following a session 
of the politburo set for tuesday 
bild said its report would appear in mondays editions of the 
newspaper the report was sent by telex to other news media in 
advance of publication 
honecker has led the country as communist party chief since 1971 
party sources have said leaders in east berlin are unhappy over 
the way honecker has handled the current unrest and that he has 
lost support in the 163seat central committee 
any final decision regarding honeckers leadership role would 
have to be approved by the central committee 
bild also reported that more than 20000 east germans unhappy 
over the leaderships rejection of reforms have canceled their 
party membership in the past two weeks 
lutheran bishop werner leich called on the government to allow 
free elections and urged all sides to refrain from violence 
future elections must serve the purpose of renewal and must 
provide a clear choice by secret ballot of candidates and 
political platforms said leich who heads the east german 
lutheran church federation 
leich in a pastoral letter also appealed to east german 
security officials to show restraint during peaceful prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
he said the government must open a dialogue with all levels of 
society not just political groups and organizations already in 
place 
critical voices cannot simply be dismissed as enemies of the 
state not even the new groups that have formed in our society 
said leich referring to the growing prodemocracy movement in the 
rigidly controlled nation of 166 million 
leich is also bishop of the thueringen region in southwestern 
east germany 
the 77yearold honecker has flatly refused to talk with 
prodemocracy groups

rockey chapman and a few of his buddies 
wanted to volunteer to pick up trash along a 3mile stretch of road 
in their hometown 
so chapman applied for his group to join the states successful 
adoptahighway program which credits volunteers with a sign 
bearing their name and is placed along the strech of road they 
spruced up 
we were willing to pick up garbage a minimum of four times a 
year he said in return they would erect me a green and white 
sign just like everyone else 
thats the rub chapman is the exalted cyclops of the rockingham 
county chapter of the invisible empire of the ku klux klan 
last weekend he and the other volunteers wore their white robes 
as they handed out leaflets in downtown reidsville a town of 
12400 near the virginia border 
state department of tranportation secretary jim harrington 
denied the kkks request saying it would be detrimental to the 
program which has become the largest of its kind in the nation 
they transportation officials were afraid it would lead to 
that part of the highway becoming more of a target of people 
dumping a lot of trash for them to pick up said north carolina 
gov jim martin who supports harringtons decision 
of the nearly 5000 civic groups businesses and neighborhoods 
that have volunteered to adopt more than 10000 miles of state 
roads only a handful had been turned down 
one group was a rock band called the sex police and another was 
a lingerie store called the bra patch the department said earlier 
this month the agency feared motorists would be offended by the 
words sex and bra on the road signs that identify the 
adoptahighway volunteers 
but chapman says that never in my wildest dreams did i think 
theyd turn me down i know enough about my constitutional rights 
to know when theyre being stepped on 
the north carolina branch of the american civil liberties union 
agrees 
we feel it is a violation of the klans first amendment 
rights said charlotte attorney elizabeth hodges an aclu board 
member on friday regardless of what they stand for we should 
take on the case 
state aclu director james shields said his organization would 
come to the aid of any group whose constitutional rights were being 
violated 
if government is able to decide who gets to participate in a 
program based upon government approval of their views government 
is doing a very klanlike thing he said 
the aclu will ask the state dot to reconsider its decision if 
that fails shields said a lawsuit could be filed in state or 
federal court 
chapman a welder does not consider it ironic that the aclu 
usually thought of as a liberal organization came to his groups 
assistance 
i didnt even ask them why they did it because i already knew 
the answer he said this is a first amendment issue 
some reidsville residents said they felt the klansmen were 
entitled to join the program like anyone else 
if they want to clean up the trash let em said brenda 
wingfield who was delivering phone books out of the back of her 
pickup truck fair is fair who cares who cleans it up i 
certainly dont want to do it 
but samuel e nunnally the owner of a photography studio was 
indignant about the klans efforts 
theyve got such a bad name he said people would save up 
their trash and throw it on their stretch of highway 
nunnally who is black said the county was not ready for the 
klan to begin advertising itself like other civic organizations 
they need to prove themselves for a few more years before they 
get into something like this he said 
the governor suggested the kkk was about as interested in 
creating a controversy over it as they are in cleaning it up 
chapman whose mobile home sports a confederate flag in front 
agreed in part saying its a chance to get some good publicity for 
his group and dispel a myth out there that were still 
hatemongers 
were a prowhite organization just like the naacp national 
association for the advancement of colored people is problack 
a youth group affiliated with the national association for the 
advancement of colored people has adopted a highway in wayne county 
in eastern north carolina 
this isnt a matter of black and white chapman said this 
is a matter of rights

after eight years final senate hearings on the 
impeachment case against us district judge alcee l hastings are 
tentatively set for this week with a vote on whether to remove him 
from office possible by weeks end 
removal from the bench would be a form of living death said 
hastings who was acquitted in a jury trial but hes anxious to 
move ahead with his life 
we are now talking in the ninth year of this matter he said 
in an interview everyone should be entitled to closure by now 
its not in the best interests of al hastings and it does not 
serve the community 
he noted the busy southern district of florida has been in 
effect one judge short he stopped hearing criminal cases last 
year and hasnt presided in a civil trial since early summer when 
he was preparing for the inquiry by a special 12member senate 
panel 
a vote by twothirds of the full senate would be needed to 
remove him from his 89500ayear job 
hes ready to return to the bench with vigor hastings said 
or to begin a new job he refused to give any hints about 
i have a plan to stay and a plan to go said hastings 52 
appointed in 1979 by president carter as floridas first black 
federal judge i believe everyone knows that the system will not 
cause me to roll over 
his problems began oct 9 1981 when his friend william a 
borders a washington attorney was arrested in an undercover fbi 
operation of alleged fixing of court cases borders was convicted 
of bribery conspiracy but hastings was acquitted in a separate 
1983 jury trial 
however a subsequent investigation led to hastings impeachment 
last year in the house which accused him of plotting to obtain a 
bribe lying during his trial defense and an unrelated charge of 
disclosing federal wiretap information 
hastings said he thinks he has a good shot of remaining on 
the bench 
however some senators expressed doubts about some of hastings 
actions among those his showing up at a restaurant as borders 
had told an undercover agent hastings would do to signify borders 
influence with him and his efforts to avoid fbi agents in 
washington the night of borders arrest 
hastings said the senate inquiry produced no smoking gun no 
strong new evidence against him 
in fairness to anybody who is a detractor of mine you could 
say there is some persuasive evidence that one could infer that i 
was guilty but persuasive evidence has to be conclusive before you 
pull that switch 
hastings is the only federal official ever impeached after 
acquittal in a trial and his attorneys argued for years that he was 
being subjected to unconstitutional double jeopardy 
you have to know that im the only person in america this has 
happened to he said 
he continues to protest the use of a senate panel instead of 
the full senate to hear his case the panel then sent a report to 
the other senators the senate which says its free to handle its 
business as it sees fit has in recent years used the panel system 
to keep other senate business from being halted by impeachment 
cases 
in recent months hastings has made speeches in 10 states and 
dozens of florida cities explaining his case and urging people to 
write their senators ken klein spokesman for sen bob graham 
dfla said grahams office has answered 1400 letters most in 
hastings support 
it has been difficult hastings said but if it is next 
week or next month when the dust settles i will be standing tall 
with dignity

sunday in the second phase of the trial of an 18yearold already 
convicted of firstdegree murder in the ax slayings of his parents 
and two siblings 
david brom a 16yearold high school sophomore at the time of 
the deaths knew what he was doing and knew it was wrong the jury 
ruled in completing minnesotas twopart trial system for insanity 
pleas 
obviously were very pleased with the verdict we had 
anticipated that the law was in favor of this verdict said 
prosecutor ray schmitz the olmsted county attorney he said he 
would urge the judge to give brom the maximum sentence of 70 years 
in prison on each count 
brom surrounded by sheriffs deputies showed no emotion when 
the verdict was announced one female juror appeared to be trying 
to keep from crying 
sentencing was set for monday 
if judge ancy morse sentences brom to consecutive sentences on 
the convictions brom will have no possibility of parole until the 
year 2059 however if she judge orders sentences on the four 
murder counts to run concurrently brom would be eligible for 
parole in 17 years 
defense attorney terrence walters said he was not surprised by 
the verdict but said that after 21 hours of deliberation over 
three days i felt i had a fighting chance 
an appeal is automatic in firstdegree murder convictions 
brom was described as a gentle boy who wrote poetry but also 
liked hardcore rock music with violent overtones

the murders

conflicting testimony from several psychiatrists concerning broms 
sanity at the time of the killings 
all the psychiatrists agreed that brom suffered from a major 
mental illness but only one of five psychiatrists testified that 
brom met minnesotas legal standard of insanity

the white house budget chief said sunday it 
might be best if congress leaves in place automatic spending cuts 
that take effect monday night rather than follow the past practice 
of rolling them back 
the 16 billion cut formally known as a sequestration is 
automatic under the 1985 grammrudman act that was designed to 
force the president and congress to reduce the federal deficit 
this year congress and the administration failed to find a 
compromise 
i think it may be that sequester is the best available 
alternative at least it is real said richard darman director 
of the white house office of management and budget 
the automatic budget cuts of grammrudman took effect in 1986 
and 1987 as well but congress acted quickly to restore the lost 
funds a process that darman called phony 
this time if it goes into effect i think it would be good if 
people would live with it and say dont restore the cuts 
darman said on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley 
the chairman of the house budget committee rep leon panetta 
dcalif said he thought congress and president bush could agree 
on a formula similar to a senate package passed last friday that 
met the grammrudman targets 
the failure to meet those targets said panetta was linked to 
the sharp drop in stock prices friday 
i think there is a relationship because i think that for the 
last eight to 10 years weve been essentially on a debt binge in 
this country panetta said on the nbctv program meet the 
press 
the federal debt has reached 31 trillion and corporate and 
personal debt also have soared he said 
in washington weve reached a point where we simply dont 
have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough 
choices he said 
an author of the grammrudman law sen phil gramm rtexas 
rebutted criticism by some members of congress that the bill had 
led the government to engage in deceptive accounting practices and 
had exacerbated the deficit 
the bottom line is under grammrudman weve cut the deficit 
in half weve cut the rate of growth in federal spending in half 
and the federal government has gotten smaller relative to the 
private sector of the economy he said 
has the congress cheated and has the president in the best 
spirit of bipartisanship worked with congress to cheat the answer 
is yes said gramm but are we better off with grammrudman 
than we would be without it i think the answer is clearly yes

leaders in the beijing communist party voted 
sunday to purge the party of hostile and antiparty elements 
and wealthy private businessmen whom they called exploiters 
the decision reported by the official xinhua news agency 
indicated that the harsh crackdown triggered by student protests in 
june is not winding down after nearly five months but rather will 
be intensified 
also sunday an official report said lawmakers have proposed 
banning hong kong residents from antigovernment activities after 
the colony reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
xinhua said the beijing party committee which has led the 
nation in hardline rhetoric approved a resolution to purify the 
party organizations by requiring all members in the city to 
reregister during the coming year 
only those who meet party qualifications will be retained it 
said 
a drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how party 
members especially officials with a party membership behaved in 
ending the national turmoil and quelling the antigovernment 
rioting it said referring to prodemocracy protests that the 
army crushed in june 
the overwhelming majority of the party members will be united 
and educated and a very small number of hostile and antiparty 
elements will be resolutely purged from the party it said 
it did not say how many of beijings 10 million residents are 
party members or how many are expected to survive the examination 
so far only a few expulsions from the party have been announced 
including that of yan jiaqi a political scientist who fled to the 
west in june and is working to organize an opposition from overseas 
former party general secretary zhao ziyang ousted for allegedly 
supporting the student protests has been allowed to keep his party 
membership but some top officials are believed to be pressing for 
his expulsion he already has lost all his party posts 
leading targets of the party purge include private businessmen 
whom the resolution referred to as exploiters 
the resolution stipulated that exploiters cannot be admitted 
into the party and those who have already been party members must 
adhere to the partys ideals it said 
besides getting their own due pay they should spend their 
posttax profits on production and public welfare and should not 
use them for their own private needs if they fail to do so they 
can no longer be party members it said 
private businessmen were commonly described as exploiters 
during the first three decades of communist rule but after senior 
leader deng xiaoping began reforming the centralized economy a 
decade ago they were embraced as partners in chinas 
modernization at least one millionaire has been admitted to the 
party 
since the june crackdown on the student movement however 
hardline policies have made a comeback in all areas the slogan of 
dengs early reforms to get rich is glorious has been 
dropped and party leaders have begun criticizing private 
businessmen for becoming wealthy 
some cities have put limits on how much selfemployed 
businessmen can pay themselves and tax officials have been ordered 
to make sure private businessmen pay what they owe 
many private clothing sellers and bar owners in beijing have 
said they want to sell their businesses 
the resolution also said the party will examine officials at all 
levels and make any changes it considers necessary 
political integrity will be emphasized in choosing and 
appointing officials in the future it said 
the beijing party committee has heard a series of hardline 
speeches in the past few days from its head li ximing including a 
call thursday for direct party decisionmaking in universities and 
at the most local level of government 
the hong kong proposal the latest in a series of statements by 
the government about its future rule there was likely to add to 
fears that have caused tens of thousands of residents to flee the 
british colony 
the legislators members of the standing committee of chinas 
national peoples congress also reiterated the government position 
that china will have the right to station troops in hong kong and 
declare a state of emergency there

widespread shortages are sitting at rail stations and food 
shipments are rotting for lack of people and equipment to move the 
cargo soviet media reported sunday 
strikes and sheer mismanagement were blamed for the transport 
jam which has exacerbated shortages and threatened to derail 
perestroika soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
premier nikolai ryzhkov warned on national television sunday 
night that if things do not improve shortly well have to take 
tough measures against leaders of all ranks 
more than 2 million tons of cargo are piled up in soviet ports

thousands of containers of consumer goods and food purchased by the 
government on an emergency basis to appease a public angered by 
empty store shelves 
ryzhkov said the unloaded cargo included 25000 tons of imported 
food and that some of it was spoiling 
the news agency tass reported that 1700 trains were stalled for 
lack of coal even though the countrys first nationwide coal 
strike ended two months ago as of wednesday 100000 railcars were 
out of circulation tass said quoting railroad minister nikolai 
konarev 
in the critical harvest season key rail depots are clogged with 
180 cars of meat rotting in the leningrad depots alone media said 
incoming trains are waiting for unloading and outgoing cargo is 
piled up for lack of empty containers and railcars 
the work of the leningrad rail center is effectively 
paralyzed the daily sovietskaya rossiya reported thursday all 
the approaches to stations for dozens of kilometers around the 
city all the cargo yards and sorting stations are packed with 
unloaded freight cars 
the leningrad traffic jam began when byelorussian farms began 
shipping potatoes faster than the citys vegetable warehouses could 
take them in the paper said rail authorities finally managed to 
deal with the glut of potatoes but now refrigerated cars oil 
tankers autotransport wagons and flatbed cars for containers are 
backing up 
the soviet union has long had difficulty transporting its 
harvest to storage and shops tass reported this week that 29 
million tons of grain one million tons of meat and 25 percent of 
vegetables are lost each year between field and table 
this year the annual difficulties are exacerbated by strikes in 
the caucasus and moldavia regions spawned by ethnic conflicts 
trains have not run for 18 days in moldavia in a language dispute 
said tass quoting valentin tetenov a legislator who heads the 
supreme soviet transportation committee 
rail traffic to yerevan the capital of armenia was halted from 
sept 5 to sept 17 and sporadically since then in an economic 
blockade mounted by azerbaijanis as part of the lengthy dispute 
over rights to the nagornokarabakh enclave 
rail officials apparently continued to load trains and send them 
to armenia even though they knew the line was closed because at 
one point 400 trains were reported stuck on the tracks to yerevan 
moscows smolensk cargo depot was piled high with containers 
sunday afternoon including some shipped from west germany nearly 
five weeks ago and one sent from hungary in june the lone worker 
on the scene said factories were not sending trucks to pick up 
their shipments 
who knows why he shrugged 
in the vladimir region 300 containers are stacked in the rail 
depot because so many trucks have broken down for lack of spare 
parts the critical parts are somewhere in the mountain of cargo 
the news program vremya said saturday 
the ukraine has closed one sugar beet processing plant and may 
have to close 30 more at the height of the harvest because the 
warehouses are full and there are no railcars to haul the sugar 
the labor newspaper trud reported sunday sugar is rationed in the 
soviet union primarily because it is used for making moonshine 
trud quoted the head of the ukrainian council of trade unions 
v sologub as saying 280000 tons of cargo has piled up at the 
port in odessa and factory workers are being drafted into 
stevedore duty

an iraqi politician sunday was hounded from the 
podium by cries of war criminal at the first international 
conference in nearly 70 years on the kurdish people whose ancient 
middle east homeland straddles four countries 
the twoday conference focused attention on human rights abuses 
suffered by the kurds an ethnic minority of about 20 million 
people spread across iraq iran turkey and syria 
held under the auspices of franceliberty a human rights 
foundation set up by first lady danielle mitterrand the conference 
drew 300 participants from 36 countries including us sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee and lord eric avebury chairman of the british 
parliamentary human rights group 
innocent women and children have suffered and been tortured 
yelena bonner wife of soviet physicist and nobel peace prize 
winner andrei sakharov said saturday in remarks at the start of 
the conference 
but she added if we conducted a poll in moscow only one in 
100 people would know of the problems of the people in kurdistan 
conference organizers hoped the meeting would raise 
international awareness 
they passed resolutions asking for a factfinding mission to be 
sent from the west to examine human rights abuses in kurdish areas 
they also called on the un general assembly to hold a special 
session to examine the kurdish question 
among the worst abuses noted by conference participants was last 
years chemicalweapons offensive launched by iraq against kurdish 
strongholds in the northern part of the country 
thousands of people died including many women and children and 
up to 100000 others fled to iran and turkey according to the us 
state department 
kurdish leaders accuse iraqi president saddam hussein of 
genocide and many of those at the conference threatened to walk out 
when bahaddin ahmet president of the kurdish parliament of iraq 
tried to take the podium 
kurdish leaders in iraq accused members of the kurdish 
parliament set up by the iraqi government in 1974 of being 
collaborators 
a war criminal is speaking here cried jalal talabani 
leader of the resistance group peoples united kurdistan party of 
iraq 
talabani seized the podium and the iraqi delegation withdrew 
the resistance group accuses iraq of destroying nearly 4000 
kurdish villages and relocating 220000 kurdish families to other 
parts of iraq during a 15year effort to arabize oilrich parts 
of the country 
the situation in iraq kurdish spokesmen say is the most 
dramatic example of the plight of the kurds 
descended from the ancient medes who occupied the area that is 
now iran most kurds are sunni moslems who speak their own language 
the 200000 square miles they occupy and call kurdistan has 
over the centuries been ruled by arabs mongols and turks of the 
ottoman empire 
when the ottoman empire was defeated at the end of world war i 
the allied powers dismembered it and granted the kurds autonomy 
under the 1920 treaty of sevres the portion of the treaty giving 
autonomy to the group was never carried out and kurdish nationalist 
aspirations were subjugated by colonial interests 
about 10 million kurds live in turkey 55 million in iran 35 
million in iraq and about a million in syria kurds number 650000 
in western europe 320000 in the soviet union and 100000 in 
lebanon about 3000 live in the united states

an attempt to quietly remove a nearly 
centuryold stone monument honoring white supremacists has sparked 
racial tensions and threatens federal funds for a construction 
project officials said 
city officials said the 20foot obelisk must be removed because 
of road construction and because of commercial development of the 
area near the monument 
theyre lying in their teeth said wayne ponthieux of boh 
brothers construction co inc foreman of the crew doing the 
street work i can work all around that monument that monument 
does not have to be touched 
none of the street work comes closer than 15 feet he said 
streets director betty jo everett who said that the move was 
forced by road work said later last week that electrical and 
traffic engineers told her the obelisk might be damaged by the work 
the monument also could block the view of traffic signals that 
will be installed after the road work is done she said 
it would be a safety hazard in the way that we have redesigned 
the intersection said everett when uses change over the 
years you have to make decisions for the safety of the public 
both pedestrians and drivers 
erected in 1891 the monument bears the names of 16 people all 
members of the white league who died in a brief bloody battle in 
1874 between the white supremacist group and the reconstruction 
government 
an inscription added in 1932 says united states troops took 
over the state government and reinstated the usurpers but the 
national election in november 1876 recognized white supremacy and 
gave us our state 
its the second time in eight years that an official in this 
predominantly black city has tried to remove the pointed pillar 
officially called the liberty place monument 
everett said she gave the order to remove the monument without 
consulting mayor sidney barthelemy who is running for reelection 
in february 1990 barthelemy has not publicly commented on the 
situation 
while the road work continues the order to remove the obelisk 
was put on hold until officials decide where it should go and 
whether moving it would violate federal law 
glenn montecino an aide to lawmaker and former ku klux klan 
leader david duke said moving the obelisk could mean the 
construction project will lose federal funds since it could be a 
candidate for the national register of historic places 
although the monument isnt yet on the national register 
federal rules require preservation officials be consulted before 
work starts at a site that might qualify for the register said 
leslie p tassin louisianas historic preservation officer 
in the 1970s blacks demanded removal of the monument which had 
long been and continues to be a rallying point for white 
supremacists their demands were rejected but a plaque repudiating 
the references to white supremacy was added in 1974 
former mayor dutch morial the citys first black mayor 
advertised in 1981 for a firm to remove the monument from the 
center of a tiny traffic circle the city council said the obelisk 
had to stay but agreed to let the 1932 inscriptions be removed 
they were filled in whitewashed over and covered up but the 
covers since have been removed leaving bolts sticking out from 
partly erased inscriptions the 1974 plaque also is nowhere to be 
seen 
morials move like everetts order sparked challenges from the 
national association for the advancement of white people founded 
by duke 
duke former imperial wizard of the knights of the ku klux klan 
founded the naawp after repudiating the klan he was elected last 
february to the state legislature 
the naawp held a small protest at the monument saturday in which 
about 20 people showed up the group said it would be satisfied if 
the city assured it the monument would be erected somewhere within 
the 10 blocks covered by the battle of liberty said naawp member 
callie opry

a team of federal inspectors arrived 
sunday to investigate a fire that gutted much of a parked delta 
airlines boeing 727 and burned a gaping hole in its fuselage 
five crew members and one passenger were treated for smoke 
inhalation and released after saturdays fire at a boarding gate at 
salt lake international airport 
the investigation assisted by representatives of delta and 
boeing should take three or four days said bob johnson regional 
director for the national transportation safety board in denver 
he said early indications were that the fire broke out in an 
area of the belly of the fuselage below and behind the cockpit 
where the planes computer and aviation electronics are housed 
the top of the planes forward fuselage was scarred by a gaping 
black hole roughly 4 feet wide and 15 feet long that appeared to 
nearly sever the front third of the plane 
johnson and delta officials praised the crew of flight 1558 for 
their cool quick evacuation of the plane and the firefighters who 
surrounded the aircraft within minutes of the first alarm 
nine passengers and six crew members were on board when smoke 
following a loud pop began billowing from a vent in the 
firstclass section 
were all fortunate with how the circumstances came about 
fred rollins deltas district director of marketing said sunday 
the crew was there and ready they acted very rapidly they were 
very very efficient there was no panic no pushing or 
screaming or anything 
the plane just in from los angeles had been scheduled to 
depart salt lake city for edmonton alberta with 86 passengers 
passengers were put on another delta flight to edmonton 
johnson said the airports fire units responded with 
exceptional speed he credited a groundcrew member and the 
airport control tower for rushing firefighters to the scene 
my understanding is that there was a mechanic on the outside 
of the airplane and he first observed the fire and he was equipped 
with a radio so he was able to assist in the initial notification 
quickly johnson said 
control tower personnel noticed the smoke about the same time 
he added 
firefighters extinguished the flames within 15 minutes 
authorities said 
while the ntsb team triesto nail down the cause of the fire 
delta officials will determine whether the 30 million airplane can 
eventually be returned to service 
its too early to determine if its reparable that depends on 
the analysis by structural engineers and further investigation 
rollins said 
he had no dollar estimate for damages 
rollins said he did not know the planes age but deltas fleet 
has an average age of 84 years

up smith said they slept everywhere last night in their 
cars they were all over the place 
mike dalton spill unit supervisor of the ohio environmental 
protection agency said epa and plant officials did not immediately 
know how much ammonia escaped or how much was in the system 
once the plant has made the repairs then theyll recharge and 
determine how much they lost dalton said

the plant and did not reach streams he said

underground leaders of the arab uprising on 
sunday rejected a us plan to arrange talks between israelis and 
palestinians and prime minister yitzhak shamir opposed the idea of 
holding such talks in cairo 
shamir said he preferred lowerlevel talks than those proposed 
by the united states and that they should be held in israel 
security forces killed a palestinian and wounded three others 
during protests in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and arab 
reports said a palestinian accused of collaborating with israel was 
killed by masked activists 
the latest deaths brought to 595 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli soldiers and civilians during the 22monthold 
uprising another 130 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
as suspected collaborators forty israelis also have died in the 
violence 
a us plan formulated by secretary of state james a baker iii 
is designed to bring about a meeting in cairo urged by egyptian 
president hosni mubarak as a way to bridge differences between 
israel and the plo 
the underground palestinian leadership in its 47th leaflet 
since the start of the rebellion in december 1987 said it 
rejects americas suspicious role primarily james bakers five 
points 
bakers plan calls for consultations between the israeli and 
egyptian foreign ministers to agree on the makeup of a palestinian 
delegation for the proposed cairo meeting 
mubarak urged the meeting as a way to revive israels stalled 
peace initiative which calls for elections among palestinians in 
the west bank and gaza to pick delegates to negotiate with israel 
on interim selfrule 
the leaflet from the uprisings plobacked leadership said 
bakers ideas merely supported shamirs election plan and were a 
way to avoid the international peace conference that the plo wants 
the uprising leaders already have rejected the shamir plan 
in an interview with the independent daily maariv shamir said 
he saw no reason to meet in cairo 
why go to cairo when the two sides israeli and palestinian 
are here shamir asked 
he said the meeting should be in israel and that it should 
merely be a gathering of technocrats to iron out details of his 
election plan 
shamir aide avi pazner later said the prime minister did not 
mean that such talks could only be held in israel but was just 
raising different possibilites 
but he said shamir does wants to lower the profile of the 
contacts 
you cannot conduct highlevel meetings in the limelight 
because it is difficult to get results pazner said 
also sunday a military court sentenced a reserve soldier to two 
years in prison for causing the death of two palestinians in may 
1988 the army said 
army raido said ilan orev 25 was chasing stonethrowers in the 
west bank village of bani naim when he knelt took aim and fired 
two bullets into the heads of two rioters in violation of orders 
not to open fire 
late sunday 3yearold attiyah elghurani of the shati refugee 
camp died of a gunshot injury he suffered on thursday the army 
said 
officials at shifa hospital in gaza said the boys skull had 
been shattered by a rubbercoated metal pellet fired by israeli 
soldiers 
the army said at the time that its troops had not opened fire in 
the area but that it was checking further an army spokesman said 
sunday that no new details were available

tens of thousands of abortionrights 
supporters buoyed by recent legal and political victories marched 
through downtown san francisco to a rally in front of city hall on 
sunday 
across the continent in trenton nj several thousand 
demonstrators chanted waved banners and marched on the statehouse 
to tell lawmakers not to tamper with their right to a safe and 
legal abortion 
the san francisco marchers about threefourths of them women 
carried signs proclaiming the right to choose abortion and in some 
cases denouncing president bush for his antiabortion stand 
a lot of the younger generation felt the right was safe but 
now its threatened said alice wallace 70 of san francisco 
who wore a retain choice sign on her back i think the 
politicians will be hearing it 
police estimated the crowd at 30000 march coordinator jessica 
braverman said the turnout was 45000 to 60000 no antiabortion 
demonstrators were seen along the route 
after parading past friendly onlookers along more than a mile of 
market street the citys main boulevard marchers gathered in 
front of city hall for a rally and speeches by politicians 
some of the loudest cheers were for norma mccorvey the texas 
woman who was jane roe in the 1973 supreme court ruling 
legalizing abortion 
the march organized by californias national organization for 
women chapter and the bay area prochoice coalition came on the 
heels of several developments favorable to the abortionrights 
cause around the nation 
last week congress for the first time since 1981 voted to fund 
medicaid abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest 
despite a veto threat by bush earlier in the week the florida 
legislature rejected attempts by gov bob martinez to tighten 
restrictions on abortion 
the florida supreme court and a california court of appeal have 
blocked enforcement this month of state laws that would require 
parental consent for minors abortions and democratic candidates 
for governor in virginia and new jersey have used their 
abortionrights stands to gain on their republican opponents 
according to opinion polls 
also on sunday vermont gov madeleine m kunin in washington 
unveiled an unusual plea to the supreme court from 10 governors 
urging the justices to reject efforts to restrict abortions 
a number of san francisco marchers said a recent supreme court 
ruling giving states more authority to restrict abortion had 
galvanized prochoice sentiment 
people didnt think their right to choose was threatened now 
with the webster supreme court ruling theyre aware of the 
threat said lita krowech of oakland whose tshirt read us 
out of my uterus 
several signs called for us approval of ru486 the french 
abortioninducing pill 
the new jersey gathering sunday drew about 6500 state police 
estimated rally organizers said 10000 people participated 
demonstrators filled the street in front of the statehouse and 
drew national womens rights leaders who said the nation is 
watching the new jersey governors race they told the crowd that 
lawmakers will begin chipping away at abortion rights unless 
prochoice voices are heard in every state 
you will set the standard for the 1990s you will prove to 
candidates across the country if youre out of touch you could 
be out of office said kate michelman executive director of the 
national abortion rights action league 
antiabortion forces staged a small demonstration about a block 
away on saturday 116 people were arrested in chicago and 69 in 
boston during antiabortion demonstrations outside clinics

nowdefunct communist party on sunday nominated justice minister 
kalman kulcsar to run for president officials said 
the patriotic peoples front made up of union youth womens 
and other groups also elected the 61yearold kulcsar as chairman

forefront of democratic reform in hungary 
the presidential election tentatively set for nov 25 would be 
the countrys first free national balloting in 41 years

its a smokefilled nightclub crowded with 
small tables covered with checkered tableclothes when the 
diminutive woody allen appears with his beloved clarinet in hand 
its not a scene from his next movie but a weekly jazz jam 
session featuring the oscarwinning filmmaker 
for the past 18 years allen has appeared regularly on monday 
nights at michaels pub in manhattan to play such new orleans tunes 
as in the shade of the old apple tree 
allen says he is grateful for the influence music has had on his 
life 
its the best life i can think of if youre a really talented 
musician because communication in music is so emotional in every 
way allen said in the oct 23 issue of time magazine 
playing and practicing the clarinet is something of an 
obsession he says 
there have been times when i would film all day long and 
wouldnt get to my hotel room until 1030 at night allen said 
so i would get into bed and pull the quilt up over my head so i 
wouldnt offend the neighbors 
allen missed the 1978 academy awards in which he won an oscar 
for the movie annie hall so he could make his weekly gig

galveston island a barrier coast off the texas coast was 
struck by the deadliest hurricane on record in september 1900 
the powerful storm sent a wall of water washing over the island 
and some called it the worst natural disaster in us history 
the death toll from that storm isnt certain but experts 
generally agree it easily topped 6000 some accounts placed the 
number of people killed at 8000 
the storm caused damage estimated at 30 million and 40 million 
fifteen years later in august another hurricane hit galveston 
the official death toll was estimated at 275 much lower than the 
great 1900 storm 
thats because stormwary residents had raised the grade of the 
island and built a seawall to protect them from surging tides 
blamed for most of the deaths still damage from the 1915 storm 
was set at 50 million

during this season of the martha graham dance 
company short dances by some of the company members are being 
shown even on those programs most of the evening has dances 
created by miss graham who is 95 
the more interesting of the martha and new 
choreographers programs this past week at the city center had 
steve rooks dancing his own solo a love duet choreographed by 
jacqulyn buglisi and maxine sherman doing her own abstract solo 
rooks solo outside has a text from the gospel of matthew 
printed in the program so the audience knew what he was driving at 
rooks also conveyed it clearly in his dance there was not only 
weeping and gnashing of teeth but fear flight which he managed 
to suggest by flinging himself in circles instead of running 
supplication as humble as a dogs begging and despair it was a 
tour de force 
joyce herring and donlin foreman danced sospiri which was 
totally a beautiful love duet it included at different times a 
spiritual sense and graphic embraces 
program notes for maxine shermans watermark say that the 
mystery and virtue of fidelity will unfold miss sherman was more 
abstract than that her green chiffon and long hair unfolded but we 
received no message 
in the earlier program thea nerissa barnes danced excerpts from

thousands of people braved wilting heat sunday 
to see ferdinand marcos laid temporarily to rest in a service 
that was part religious ceremony and part political rally 
enrique fernando the last philippine supreme court chief 
justice during marcos rule collapsed during an emotional speech 
by the ousted philippine presidents son ferdinand jr or bong 
bong 
dr azucena ignacio marcos personal physician rushed from the 
raised platform holding marcos coffin and attended to fernando 
before an ambulance whisked him to st francis medical center he 
was listed in stable condition 
marcos died at the same hospital sept 28 at age 72 after a long 
illness 
initial ambulance reports said the 74yearold fernando who 
reportedly has a slight heart ailment had succumbed to the heat 
exacerbated by the crush of people the temperature at the cemetery 
was about 83 degrees with 72 percent humidity the national weather 
service said 
more than 2500 people waited hours for marcos widow imelda 
to arrive at the valley of the temples memorial park with her 
husbands body 
the funeral procession began shortly after 1115 am when more 
than a dozen men rolled marcos casket up a long winding hillside 
drive with hundreds of mourners walking behind 
they were preceded by supporters carrying the presidential seal 
of the philippines and us and philippine flags 
when the pallbearers reached the stairs leading to the small 
airconditioned mausoleum which had the initials fm landscaped 
into shrubs below elderly retired philippine generals were 
replaced by younger men 
once up the stairs the closed coffin covered with a philippine 
flag was surrounded by white flowers on a porch overlooking the 
mourners below 
mrs marcos dressed all in black was joined on the platform by 
her son daughter irene araneta and adopted daughter aimee 
marcos 
there were prayers and a blessing by monsignor domingo nebres 
the philippine priest who drew the wrath of the honolulu catholic 
diocese for comparing marcos to jesus christ during a funeral mass 
friday 
ms araneta sang her fathers favorite long song and mrs marcos 
sang ave maria and the lords prayer 
elevenyearold aimee marcos read a saying daddy i will 
always love you forever thank you for your legacy of love 
the service took a more political turn after pop star imelda 
papin mrs marcos partner in a recent commercial recording duet 
sang a rousing rendition of the philippine national anthem with 
many in the crowd singing along 
bongbong marcos widely reported to have political aspirations 
himself stirred the crowd with a eulogy to his father whom he 
called a man of unbridled excellence 
mrs marcos has vowed to eventually bury her husband in the 
philippines and said entombing him above ground in the mausoleum 
would make it easier to return his remains to his homeland 
philippine president corazon aquino who replaced marcos after a 
1986 popular revolt ended his 20year dictatorial rule and sent him 
into exile here has prohibited marcos return even in death 
the marcoses were subsequently indicted on us criminal 
racketeering charges accusing of them of looting their homelands

japanese investors monday were visibly calmer about 
the stock market than they were after black monday two years ago 
a retail brokerage office of the giant nomura securities co in 
the central ginza district was somewhat busier than a usual monday 
morning but the market players seemed to be waiting for bargains 
rather than unloading their shares in a panic 
i expect the nikkei index to remain bearish all day but i am 
not so worried because we all know it is due to external factors 
said an investor watching the key index shortly after the market 
opening 
i am going to sit and wait for a while and start buying shares 
later on as shares start hitting the bottom he said 
in october 1987 after a plunge on wall street that went down in 
history as black monday brokerages in tokyo were packed with 
massive sell orders that led to the black tuesday here 
the nikkei average fell 3836 points or about 15 percent on 
oct 20 1987 following a 23 percent plunge on wall street 
largely due to panic selling by private investors 
japanese private investors seemed to have learned the lesson 
that fluctuation of the wall street index is only one of many 
aspects of the tokyo market said a dealer at nikko securities 
co speaking on condition of anonymity it is undoubtedly an 
important elmement but not necessarily as dominant as it was 
thought to be 
keiishi nishida a dealer at the tokyo office of kidder peabody 
securities co said this is nothing like the crash two years 
ago when private investors rushed to the brokers from early in the 
morning and sold all they had i dont think any investors expect 
tokyo shares to drop like new york this time 
but he added that investors remained hesitant to place buy 
orders because they want to make sure that the new york plunge 
was only a onetime thing and the dow jones will not go down 
further monday there 
nishida also attributed tokyos moderate recovery in late 
morning to programmed trading 
after the sizable drop buy orders from institutional 
investors on programtrading came in he said but other than 
that i dont expect much of buy orders today 
another investor in the ginza office commented in a trading 
day like today you must deal with caution

bankers at their annual convention said sunday 
the friday the 13th stock plunge may be a blessing in disguise if 
it instills a new sense of caution about highly leveraged corporate 
buyouts 
i dont think its going to be any disaster its just going 
to cause people to become more cautious as they should have been 
from the beginning said donald t senterfitt vice chairman of 
sun trust bank inc in orlando fla 
it was a snag in bank financing for an employee buyout of united 
airlines that triggered the stock market drop worry among traders 
that banks had become more wary of buyouts caused stocks of 
companies targeted for takeover to tumble and the weakness spread 
generally through the market 
in the last 90 minutes of trading the dow jones industrial 
average plummeted 190 points in the worst drop since the october 
1987 crash 
but senterfitt and other bankers attending cocktail receptions 
and seminars at the american bankers association the industrys 
largest trade group were making no apologies sunday 
what we were seeing was a house of cards bound to come 
tumbling down i hope the united airlines thing marks a more 
conservative approach by banking throughout senterfitt said 
in a leveraged buyout or lbo investors often managers 
seeking to thwart a hostile takeover borrow heavily in order to 
take over a company or a division of a company 
the new owners either cut costs or sell off parts of the company 
to pay back the loans the danger is that the restructured 
companys debt burden is so heavy it will topple into bankruptcy in 
an economic downturn 
large banks as profits in their traditional business of 
commercial lending grew scarce have turned increasingly to 
leveraged buyout financing as a source of lucrative fees 
in fact according to analysts some large banks are as heavily 
involved in lbo lending as they are in third world debt if all of 
the lbo lending went sour at once a number of large banks would be 
insolvent 
as of june 30 according to robert litan of the brookings 
institution five large banks had made leveraged loans exceeding 
their equity bank of boston 103 percent bank of new york 127 
percent continental bank 123 percent manufacturers hanover 107 
percent and wells fargo 119 percent 
aggregate lbo exposures including related equity investments 
exceed equity for most moneycenter banks analyst james j 
mcdermott jr of keefe bruyette and woods warned the senate banking 
committee earlier this month 
regulators have noted the trend both the federal reserve which 
oversees bank holding companies and the office of the comptroller 
of the currency an arm of the treasury department which regulates 
nationallychartered banks formally warned banks last fall to 
exercise caution in lbos and ordered government examiners to 
closely scrutinize such lending 
thats starting to have an effect according to thomas p 
rideout outgoing aba president and vice chairman of first union 
national bank charlotte nc 
it appears to me that regulators have a very good handle on 
the bank exposure to lbos that kind of publicity would make a 
credit committee more cautious he said 
rideout said its only natural that banks with signs of a 
softening economy emerging would apply tougher lending standards 
when youve had an expansion as long as this one you always 
think as a banker or businessman when am i going to have to 
tighten my belt and hunker down a bit he said this would be 
the wrong time to invest in an airline or any other industry if 
you think you have doubts about their bottom line 
robert dugger the banking associations chief economist said 
to a degree it is the buyout deals themselves that have changed 
not bankers attitudes 
what you saw in the events of last week was a transaction that 
just didnt meet the flinch test it required more faith in the 
future than bankers are accustomed to affording he said 
it doesnt mean bankers have become more conservative it 
reflects the fact that the leveraging in these deals has had to get 
progressively deeper in order to remain profitable dugger said 
banking analyst alex sheshunoff of austin texas who was 
attending the convention said i think the stock drop is a 
healthy end to a phenomena that longer term could be detrimental to 
both the companies involved the economy and the country 
i think its important that the lbo thing is slowing down now 
rather than reaching the proportions that it could have

union workers at boeing cos helicopter division 
on sunday approved an indefinite contract extension at their 
pennsylvania plant avoiding a strike that has hit boeing plants 
elsewhere 
no negotiations were scheduled in the nearly 2weekold strike 
by machinists but contract talks were set to begin monday between 
boeing and its secondlargest union representing engineers and 
technical workers 
members of united aerospace workers local 1069 which represents 
about 3200 hourly production and maintenance workers at boeing 
helicopters suburban philadelphia plant met sunday after a 10day 
contract extension expired at midnight 
company spokesman robert torgerson said the workers agreed to 
another extension with a 10day notification requirement to cancel 
for either side 
were just continuing to talk torgerson said the major 
issues are wages and benefits 
neither local 1069 president anthony forte nor art andrews 
chairman of the local 1069 strike committee were available sunday 
to comment according to a person answering the unions telephone 
neither side has released details in the contract dispute 
the contract at the helicopter plant expired oct 4 but both 
sides agreed to hold off any strike or lockout for at least 10 
days with the contract remaining in effect through the period 
boeing helicopter has a total of about 6500 employees the 
plants operations have not been affected by the machinists union 
strike elsewhere at boeing because the hourly workers are 
represented by a different union 
boeing helicopter builds army ch47d chinook helicopters and is 
a partner with bell helicopter textron inc to develop the v22 
osprey tiltrotor plane for the defense department it also 
produces components for boeing commercial jet transports 
the machinists unions 57800 members at boeing walked out oct

worlds largest commercial jet builder about 43300 strikers are 
in the seattle area 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland 
ore and lesser numbers at a halfdozen other locations 
dan mahoney general counsel of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association said negotiators for that union 
and boeing probably would meet monday and tuesday then hold 
sporadic sessions as needed over the next three weeks 
their contract expires dec 1 but no one expects a strike by 
the unaffiliated group which represents nearly 28000 engineers 
scientists manual writers draftsmen and other technical workers

the head of the nations largest stock mutual 
fund said redemption requests have been running very light 
since fridays market scare partly because investors are in for the 
long haul and arent necessarily spooked by even a large decline 
following last weeks 216point decline in the dow jones 
industrial average most of which hit during the last hour of 
trading friday some market observers voiced fears that mutual 
funds would be hit with massive redemptions by clients wanting to 
get out of the market 
that could force fund managers to dump stocks in order to raise 
enough cash to pay their clients thereby exacerbating the market 
turmoil 
but money market guru peter lynch who heads fidelity 
investments 125 billion magellan fund said sunday that the 
real fast aggressive people left before the close on friday this 
weekend redemptions have been very light 
lynch admits that over the past six weeks he has increased 
magellans cash position by 350 million to 850 million but it 
was not because he feared his funds shareholders would start 
cashing out rather he said in a telephone interview from his 
boston home i havent been finding that many stocks that are 
undervalued 
investors generally view stock funds as longterm investments 
and arent likely to rush out and redeem that quickly said 
erick kanter vice president of the investment company institute a 
washingtonbased trade association of mutual funds 
stock funds account for roughly 25 percent of total mutual fund 
assets of 242 billion most stock funds keep about 10 percent of 
their total assets in cash 
a gallup survey of 150 fidelity customers late friday and early 
saturday found that 84 percent said they had invested for the long 
term while 4 percent said they intended to sell their fund shares 
in the next few weeks 
kanter said that even following black monday oct 19 1987 
when the dow plummeted 508 points only 2 percent of total stock 
fund assets actually were redeemed 
those who did redeem wound up losing a lot because stock funds 
rebounded very quickly kanter said even magellan posted a gain 
at the close of 1987 although it was a 1 percent increase rather 
than the 41 percent gain that the fund had been tracking before 
black monday 
still lynch said magellan has had redemptions up until 
august the public has been very nervous since 87 and has been 
cutting back pretty steadily 
lynch said he believed the overall stock market likely would 
have a net gain for the full year making 1989 the recordsetting 
eighth consecutive advancing year 
the reason weve had eight straight years is because we had 16 
years of nothing he said the market went sideways or down for 
16 years 
the previous longest advance began in 1896 and lasted for six 
years lynch said

israels stock exchange one of the few foreign 
markets to trade on the weekend after the wall street plunge 
witnessed frantic trading and a 69 percent drop in share value 
sunday officials said 
although the tel aviv market is small and limited to local 
stocks analysts looked to the exchange for signs of how other 
world markets would react among a handful of small foreign markets 
to trade over the weekend taiwan lost ground but south korea 
posted a small gain 
what is happening here is a reaction to the news coming from 
new york on friday said yossi nitzani director of the stock 
exchange there are large amounts of selling in almost all areas 
of the market 
the feeling here is that something very significant happened 
in new york nitzani said capital markets dont like 
uncertainty so the first reaction was to get out and wait for 
things to become clearer 
trading was three times its usual volume with stocks declining 
in paper value by 400 million nitzani said in an interview it 
was the sharpest fall since october 1987 when israeli share values 
were off 85 percent in reaction to the new york crash 
sundays fall in the dollarlinked bond market was less 
dramatic down 2 percent 
no us stocks are traded in israel and no israeli stocks are 
sold on wall street but the us market has strong influence in 
israel because the two economies are closely intertwined 
the tel aviv exchange is open from sunday to thursday and closed 
friday and saturday for the jewish sabbath 
simcha sadan an economist at tel aviv university said on 
israel television there could be a spillover into israel because of 
extensive economic ties between israel and the united states its 
major ally and source of nearly 3 billion in annual aid 
if the american economy gets sick then we will certainly get 
pneumonia he said 
the director of one of tel avivs largest trading houses 
predicted further drops after london and tokyo openend 
i am afraid it is not finished he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity london will probably fall when it opens 
monday and that will influence people here as well as in new york

vending machines have come a long way from 
bubblegum machines and coffee soda and candy dispensers now a 
machine will sell you hot personalsize pizzas or a fresh cup of 
cappuccino or espresso coffee 
these and other innovations along with coinless debit card 
machines were introduced over the weekend at the annual 
convention of the national automatic merchandising association 
the trade show drew thousands of representatives of the 209 
billion vending machine industry association spokesman david stone 
said sunday 
the upscale coffee machines manufactured by the italian 
corporation borghi spa crush a small amount of coffee beans for 
each cup blast steam through the grounds and dispense a strong 
tasty brew in a tiny cup 
were looking for the upscale higherend consumers who 
appreciate a better european cup of coffee and ethnic groups who 
dont like american coffee because they find it too diluted said 
erick feitshans director of us operations for borghi 
we use a filter that dechlorinates and purifies the 
water said feitshans who noted there is an industry trend 
toward using filtered water so we dont use dirt water out of 
city plumbing systems 
the machines also make hot chocolate and regular americanstyle 
coffee for consumers with more conventional tastes 
coffee costs from 80 cents to 120 with cappuccino the 
costliest 
pennsylvania businessman gw black and his son brett offered 
a 7inch cheese and pepperoni pizza that takes 60 seconds to make 
in their pizza chef a microwavepizza oven they hope the 2 tab 
for a pie will be within the budget of college students looking for 
a latenight snack 
its a little bigger than a pan pizza at pizza hut and its a 
buck cheaper black said its not doughy and its not super 
crispy i think we did a good job for a microwave pizza 
bert de vos owner of de vos international a vending machine 
company in the netherlands displayed his deepfrozen machine 
that sells a consumer a frozen dinner and has a builtin microwave 
oven to heat it up 
to make it easier for customers to pay for these items vendors 
are moving toward introducing debit card systems especially on 
college campuses stone said 
customers can feed bills such as 10 into a machine which 
produces a magneticstrip credit card when the card is inserted 
into a vending machine to buy an item like a 50cent candy bar the 
purchase price is automatically deducted leaving 950 on the card 
students at the university of kentucky are already using the 
debit cards for the campus cafeteria vending machines and even 
washing machines said bruce vernon customer service manager for 
debitek based in chattanooga tenn which makes one of the debit 
card models 
and its much easier for the vending industry he said it 
takes all the coin mechanisms out of the machine which cuts the 
maintenance costs for collecting money and unjamming slots 
it the technology is here already but it looks like this 
is the year its going to take off vernon said

japanese investment in american real estate and 
businesses does not threaten the national security or economic 
health of the united states experts told a conference in tokyo 
last week 
but strong public resentment over highly publicized japanese 
purchases of american companies like sony corps recent 34 
billion takeover of columbia pictures indicates japan should do 
more to reassure americans of its good intentions they said 
foreign investment is good for both economies as president 
john f kennedy once said a rising tide lifts all the boats 
said elliot richardson a former us secretary of both commerce 
and defense 
aside from helping cover the us trade and federal budget 
deficits japanese investment can aid technology transfers and help 
revitalize us industries through the sharing by japanese 
companies of management and production techniques with american 
partners speakers at the conference said 
they acknowledged however that the perception of japanese 
investment among many americans was strongly negative and could get 
worse 
americans grew up in an era when the us was the source not 
the recipient of foreign investment they feel we are losing 
control of our economic destiny said richardson who heads the 
washingtonbased association for international investment a 
conference sponsor 
the american sponsors and their japanese counterpart the 
council for better corporate citizenship said they held the 
conference to help the japanese understand why their investments in 
america can be controversial even while the us government 
welcomes them 
in a recent gallup poll reported in newsweek magazine 52 
percent of the people polled said they viewed japanese economic 
might as a greater threat than soviet military power 
japanese investment in the united states has come under fire 
largely because of its rapid growth twice as fast as that of 
other nations in highly visible areas us ambassador to japan 
michael armacost told the conference 
japans total investment in american real estate corporations 
and subsidiaries skyrocketed from 47 billion in 1980 to 534 
billion in 1988 
of a total 65 billion in foreign direct investment in 1988 
japan accounted for 142 billion just behind britains 215 
billion economists estimate japanese investment will reach 21 
billion this year 
highly publicized lawsuits against japanese firms accusing them 
of racial and sexual discrimination along with problems in 
balancing american and japanese management styles and staff in us 
offices have contributed to the backlash against japanese 
investment speakers said 
alice young a partner in the new yorkbased law firm milbank 
tweed hadley and mccloy urged japanese investors to keep a low 
profile in making investments to avoid plastering japan inc 
all over everything to seek expert advice to avoid lawsuits 
over largely avoidable problems and to hire and promote the best 
american talent to positions of responsibility 
armacost noted that 85 percent of all chief executive officers 
in japanese overseas subsidiaries are japanese while only 20 
percent of the ceo positions in overseas subsidiaries in japan are 
filled by expatriates 
until companies are perceived as creating the best environment 
for american workers you wont get the best ms young said 
japanese investors can also allay american anxiety over their 
economic activities by getting more deeply involved in community 
activities in the united states speakers said 
a japanese corporation in america needs to be more responsible 
to community concerns than it would be at home said richardson 
singling out the hitachi foundations program of matching grants to 
community projects 
while there is substantial room for improvement in the way 
japanese firms operate in the united states there is no evidence 
to support charges that japan is buying america on the cheap 
said jonathon e colby a partner in blackstone financial services 
inc 
japanese companies buy only highquality assets at a fair 
price colby said 
japanese companies operating subsidiaries in the united states 
are reinvesting their profits from american operations rather than 
sending them home said samuel m rosenblatt president of the 
association for international investment 
the rate of return from us affiliates from 1981 to 1988 was 
only 33 percent for japaneseowned firms compared with 56 
percent for all foreignowned firms in the united states 
indicating that japanese are investing in america for the long 
term he said 
officials of the departments of commerce and defense said there 
were no signs that japanese investment was threatening us 
national security 
robert l mullen deputy undersecretary of defense said that in 
cases in which a joint venture would involve the sole us company 
with a strategic product or technology the defense department 
makes arrangements to ensure the deal will not compromise national 
security
