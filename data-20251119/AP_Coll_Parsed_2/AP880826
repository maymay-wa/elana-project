representatives of 2200 striking 
registered nurses reached a tentative agreement with six private 
hospitals friday for pay raises of 21 percent the california 
nurses association said 
the tentative pact was reached after the hospitals negotiating 
board accepted a proposal from the cna said larry arnold 
spokesman for affiliated hospitals which is handling negotiations 
for the medical centers 
the nurses will return to work by wednesday if the contract is 
approved eileen maloney a spokeswoman for mayor art agnos said 
they went on strike aug 2 
if approved the pact would end a citywide labor conflict that 
at one point involved 4000 nurses and hospital employees at eight 
medical facilities the labor dispute involved two unions and three 
separate strikes 
nurses at the private hospitals last week turned down an offer 
of a 20 percent increase over three years by a 21 margin the 
nurses were seeking 21 percent over two years 
under the tentative pact nurses would receive an 8 percent pay 
raise the first year of the contract compared with the 75 percent 
firstyear raise in the previous offer said nurses spokeswoman 
karen bardoni 
the 8 percent the first year is very important in bringing 
affiliated up to the standards of other area hospitals bardoni 
said 
the increase would be over a 34month period 
the tentative agreement also carries improved language on 
staffing levels and higher weekend differential pay 
a ratification vote was set for sunday 
union officials are endorsing the proposal and predicted 
approval bardoni said they also had recommended approval of the 
earlier offer 
some 1700members of local 250 of the hospital and health care 
workers union began returning to work this week after reaching 
agreement with seven hospitals on a twoyear pact that will restore 
fringe benefits and shortterm sick leave under the pact some 
workers will get raises of up to 6 percent over the life of the 
pact and others will get bonuses of up to 300 at the end of two 
years the union had gone on strike july 26

president corazon aquino approved 
legal measures friday to block the return of ferdinand marcos who 
has asked a court to grant him permission to come home and face an 
accuser 
at a meeting with key legal advisers she authorized 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez to file a motion with the 
anticorruption court to reject marcos petition to come home when 
a former cabinet minister gives a deposition against him in 
november 
chavez said that if the lower tribunal upholds marcos request 
the government will appeal to the supreme court to keep the former 
president from coming home from hawaii where he fled after a 
february 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and 
propelled mrs aquino to power 
in a petition filed wednesday with the anticorruption court 
marcos asked permission to return so he could defend himself when 
baltazar aquino the former public works minister gives a 
deposition on alleged kickbacks by japanese firms during the marcos 
administration 
the former minister is not related to the president 
the antigraft court said last week that marcos had the right to 
be present and crossexamine aquino if the testimony was to be used 
in criminal proceedings 
the anticorruption court stopped short of ordering marcos to 
return however and chavez indicated the government will use all 
legal means to prevent marcos from coming to the philippines 
in hawaii marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad withheld comment on 
the governments plans because we are confused by all the 
reports on the proceedings 
aquino presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said the 
government was trying to reconcile the demands of the judiciary 
and the demands of national security 
mrs aquino cited national security as the main reason for 
preventing marcos from coming back from his exile in hawaii 
but she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts 
even if they order marcos home 
promarcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible 
for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the 
aquino government key leaders of those coup attempts remain at 
large 
philippine law bans trials in absentia and the government has 
delayed filing charges against marcos for fear he would demand the 
right to return 
the government claims marcos embezzled up to 10 billion during 
his administration efforts to recover the money have foundered in 
large part because of the reluctance to file criminal charges

federal agents searched half a dozen 
state capitol offices belonging to lawmakers or their aides as part 
of an apparent corruption probe the fbi and a state senator said 
thursday 
sen joseph montoya the democratic chairman of the senate 
business and professions committee and assemblyman pat nolan the 
republican floor leader of that chamber confirmed that their 
offices were among those searched by the fbi but both denied 
involvement in any improper activities 
the fbi refused to reveal the names of the lawmakers or even the 
subject of the investigation but a capitol source who spoke on 
the condition that he not be identified said all of the parties 
named in the search warrants were involved in the passage of a bill 
involving investment banking regulations 
a senate aide who received one of the search warrants chief 
sergeant at arms tony beard said the warrants specified documents 
related to a vetoed bill involving investment banking law 
at least one office was searched for more than three hours 
sources said 
what i can tell you is that anything i have received in the 
way of contributions or honoraria is always done as prescribed by 
law said montoya who confirmed that federal agents searched his 
office 
montoya also confirmed that agents were seeking information on 
the investment banking law bill 
i guess they wanted to check things out he said adding 
that agents were seeking information about two measures that passed 
through his committee 
the fbi executed warrants wednesday on the offices of six 
legislators and legislative assistants said terry knowles 
special agent in charge of the sacramento fbi office the 
searches were in connection with an ongoing investigation and 
were conducted late wednesday he added 
a capitol employee said a team of about 30 federal investigators 
from the fbi and us attorneys office served search warrants on 
the lawmakers offices 
all i know is some agents came in last night and served some 
warrants there were no arrests no obvious scene i cant tell you 
who was served the source said 
my office and the offices of several members from both parties 
were searched last night by the fbi it is not clear to me yet what 
the object of the investigation is but i am confident that when 
the investigation is completed my office will be completely 
cleared nolan said in a written statement

the owner of a bronx social club where a fire 
killed six patrons was arrested thursday and charged with 
manslaughter and assault for maintaining the basement club in a 
reckless manner police said 
domingo reyes 37 of the bronx was arrested at a pay phone in 
manhattan after police traced a 45minute call he made from a phone 
booth to a precinct house said police spokesman sgt maurice 
howard 
he was charged with six counts of seconddegree manslaughter and 
some 40 counts of assault for every person that was in the club 
last sunday at the time of the fire he said 
the section of the penal law that hes charged with it covers 
death caused in a reckless manner said howard he maintained 
the club in such a way it was reckless and thats where his 
responsibility to the deaths comes in he said 
howard said police had been searching for reyes since the fire 
at the bronx club known as the hole 
he had an impending sense that they were looking for him 
howard said in explaining why reyes may have called police 
when reyes saw the unmarked cars pull up to the phone booth and 
detectives getting out he ran and there was a brief foot chase 
before he was captured said howard 
dozens of club patrons were injured in the fire many severely 
burned eighteen firefighters also were hurt none seriously 
officials said the club was operated illegally because it served 
liquor without a license and didnt have enough exits to comply 
with building codes 
although arson was initially suspected the fire was later ruled 
to have been accidental

bernie grant was branded a public enemy three 
years ago for defending black youths involved in a north london 
riot in which a policeman was hacked to death 
today far from being hounded out of public life 44yearold 
grant is a member of parliament and perhaps the most influential 
black politician in britain 
when grant diane abbott and paul boateng won seats for the 
opposition labor party in the june 1987 election to become the 
first blacks ever to enter the house of commons many hailed it as 
a breakthrough for britains 24 million blacks 
those who feared that grants flamboyant radicalism would prove 
disruptive have been confounded with his greying beard 
gaptoothed smile and melodious caribbean accent grant has emerged 
as a charming conversationalist and a dedicated parliamentarian 
i suppose some people must have expected me to act in a 
certain way and they were probably surprised he said in an 
interview but i havent adjusted my approach to politics in any 
way 
that approach holds that the 4percent black minority are at 
the bottom of the pile and becoming a powder keg in the inner 
cities 
i wouldnt be surprised if there were another disturbance 
tomorrow he said its there and its going to happen because 
the government isnt paying any attention to it 
weve got our backs to the wall and were fighting against a 
very racist government that discriminates against black people 
the problem i think black people are facing now isnt the 
overt racism that to a large extent happened in the 60s but 
its the unconscious racism the racism of the people that make 
policy that will affect a large amount of black people adversely 
grant emigrated from his native guyana a former british colony 
on south americas northeast coast to britain in 1963 here he 
became the first black ever to head a municipal council leading 
the north london borough of haringey for three years 
he burst into national prominence in 1985 when an impoverished 
housing project in the tottenham area of haringey erupted in riots 
and the policeman was hacked to death the first ever to die in 
british racerelated unrest 
grant accused the predominantly white police force of sparking 
the violence and in his most controversial utterance said the 
blacks felt they had given the police a bloody good hiding 
thrashing 
he insisted he was not seeking to justify the killing but simply 
explaining how other blacks felt about it 
the effect was incendiary 
the rightwing tabloid press called him barmy bernie home 
secretary douglas hurd branded him a high priest of race 
conflict and nearly 1000 haringey borough workers staged a 
oneday strike demanding his resignation his white girlfriend 
councilor sharon lawrence received death threats 
ive never denied it he says now ive never regretted 
it ive never withdrawn what i said my position at the time was 
to put forward the views of the young people 
it defused the situation a lot of the newspapers turned on 
me i was quite clear in what i was doing 
in the 1987 election he carried tottenham where 37 percent of 
the electorate are black or asian with a sharply reduced labor 
majority 
in his maiden speech to parliament grant said that unless young 
blacks were offered better prospects they will find other means 
of expressing their frustration 
he claims police still harass black youths using unnecessary 
force and planting evidence 
when he first arrived in parliament grant said he underwent an 
initiation ceremony in which seven or eight legislators from the 
governing conservative party gathered around him in the smoking 
room and sort of baited me with racial innuendo 
they were deliberately trying to create an incident but it 
didnt work he said i was quite cool 
when a doorman tried to eject him from the public gallery even 
though he knew who i was grant threatened to withdraw from the 
daily business of parliament until the speaker examined his 
complaint the doorman apologized 
grant has confronted parliament with issues ranging from alleged 
harassment of blacks in the armed forces to prime minister margaret 
thatchers handsoff policy toward south africa 
but he said he has problems with the labor party too 
he charges that its hierarchical system keeps black politicians 
out of the limelight and ignores his expertise in local government 
and race relations 
nonetheless grant said im quite happy despite all the 
faults of the place parliament to be there its relatively easy 
compared to the pressure i was under when i was leader of haringey 
council to some extent the spotlight has been dimmed

an 800pound lovesick boar named 
walter whos been hogging too much of his owners attention lately 
has been put up for sale but so far there have been few offers for 
the pining swine 
a guy wanted to know if i would deliver him to nova scotia 
said owner david dewees who is asking about 300 for walter 
there really havent been any serious offers 
the trouble with walter is that hes doubled in size since a 
friend gave him to dewees about 6 months ago and is desperately 
in need of female companionship according to the classified 
advertisement dewees ran this week in the cape cod times 
hes just rooting up the fences and is constantly looking 
around and you can just tell by the noises hes making that hes 
desperately looking for females dewees said 
walter eats like well a pig putting away close to five 
gallons of garbage a day dewees said 
i feed him mostly garbage and of course the green stuff from 
the garden thats left over and he loves it all he said 
neighbors bring their children to watch walter at the trough 
its a huge awful sight to see him eat dewees said 
a cabinetmaker and construction worker who used to raise pigs 
dewees says he wont have enough time this winter to look after 
walter whose currently living at a nearby farm along with four 
sheep and two horses 
walter a blend of hampshire and poland china is about 5 feet 
long and has chewed through the planks of his pen with his 4inch 
tusks 
dewees said selling his porcine pet for meat isnt likely to 
bring home the bacon because mature boar meat generally isnt good 
for anything more than catfood 
however walter isnt naturally boorish even though he has made 
mistaken advances to the back of a pickup truck and was turned down 
for the local fair because there wasnt a pen strong enough to hold 
him dewees said 
hes really a very gentle fellow he never has been aggressive 
as far as meanness is concerned he really needs companionship

maybe in detroit they let the mayor cook for 
himself and feast on his own sausageandsauerkraut maybe in 
pittsburgh they think that because the mayor is also a jewish 
grandmother she can subsist on her own chicken soup 
not in new york where a food trend is big news and mayor edward 
i kochs appetite and battle of the waistline are wellknown 
in new york the mayor gets a chef and the chef can cause his 
own scandal 
because of an indiscretion in an administration that has seen 
some major corruption koch is looking for a new cook to share 
gracie mansion the sprawling riverview estate the city provides 
him on the ritzy upper east side 
in what could be known as the cheesecake caper or garlicgate 
chef michael london resigned when investigators determined he had 
improperly used city workers and facilities in his private catering 
and baking business 
while authorities decided not to prosecute koch ordered the 
cook known for his salmon with garlic his chocolate chip cookies 
and his cheesecakes to quit or drop his outside work 
london elected to leave the mayors employ giving kochs staff 
a task few other us mayors ever have to deal with finding a new 
livein chef 
few other cities even provide their mayors with a home never 
mind a cook to live in it that leaves most of them with a 
coffeemaker in the office and maybe a takeout menu in a desk drawer 
we do things a little differently here in the west said 
bonnie bartak spokeswoman for mayor terry goddard of phoenix 
ariz who is a bachelor like koch but cooks for himself and lives 
in a bungalow he owns 
even our governor rose mofford is probably home fixing 
herself a bologna sandwich like the rest of us ms bartak said 
los angeles furnishes mayor tom bradley with a place to live 
but on the rare occasion he dines there bradley and his wife must 
fend for themselves said deputy mayor mike gage 
nevertheless he didnt want to help new york find a chef for 
koch 
la has some wonderful chefs but were not inclined to 
export them we enjoy them here gage said 
up the coast san franciscos mayor art agnos has to provide his 
own house and is struggling to make the payments said spokesman 
scott shafer does he get a chef at least 
his wife wishes he did said shafer 
doesnt cook for himself eh 
ive never seen him near a stove 
it gets worse in small towns apparently mayor paul warwick in 
the small coastal georgia town of brunswick said he gets the 
following 
no chef no house no car 
he does however get a gasoline expense account in addition to 
his 125aweek salary 
kochs salary is exactly 20 times higher at 130000 a year 
some mayors seem to manage quite well without a chef practicing 
the culinary arts themselves 
detroit mayor coleman young is a connoisseur of chili said 
spokesman bob berg hes also got a sausage and sauerkraut dish 
that he puts together 
and in pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff a jewish grandmother 
is known to make a good pot of chicken soup and a great batch of 
cookies 
but in new york the tradition of hiring someone to cook for the 
mayor seems well entrenched 
officials at city hall and the city archives couldnt say which 
mayor was the first to have a cityprovided chef but all agreed 
that several men who served before koch assumed office in 1978 
enjoyed the perquisite 
koch spokesman lee jones said the chefs position which pays 
51000 a year saves the city money because of the banquets koch 
holds and the entertaining he does as chief executive of the 
nations largest city 
besides they say the cheesecake is really tasty

jerry gray chief of the aps nairobi bureau 
traveled to rwanda to cover the latest episode in the decadeslong 
feud between the hutu and tutsi tribes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rwanda and burundi are like twins in the 
womb of africa 
the tiny nations landlocked in the center of the continent are 
a mirror image of each other with common histories and languages 
and ethnic likenesses 
cloaked by clouds that crown hills and mountain peaks and the 
smoke from thousands of cooking fires rwanda and burundi are two 
of africas most beautiful and poorest countries 
they also are among the most obscure 
during the past quarter century they have shared one of the 
worlds worst ethnic disputes the unrest between the majority hutu 
and the tutsi minority that has claimed hundreds of thousands of 
lives 
the bloodletting that runs through the histories of both 
countries like the meandering akanyaru river that marks their 
common border began anew aug 14 
hutu tribesmen in two northern burundi communes set upon their 
tutsi neighbors hacking them to death with machetes and burning 
them alive in huts refugees and burundi officials say 
the tutsidominated army was sent north as peacemaker but the 
soldiers turned executioners after discovering the carnage 
inflicted on their tribesmen 
how the most recent bloodbath began is unclear but 
historically it has taken little to set either side off on a 
murderous rampage 
gravediggers have confirmed at least 5000 people killed but 
hundreds of burundians mostly hutu who fled into rwanda to escape 
the armys onslaught insist that more people were left behind dead 
than the 40000 who crossed the akanyaru river to refuge in rwanda 
in the beginning there were many bodies floating along the 
river said alexander munyakayanza one of the officials in 
charge of three camps of refugees who have settled on the hillside 
overlooking the marshy plain that leads to their former homes 
the refugees in both camps and six similar camps are mostly 
hutus and they say their former homesteads are now killing grounds 
the burundi government denies armyled massacres but refugees 
are arriving in rwanda with knife slashes burns and bullet and 
shrapnel wounds 
tribal problems exist in virtually every african country but 
modern weapons the centuriesold feud and a pressure on land 
unlike anywhere else in africa have led to frequent genocidal 
orgies in rwanda and burundi 
belgium ruled rwanda and burundi as one territory known as 
rwandaurundi under a league of nations and later united nations 
trusteeship from 1917 until 1962 when both countries were given 
their independence from 1899 until the end of world war i in 1917 
the area was part of german east africa 
major ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century 
when the tutsi tall and elegant nilotic people migrated from 
ethiopia and imposed feudal rule on the short stocky bantu people 
they found living in communes on the bluegreen mountains and 
hillsides 
today the tutsi govern burundi while the hutu control rwanda 
the hutu are the majority in both countries making up 84 
percent of the population and the tutsi the minority at 15 
percent 
nowadays competition for space on the rolling landscape is at 
the root of much of the ethnic animosity most of the people in 
both countries are farmers 
rwanda is africas most densely populated state with 61 
million people crammed into an area about the size of maryland 
burundi is roughly the same size as its northern neighbor and has 5 
million people 
when independence came to rwanda the hutu assumed political 
power through the sheer weight of numbers their coming to power 
was aided by a 1959 hutu uprising in which 20000 to 100000 of the 
thenruling tutsi were slaughtered and 200000 more fled into 
burundi 
the tutsi held on to power in burundi even after independence 
and have kept the hutu subservient with guns and intimidation 
in 1972 hutu in burundi tried to overthrow the government 
beginning with a massacre of hundreds of tutsi the rebellion was 
crushed and the government in reprisals killed between 100000 
and 300000 hutu including most of the tribes intelligentsia 
according to human rights groups 
the tutsi live in mortal fear knowing they are in the 
minority said an american missionary who lived and worked in 
burundi from 1960 to 1970 and spoke on condition of anonymity 
they fear that some hutu leader is going to rally the people 
around him and they know that will be the tutsis death knell

correspondent sein win 66 has reported for the 
ap from rangoon since 1968 as a reporter and newspaper editor he 
was imprisoned in 1960 by burmese governments and on july 29 was 
picked up again and released thursday after being held for 28 days 
here is his first person account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i was arrested on the night of july 29 
with burma in the grip of authoritarian rule when i left prison 
thursday i entered a new country 
as i emerged from jail i witnessed an incredible thing for the 
first time in a quarter century people thousands and thousands 
of them were chanting crying for democracy and there were no 
secret police no soldiers with bayonets fixed and with fingers on 
the triggers to stop the demonstrators 
i was picked up along with nine others including dissident aung 
gyi who had earlier this year sent a series of letters to strongman 
ne win pointing to political economic and human rights problems in 
the country and urging reform 
we had been accused of something akin to treason although no 
evidence was ever produced against me 
during imprisonment in a special solitary cell measuring 16 feet 
by 14 feet i was never told of the tumultuous events sweeping 
burma the ouster of president sein lwin after 17 days in power 
killings of unarmed demonstrators mass uprisings demanding the 
return of democracy which had once briefly flickered 
after the authorities barged into my house at 10 pm and hauled 
me off my family sent a telex to the ap bureau in bangkok daddy 
has been taken away it said he wont be able to answer your 
queries 
when ne win retired and was replaced as head of the ruling party 
by sein lwin last month one of the first acts of the new 
leadership was to order our arrest challenged openly by the aung 
gyi letters which were reprinted and sold like hot cakes the 
government had apparently decided to crack down quickly 
we were taken to insein prison eight miles north of rangoon 
interrogated separately and charged under a new law of attacking 
the state comparable to high treason 
the cells were furnished with a table chair bed mattress 
blanket and mosquito net a bath with running water was attached 
food was good there was a cup of milk and an egg in the 
morning another cup of milk in the afternoon the two main meals 
included meat and soup 
except for loneliness the thirst for news from the outside and 
uncertainty over my future life was not so bad i had more than 
enough time for buddhist meditation 
i found out later that my house was searched for four hours but 
nothing incriminating had been found my answers to the 
interrogators were simple my frequent visits to aung gyi were to 
gather news he also was an old friend 
jail was not new to me as editor of the englishlanguage the 
guardian newspaper i tried to do my part in fostering a free 
press in the country and was jailed for nearly a month in 1960 
under the official secrets and emergency provision acts 
i was let out on bail and the government withdrew the charges 
after a years trial 
after ne win seized power in a 1962 coup thousands of real or 
imagined opponents were arrested i was among them spending three 
years under protective custody without interrogation or trial 
the lastest incarceration was far shorter than i expected that 
perhaps can be accounted for by the rapidly changing events in the 
country after 26 years of seemingly passive acceptance of 
authoritarian rule hundreds of thousands in rangoon mandalay 
prome pegu moulmein and elsewhere announced boldly that they had 
had enough 
i saw them when they opened the prison doors thursday i got 
caught in crowd of demonstrators delaying my return home i could 
hardly belive my eyes 
returning home reunited with my wife and children who for the 
28 days had received no word of my whereabouts or condition i did 
what i have been doing for most of my adult life i sat down at the 
telex and filed a story

elizabeth bridge into central belfast is a reminder of how quickly 
the balance can shift in the treacherous ebb and flow of the 
northern ireland conflict 
the wreath commemorates lt alan shields a naval recruiting 
officer who was blown up by a bomb while driving into belfast 
monday the 26th british military man to die in an irish republican 
army attack this year 
beyond the bridge workers clear the wreckage left by an ira car 
bomb that exploded in the commercial heart of belfast on tuesday 
the army deaths are a sharp increase from 1987 when the ira 
managed to kill only three soldiers while the bombing is a 
sobering reminder to belfast not to take for granted the peace and 
prosperity that has blossomed in its business and entertainment 
center over six relatively bombfree years 
ira successes usually go in short bloody bursts and no one 
knows how long this one will last 
but it represents at least a temporary change of fortunes for 
the ira in its campaign to rid northern ireland of british rule and 
unite the province with the irish republic 
ever since november when a bomb massacred 12 protestant 
civilians at a war memorial ceremony in enniskillen little had 
gone right for the ira 
blunder after blunder left a trail of 18 innocent dead 
protestants as well as the bluecollar roman catholics whose 
interests the ira claims to represent 
thus the shift to attacks on soldiers with little risk to 
civilians is a morale booster for ira supporters who were feeling 
increasingly embarrassed at seeing the ira repeatedly having to 
excuse its mistakes 
things got so bad that gerry adams president of the outlawed 
iras legal political wing sinn fein had to warn the ira publicly 
to get its house in order 
the attacks on the army have taken place in mainland britain and 
continental europe but the deadliest have been in northern 
ireland where six offduty soldiers were blown up in their van in 
june and eight died in a bus bombed last saturday 
the iras bolstered spirits were reflected in its boast that it 
smuggled tuesdays bomb in central belfast through a massive 
security net and that in future a sophisticated system of 
nondefusible explosives would be used to set off more bombs 
combined with remotecontrol smoke grenades to warn off bystanders 
the ira are on a high at the moment flush with weapons and 
explosives but it cannot be sustained because against a resolute 
government there is no way they can convert their violence into the 
political concessions they demand commented the belfast 
telegraph northern irelands most influential newspaper 
the government responding to anguished protestant appeals for 
tougher antiira measures says it has taken decisions which it 
says are being kept secret but will soon become apparent 
newspapers speculate that these include sending in more troops 
extending legal powers to hold suspects and tightening cooperation 
with the irish police to close the iras refuges south of the 
border 
but as the telegraph itself noted most of the ideas have 
already been tried and for every argument in favor of radical 
change there is another to say that it might make things worse 
some analysts imagine the fighting reaching a stalemate in which 
the british agree to talk about troop withdrawal the ira accepts a 
truce and all parties acknowledge the futility of violence and sit 
down for peace talks 
but paul arthur a political scientist at the university of 
ulster believes prime minister margaret thatcher is too deeply 
committed to fighting terrorism to agree to anything that smacks of 
a deal with the ira 
arthur believes the only way the ira will be defeated is if 
enough catholics are revolted by the bloodshed to expunge the 
gunmen from their midst 
thats why killing soldiers makes the most sense for the ira 
civilian deaths only provoke revulsion while killing local 
policemen and militiamen gets marginal publicity in britain 
compared with the death of a soldier who has been sent in from 
britain 
the struggle at present is shaped mainly by propaganda needs 
the ira aims to turn the british public off northern ireland and 
into a mood to bring the boys back home 
the british people need to ask if there is not another way 
says sinn feins adams they should actively press for their 
government to withdraw 
the british government counters with the charge that the weapons 
and explosives fueling the summer blitz have come from libya 
these supplies says tom king the governments northern ireland 
secretary may have given some people the idea that somehow 
violence can actually win

a colony of more than 2000 bats has 
chased a couple from their home of 15 years and one of them says 
its too scary to move back until theyre sure the winged 
invaders are gone 
after dark each day lorraine and steve disburger watch brown 
bats flutter in and out of the yellow woodframe house they said 
they havent been able to find anyone to help them solve their 
problem largely because they have trouble getting people to 
believe them 
ill never forget the night we left mrs disburger said 
recently i couldnt sleep i was too scared you could hear 
them it was one of those hot nights and it was like the house was 
breathing 
we had the lights on bright she said the bats were right 
in the next room then one lit on steves leg that did it we went 
outside and slept the rest of the night in our camper the next 
morning i begged my motherinlaw to take us in 
that was july 15 and they havent been back to their central 
new york home since except to do laundry and grab a few possessions 
disburger used heavy plastic to seal off the unfinished 
secondfloor room that seems to be the colonys nursery but his 
wife doesnt want to go near the house if she can help it 
its too scary she said 
she said shes been frustrated in trying to get help from pest 
control experts local and state health officials and legislators 
the disburgers have tried ultrasound mothball crystals and 
smoke bombs to get rid of the bats the only weapon that worked was 
a tennis racquet but smashing a bat creates possible exposure to 
rabies and disease carried by the flying mammals 
on thursday stephen frantz a zoologist with the state health 
departments wadsworth center for laboratories and research who 
specializes in rodent and bat diseases visited the disburger home 
judging from what ive heard its certainly a problem 
frantz said before the visit the large number of bats reported 
is unusual but not rare this year there seems to be more people 
with serious problems 
the couple said they noticed more and more bats starting to 
appear at the house about five years ago theyd disappear in the 
winter but would come back in spring she said 
the disburgers tried their best to plug up their old house 
theyd sit in the camper at night and watch the entrances and exits 
used by the bats disburger had ladders ready all around the 
exterior hed run and get some insulation and plug a hole 
the couple said they expect to spend up to 4000 to rid their 
house of the winged varmints that includes scattering the colony 
plugging all the holes and putting on a new roof 
frantz said he was thinking of sealing up most of the holes in 
the house then installing oneway exits in the remaining ones 
when the bats leave at night to feed he said they wont be able 
to get return

birth defects such as lung abnormalities 
cardiovascular problems and chromosome disorders continue to rank 
as the nations fifth leading causes of premature loss of life 
federal health researchers say 
the national centers for disease control which tabulates 
years of potential life lost nationwide to determine the role 
of various conditions in premature mortality reported thursday 
that in 1986 birth defects robbed their victims of 651523 years 
of life they would have lived before age 65 
that ranked fifth among all causes of premature lifeyears lost 
the atlantabased agency said ranking first was unintentional 
injury resulting in about 24 million lost lifeyears followed by 
cancers heart disease and suicide and homicide 
birth defects have ranked fifth in all previous studies of 
premature mortality published as far back as 1984 said researcher 
david erickson 
as infant mortality due to other causes has been reduced with 
advances in prenatal care and medical treatment congenital 
anomalies birth defects have become the leading cause of infant 
mortality the cdc said in its weekly report 
in detailed statistics from 1985 the latest year for which such 
data are available the leading category of premature mortality 
from birth defects was lung abnormality either impartial 
development or abnormal growth of the lungs those conditions 
accounted for more than 9 percent of the lifeyears lost to birth 
defects the cdc said 
ranking behind lung abnormalities as a cause of premature loss 
of life were conditions where infants were born with incomplete 
brains or with arrested development of the left side of the heart 
further six of the 15 leading birth defects in the cdcs 
premature mortality analysis were defects of the cardiovascular 
system three chromosome defects including downs syndrome were 
also included in the top 15 
the cdc uses age 65 as a statistical benchmark in its premature 
mortality studies most average american life expectancies are 
somewhat higher

from the mississippi delta a strong evocative evening of 
theater by endesha ida mae holland at offbroadways theater four 
the presentation by the negro ensemble company has nine

white meter reader tells a gullible old black woman that if anybody 
steps on her groundlevel meter her water bill will skyrocket the 
old woman has a pile of bricks and a notoriously bad aim so 
children and drunks enjoy the challenge

connecticuts top roman catholic cleric 
has ended his longtime affiliation with the democratic party and 
reregistered as a republican because of the democrats stances on 
birth control and abortion rights 
archbishop john f whealon of hartford announced his decision to 
quit the democratic party in his weekly column in the catholic 
transcript the archdiocesan weekly newspaper appearing friday 
whealon didnt say in his column that he had registered as a 
republican but he made the switch last week according to 
officials in the office of the west hartford registrar of voters 
whealon complained the democratic platform drafted during the 
recent national convention is in favor of contraception and 
abortion financed by the government 
he said the republican party platform expressed support for the 
family and opposed abortion 
in 1860 the democratic party was on the wrong side on the 
moral question of slavery it is on the wrong side of the more 
serious moral question of abortion therefore reluctantly i am 
unable in conscience to remain a registered democrat feeling 
abandoned i hope that the democratic party regains its moral 
principles and soul the archbishop wrote 
whealon had been registered as a democrat in connecticut since 
1969 
i had no idea what his political affiliation was and i dont 
know that anyone else did either democratic state chairman john 
droney said thursday 
were glad to have him aboard said pauline kezer vice 
chairman of the state republican party

the soldiers call it the 
rush hour 
each day at about 4 pm groups of palestinian youths barricade 
streets with burning tires and hurl stones at israeli soldiers 
each time the soldiers give chase through the narrow winding 
streets of the citys outdoor market 
its some sort of a game but it gets serious from time to 
time said capt amnon a reservist who was identified only by 
his first name in keeping with army regulations 
as he spoke a column of black smoke rose from a burning tire 
signaling the start of the daily ritual of disturbances in this 
west bank city of 120000 
the soldiers in amnons company say they are weary and 
frustrated with the lethal game that by army count has left 15 
nablus arabs dead and nearly 150 injured in the past two months 
its like chasing our tail if we go up the hill they go 
down if we go down they go up said lt moshe 
as he and the other soldiers spoke to a reporter on a hillside 
road arab youths sneaked up and pelted stones at the soldiers the 
soldiers dashed down the hill but the youths had vanished 
lt moshe a student in his 20s and pvt shalom a farmer in 
his 30s pulled up in a jeep with a makeshift top of spare tires 
and wire mesh serving as a protection against cement blocks dropped 
from rooftops 
i dont want rocks dropped on my head and i dont want to 
shoot them but if i dont have a choice said shalom his 
sentence ending in a shrug 
soldiers have orders to refrain from firing unless their lives 
are in danger or they are the targets of firebombs 
for all other threats they are supposed to use tear gas rubber 
bullets or plastic bullets 
frankly speaking almost anything can be lifethreatening 
said capt amnon fatigue showing in the dark smudges under his 
eyes 
he said soldiers faced three to four dangerous situations every 
day and it was often a struggle to maintain restraint the threats 
ranged from ball bearings fired from slingshots to stones hurled at 
drivers 
its difficult to tell soldiers they have to stay cool after 
three weeks of this everyone gets mad said amnon a textile 
merchant and veteran of the 198285 lebanon war 
i explain every day to the men that to shoot three or four 
arabs is not going to solve the problem or move us forward one 
bit 
during a daylong tour with soldiers in nablus 37 miles north of 
jerusalem a reporter heard the crackle of gunfire about 20 times 
although most were apparently warning shots 
by army count one arab was wounded in the leg by live 
ammunition two by experimental plastic bullets and two by rubber 
bullets 
at one point the radio on maj elkanas jeep crackled and a 
soldier manning a lookout post asked permission to shoot he 
proposed using a 22 caliber rifle to shoot at the legs of about 
20 protesters erecting barricades on a main thoroughfare 
absolutely not snapped elkana you are not to shoot 
without my authorization 
elkana 32 from a kibbutz near tel aviv said soldiers had to 
show a presence throughout the city because we are the law here 
but he said he did not normally send his men into the mazelike 
network of narrow alleyways that made up the old city as long as 
palestinians did not try to block main roads 
see that fire he said pointing to a burning tire about 100 
yards from the main road im going to let it go if we try to 
put it out they will throw stones and then we have to run after 
them i prefer to choose the time and place 
one hour later squads of 10 to 20 palestinians tried to choke 
off a main street by simultaneously setting up burning barricades 
at both ends 
soldiers called in a bulldozer which charged through one 
makeshift barricade ripping open a water pipe that sprayed the 
smoldering debris 
other soldiers wearing helmets with face shields entered the 
marketplace members of the patrol could be seen frequently looking 
up at rooftops from where palestinians have dropped bricks large 
blocks and even refrigerators 
the orders are to keep the situation under control there is 
no way we can just let them do what they want if we did it would 
be total anarchy just like lebanon said capt amnon

when secretary of state george p shultz comes 
back from vacation after labor day one of the first things he will 
have to do is set priorities from an immense list of foreign policy 
problems 
there simply is not enough time left for shultz and others in 
the reagan administration to take on all the woes of the world 
before ringing the curtain down in january 
but the long list is tempting because so many problems suddenly 
seem ripe for solution and a nudge from the united states could 
make a difference 
in africa the united states is front and center using its 
influence to seek solutions to the twin problems of angola and 
namibia 
it could be argued that only us mediation could have moved the 
cubans and south africans to where they are now holding talks in 
brazzaville that might pay off in independence for namibia and the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
the continuing unrest of the israeliheld west bank beckons for 
us intercession in shultzs absence the state department gave 
the palestinian arabs a lift by hinting they may be entitled to a 
separate seat in peace talks and by admonishing israel for ordering 
25 more deportations from the troubled territory 
shultz is likely to give the mideast one more college try by 
scheduling a fifth visit to the region this year there is little 
evidence though that prospects for success have improved 
jordans king hussein has made official what seemed obvious to 
many for so long he will not assume the responsibility for 
negotiating a solution to the arabisraeli dispute nor with 
national elections looming in november is israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir by any stretch of the imagination prepared to 
guarantee in advance of peace talks that israel would withdraw from 
the west bank 
benny begin a rising star in shamirs likud party and son of 
former prime minister menachem begin reminded reporters during a 
thinktank session this week on the middle east that sept 30 will 
mark the 50th anniversary of munich 
the sudeten in 1938 was a strategic buffer between germany and 
czechoslovakia but it was absorbed by germany setting the stage 
for the nazis to attack czechoslovakia with the argument that the 
rights of 3 million sudeten germans were being violated 
begin drew a parallel to the 15 million palestinian arabs whose 
demands also have attracted important international support the 
fact that an israeli politician finds munich relevant to todays 
middle east illustrates the determination of a sizable segment of 
the israeli population not to give up the west bank 
that resistance of course stands smack in the way of shultzs 
plan for a settlement in which israel would relinquish at least 
part of the territory 
so when he is back in his comfortable office on the seventh 
floor of the state department tanned and rested after a golfing 
vacation shultz must decide how much energy to expend on the 
middle east and if he decides on a lot what other world problems 
should be sidetracked 
tugging at his sleeve too is the ussoviet relationship and 
whether the improvement that resulted from four summit meetings 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
summit meetings could carry over into the negotiations to reduce 
strategic nuclear weapons 
there are a number of problems in verifying some of the more 
elusive variety of these destructive missiles bombers and 
submarines that may defy solution and yet many elements of a 
possible treaty are already in place a big push by shultz who put 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty over the top through 
regular meetings with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
might just carry the day

teachers throughout massachusetts continue to lead 
children in the pledge of allegiance each day on the voluntary 
basis supported by gov michael dukakis 
every elementary school child has an opportunity to say the 
pledge of allegiance to the flag every day education 
commissioner harold raynolds said in an interview thursday 
republican george bush has attempted to make dukakis 1977 veto 
of a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into a 
campaign issue in their presidential contest 
dukakis in vetoing the bill cited advisory legal opinions and 
us supreme court precedents that making the pledge mandatory 
would be unconstitutional he says he supports saying the pledge 
itself 
raynolds said massachusetts schools observe that policy of 
encouraging the pledge on a voluntary basis 
the law is clear that those teachers who do not wish to 
conduct it or those students who do not wish to say it are not 
compelled to do so he said but he added that such exceptions 
are very very very few one or two perhaps in a school in most 
cases 
bush has claimed that dukakis was simply looking for a 
reason to refuse to sign the bill 
dukakis responded this week that he recites the pledge of 
allegiance himself and would urge children to do so 
his 1977 veto was based largely on an advisory opinion from the 
state supreme court 
the court said the bill before dukakis that year to amend a 
1935 law requiring teachers to lead the pledge once a week 
violated the first amendment rights of freedom of speech and 
religion it also said the original law was unconstitutional 
the amendment said each teacher at the commencement of the 
first class of each day in all grades in all public schools shall 
lead the class in a group recitation of the pledge of allegiance 
to the flag 
failure of a teacher over a period of two consecutive weeks to 
salute the flag and recite said pledge or to cause the pupils 
under his charge so to do shall be punished for every such period 
by a fine of not more than 5 
at dukakis request the state supreme court studied the 
amendment and by a 52 vote issued an advisory opinion saying the 
entire law regarding the pledge violated teachers first amendment 
rights 
the court cited a 1943 us supreme court decision west 
virginia board of education vs barnette which held that requiring 
a student under the threat of expulsion to recite the pledge and 
salute the flag violated the students first amendment rights the 
student a member of the jehovahs witnesses had objected on 
religious grounds 
in our view the rationale of the barnette opinion applies as 
well to teachers as it does to students the state court said 
however commendable the legislatures interest may be in 
imbuing young people with patriotic feelings that interest can 
only be implemented through a precise and narrowly drawn provision 
which achieves the basic purpose without compromising first 
amendment rights the justices said 
acting on the courts opinion dukakis wrote to the legislature 
in 1977 my oath of office as does yours requires me to uphold 
the constitution of the united states i cannot sign any bill that 
violates the constitution as this bill has been declared to do 
the legislature overrode dukakis veto by votes of 20127 in 
the house and 247 in the senate the bill became law and remains 
on the books today 
but thenstate attorney general francis x bellotti issued an 
opinion in 1977 saying that because of the constitutional question 
the law may not be enforced 
so it has never been enforced couldnt be enforced current 
attorney general james shannon said thursday 
bush in political speeches over the past week has said he 
doesnt believe the framers of the constitution would have 
considered it a violation of anyones constitutional rights to be 
required to recite the pledge of allegiance i would have signed 
that bill and let the us supreme court resolve the issue he 
says on the campaign trail 
but shannon said the question really was ok do you for 
political purposes make people go through the expense and the 
trouble of having to strike down a clearly unconstitutional law or 
do you go with the highest courts decision he dukakis did the 
right thing 
laurence tribe a constitutional law professor at harvard law 
school said courts in other states have ruled similarly to the 
massachusetts court 
the confusion that i think is created about it is that 
many assume that if teachers have a right to kind of opt out of 
leading the class in the pledge that therefore the pledge of 
allegiance will not be somehow an official part of the school 
day tribe said 
but of course thats not what was at stake it remains an 
official part of the school day it is just a question of whether 
teachers like students have a right for reasons of religious 
conscience to be excused from taking part in it

the controversy over whether dan quayle used 
family influence to secure a spot with the vietnamera national 
guard dogged the republican presidential ticket for a full week 
before finally fading in recent days 
quayle said thursday he had answered questions for seven days 
now and that the public was getting a little bit sick of the 
issue he said it was time to focus on the differences between the 
two tickets 
the guard questions arose immediately after the 41yearold 
indiana senator was named to the republican ticket by bush in his 
inaugural news conference quayle was asked about his decision in 
may 1969 to seek a guard position instead of accepting a draft or 
volunteering for military service in vietnam 
later in the midst of a round of network television interviews 
quayle was asked whether his prominent family pulled strings to get 
him into the guard he joined just six days before he became 
eligible for the draft at the height of the vietnam war his 
answers were not always consistent but last friday his spokesman 
acknowledged that phone calls may have been made on quayles 
behalf and a former family employee acknowledged he had made one 
such call 
thus began a controversy that occupied most of the vice 
presidential candidates first week of candidacy 
millions of young american men sought alternatives to vietnam 
service in the late 1960s but quayles effort raised eyebrows 
because of his prowar stance then and his outspoken advocacy of a 
strong national defense now quayles decision to join the guard in 
preference to service in vietnam didnt sit well with everyone 
even among the higher ranks of the gop 
i must tell you in my generation you knew who was in the 
guard and who was in uniform fighting for their country said 
senate gop leader bob dole in a sunday television interview so 
theyre very sensitive about it they didnt have anybody they 
could call they couldnt influence anyone say i asked my 
parents well my father wore overalls whos he going to 
influence 
quayle has run into scattered hecklers chanting quayles a 
chicken and bearing signs reading sissy rich boy dump 
quayle and war wimp 
national guard officials have repeatedly denied quayle received 
preferential treatment insisting places were available in certain 
units including quayles 
we have found nothing anywhere in our files that would 
indicate any problem said capt cathi kiger a spokeswoman for 
the national guard in indianapolis 
a retired major general in the national guard did acknowledge 
tuesday he told subordinates to hold open a space for quayle after 
retired guard commander and pulliam employee called to 
recommend quayle 
retired maj gen alfred ahner who in 1969 was military support 
plans officer for the state of indiana and later headed the state 
guard said he was contacted by retired maj gen wendell 
phillippi then managing editor of pulliams indianapolis news 
wendell phillippi had called and said he had a good man and 
said he thought hed make a good guardsman ahner said thats 
when i went over to personnel 
they said they had a couple of spaces i said hold one of 
them theres a good guy coming over 
kiger on wednesday cited general order 25 which authorized 
officials to fill the headquarters detachments 138 allotted places 
as of april 1 1969 guard records show no more than 134 men were 
enlisted during april may the month quayle joined and june 
were not waving the flag here but a lot of people are saying 
whats the big deal kiger said 
ahner notwithstanding quayle dismissed the issue monday when he 
spoke at a veterans of foreign wars meeting in chicago saying he 
didnt need his familys help to join the guard 
my indiana national guard unit had openings before i applied 
they had openings when i applied and they had openings after i 
applied so there was absolutely no influence used said the 
maternal grandson of eugene c pulliam who published newspapers in 
arizona and indiana at the time quayle enlisted 
retired col jerome rafferty who was director of personnel in 
1969 said the then22yearold quayle was a solid guard candidate 
but conceded the recommendations of highranking officers carried 
some weight 
if any of the generals called me and said they knew a man 
who would make a good guardsman id prick my ears he said 
because they only sent the highest quality young man thats the 
way the system worked 
but rafferty maintained that despite a certain amount of 
networking among officers the service was fundamentally 
egalitarian 
we recruited on the basis of the needs of the service not 
the individual he said 
the experience of a college dropout sworn in within three days 
of quayle seemed to confirm raffertys claims 
retired sgt stephen w morell was able to complete processing 
in three days while there was a 22day span between quayles 
initial testing and his enlistment morell now an unemployed truck 
driver said he dropped out of college and walked into a local 
recruitment office he enlisted as a clerktypist and served 
sidebyside with quayle

the white house is warning that if congress 
wants to enact new spending programs for the coming fiscal year 
lawmakers will have to find offsetting savings elsewhere or face 
unpopular automatic budget cuts 
the reagan administrations office of management and budget 
projected thursday that the fiscal 1989 federal deficit would come 
in just under the 146 billion target set in the grammrudman 
balanced budget law 
under that legislation if the budget office determines that the 
red ink will exceed 146 billion spending on defense and domestic 
programs must be slashed automatically by whatever amount is 
necessary to shrink the deficit to 136 billion 
in that case congressional overspending will trigger 
acrosstheboard cuts that slash high priority programs every bit 
as much as lower priority programs president reagan warned from 
los angeles where he is vacationing 
omb estimated that including programs enacted through aug 15 
the fiscal 1989 deficit would be 144 billion when figuring in 
programs signed into law over the last few days the amount of red 
ink grew to 1453 billion just 700 million below the 146 
billion budgetcut trigger 
white house budget chief james c miller iii noted that when 
lawmakers return from their summer recess next month they plan to 
consider a collection of popular bills including hunger relief 
antidrug programs welfare reform child care and a minimumwage 
increase that would boost the deficit beyond 146 billion 
miller told reporters that if those bills were enacted 
lawmakers would have to find compensating savings elsewhere or face 
the automatic cuts which are something i dont think anybody in 
their right mind wants 
house budget committee chairman william h gray iii dpa said 
he believed spending would be kept under control 
its clear that congress and the president are going to have 
to walk a fiscal tightrope in the coming weeks but i believe we 
can maintain our balance and avoid crippling acrosstheboard 
cuts gray said in a prepared statement 
lawmakers are considered unlikely to set off the grammrudman 
process of spending cuts and risk the wrath of voters angry because 
their favorite programs have been slashed 
on aug 19 the congressional budget office estimated the 1989 
deficit at 153 billion an amount that would trigger 17 billion 
in cuts that projection which serves only as a guideline for 
lawmakers was based on more pessimistic economic assumptions than 
those used by the administration 
fiscal 1989 begins oct 1 ombs final binding calculation of 
next years projected deficit is due oct 15 
the omb estimates the deficit for the current fiscal year at 
1523 billion

the next administration needs to exert 
stronger white house leadership of us science and technology 
policy according to an appeal issued by organizations representing 
more than 750000 scientists and engineers 
in a letter to presidential candidates george bush and michael 
dukakis the heads of 23 scientific and engineering societies 
called for early appointment of a new white house science and 
technology adviser who will have direct access to the president 
they contended in the letter released thursday that the most 
urgent problems confronting the united states and the world today 
ranging from the destruction of the ozone layer and the greenhouse 
effect to the spread of aids and the restoration of 
competitiveness of us industry depend on the effective 
utilization of the nations science and technology resources 
leadership in science and technology policy must come from the 
white house they said urging the candidates to devote careful 
thought to the white house science and technology advisory 
structure 
we believe that this structure must be strengthened and that 
the person selected to be the principal science and technology 
adviser should have direct access to the president the letter 
said 
it also urged that the appointment of a new science and 
technology adviser be made early enabling the adviser to have a 
voice in filling subcabinet level positions in federal agencies 
which deal with science and technology issues 
spokesmen for the bush and dukakis campaigns said they had no 
immediate comment on the letter 
the letter was released at a news conference during which val 
fitch president of the american physical society said the united 
states was at a competitive disadvantage in the world economy 
because about threequarters of federal research and development 
money goes to military programs 
fitch a nobel prizewinning physicist from princeton 
university called for a return to the halcyon days of the 
eisenhower and kennedy administrations when white house science 
advisers had enjoyed more frequent and direct access to the 
president 
russell c drew president of the institute of electrical and 
electronics engineers said we see the need for a much stronger 
proactive role on the part of government in building partnerships 
within the science and engineering community 
from the engineering standpoint we see an extremely important 
role for a vigorous science and technology adviser to the 
president in bringing these issues to the president being a 
spokesman in the councils of government being an advocate when 
necessary drew said 
howard k schachman president of the federation of american 
societies for experimental biology said we believe that 
solutions to many of the worlds most vexing problems will need to 
be sought through the biological and medical sciences in the next 
decade 
the president must be given the detailed knowledge that will 
allow him to judge the validity and implications of the latest and 
best research said schachman 
william r graham a former nasa official has been serving as 
white house science adviser since june 1986 prior to that the 
post was vacant for a sixmonth period following the resignation of 
george a keyworth ii in december 1985

prospects for a hefty boost in the value of 
us agricultural exports this year have continued to improve but 
the agriculture department says the outlook is not quite so bright 
for 1989 
this fiscal years export value is expected to jump 22 percent 
to a fouryear high of 34 billion up from 279 billion in 
198687 the department said thursday 
shipments were forecast at 146 million metric tons in the year 
that will end sept 30 up 13 percent from last year 
both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous 
usda forecasts on may 26 of 335 billion and 1455 million tons 
although the report cited no figures for subsequent years it 
said export values may increase in 198889 due to higher prices but 
the volume of shipments may decline 
in another report last week the departments economic research 
service said the volume of 1989 wheat exports may drop 12 percent 
from this year corn 4 percent and soybeans 29 percent 
thursdays report said the rise in 1988 estimates since may 
stemmed from largerthanexpected exports of animal products 
slightly larger subsidized wheat exports and higher corn prices 
due to the drought 
noting that 198788 exports are now expected to be up 61 
billion and 168 million tons the report said this largely 
reflects reduced competitor supplies higher prices for grains 
oilseeds and cotton and increased us export competitiveness 
helped by a lowervalued dollar and the export enhancement program 
or eep 
under eep selected countries including the soviet union and 
china can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized 
by the us government 
the new forecast showed the value of grain exports at 122 
billion up from 118 billion expected in may and 198687 
shipments worth 933 billion 
oilseeds mainly soybeans were forecast at 76 billion down 
slightly from 77 billion indicated three months ago but that was 
up from 647 billion last year 
exports of livestock products this year were raised to 47 
billion from the may forecast of 45 billion in 198687 those 
were valued at 396 billion 
other major categories included horticultural products 37 
billion this year the same as indicated in may but up from 315 
billion in 198687 cotton export values were shown at 22 
billion the same as the earlier forecast last years cotton 
shipments were worth 143 billion

world cigarette production climbed 29 percent 
last year to 512 trillion cigarettes or pieces says an 
agriculture department analysis 
china accounting for 28 percent of the world cigarette 
production continues to be the driving force behind this 
increase the report said thursday chinas output in 1987 
increased 10 percent to 14 trillion pieces registering 
doubledigit growth for the fourth consecutive year 
not including china world output remained nearly unchanged at 
143 trillion cigarettes although us production rose 6 percent 
to 6894 billion pieces 
other countries posting gains of 3 billion or more cigarettes in 
1987 included the soviet union poland spain philippines mexico 
hong kong bulgaria and south korea 
increased production in the united states hong kong and 
bulgaria went towards expanded exports the report said 
production increases in the remaining countries were generally in 
response to increased domestic consumption 
but some countries showed significant production cuts last year 
japan led the way as cigarette output declined 10 percent to 2664 
billion pieces the report said 
this reduction was a result of a dramatic increase in imports 
that reduced the market share of domestically produced 
cigarettes the report said 
other countries showing reduced production in 1987 included 
india brazil west germany romania italy france syria and 
yugoslavia

the national association of wheat growers says 
a plan by the agriculture department to change price support loan 
procedures should be withdrawn 
frank johannsen president of the association said thursday 
that wheat growers strongly oppose usdas aug 10 proposal to 
provide that 1987 and all subsequent crops of wheat feed grains 
rice and soybeans would be ineligible for an extension of the 
original 9month loan 
the support loans are made to farmers who then are required to 
repay the loans when due or forfeit the grain to the departments 
commodity credit corp it has been a common practice in periods of 
abundance to extend the loans allowing the grain to be kept off 
the market longer and not depress prices 
johannsen said in a letter filed with usda that he recognized 
the market situation changed in 1988 because of the drought but 
that it does not justify prohibiting loan extensions on future 
crops 
decisions on future loan extensions should be made on a 
yeartoyear basis and should be based on us stocks production 
and projected domestic and world demand he said 
the usda policy affecting loan extensions and the farmerowned 
reserve program in which grain is stored over extended periods 
until rising prices force their release is facing legal challenges 
by a group of farmers in us district court st paul minn

the nevada supreme court has refused to 
drop the rock group judas priest from a lawsuit filed on behalf of 
a youth who killed himself and another who attempted suicide after 
listening to the bands music 
the heavy metal groups attorney contended the british band 
isnt subject to nevada jurisdiction but the state high court said 
thursday that jurisdiction is not unreasonable because the state 
has a strong interest in protecting its citizens from personal 
injury 
while it is true that the members of judas priest will now be 
forced to defend a lawsuit in a country distant from their own it 
is more equitable to place such a burden on them and not the 
plaintiffs because the band members consciously and deliberately 
chose to develop a worldwide market the court said 
the case is scheduled to go to trial oct 10 in washoe district 
court in reno attorneys are expected to seek millions of dollars 
in damages against the group sued two years ago along with cbs 
records after james vance 19 and ray belknap 18 shot themselves 
two days before christmas 1985 
the suit filed on behalf of vance who survived and belknaps 
mother aunetta roberson claims the apparent suicide pact resulted 
from the lyrics of the songs on judas priests stained glass 
album particularly beyond the realms of death and heros 
end 
the suit also blames the alleged hypnotic effect of the music 
and the groups intentional cultivation of a cult following

clyde l conrad the former soldier arrested 
in west germany on suspicion of espionage grew up as a shy but 
wellliked youth in sebring ohio according to former high school 
classmates 
he was shy but when you would compliment him he would give 
you this sly smile that would catch your attention said joe 
igro who was on the track team with conrad at mckinley high 
school the northeast ohio school where conrad graduated in 1965 
igro said conrad flew home from germany for their 1985 class 
reunion but there was just small talk about old days in school 
not about what he was doing now 
clinton robert waugaman 41 who went through school with conrad 
and was the track teams manager during their senior year said 
conrad kept to himself 
as far as i know he pretty much stayed home waugaman said 
i dont even recall him ever dating much he didnt associate 
with that many people 
conrad enlisted in the army on aug 9 1965 and during his 20 
years of activeduty service worked as an infantryman and then as 
an administration specialist before retiring with an honorable 
discharge in september 1985 while serving with the 8th infantry 
division in west germany service records show he served in the 
vietnam war from march 1966 to march 1967 but spent most of his 
career in west germany 
army officials said thursday they still were trying to determine 
what security clearances conrad held when he retired the army said 
his last job was listed as liaison noncommissioned officer 
but said it would take at least until today to determine his 
specific responsibilities in that position 
the army released the bare service record for conrad born in 
august 1947 at the request of reporters but would not confirm he 
was the man arrested in west germany for allegedly leading an 
international spy ring that funneled us and nato secrets to the 
east bloc for 10 years 
however west german authorities have identified the man 
arrested as a former us soldier named clyde lee conrad 
the army said that under the privacy act it could not discuss 
the ongoing espionage investigation 
according to the service records conrad served with an 
unspecified unit in west germany from may 1967 to may 1970 and 
again from june 1971 to june 1974 
in november 1974 he was assigned to the 8th infantry divisions 
headquarters company which is located in bad kreuznach this 
appears to be the first assignment that conrad drew with a 
headquarters detachment where sensitive documents would assuredly 
be stored 
conrad served in that post until august 1979 the next month he 
was transferred to the 3rd battalion of the 17th infantry at fort 
ord calif where he remained until march 1980 
the army then sent him to the defense language institute in 
monterey calif where he successfully completed a course in basic 
german 
after finishing school in november 1980 he immediately hooked 
back up with the 8th infantry divisions headquarters company in 
bad kreuznach where he remained until his retirement 
according to the service record conrad was a recipient of the 
national defense service medal the vietnam service medal five 
army commendation medals the army achievement medal three 
meritorious service medals and seven good conduct medals 
he also qualified as an expert with the m16 rifle and qualified 
for the combat infantryman badge and the parachute badge he won 
promotion to the rank of sergeant first class in november 1979

south korea and north korea failed again 
today to clear the way for fullscale talks on sharing the olympics 
and on a nonaggression pact and said they will not meet again 
until after the games 
the two sides after more than three hours of discussion failed 
to resolve any outstanding issues the south proposed they meet 
again in october after the olympics the north proposed a meeting 
oct 13 which was accepted by the south 
the decision not to meet until october appeared to indicate the 
two sides had given up on efforts to work out an agreement on the 
olympics which end oct 2 
but south korean officials would not rule out a lastminute bid 
to try to get the north to participate in the games in seoul 
the fivemember delegations of lawmakers from each side smiled 
and shook hands as the meeting opened in the south korean building 
at the panmunjom truce village 35 miles north of seoul the site 
straddles the demilitarized zone the neutral dmz which divides the 
two koreas 
chief delegate park joonkyu of south korea urged the communist 
north to agree to hold parliamentary talks in the norths capital 
of pyongyang next monday to resolve the olympic question 
he noted that the olympic flame was due to arrive in the south 
on saturday and time was running out before the games begin on 
sept 17 
the attention of the entire world is now focused on the 
question of whether the grand festival of national reconciliation 
will be held or not he said 
the chief north korean delegate chon kum chol said talks 
should be held as soon as possible but still insisted that a 
nonaggression pact should top the agenda he said fullscale talks 
should also stress the olympics 
chon said the dispute over the norths call for representatives 
of social and other groups taking part in the parliamentary talks 
could be put aside and settled at the actual talks but he held 
fast that the full parliaments of both sides take part in the 
negotiations 
the talks began aug 19 ended in stalemate monday and resumed 
friday only because their top delegates met wednesday 
south korean officials said thursday the negotiations would bog 
down unless north korea changes its unrealistic positions 
it is up to north korea we have done enough and nothing more 
to give said one source close to the south korean delegation 
who asked not to be identified 
the two sides differ widely over an agenda and the size of the 
parliamentary talks 
north korea is demanding a meeting of the full legislatures of 
both sides involving nearly 1000 members plus dozens of 
representatives of all walks of life 
south korea is seeking a smaller meeting of up to 30 delegates 
from each side saying that a large group cannot effectively tackle 
sensitive issues 
also in dispute is a north korean demand that the two 
legislatures publish a joint declaration of nonaggression calling 
for the withdrawal of 42000 us troops based in south korea 
south korea considers the us military presence essential to its 
defense 
north korea called for urgent talks on sharing the sept 17oct 
2 olympics but south korean officials said it seemed more 
concerned about issuing a joint declaration of nonaggression 
south korean officials say there is virtually no hope for north 
korea to take part in the olympics they say north korea is trying 
to keep the current talks alive as long as possible to distract 
world attention from the olympics 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics unless it is 
made a cohost the international olympic committee has rejected 
the north korean demand saying that the olympics are awarded to a 
single city and cannot be shared 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
capitalist south korea at the end of world war ii in 1945 they 
fought the korean war from 1950 to 1953 which left more than a 
million people dead

a couple whose hardluck stories of 
brokendown cars and helpless pregnancy squeezed up to 200 an hour 
from parkinglot good samaritans were actually apartment managers 
who moonlighted as con artists authorities said 
jeffrey dwayne allman 31 and tracy chris hartland 24 
described as aspiring actors were each charged with 22 misdemeanor 
counts of petty theft for allegedly duping people in the scheme 
that netted them up to 200 an hour the city attorneys office 
said thursday 
among the alleged victims was los angeles times writer jack 
smith whose column recounting his suspicion and eventual surrender 
of 20 during an encounter with the seemingly forlorn couple 
brought at least 50 letters from readers who said they had been 
similarly taken in 
the couple who have been dubbed the yuppie panhandlers by 
authorities are scheduled for a municipal court arraignment sept 
1 
city attorney jim hahn said the couple approached people in 
supermarket parking lots and at service stations and told elaborate 
hard luck stories asking for a loan which they promised to pay 
back 
the letters to smith were turned over to police and hahn said 
they provided the leads needed to identify the couple 
im pretty softhearted and i was skeptical throughout because 
there were some holes in their story but then you wonder what if 
its true said smith who was approached by the couple outside 
a pasadena supermarket in april 
i hate to think i looked gullible when i thought about it i 
said what a dumbbell you are smith added 
he said he has since talked to the woman who apologized 
allman and hartland who were arrested aug 10 while making 
their pitch to a man at a west hollywood car wash were not at all 
down on their luck hahn said 
they were being paid for managing a west hollywood apartment 
building and also received a free 776amonth apartment as part of 
the deal hahn said 
he added that allman admitted making about 200 an hour on the 
con game which had been running for three years 
both allman and hartland have arrest records on drug related 
charges and hartland has a shoplifting case pending hahn said 
explaining how the scheme worked hahn said the woman often 
would sit in a car cuddling a dog or cat while allman approached 
the victims 
allman would spin elaborate tales of woe and misfortune about 
how their car had broken down and they had spent all their money to 
get it repaired or about how the car had been burglarized and all 
their cash stolen he said 
one victim remembered how allman dropped imploringly to one 
knee during his pitch to her hahn said noting they would get 
the name and address of each victim and promise to return the money 
often the woman appeared to be pregnant he said and when the 
couple left with between 10 and 100 they would wave at their 
victims and say god bless you 
that woman has been two months pregnant for two years smith 
quipped 
those who helped the couple often went out of their way to do 
so hahn said 
a minister drove with the couple for 20 minutes in search of a 
store which would cash a check so he could give them 53 in food 
and cash an elderly man took the couple home with him fed them 
and gave them 100 to help them get home to lodi where they said 
they lived hahn said 
neither allman or hartland is listed in area telephone 
directories and they could not be reached for comment 
the maximum sentence for each charge is six months in jail and a 
1000 fine hahn said he also will seek restitution for all 
victims

since 1964 
von karajans terse letter thursday to festival president albert 
moser gave no reasons for the surprise decision prompting 
speculation the maestro may have quit in a huff rather than because 
he is ill a copy of the letter was published by the austria press 
agency 
for years the festival has been the target of media criticism 
for being elitist too expensive and too conservative the quality 
of some of the performances also has been disputed 
in a statement the directorate noted the worldfamous 
conductors decision with the greatest regret

the us government is reviewing the dutyfree 
export privileges of six countries that have been accused of 
abusing workers rights said us trade representative clayton 
yeutter 
the six countries including israel have been targeted in an 
annual review under the generalized system of preference or gsp 
program that allows developing nations to export products to 
the united state free of charge yeutter announced thursday 
gsp beneficiary countries must comply with international trade 
union laws and yeutters decision to review the six countries was 
based on petitions from labor unions human rights and lobbying 
groups 
last june the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
complained that israel was denying trade union protection to more 
than 100000 palestinians who travel daily from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip to work in israel 
the other countries to be reviewed are syria burma haiti 
liberia and malaysia 
the aflcio filed the petitions against syria burma and 
malaysia the united electrical workers complained about haiti and 
an international lawyers group submitted the petition against 
liberia 
my decision to accept or reject these petitions was made after 
careful and deliberate consideration yeutter said in a 
statement he added that the acceptance of these petitions does 
not prejudge our final determination 
yeutter rejected petitions to review the gsp rights of el 
salvador guatemala indonesia the philippines thailand and 
turkey 
if the countries lose their dutyfree privileges israel which 
in 1987 exported 487 million worth of goods under the gsp program 
would lose the most 
a freetrade agreement between israel and the united states 
already exempts some israeli exports from duty but that 1986 pact 
is being phased in over a 10year period and still does not cover 
hundreds of items 
malaysia also stands to lose having exported 347 million in 
goods under terms of the gsp while the others exported far smaller 
amounts 
currently the united states grants dutyfree treatment to about 
3000 products from 136 countries according to government figures 
since the programs inception in 1976 the value of gsp dutyfree 
imports has grown to 163 billion 
three days of public hearings will be held starting oct 3 in 
washington on the case and investigations will be conducted in the 
targeted countries the trade representatives final determination 
will be announced on april 1 1989

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen says the booing he heard from the veterans of foreign 
wars doesnt mean he failed to get across his message that 
democrats are strong on defense issues 
i tried in a dispassionate way to set the record straight and 
theyll remember that said bentsen 
in his speech thursday in chicago before the vfw the texas 
senator called republican attempts at painting the democrats as 
weak and unpatriotic scurrilous 
bentsen planned to reinforce his defense message today with a 
visit to atlanta and appearances with georgia sen sam nunn the 
democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee 
bentsen a decorated world war ii bomber pilot was greeted with 
a standing ovation from the vfw but he was interrupted four times 
by boos and jeers from the crowd three times when he talked about 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis and once when he 
mentioned former president jimmy carter 
it got my adrenalin up bentsen told reporters later ive 
done enough campaigning that i know youre going to have some of 
those along the way he said of the unfriendly reception by some 
in the audience 
he said he was not surprised by the negative reaction to his 
mention of dukakis saying in part you saw orchestrated 
response by some who were quite partisan 
but the loud boos that greeted bentsens assertion that carter 
started the recent defense buildup surprised me he said 
jimmy carter toward the end of his term began to appreciate 
that our defense forces had deteriorated he turned that 
around bentsen said thats not generally remembered and they 
really didnt want to remember that 
bentsen wearing his vfw cap asked the veterans to consider 
dukakis also a veteran as someone they could rely on to keep the 
nation protected he recited a list of defense programs supported 
by the massachusetts governor including the cruise missile the 
stealth bomber and a new conventional weapons initiative 
the simple truth is this governor dukakis is a veteran a 
patriot and an advocate of american strength and steadiness 
bentsen told the vfw he can be trusted as a defender of american 
security and as a champion of american values 
the vfw supported ronald reagans presidential campaigns in 1980 
and 1984 and warmly greeted vice president george bush and his 
running mate sen dan quayle of indiana on monday 
bentsen was finishing up his campaign swing this week in the 
deep south after spending most of the first three days in the 
midwest 
besides visiting mississippi and georgia he was scheduled to 
address a state democratic meeting in hot springs ark today 
bentsen originally had been scheduled to return to washington 
tonight but instead he was heading back to his home state of 
texas bush was campaigning in the state and bentsen said he 
wanted to respond to that

nude models are unfair victims of popular 
disapproval a chinese newspaper said today in an appeal for an 
improvement in models social status 
the guangming daily said a survey of nude female models in the 
eastern city of nanking revealed they are subject to social scorn 
and often have difficulty finding boyfriends or husbands 
some complained that even at the art institutes where they work 
teachers and students regard them as sexually liberated modern 
women 
the newspaper chinas leading daily for intellectuals said one 
model was arrested and fined 27 after getting into a fight after 
she was insulted 
the report did not mention male models 
the women seldom earn more than 55 a month thats about double 
what a factory worker makes but the models have no medical 
benefits and often cant afford a doctor when they catch colds the 
report said 
few buildings in nanking are heated despite temperatures below 
freezing in the winter 
in february another chinese daily reported a 19yearold girl 
suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she received for 
posing nude at the nanking academy of fine arts 
the guangming daily said artistic studies of the human body go 
back thousands of years but it said china is less receptive to 
nudity in art because of its feudal history and long periods of 
isolation 
all society should give them more understanding and more 
respect it said 
the nude has played a relatively minor role in chinese art 
history and the prim communist government that came to power in 
1949 effectively banned all nude paintings 
but nude modeling for art schools was revived around 1984 and 
the government has since given cautious approval to art shows 
featuring nude paintings shanghai last month opened an exhibition 
of paintings and sculptures devoted to studies of the human body

george bushs presidential campaign agreed to 
drop a charter air carrier after media representatives refused to 
fly on it due to safety concerns 
campaign officials arranged to meet today with key air officials 
to negotiate termination of the 18 million contract said 
campaign spokeswoman alixe glen 
she said the campaign would enter discussions with other 
potential carriers and use a united airlines charter in the 
meantime 
the decision came after a series of mishaps in the past week 
involving the key charter that carries the traveling press corps 
the press corps wants to terminate the contract said glen 
noting that news organizations are charged to cover the cost of the 
charter 
the charter belongs to the press corps and we are trying to 
meet their needs they have a job to do and we aim to meet their 
needs she said 
terms of the settlement remained to be worked out she said but 
added that key oficials did not want to be an obstacle in any 
way 
after some in the press refused to fly a key plane earlier in 
the week the campaign already had switched to united for a 
thursday trip to san antonio but that boeing 737300 aircraft was 
grounded for the day by an engine that overheated on takeoff from 
houston 
bush and a small pool of reporters aboard air force two went on 
to his event in san antonio while the rest of the press corps was 
left behind 
the earlier incidents occurred saturday when fumes and smoke 
entered the cabin as the key boeing 727 was landing in columbus 
ohio and monday when the same planes wing flaps did not retract 
as it was taking off from chicago the plane dumped fuel into lake 
michigan and returned to chicago 
keys president coleman andrews came to houston on thursday to 
meet with members of the traveling press and campaign staff but 
his assurances did not change the minds of those worried about the 
aircrafts safety 
bush has about 60 to 70 reporters photographers camera crews 
and producers traveling with him as he campaigns for the presidency

communities should be prepared ahead of time in 
case they are struck by multiple suicides since there is 
extremely compelling evidence that one can lead to another the 
centers for disease control says 
the middle of a crisis is no time to work out whos supposed 
to be doing what said dr patrick ocarroll a cdc specialist in 
suicide research 
being prepared is one of 10 recommendations the federal agency 
issued thursday to help communities deal with clusters of 
suicides 
the recommendations stem from a conference held in new jersey 
late last year to enable communities that have not seen outbreaks 
of suicide to learn from those that have 
on march 11 1987 four bergenfield nj teenagers killed 
themselves in a garage in an apparent death pact within six days 
four more teenagers were dead in the chicago suburbs and 
officials said those suicides probably were triggered by reports of 
the new jersey deaths 
rule no 1 in the cdc recommendations be ready to take action 
when the problem does arise with suicide clusters there is 
usually a great deal of confusion ocarroll said in an interview 
thursday this confusion can lead to different sectors of the 
community working at cross purposes 
the cdc said public and mental health agencies schools 
government police suicide hotlines and even the news media should 
cooperate in advance to make plans for their community 
then if a suicide cluster appears to be developing the 
community should work together to cope with its grief while 
watching other troubled youths to prevent further deaths the 
report said 
though there are as yet no definitive studies of 
suicideprevention approaches i would never advocate doing 
nothing ocarroll said he said there is extremely 
compelling evidence that suicides can trigger more suicides 
only about 5 percent of the 5000 teen suicides a year in the 
united states are believed to be part of clusters ocarroll 
said but those clusters present the best opportunity for action 
the response to suicide in a community has got to be gauged 
according to the situation ocarroll said 
for example the suicide of a student at home during a weekend 
would not call for some kind of enormous swatteam approach in 
school monday morning he said in that case quiet discussion 
would be in order 
but if three or four suicides occur in a matter of days and 
the community is going crazy in that situation you will do far 
more harm than good by trying to play it lowkey he said 
among other cdc recommendations 
avoid glorifying the victims and their deaths and minimize 
sensationalism 
identify those at high risk and refer them to counseling 
arrange for timely and accurate information flow to news media 
identify elements that might increase suicide attempts and 
alter them ie block off places where suicide attempts are 
taking place

maria desillers is an unfairly maligned woman who 
handled donations for her dying son as best she could according to 
the lawyer who successfully battled contempt motions that could 
have put her in jail 
the courtappointed curator for ronnie desillers estate sought 
a contempt ruling because ms desillers has refused to hand over 
financial records and items allegedly bought with some of the 
690000 in donations for the boy 
but dade probate judge francis christie dismissed the contempt 
motions thursday saying that if ms desillers gave up the records 
they might incriminate her in criminal probes under way in dade 
and broward counties 
im very happy said ms desillers who while awaiting the 
ruling gave her age as 33 the same as christ when he was 
crucified 
curator karen gievers appointed by christie in march after ms 
desillers handling of the donations was questioned contends that 
about 200000 may have been misspent on such purchases as a used 
bmw worth 13500 a diamondandsapphire ring a diamondstudded 
gold cross clothing furniture and 18 gravesites 
lawyers for ms gievers had no comment after christies terse 
ruling but later requested an emergency hearing today on their 
requests to seize disputed belongings of ms desillers also they 
want the judge to strike her 150000 claim on her sons estate 
said frank johnson another of her attorneys 
defense lawyer roy black argued during the twoday hearing that 
ms desillers enjoyed a fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and shouldnt have to give up financial records 
or the disputed purchases 
he also said some of the donations were expressly for his 
clients personal expenses 
im not saying people gave it for maria to buy jewelry if she 
bought a pickup truck for 20000 which is what they cost today 
nobody would have criticized her he told the judge 
youd think this was lifestyles of the rich and famous this 
is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated said black adding 
that his client was unfairly portrayed as greedy and grasping 
when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families with sick 
children 
ronnie 7 died in april 1987 at childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh while awaiting his fourth liver transplant his plight 
made national news after 4000 raised by his classmates for the 
operation was stolen from a school closet 
among the donations was 1000 from president reagan and 
200000 from miami beach industrialist victor posner about a 
third of the donations remain frozen in the boys estate 
shortly before the ruling ms desillers former fiance jose 
castillo was handcuffed and whisked away as he stepped out of the 
courtroom where he had sat supportively behind ms desillers 
castillo hocked two ibm computers monitors and printers worth 
4000 at a broward county pawn shop abbeys which he and ms 
desillers have often used in the past said metrodade detective 
barry garafola one of the computer sets had been stolen in a march 
robbery and the other has not been traced 
as he was led away castillo termed ridiculous charges of 
grand theft and another of dealing in stolen property detectives 
could not say if ms desillers was involved 
her handling of the money came under question when the 
pittsburgh hospital sued for the 262000 balance of the boys 
bill she refuses to pay claiming ronnie received improper care 
there a charge the hospital denies

an opposition leader claims public support for 
panamas military leader manuel antonio noriega is deteriorating 
dramatically 
noriegas government is weaker by the day the regime is 
fighting for its survival said ambassador juan b sosa at a news 
conference on thursday to mark six months to the day after panamas 
upheaval began with the failed attempt to oust noriega as commander 
of panamas defense forces 
sosa said that a combination of factors had led to a dramatic 
deterioration of noriegas public support 
sosa who continues to serve as panamas ambassador to the 
united states retains control over panamas embassy despite the 
noriega governments attempt to replace him said public opposition 
to noriega was evident earlier this month when hundreds of 
thousands of panamanians turned out for the funeral of former 
president arnulfo arias 
the united states continues to recognize sosa as panamas 
ambassador and maintains that president eric arturo delvalle who 
was ousted the day after his abortive attempt to fire noriega is 
the legitimate authority in panama

documents they were joined by fleeing residents carrying cats 
dogs and caged parakeets

the controversy surrounding dan quayles service 
in the national guard is a total creation of the media says 
the wife of the republican vice presidential candidate 
marilyn quayle makes her comments in an interview with barbara 
walters for the abc news program 2020 to be aired tonight 
and in todays editions of the washington times 
i anticipated they the media would try their hardest to 
knock danny and they have certainly exceeded my wildest dreams 
mrs quayle told the newspaper in an interview from boonville mo 
asked why she thought people are reacting so strongly to the 
question of whether dan quayle pulled strings to enter the national 
guard at the height of the vietnam war mrs quayle said in the 
television interview i dont think people are i think its a 
total creation of the media 
mrs quayle added that it had crossed her mind that 
journalists are out to get george bushs running mate 
i cant substantiate that she said in the television 
interview recorded wednesday i think part of it is just the fact 
that there were so many members of the media down in new orleans 
with nothing to do and they decided they would find a story and 
they looked wherever they thought they could and dug something up 
they are supposed to be the news gatherers the disseminators 
and not the destroyers mrs quayle told the newspaper 
she added that her biggest chore has been shielding her three 
children tucker 14 benjamin 11 and corinne 9 from the 
coverage on television and in the papers and keeping their spirits

cuba is using poison gas to flush out south 
africanbacked angolan guerrillas from their rural strongholds 
according to a un expert quoted in a british defense publication 
janes defense weekly quoted aubin heyndrickx head of 
toxicology at the university of ghent in belgium and a un expert 
on biological and chemical warfare as saying evidence based on 
environmental samples shows cuba is using the lethal mixture of 
mustard gas and nerve gases 
soil leaf and water samples taken from angolan battle zones in 
april showed clear traces of the gases heyndrickx was quoted as 
saying 
janes defense weekly is an authoritative publication dealing 
with military matters worldwide 
the attack must have taken place in march or april heyndrickx 
was quoted as saying because the nerve gases are extremely 
volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a 
few weeks 
the professor was quoted as saying he couldnt tell exactly 
which nerve gas was used although he knows it is one of the three 
neurotoxins soman tabun or sarin he did not say if any rebels 
were killed by the gas 
the report came as us mediators were working on a compromise 
timetable for a withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola 
south africa has promised to pull out its troops from angola by 
sept 1 and grant independence to southwest africa also known as 
namibia on condition the cubans leave 
heyndrickx was quoted as saying he is convinced the cubans are 
continuing to uses gases in angola to help win the war against 
rebels of the national union for the total independence of angola 
im sure the cubans will go ahead with this this is the new 
military tactic janes quoted him as saying 
the guerrillas backed by south africa and the united states 
have been fighting since 1975 to force the cuban and sovietbacked 
angolan government to share power the guerrillas control large 
portions of southern angola 
the professor was quoted as saying he has gas detection kits 
captured from cuban soldiers which are designed to measure whether 
levels of poison in the atmosphere are toxic for man 
a university of ghent team examined patients in guerrilla field 
hospitals and found evidence of nerve gas attacks in 1986 and 1984 
but none of those victims showed any trace of mustard gas he was 
quoted as saying

for years a mother and three grown children 
in this small town were known as a strange brood their furniture 
was upside down they refused to use household plumbing and shouted 
at all hours of the night 
but the odd habits of anna k moore 68 and her children 
generated only sympathy from townspeople which deepened when 
utility workers found the decomposed body of mrs moores daughter 
dawn in their house officials said 
i feel terrible about this whole situation said john c 
mullins the police chief in this southeast kentucky town of 8000 
people to me the outcome of this is the moore family is going 
to be stuck in a mental institution 
officers on wednesday arrested mrs moore her 38yearold 
daughter michella and michellas twin brother john police said 
they were taken to a lexington hospital for a medical evaluation 
ordered by whitley district judge r blaine stewart 
the familys strange habits had grown stranger in the last two 
or three years according to mayor tom thurston in addition to the 
upsidedown furniture shouting and refusal to use plumbing the 
house was falling apart and there was no glass in the windows 
on aug 5 gas workers checking a meter at the house found 
35yearold dawn moores body in a bedroom after mrs moore asked 
them if they would like to see her daughter officials said 
the family had put miss moore to bed after she collapsed july 8 
then rubbed her with lotions and flour in an attempt to heal her 
authorities said 
mrs moore later said she did not realize her daughter had died 
until miss moores body turned black 
the woman died of natural causes said whitley county coroner 
carl paul citing a preliminary autopsy report 
the medical examination of the family was requested by mrs 
moores brother richard taylor of louisiana after he heard about 
his nieces death said his attorney darrell saunders 
for the people of corbin the order that the moores be examined 
represents an emotional release thurston said 
we have a community that would have helped if they had been 
allowed said the mayor but they the moores were unusually 
independent and would not accept aid by anybody 
the family was considered harmless john moore used to listen to 
his portable radio while he picked up trash downtown and his 
sisters sat on a curb and watched 
mrs moore and michella were arrested as they walked to a 
grocery store said police lt pauline burgan they did not resist 
but did not seem to know what was happening she said 
the mother started hollering dont hurt my daughter and 
that was it the lieutenant said 
john moore arrested in woods behind his house was handcuffed 
after he screamed neighbors said 
i liked to cried when i saw them put him in the police car 
said harold adkins 
stewart acting on an initial medical evaluation at the police 
department ordered the moores taken to eastern state hospital in 
lexington nearly 80 miles to the north 
under state law the hospital evaluation must be conducted 
within 72 hours if it is determined the moores need medical 
attention and cannot care for themselves they are entitled to a 
hearing and trial before commitment 
city manager dick vermillion said committing the moores would be 
in the familys best interest 
i think we would have been criticized real hard if we hadnt 
taken action he said suppose it happened again 
but mullins who knew the moore children growing up said 
committing the family to a mental institution would be a real 
injustice 
they may get properly clothed and properly fed the police 
chief said but are they going to be happy there separated i 
dont think so

lawmakers facing a sept 1 deadline for 
certifying a new chamber of deputies returned to work early today 
before an empty public gallery following a stormy debate that one 
legislator said was proof of democracy 
opposition legislators walked out just before dawn thursday 
after a rowdy allnight session of the chamber sitting as an 
electoral college to certify results of the july 6 general election 
when the meeting resumed the public galleries were closed 
although the press was allowed in 
opposition sympathizers earlier thursday chanted whistled 
threw coins and other objects and rose to comment on what in the 
past have been staid sessions endorsing sweeping victories by the 
governing institutional revolutionary party or pri 
cuauhtemoc won was a frequent chant 
presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas the leader of a 
democratic reform movement claims the pri cheated him of victory 
his supporters form the biggest bloc of opposition legislators 
in the chamber where the pri must now contend with the strongest 
opposition in nearly 60 years 
the head of the pri delegation guillermo jimenez morales said 
the unprecedented debate shows clearly that we are living within 
a democratic framework 
the july 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that 
the pri tampered with voter registration rolls stuffed ballot 
boxes and destroyed ballots for opposition candidates 
opposition leaders have accused the party of steamroller tactics 
to speed vote certification especially in the chamber 
we have to seek new ways of protest because the official 
party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day alfredo 
noyola of the opposition national action party said thursday after 
227 opposition delegates walked out temporarily halting the 
chambers work 
he accused pri delegates of rejecting all opposition requests to 
investigate fraud jimenez morales denied the charge 
the body made up of newly elected or reelected deputies 
themselves must finish its work by sept 1 the date of outgoing 
president miguel de la madrids stateoftheunion address 
the chamber must also certify the presidential election by the 
dec 1 inauguration day of carlos salinas de gortari the pri 
candidate 
if the deadlines arent met the pri will suffer twin 
embarrassments there will be no chamber of deputies to sit in 
joint session with the senate for de la madrids speech and he 
will be unable to follow the pris tradition of formally 
introducing the new president 
jimenez morales said thursday the nations constitutional 
order will be shattered if the chamber does not finish by sept 1 
the pri has not lost a presidential election since it was 
founded in 1929 but the july 6 balloting marked the first time the 
pri won the presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast 
the pridominated federal election commission says salinas won with 
5036 percent of the vote 
cardenas a former pri leader who broke away to head the leftist 
national democratic front coalition came in second with 311 
percent manuel j clouthier of the conservative national action 
party came in third with 17 percent 
also for the first time the pri did not win every race for the 
64member senate four opposition senators already have been 
certified for their posts the senate sitting as a separate 
electoral college has been meeting routinely 
cardenas and clouthier have urged mexicans to reject the 
election results 
they have also accused the government of denying the electoral 
colleges access to documents from about half the nations 55000 
polling stations the government denies the charge 
on thursday the pri majority on the federal election commission 
rejected an opposition proposal to let the two electoral colleges 
examine the documents pri representative david jimenez said it 
wasnt necessary since party representatives saw them on election 
day the excelsior news service said 
soldiers earlier this week blocked opposition deputies from 
entering the room where ballots are under guard 
by law the deputies and senatorselect sit as separate 
electoral colleges to certify their own elections and then the 
500member chamber of deputies sits as an electoral college to 
certify the presidential election

pain and suffering were written on the face of 
emmanuel kotlyar as he stressed to prominent political and cultural 
figures the importance of building a center to chronicle the 
millions like himself who fell victim to josef stalin 
the frail man of 80 said he spent 14 years in a labor camp after 
being arrested in 1929 on trumpedup charges and hoped he would 
live to see the building completed 
we arent doing it for us but for the future generation to 
prevent a repetition of the terror the balding kotlyar said his 
body shaking his voice trembling 
kotlyar stood with a cane at a microphone thursday night in a 
packed auditorium 
for 2 hours about 200 intellectuals at the union of architects 
headquarters brainstormed about what a monument to stalins victims 
should look like where it should be built and whether it should be 
accompanied by a center that would study the repressions 
no formal program or plan came out of the session which brought 
together the main forces behind the drive to put up a monument to 
stalins victims the informal group memorial officials of 
theatrical film and architect unions ogonyok and the weekly 
newspaper literaturnaya gazeta 
there was no agenda and those interested in speaking simply 
took the microphone 
we are tired of monuments said kotlyar we have so many 
of them we need a center 
one of the centers main tasks he said should be to answer the 
question of how many people were killed and imprisoned by stalin 
from the 1930s to 1950s 
those in the audience included andrei sakharov one of the 
founders of the countrys dissident movement seated nearby was 
sergei grigoryants who publishes an unsanctioned journal called 
glasnost named after mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness 
he received a fresh reminder sunday after a demonstration 
against the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 20 years ago 
that even under gorbachev expression of dissident political views 
can land a citizen in jail grigoryants was among dozens of 
demonstrators hauled away to a police station 
two popular intellectuals who have used art as axes to chip away 
at stalinism author anatoly rybakov and playwright mikhail 
shatrov also attended 
last winter memorial a band of scholars lawyers and history 
buffs took to the streets with a petition drive and demonstrations 
that got them detentions fines and threats but the crackdown was 
halted suddenly this summer 
with gorbachevs support the communist party conference that 
ended july 1 passed a resolution called for a monument in moscow to 
stalins victims who western specialists estimate number about 20 
million 
the union of architects has since proposed converting a prison 
in sukhanovo 15 miles east of moscow into a complex that would 
include a monument museum and archives containing documents about 
the victims 
sukhanovo was a monastery before soviet rule but under stalin 
was used as a prison where inmates were routinely tortured it is 
believed to be run now by the kgb 
a competition for the design of the memorial complex is to be 
held late this year or early next year and organizers have set up 
a special bank account to accept donations from the public to 
finance the project 
groups in the baltic republics and the siberian city of chita 
are raising money for local monuments to stalins victims

the number of applicants to medical schools is at 
a 10year low partly because baby boomers are passing college 
age and partly because the medical profession has lost some of its 
glow officials say 
medical school applicants numbered 10 percent fewer for the 
198788 academic year than in 198687 and more than 30 percent 
fewer than a decade before according to a report in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
physicians are generally advising potential medical school 
applicants not to go to medical school said dr marten kernis 
vice dean of the university of illinois college of medicine the 
nations largest medical school with 1300 students 
physicians are working right now in a changing environment 
with all sorts of federal regulations being imposed changing 
reimbursement policies huge increases in medical malpractice 
liability premiums large increases in lawsuits changes in the tax 
structure et cetera he said thursday 
many physicians are arguing that these characteristics are 
mitigating against the practice of medicine 
the journal also noted that eight of 10 medical students are 
debt when they graduate and their average debt load is larger than 
it has ever been 35621 in 1987 
the greatest increases in medical school enrollment are among 
women and minorities the journal said 
john sherman executive vice president of the association of 
american medical colleges agreed that medicine has lost some of 
its luster 
we know for certain that young people these days who otherwise 
would be interested and qualified are being turned away from 
medicine by their perception of whats involved both medical 
education and practice he said in a telephone interview from 
washington dc 
the university of illinois last week decided to cut 1989 
enrollment by 10 percent in keeping with reduced federal support 
the past several years because of a projected doctor glut 
other schools are following a similar course said kernis who 
noted that colleges and medical schools are seeing the end of the 
baby boom generation 
in addition potential applicants may be discouraged by the 
increasing cost of medical education the perception that medicine 
is more technological and less humane than it once was and the long 
period of training involved he said 
the ama reported that a total of 65742 students were enrolled 
in the nations 127 accredited medical schools for 198788 a 
decline of 400 students from the previous year and 1701 fewer than 
in 198384 
the number of applicants was down for the third straight year 
to 28123 and reflects a general decline over the past 10 years 
in 197778 for example medical school applicants numbered 40569 
the ama said 
in the past five years the number of firstyear white male 
students has decreased by 132 percent to 8216 while the number 
of black male students has decreased by 68 percent to 572 the 
journal said 
but in the same period the number of firstyear white female 
students increased by less than onetenth of 1 percent to 4363 
while the number of black female students increased 317 percent 
to 682 it said 
women accounted for 37 percent of 198788 medical school 
applicants and 365 percent of entering classes the journal said 
the number of asians or pacific islanders entering us medical 
schools has more than doubled with the percentage of firstyear 
male students increasing by 1065 percent to 1179 and that of 
female students by 1284 percent to 676 the journal said 
i think thats a social phenomenon kernis said weve had 
a lot of immigration among pacific islanders and vietnamese and 
cambodians

nearly 12000 people and dozens of famous 
friends sang happy birthday to leonard bernstein in a fourhour 
tribute that left americas most famous living conductor usually 
loquacious nearly speechless 
bernstein chuckled and wept as friends including actress lauren 
bacall and composerproducer quincy jones recalled the 
conductorcomposers life and work at thursday nights 70th 
birthday gala at the tanglewood music festival 
but words almost failed the maestro when he was pulled to the 
lectern for the finale 
as hundreds of performers and the audience of 12000 stamped 
their feet bernstein shook his head no 
he grabbed the microphone said as victor borge would say 
then let out a wail characteristic of the comic pianist 
most of the audience and 250 performers then sang happy 
birthday to bernstein before he walked offstage ahead of bacall 
jones and other celebrated pals 
the berkshire hills gala was billed as one of the music worlds 
great events the master of ceremonies was beverly sills the 
former diva who is retiring as director of the new york city opera 
in november 
i love lenny she said the only thing i would not do for 
him is sing 
besides the friends who volunteered their talents to honor 
bernstein and benefit the music school where he cut his conducting 
teeth performers playwrights poets and the new york philharmonic 
his old orchestra videotaped birthday messages that were 
televised on huge screens at tanglewood 
it was all in honor of a man who gained enormous popularity and 
fame with works ranging from broadway classics like west side 
story to classical compositions like mass 
there once was a boy named lenny whose talents were varied 
and many sang bacall in a song written by stephen sondheim for 
the occasion poor lenny 10 gifts too many 
borge praised bernsteins flamboyance at the baton 
a normal conductor comes in bows turns his back on the 
audience and thats it borge said with lenny he comes in 
youre already smiling 
jones recalled being shocked when he first met bernstein 
i was all set to meet a man who was shy and introverted 
conservative concerned about health food recalled jones 
wrong this man goes to bed at 630 in the morning and at 645 he 
wakes up 
frank sinatra sent a congratulatory letter that began dear 
genius and there were affectionate regards from leaders of 
several countries including president reagan francois mitterrand 
of france and prince rainier of monaco 
bernstein kissed and hugged friends throughout the night but 
declined to talk about the celebration and ordered photographers to 
stop taking pictures of his 90yearold mother jennie 
youre going to tire out my poor old mummy he said 
but mummy was impressed 
ive been to many events with lenny but this here tops it 
all she said 
the concert which launched a fourday benefit for the 
tanglewood music school featured a smattering of short pieces with 
a strong personal connection to bernstein 
songwriter betty comden and pop singer patti austen for 
example sang tunes from his broadway shows on the town and 
wonderful town 
his children sang a song they had written for him which included 
the lines its true the most difficult man in my life is you a 
guy who gives and gives is a hard kind of guy to live with 
crying bernstein stood up and blew kisses he also ran down the 
aisle to embrace emigre soviet cellist mstislav rostropovich who 
flew in from paris to play don quixote 
that composition was one of the works bernstein conducted in his 
1943 debut with the new york philharmonic as a lastminute 
substitute for the ailing bruno walter the appearance catapulted 
bernstein to instant stardom as a young uniquely american 
conductor in a field then dominated by older europeans 
bernstein was among the first graduates of the tanglewood school 
in 1940 and has taught there every summer since

north korea and south korea today failed 
to clear the way for fullscale talks on sharing the olympics and 
on a nonaggression pact and both sides blamed each other for the 
breakdown 
the only agreement after more than three hours of talks was to 
meet again oct 13 after the olympics to continue talks on easing 
tension 
the two fivemember delegations of legislators shook hands and 
smiled before the meeting at the panmunjom truce site which 
straddles the neutral demilitarized zone separating the two koreas 
but delegates later blamed each other for failing to resolve the 
dispute over the olympics to be held in seoul sept 17oct 2 
it has been confirmed that south korea attempted to blow away 
the olympic question the chief north korean delegate chon kum 
chol told reporters 
south korean officials refused to rule out the possibility of a 
lastminute bid to get the north to take part in the games but 
they have rejected the norths demand to be a cohost of the games 
at this stage one thing is sure that cohosting is 
impossible said south korean delegate lee handong 
chon denied the north would attempt to disrupt the olympics 
south korea fears its archrival may stage terrorist attacks during 
the games 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics unless it is 
made a cohost the international olympic committee rejected the 
demand saying the olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot 
be shared 
north korea insists that fullscale talks should have 
nonaggression as their top item it also demands the full 
parliaments of both sides take part while the south called for 
smaller delegations 
also disputed is a north korean demand that the two legislatures 
publish a joint declaration of nonaggression calling for the 
withdrawal of 42000 us troops based in south korea south korea 
considers the us military presence essential to its defense 
the chief south korean delegate park joonkyu told reporters 
the talks should not be considered a failure because the two sides 
had agreed to another meeting 
the best thing to come out of this meeting is that we continue 
to have talks he said 
the two koreas are bitter rivals with hundreds of thousands of 
troops facing each other along their tense 150mile border 
the peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
prowestern south korea at the end of world war ii they fought the 
korean war from 1950 to 1953 which left more than a million people 
dead

to the hospital july 15 he was being released last week when he 
suffered a heart attack

conducted business in the intensive care unit he was shooing 
doctors away 
foreman was known for his courtroom theatrics issueclouding 
rhetoric spotlight shifting and verbal attacks on prosecution 
witnesses that kept law students and spectators spellbound 
in a murder case you should never allow the defendant to be 
tried he once explained try someone else the husband the 
lover the police or if the case has social implications society 
generally but never the defendant 
foreman however persuaded james earl ray to plead guilty to 
the 1968 slaying of king the nobel prizewinning civil rights 
activist in exchange for a 99year sentence ray charged later 
that foreman pressured him into the plea by saying the odds were 
99 percent certain he would go to the electric chair if he 
faced a jury 
foreman estimated once he had tried 1500 death penalty cases 
but of his clients only a restaurateur named steve mitchell was 
executed mitchell was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife and 
foreman who consistently opposed the death penalty said later 
mitchell had deserved to die 
you cant win em all he said 
foreman born in a log cabin outside livingston on june 21 
1902 was the middle child in a family of 10 his father and 
grandfather were sheriffs of polk county but he chose to study law

associated press during an interview last december i was 
operating a shoeshine stand on a principal corner of the 
courthouse lawyers would sit around the corner they seemed to 
live better and work less i thought itd be an easy way to make a 
living 
aside from handling death penalty cases foreman also made 
headlines by handling divorce cases and claimed to have handled 
more divorce cases than anyone else in the world he was listed in 
the guinness book of world records for having attained the highest 
cash settlement in a contested divorce in 1963 when cecil amelia 
blaffer hudson got 95 million in cash plus 20 million to 30 
million in art 
his style his technique his manner of handling himself 
before the jury had a dramatic affect on my career not only mine 
but many other men and women in the state who practice law said 
houstons other famed attorney richard racehorse haynes who 
used to skip law school classes to watch foreman in court 
i dont pretend to be the greatest lawyer who ever lived or 
even the greatest lawyer today foreman said in december 
but on the other hand i dont deny it 
foremans wife marguerite died in 1979 survivors include a 
son william of galveston a daughter marguerite of huntsville a

boxer mitch green has dropped assault charges 
against world heavyweight boxing champ mike tyson stemming from a 
scuffle outside a clothing store saying he hopes they will settle 
their differences in the ring 
green arrived at a harlem precinct with his lawyer david lee on 
thursday told police im dropping the charges and left 
without giving a reason for his decision said a police spokesman 
sgt john clifford 
but outside the station green taunted tyson chanting sissy 
sissy as he was booed by a protyson neighborhood crowd 
green who once fought for the us boxing association 
heavyweight title and lost in the ring to tyson two years ago told 
police tyson knocked him down with a punch during a predawn 
scuffle tuesday outside a harlem haberdashery 
mike tyson hit me and ran like a sissy he told reporters 
during a news conference adding that tyson hit him after he told 
the champ he did not fight hard in their 1986 bout because he had 
been cheated by promoter don king 
tysons description issued a few hours later was equally 
succinct he hit me first i hit back and the fight was over 
faster than spinks a reference to tysons firstround knockout 
of michael spinks earlier this year 
tyson fractured a bone in his hand when he hit green placing in 
jeopardy his title defense against britains frank bruno scheduled 
for oct 8 
in his statement tyson dismissed green as a punk and a true 
coward who filed a criminal complaint as a publicity stunt 
i can beat this guy anytime anywhere any place tyson 
boasted i will teach him a lesson in the ring that he should 
have learned already 
but first he said green would have to survive some good 
tough preliminary fights so that hes ranked again 
tysons manager bill cayton said a rematch would be absolutely 
a very attractive fight 
cayton told the daily news that green paid just 30000 to 
tysons 250000 despite a higher ranking at the time deserves a 
break 
in august 1987 green was arrested after police found drugs in 
his car and that his license had been suspended 54 times a week 
later he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and 
driving while intoxicated after he refused to pay a bridge toll

mayor joe smitherman accused by blacks of 
being a dictator after his apparent reelection to an 
unprecedented seventh term has sued the council in this civil 
rights landmark city for failing to certify his victory 
smitherman asked dallas county circuit judge charles thigpen on 
thursday to order the council to certify the election so candidates 
for seven contested council seats can begin campaigning 
the judge scheduled a monday hearing on the suit 
the controversy over the mayors race erupted wednesday when the 
councils three black members including cleophus mann who is 
seeking to become selmas first black mayor voted against 
certifying tuesdays election results which appeared to return 
smitherman to office without a runoff the three white council 
members voted for certification 
we might as well have been in panama said mann we sit 
around and let a dictator run things 
after the meeting mann almost came to blows with city attorney 
henry pitts one of manns campaign aides and another man were 
arrested on charges of disorderly conduct 
attorney jl chestnut who represents two of the three black 
council members said he doubts thigpen has the authority to force 
elected officials to certify the election 
this is a racially polarized city chestnut said of the 
community of 27000 there is absolutely no sentiment in black 
selma to certify any election 
this is one of the worst incidents ive seen since 1964 
said smitherman referring to the start of civil rights protests 
that marked his first year as mayor 
on march 7 1965 several hundred civil rights activists began a 
50mile voting rights march to montgomery state troopers and 
sheriffs deputies acting under orders from gov george wallace 
beat marchers as they tried to cross the edmund pettus bridge 
television film of the beatings shocked the nation 
unofficial city results showed smitherman defeating mann by 
3752 votes to 2769 a third candidate coy darby had 453 votes 
if the results are upheld smitherman would not face a runoff 
because he received more than half the vote 
a second council meeting held wednesday afternoon was boycotted 
by the three black members without a quorum no action could be 
taken 
beverly mitchell a mann aide said mann heard of numerous 
irregularities in the election including a predominantly black 
precinct where polls opened 20 minutes late and had no official 
poll workers for hours 
also she claimed city officials posted voter rolls only 10 
days before the election while the requirement is 30 days ms 
mitchell said police chief melvin summerlin intimidated people by 
showing up at several polling places and asking workers if they 
knew what they were doing 
smitherman a onetime segregationist defeated another black 
challenger in 1984 and took about 20 percent of the black vote at 
the 20th anniversary of the 1965 voting rights march smitherman 
joined black leaders at the observance and at one point shared a 
hymnal with jesse jackson and joined him in singing the battle 
hymn of the republic 
a policeman was stationed in front of smithermans office and 
extra patrols were scheduled for his residence after wednesdays 
confrontations

since it mushroomed overnight on 
easter 1974 this black shantytown has been visited regularly by 
police bulldozers and eviction agents 
today in what aides called a symbolic move president pw 
botha visited the settlement outside cape town that his government 
tried so many times to destroy 
each time the shacks of plastic sheeting and corrugated tin 
were smashed each time they reappeared in a different sandy 
field each time truckloads of women and children were carted away 
to rural homelands separated from the men who had jobs in cape 
town thousands more families replaced them 
botha making one of his few visits to a black township in his 
10 years as south africas head of state was loudly cheered when 
he arrived at the longtroubled area that the government is now 
trying to develop for blacks who fought antiapartheid activists 
thank you we accept you as our leader a black choir sang 
in the xhosa language 
the group said they made up the song for bothas visit to 
crossroads where dozens of people were killed and 70000 people 
left homeless during unrest in may and june of 1986 
botha stopped at a recently established employment center where 
appointed mayor johnson ngxobongwana welcomed the president in 
the name of all crossroads residents 
not everyone was happy about bothas visit jan van eck an 
antiapartheid member of parliament said of crossroads the 
black community that rejects an archbishop desmond tutu and 
accepts into its midst the oppressor mr pw botha is far 
removed from the rest of the oppressed people of south africa 
he was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to 
crossroads that says no entry for tutu the black anglican 
leader who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his fight against 
apartheid under which the black majority has no voice in national 
affairs 
mayor ngxobongwana headed socalled vigilantes from the oldest 
section of crossroads who burned down neighborhoods in 1986 where 
militant young antiapartheid activists held sway 
the government is building new homes for ngxobongwanas 
supporters while most of his displaced opponents have moved where 
the government wanted them a massive black township called 
khayelitsha farther from cape town 
botha said the employment center was an example of his 
governments attempts to develop black areas 
to boycott is easy but it leads nowhere botha told about 
200 people in the center to cooperate is sometimes difficult and 
to take responsibility sometimes difficult but history remembers 
only those who build not those who destroy 
the center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry 
bricklaying sewing and other skills 
the shantytowns troubled history centers around the 
whitedominated governments former policy that people of 
mixedrace had preference over blacks for all jobs in the cape town 
region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers 
crossroads was born as a result of the governments attempt to 
remove several black spots where blacks lived illegally 
when three such areas were demolished in 1974 residents packed 
their few possessions and moved but only as far as an intersection 
near cape towns airport 
by 1976 crossroads was a squatter city of 60000 people and 
the government declared it an emergency camp subsequent 
demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth 
in 1984 botha abandoned the idea that the cape should be a 
jobpreference area for mixedrace people and promised a halt to 
forced removals for race separation purposes 
by 1986 an estimated 200000 blacks were living in crossroads 
slums 
but during a fourweek period in may and june that year battles 
broke out between factions in different neighborhoods scores of 
people died and 70000 were burned out of their shacks 
residents and community workers said police aided the socalled 
vigilantes from the oldest section of crossroads who burned down 
neighborhoods where militant young antiapartheid activists lived 
critics charged that the 1986 violence was part of a government 
plan to clear out overcrowded slums so they could be rebuilt with 
lower density while troublemakers were moved farther away 
the cape town supreme court is hearing the first of more than 
3000 damage suits by those who lost their homes they charge the 
police and government with responsibilty

mechanics joined hundreds of other workers 
on strike at a steel mill in southeastern poland and police backed 
off after staging a massive show of force around a strikebound coal 
mine labor leaders said today 
polands powerful roman catholic bishops urged the government to 
renounce force in settling strikes around the country and 
reiterated their stand that the government should allow free trade 
unions a key demand of strikers 
ewa kuberna a spokeswoman for the outlawed solidarity free 
trade union said about 3000 workers were occupying the stalowa 
wola steel mill she said the mechanics joined other strikers late 
thursday and that the mill was shut down 
workers arriving for the first shift today were turned away by 
management kuberna said 
in the coal mining region of silesia police briefly surrounded 
the july manifesto mine near jastrzebie late thursday solidarity 
activists said robert kozak a solidarity spokesman in warsaw 
said about 100 police vehicles some equipped with water cannons 
surrounded the mine where a strike spawned polands worst labor 
unrest since 1981 
kozak said police drove up to the main gate and turned flood 
lights on the compound which has been occupied by strikers for 11 
days 
he said security forces made no attempt to enter the mine where 
an estimated 600 workers remained holed up police left a short 
time later kozak said 
intimidation and force must be abandoned and the reasonable 
voice of all the citizens of the country must be loyally 
acknowledged the bishops said in their first statement on the 
strikes that began aug 16 
they implicitly criticized the government for not meeting 
agreements signed with workers during the 1981 unrest saying the 
social accords signed eight years ago and developed with such 
difficulty remain a task to be fulfilled 
earlier thursday three strikes crumbled in silesia and steel 
workers gave up an onagain offagain strike in the nowa huta 
steel mill outside krakow 
strikes continued along polands baltic coast in the major 
ports of gdansk and szczecin and at least two coal mines in 
addition to july manifesto remained crippled by strikes 
the strikers are demanding legalization of the solidarity trade 
union federation and better wages 
an 11 pm to 5 am curfew was in effect in jastrzebie at the 
heart of the coal mine strikes provincial officials decreed 
thursday that nonresidents were not permitted in the town 
one strike committee member said riot police beat at least six 
miners when they forced strikers to evacuate three paralyzed mines 
wednesday night including the borynia mine in jastrzebie and the 
morcinek mine in nearby kaszyce 
but at least 20 people remained barricaded underground at the 
third mine the mosczenica witnesses said 
the state news agency pap said strikes ended thursday at three 
other shafts the krupinski zmp and first of may 
strikes continued in only three mines down from 12 at the 
beginning of this week still strikebound were the july manifesto 
jastrzebie and 30 years of peoples poland mines the first to 
declare strikes 
the gdansk port the countrys busiest remained totally shut 
down according to reporters but the statecontrolled media said 
parts of the port were working 
gdansks port director issued an ultimatum that dockworkers 
would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on 
strike 
at the 30000worker nowa huta steel mill workers who tried to 
start a strike wednesday idled various departments for 24 hours 
the last strikers gave up thursday afternoon said stanislaw 
handzlik a member of the plants solidarity organizing committee 
tentative talks began thursday at the strikebound szczecin port 
between a strike committee and management 
but jozef kowalczyk a spokesman for the strikers complained 
that even while talks were going on two ships containing security 
troops menaced the dockworkers by sailing near the docks although 
the troops didnt land 
official accounts made no mention of a police role in ending any 
strike saying only that strikers gave up and reporting 
preparations to restart work 
francinek cichon a member of the morcinek strike committee 
said six men at borynia were beaten as well as men at morcinek but 
that no strikers needed hospitalization there were some 
detentions he said 
also thursday us congressional staffer michael hammond 
announced that the congress would soon approve a 1 million grant 
to help solidarity which was outlawed by the polish government in 
1982 
hammond was in krakow at a gathering of more than 600 activists 
from east and west who came together for an unofficial human rights 
conference 
hammond general counsel to the senate steering committee which 
does research and provides support for conservative members of the 
chamber said the united states already has provided two such 
grants to solidarity

a trw inc official apologized for the 
companys role in a defense fraud case after the company paid a 3 
million penalty for conspiring to overcharge the government for 
military aircraft and m1 tank parts 
trw as a company deeply regretted that the events occurred we 
have taken steps to try and prevent a recurrence of those 
incidents william b lawrence trw vice president and assistant 
secretary said thursday outside us district court 
minutes earlier lawrence had waived the companys right to a 
trial and entered a guilty plea on its behalf before judge george 
w white 
the combined fine and criminal penalty was one of the largest 
ever assessed against a defense contractor according to us 
attorney patrick mclaughlin 
four former trw employees pleaded guilty earlier to conspiring 
to defraud the government and a fifth is to be tried sept 6 on 
charges of conspiracy and making false statements mclaughlin said 
lawrence said the conspiracy was limited to lowlevel managers 
the company also paid a separate 3 million to be applied as an 
advance payment on restitution to the us department of defense 
lawrence said the money brings to 118 million the amount trw has 
given the government to settle a pending civil lawsuit 
trw estimates its compressor components division overcharged the 
government between 3 million and 11 million lawrence said the 
company sold the compressor components division in 1986 as part of 
a corporate restructuring 
lawrence said he did not expect thursdays settlement to affect 
other trw defense contracts or attempts to bid for additional 
defense work 
trw pleaded guilty thursday to conspiring between 1973 and 1984 
to inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of military aircraft 
engine parts the company also admitted it had conspired to inflate 
labor costs on compressor fan blades for the m1 tank between 1980 
and 1984 
the third count accused the company of conspiring to charge the 
defense department for operations and labor never performed in the 
manufacture of blades for the j79 aircraft engine 
the guilty plea concludes a federal investigation that began in 
1984 when trw voluntarily disclosed that its employees had engaged 
in questionable conduct mclaughlin said

citing freedom of expression the 
california supreme court has barred the use of pandering laws to 
prosecute a filmmaker whose cast performed sex acts on camera 
the prosecution under pandering laws which forbid the procuring 
of prostitutes for pay must be viewed as a somewhat transparent 
end run around the first amendment and the state obscenity 
laws justice marcus kaufman said in thursdays unanimous 
decision 
he also said pandering laws if allowed in such cases and 
applied to their limits could be used against films of 
unquestioned artistic and social merit as well as films made for 
medical or educational purposes 
only a handful of pending prosecutions were directly affected by 
the case but lawyers said prosecutors in several counties were 
following the ruling closely and would have been prepared to file 
similar charges against local sexfilm makers if the court had 
allowed it 
if they couldnt get a conviction under the obscenity section 
this pandering was the only thing left said stuart goldfarb a 
lawyer for producer harold freeman the defendant in the case he 
said there had been no attempt to prove that freemans movie 
caught from behind part ii was obscene 
freeman was convicted of pandering for paying the cast in the 
september 1983 movie to engage in sexual acts on film although the 
pandering law requires at least a threeyear prison sentence the 
judge said prison was unwarranted in freemans case and gave him 90 
days in jail that sentence challenged by the prosecutor was 
never served 
kaufman gave two reasons for overturning the conviction 
freemans conduct was not covered by the pandering laws and if 
the laws had applied they would be unconstitutional in his case 
the cast of the film was paid for acting and not for sexual 
arousal or gratification so they were not prostitutes and 
freemans hiring of them was not pandering kaufman said

allegedly led an international spy ring sold the soviets secret 
documents on nuclear missile bases military pipelines and nato 
troop strength news reports said today 
the bild newspaper of hamburg which is known to have close 
contacts to intelligence sources quoted an unidentified west 
german security official as saying clyde lee conrad had sold 
extraordinarily important information 
a special supreme court panel ordered conrad held in prison 
pending further investigation following his arrest tuesday he was 
charged with compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an 
especially grave case according to the prosecutors office 
two men who officials said were part of the ring were arraigned 
today in sweden 
kurt rebmann the chief federal prosecutor said conrad also 
recruited a second american soldier who received a fivefigure 
sum of money for supplying the ring with military secrets 
rebmann refused to elaborate 
bild said information contained in documents that conrad 
allegedly sold included secret locations of nuclear missiles 
classified documents about pipeline systems defense plans of nato 
and of us divisions and topsecret troop mobilization plans 
west germanys ard television network and the new york times 
also reported that such information was sold by the ring which 
allegedly had been operating since the late 1970s 
the times quoted us and german officials as saying conrad 
guarded a safe that stored documents at the us army base in bad 
kreuznach in central west germany 
bild said conrad lived in an elegantly furnished apartment near 
the base 
officials have said the ring was believed to have stolen 
documents concerning nato defense plans for europe and us army 
contingency plans for a ground war with the soviet union in europe 
alexander prechtel a spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office said thursday that its too early to determine what damage 
the spying caused the north atlantic treaty organization 
we cant exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are 
involved he said 
it could take months before we know the full extent of the 
damage to nato defenses he added he refused to release any 
further details about the probe 
in goteborg sweden a district court today arraigned two 
hungarianborn brothers who prechtel said were part of the ring 
chief prosecutor svenolof hakansson said the men arrested 
tuesday acknowledged working for the hungarian intelligence 
service 
security officials said sandor kercsik 48 and imre kercsik 
34 were suspected of preparing unlawful intellegence activity 
and supporting preparations of criminal acts 
a third suspect the wife of one of the brothers was detained 
for questioning and released her arraignment was not immediately 
sought 
a us justice department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity called the spy case a serious encroachment on our 
national security

ohio was born in 1947 and worked for the us military for 20 
years first as an infantryman and then as an administration 
specialist 
according to his service records conrad received the national 
defense service medal the vietnam service medal five army 
commendation medals the army achievement medal three meritorious 
service medals and seven good conduct medals 
prechtel said conrad worked with classified military defense 
plans for seven years at the us army base in bad kreuznach with 
access to a wide array of secret documents 
conrad allegedly engaged in espionage work after he left the 
service in 1985 prechtel said 
in a statement rebmann alleged that conrad had turned over the 
most recent batch of information to his soviet bloc contact in 
vienna last month 
rebmann said officials still were investigating to determine 
exactly what was missing 
cable news network on thursday quoted unidentified west german 
sources as saying conrad systematically photographed files from 
1980 to 1985 the cnn report said investigators believe he may have 
transferred material onto a personal computer which was seized at 
his home 
prechtel said that while several people had been taken into 
custody or arrested he could not confirm a new york times report 
thursday that eight people were rounded up 
the times said the network was uncovered by west german and us 
officials including agents from the fbi and the army the army has 
about 250000 military personnel in west germany at more than 200 
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of 
soviet bloc spies

a jury resumed deliberations today on 
racketeering charges against 20 men in what authorities call the 
nations longest federal criminal trial which has had more than a 
year of testimony and evidence 
prosecutors charge the defendants constituted the hierarchy of 
the new jersey faction of the lucchese organized crime family the 
organization allegedly ran loansharking drugdealing illegal 
gambling and fraudulent credit card operations the government says 
the principal defendant is reputed crime family captain anthony 
tumac accetturo of hollywood fla who allegedly controlled 
the new jersey faction 
the trial which began with jury selection in november 1986 
frequently has been characterized by courtroom outbursts wrangling 
among the attorneys and delays needed to sort problems created by 
the multitude of defendants 
that atmosphere carried over to the first day of deliberations 
thursday when the jury asked its first question just 10 minutes 
after beginning work asking for a copy of the indictment and 
transcripts of opening arguments and the lawyers began arguing 
about how much should be given to the panel 
us district judge harold a ackerman rapped his gavel and 
said ive asked you in the nicest way three times please be 
quiet 
the jurys indictment question was resolved when lawyers learned 
that the jury already had a copy of it along with a roomful of 
exhibits but didnt know it was there

the jury sent back another note cancel request 
all 20 defendants are named in the first count charging a 
conspiracy to violate the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt

americans personal incomes climbed a healthy 
06 percent in july while consumer spending slowed from its 
breakneck pace of the previous month the government reported today 
the commerce department said that the increase in incomes 
matched a 06 percent rise in june and would have been even 
stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to 
farmers 
personal consumption spending which includes virtually 
everything except interest payments on debt rose 05 percent in 
july less than half the 11 percent rise in june the report 
attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars 
the slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the 
economy because of worries that demand this year has been 
outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods thus 
creating rising inflationary pressures 
the income gain looked particularly impressive because the key 
component wages and salaries shot up 1 percent during the month 
reflecting continued strong employment gains 
this was offset somewhat by a 9 billion rate of decline for 
farm subsidy payments excluding these payments which show extreme 
monthtomonth volatility personal incomes would have risen 08 
percent in july 
americans disposable or aftertax incomes rose 06 percent in 
july down only slightly from a 07 percent june increase 
with incomes rising slightly faster than spending the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable incomes edged 
up to 43 percent in july compared to 42 percent in june 
following the 11 percent rise in spending in june which had 
been the biggest advance in 10 months the 05 percent july 
increase reflected gains in purchases of nondurable goods and 
services 
nondurable goods spending rose at an annual rate of 35 
billion compared to a 55 billion june increase purchases of 
services which includes housing costs increased 122 billion 
following an even stronger 186 billion june increase 
but purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following 
a 12 billion rise in june because sales of new cars fell during 
july

television talkshow host morton downey 
jr will not be arrested for scuffling with a weekly newspaper 
editor because a prosecutor says he wants to devote his resources 
to more serious crimes 
assistant states attorney burton a kaplan said he rejected an 
arrest warrant charging breach of peace that had been prepared by 
police based on a complaint filed by paul bass editor of the new 
haven independent 
i denied the warrant not based on the merits of the case 
because i believe there was a violation by mr downey but based 
on other considerations including the volume of business and the 
resources of this office kaplan said thursday 
kaplan said his staff in superior court can be used more 
effectively tackling more serious cases such as murders rapes and 
other crimes 
bass said thursday that he had mixed feelings about the decision 
i understand kaplans need to prioritize bass said the 
courts are overbooked with cases im very glad he said in his 
statement that downey broke the law 
but he added i think its unfortunate that some guy whos a 
celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of 
groupies and he can get away with attacking someone if it was a 
poor black kid with three friends cheering him on i think he would 
get arrested 
downey couldnt immedately be reached for comment there was no 
one on his staff at wwortv in secaucus nj at work early today 
said a receptionist at the station 
new haven attorney ira b l grudberg who represented downey

are more important things than this notwithstanding my clients 
high visibility

george bush promised new jobs for minorities and said during a 
swing through his adopted home state that hed be a good 
president for all americans while rival michael dukakis accused 
the vice president of bungling the nations war against drugs 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee maintained his 
code of silence on embattled republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle who encountered fresh doubts about his resume 
quayle was campaigning in the midwest trying to answer questions 
on farm and trade issues when the cleveland plain dealer reported 
that he exaggerated his job record in the indiana attorney 
generals office 
quayle had just begun to shed some of the questioning about his 
military record and relations with a former lobbyist 
quayles senate biography which is being distributed as 
official background of the republican vicepresidential nominee 
says he was chief investigator for the consumer protection 
division of the indiana attorney generals office from 19701971 
the plain dealer reported that the consumer protection division 
didnt even exist in 1970 and that quayle spent most of the period 
as a lowlevel clerk it said he put in less than three months in 
the investigators job and had already moved on to another job 
when the division officially opened for business in september 1971 
the new disclosure came just a few hours after bush had declared 
the controversy over his running mate to be a thing of the past 
campaigning in texas with a mariachi band and wearing a 
guayaberra bush promised in the sweltering latesummer heat of san 
antonio to help those minorities who havent really had a shot at 
the starting line 
the best way to do that in employment is to have urban and 
rural enterprise zones a break in that tax structure that will 
encourage business to locate where those populations are 
reagan tried to create such zones on a national level in the 
early part of his administration as a means to combat unemployment 
but opponents said they failed to produce results when tried on a 
state level 
bush also said he supports affirmative action programs so 
minorities have a better shot at the american dream pledged to 
fight gun control and help the faltering oil industry 
dukakis returning to boston after a midwest sojourn escalated 
his attacks on bush through his role in the reagan administration 
why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and 
grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled drugrelated deaths 
doubled and heroin imports risen by 50 percent he asked at a 
rally in cleveland 
he also said the administrations association with panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega while he was actively involved in 
the drug business was criminal 
dukakis later attended a fundraiser in boston where 150 gay 
rights advocates had protested a state policy they say virtually 
bans placement of foster children in gay and lesbian homes only a 
few protesters remained when he arrived 
dukakis vetoed this measure from the 1988 budget but now that 
he has become the democratic presidential candidate he has once 
again chosen to pander to bigotry and prejudice a flier said 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen ran into flak thursday when 
the world war ii veteran pilot told a veterans group that dukakis 
and the democrats could be trusted with the nations defense 
bentsen wearing a vfw cap was warmly received at the veterans 
of foreign wars convention in chicago but in trying to make the 
case for dukakis on defense he was interrupted four times by boos 
or jeers once when he mentioned former president carters name 
bush meanwhile appeared to be softening his stance on the 
strategic defense initiative the new york times quoted the 
republican in its editions today as saying a decision on whether to 
deploy a full or partial star wars defense system must await more 
research into its capabilities and costs 
what i want to do is to continue research at the levels of 
funding essentially that we have requested said bush who 
earlier was promising deployment as soon as feasible 
in washington the debate over campaign debates continued nancy 
m neuman president of the league of women voters said she was 
encouraged that aides to bush and dukakis would meet next week to 
begin negotiations on debates for the fall 
democratic chairman paul kirk criticized bush for indicating on 
wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least sept 20 before 
meeting dukakis in debate hes not going to be able to refuse to 
debate kirk said 
republican chairman frank fahrenkopf said neither he nor anyone 
in the bush campaign agreed to a set number of debates on dates 
certain or at particular locations

destruction of israel maariv quoted shamir as telling aides this 
week it is reaching a conclusion that we should be confronted on 
the political level 
secondly the plos recognition of israel no matter inside 
what borders will influence radical arab states and push them to 
accept israels very existence and maybe to direct negotiations 
with israel shamir was quoted as saying 
israels rightwing trade and industry minister ariel sharon 
rejected an upcoming us review of israels dutyfree privileges 
in response to alleged abuses of palestinian workers rights 
sharon alleged palestinian trade unions are coverups for 
terror organizations they are not innocent workers unions but 
front organizations behind which the plos political arm has been 
hiding for years

propalestinian lobby in washington has accused israel of 
indiscriminately closing down union offices arresting arab labor 
activists and denying trade union protection to at least 100000 
arabs in the territories who travel to jobs in israel 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said thursday he would 
review israels dutyfree trade status following the complaint 
which was filed in june

it comes to the lives of jews israel would not be pressured by 
economic sanctions a country found to have abused worker rights 
risks losing its rights to export products to the united states 
free of charge under the generalized system of preferences gsp 
in 1987 israel exported 487 million worth of goods under the gsp 
program 
the shooting incident occured after youths manning the roadblock 
in ramallah attacked the arab late thursday because they suspected 
him of collaborating with israel radio reports said only arabs 
who provide information to authorities are granted permission to 
carry a weapon 
but an arab witness said the arabs were arguing with the man 
because he demanded to pass through their barricade 
he said the man approached the barricade in his car demanding 
it be removed when arab youths refused and started to argue he 
just grabbed a pistol and shot the boy said the witness who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the clash followed three attacks on suspected collaborators in 
the last two days

eastman kodak co has refused to honor a 
second federal subpoena for information on contamination and 
chemical use at a manufacturing plant because the request is too 
broad company spokesmen said 
kodak sent a letter thursday to the environmental protection 
agencys regional headquarters in new york offering to sit down 
and meet with them about the lastest subpoena company spokesman 
paul allen said thursday night what we need to do is find out 
exactly what they want 
the new subpoena orders a kodak vice president and other company 
representatives to appear tuesday before epa officials in 
rochester the kodak officials were to give sworn testimony and 
produce documents the company received the subpoena wednesday 
kodak earlier this month refused to honor a subpoena that 
demanded documents concerning chemical spills and storage at kodak 
park a manufacturing area for the production of film and 
photographic paper it stretches over more than 7 miles of the city 
and employs more than 30000 people 
the epa action was prompted after kodak notified the state 
department of environmental conservation earlier this year that its 
own monitoring of groundwater had turned up low levels of 
contamination at its property line kodak has contended that there 
could be no health hazard to residents of surrounding homes because 
of the low and deep levels of the contamination it found 
the epa which issued the subpoenas can ask a federal judge to 
order kodak to answer them if ordered to comply and kodak still 
refused the company could be held in contempt of court epa

seals in a revamped version of the shuttle 
booster joint blamed for challengers destruction worked in a test 
firing despite intentional flaws helping discovery pass its most 
significant milestone the rockets manufacturer says 
an analysis of the aug 18 test at morton thiokol incs 
northern utah plant found that the aft seal though the worst 
flawed deliberately succeeded in preventing superhot gases from 
escaping the company said thursday 
the success of the test the fifth and final qualifying firing 
of the new 126foot solidfuel booster was vital to nasas plans 
to resume shuttle missions grounded since the challenger disaster 
on jan 28 1986 
this may be the most critical milestone as far as getting us 
back into space said morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab its 
certainly the most significant milestone weve had to pass in the 
solid rocket motor design 
if the positive evaluation of the test holds nasa officials 
have said they expect to set a firm date late next month or in 
early october for discoverys mission the first shuttle flight 
since the challenger accident 
engineers who took apart the boosters aft segment looked at 
the intentional flaws and were very pleased to see that hot gases 
had not blown by the primary oring that it had sealed properly 
said ed snow another company spokesman 
a presidential commission blamed a faulty aft joint on one of 
challengers two boosters for the spacecrafts explosion shortly 
after liftoff a plume of superhot gas burned through a rubberlike 
oring in the joint and caused challengers outside fuel tank to 
explode killing all seven astronauts 
meanwhile the fbi and nasa are investigating what appear to 
have been deliberate cuts in some oring seals destined for use in 
shuttle boosters but none of the damaged orings had been shipped 
to morton thiokol said james dockstader vice president of 
operations for hydrapak inc the west jordan utah company that 
produces the orings 
none of hydrapaks 85 employees has been dismissed dockstader 
said but he would not say if any had been disciplined 
the redesigned joint incorporates a socalled capture 
feature designed to seal the rocket during liftoff preventing 
hot gases from escaping 
snow said morton thiokol and national aeronautics and space 
administration engineers will continue tearing down the 
foursegment rocket over the next week and a half 
earlier this week morton thiokol workers completed the first 
stage of evaluating the test firing by disassembing the boosters 
nozzle section 
engineers found no problems declaring it the best nozzle 
yet raab said 
last weeks 20 million test culminated morton thiokols 2year 
redesign effort 
for the test two of the rockets three field joints including 
the aft joint the casetonozzle joint and the ignitertocase 
joint were peppered with 14 intentional flaws intended to test 
the boosters safety features to their limits the aft joint was 
the most flawed 
defects included separations in the insulation that holds the 
joints together and channels cut to allow the gases to reach the 
joints middle oring 
the oring is one of three such seals in each joint designed to 
contain heat generated by ignition of the rockets 11 million 
pounds of propellant during launch

a report filed with the nuclear 
regulatory commission proposes sealing the crippled three mile 
island unit 2 reactor for 30 years after the conclusion of a 1 
billion cleanup gpu nuclear corp said 
gpu which oversees the two nuclear plants on three mile island 
said in a statement thursday the longterm storage of unit 2 would 
prevent exposing cleanup workers to radiation 
as early as 1986 gpu outlined a plan for mothballing tmi2 
however the filing of the safetyevaluation report with the nrc 
represents the first time the utility has formally specified a 
30year storage period following the conclusion of the 10year 
cleanup said doug bedell a company spokesman 
the safety report is an elaboration of the earlier proposal he 
said 
tmi2 has been shut down since march 1979 when a combination of 
human and mechanical errors led to a partial melting of the 
reactors nuclear fuel the cleanup at the site is scheduled to end 
next year 
more than 99 percent of the radioactive fuel will be removed 
from the plant but some areas will remain too contaminated for 
human entry 
over a 30year period exposure levels for cesium137 the 
dominant remaining isotope would be reduced in half the report 
said 
although it would be possible to continue decontamination of 
the facility this effort would not appreciably enhance the overall 
stability and maintainability of the facility nor would it add to 
the overall margin of safety for the public the report said 
further work beyond the end of the planned cleanup would 
result in unnecessary additional occupational exposure to personnel 
who would be conducting the decontamination tasks the report 
said 
gpu officials previously outlined a plan for decommissioning the 
unit 2 reactor jointly with its sister plant tmi1 when that 
plant is ready to be retired from service 
decommissioning is the final stage in a plants life and 
involves removing a plant from service and ensuring that any 
residual radioactivity is reduced to levels that permit 
unrestricted use of the site

a rash of worrisome news on inflation and rising interest rates 
was tempered today by a commerce department report that showed 
americans personal income rose at a healthy pace last month but 
their rampant spending declined 
the report said personal incomes climbed 06 percent in july 
matching a june increase but personal consumption spending which 
includes everything except interest payments on debt rose 05 
percent in july less than half the 11 percent rise in june 
the slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the 
economy because of worries that demand for goods is overwhelming 
supply and pushing up prices a classic inflation pattern 
other economic reports released thursday added to worries in the 
financial markets that inflation is rising 
the commerce department said the economy overcoming a drag 
caused by the drought grew at the surprisingly strong annual pace 
of 33 percent in the apriljune quarter 
the department also said the growth in the gross national 
product the total output of goods and services would have soared 
to a 43 percent annual clip had it not been for a 95 billion 
loss in farm output in a droughtplagued year 
in another report the department said aftertax profits by 
corporations surged 115 percent in the apriljune quarter to an 
annual rate of 1666 billion the best showing since the same 
quarter of 1983 
but it was the 51 percent apriljune inflation rate reported by 
the department compared with just 17 percent in the prior three 
months that incited new worries over possible hikes in interest 
rates by the federal reserve which boosted rates earlier this 
month 
the economy is growing much too fast said robert dederick 
chief economist of the northern trust co of chicago it is nice 
to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an 
lot of unemployment but at this stage we just cant afford it 
aggravating the concern were moves by west germany and other key 
european trading partners to hike interest rates in their 
countries partly to combat what they called the unwelcome effects 
of a resurgent us dollar 
todays step is an important signal which will be understood 
by the foreignexchange and capital markets proclaimed west 
german bundesbank president karl otto poehl it should lead to 
stabilization of the currency and capital markets and the first 
reactions should show this is the case 
in response the dollar tumbled against the west german mark and 
british pound in heavy trading 
poehl used pretty strong language said derek walker an 
economist at midland bank plc the germans have shown us pretty 
clearly that they really havent been happy with the mark at the 
level its been 
the combined news of higher us inflation rising foreign 
interest rates and falling dollar rattled the stock and bond 
markets 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
fell 1582 points to 201085 the treasurys key 30year bond fell 
5 per 1000 in face amount and its yield rose to 944 percent 
from 940 percent late wednesday 
in another sign of the effects of rising interest rates the 
national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes fell 5 percent in july the first decline in 
six months as rising mortgage interest rates dampened demand

president pw botha was greeted 
by a black choir singing his praises today as he toured a 
shantytown his government tried several times to destroy 
botha making one of his few visits to a black township in his 
10 years as head of state was cheered loudly when he arrived at 
the longtroubled crossroads area outside cape town 
thank you we accept you as our leader a choir sang in the 
xhosa language 
after years of trying to eliminate the squatters town bothas 
government is now building new houses in crossroads 
however the population has changed most of the current 120000 
residents are believed supporters of the vigilantes who in 1986 
burned down huge areas of crossroads where antiapartheid activists 
held sway scores of people were killed and 70000 squatters burned 
out of their homes during that factional fighting 
botha stopped at a new jobtraining center where the appointed 
mayor johnson ngxobongwana welcomed him in the name of all 
crossroads residents 
ngxobongwana headed the socalled vigilantes 
many of his displaced opponents have moved where the government 
wanted them a massive township called khayelitsha further from 
cape town 
botha accompanied by his wife elize and daughter rozanne 
concluded his visit with a halfhour drive past crossroads shacks 
and an area where new homes are being built several thousand 
residents looked on many cheering and youths ran after his car 
when it left a childcare center 
at one point botha inspected a house under construction and 
spread mortar with a trowel later he shook the hand of a boy who 
ran alongside his car 
jan van eck an antiapartheid member of parliament said of 
crossroads the black community that rejects an archbishop 
desmond tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor mr pw 
botha is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of 
south africa 
he was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to 
crossroads that says no entry for tutu the black anglican 
leader who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his fight against 
apartheid under which the black majority has no voice in national 
affairs 
crossroads was declared a township last year the first time 
its residents were not classified as squatters millions of blacks 
live in squatter camps elsewhere in south africa and the 
government has introduced legislation making it easier for 
authorities to evict them 
botha said the employment center was an example of his 
governments attempts to develop black areas 
to boycott is easy but it leads nowhere botha told about 
200 people in the center to cooperate is sometimes difficult and 
to take responsibility sometimes difficult but history remembers 
only those who build not those who destroy 
the center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry 
bricklaying sewing and other skills 
the shantytowns troubled history centers around the 
whitedominated governments former policy that people of 
mixedrace had preference over blacks for all jobs in the cape town 
region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers 
crossroads was born as a result of the governments attempt to 
remove several black spots where blacks lived illegally 
when three such areas were demolished in 1974 residents packed 
their few possessions and moved but only as far as an intersection 
near cape towns airport 
by 1976 crossroads was a squatter city of 60000 people and 
the government declared it an emergency camp subsequent 
demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth 
in 1984 botha abandoned the idea that the cape should be a 
jobpreference area for mixedrace people and promised a halt to 
forced removals for race separation purposes 
by 1986 an estimated 200000 blacks were living in crossroads 
slums when battles broke out between different neighborhoods 
residents and community workers said police aided militants from 
the oldest section of crossroads who burned down neighborhoods 
where antiapartheid activists lived 
the cape town supreme court is hearing the first of at least 
3000 damage suits by those who lost their homes they charge the 
police and government with responsibilty

the fbi and nasa are investigating 
suspicious damage discovered in some oring seals that had been 
destined for use in space shuttle booster rockets an official of 
the manufacturing company said today 
none of the damaged orings which were found in june and which 
appeared to have been deliberately cut were sent to booster 
manufacturer morton thiokol said james dockstader vice president 
of operations for hydrapak inc the west jordan utah company 
that produces the orings 
during the normal inspection procedures in the manufacturing 
process certain space shuttle orings appeared to have received 
damage of a suspicious origin he said the damaged orings 
were immediately secured and no damaged orings were shipped to 
morton thiokol 
morton thiokol the fbi and the national aeronautics and space 
administration were advised immediately and dockstader said both 
agencies and hydrapak launched investigations 
relying upon the results of these investigations hydrapack 
has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the future and is 
confident the problem now is solved he said 
dockstader said some kind of incision had been made in the 
orings but he declined to say how many were damaged or what 
instrument had been used he also refused to speculate on a 
possible motive 
none of the companys 85 employees has been dismissed 
dockstader said but he refused to say if any had been disciplined 
fbi spokesman cal clegg confirmed the agency has launched an 
investigation of possible sabotage a federal violation but he 
declined to elaborate 
morton thiokol is not investigating the incidents because the 
company never received any damaged orings from hydrapak thiokol 
spokesman rocky raab said today 
its always upsetting to hear that someone may for whatever 
reason be deliberately damaging stuff thats intended for the 
space program raab said but we are satisfied that the steps 
taken by hydrapak to resolve the situation are in fact adequate 
because thiokol carefully inspects any products from suppliers 
and never found any problems with the orings the company is 
satisfied that the situation has resulted in no particular 
danger raab said 
there is virtually no possibility that any damaged oring has 
ever gotten into the flight hardware he said 
morton thiokol which produces the boosters at its wasatch 
operations in northern utah on aug 18 successfully conducted the 
final qualifying test of the booster which had been redesigned in 
the wake of the 1986 challenger explosion 
the explosion which killed challengers seven crew members and 
grounded us manned space program was blamed on a faulty booster 
joint which allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape igniting the 
crafts main liquid fuel tank 
orings are used as seals to prevent the superheated gases from 
escaping the joints morton thiokol engineers have redesigned the 
joints to incorporate a third oring and other improvements 
including a metal capture feature have been added 
dockstader said hydrapak submits the orings to thorough 
internal inspections which are followed by inspections by morton 
thiokol personnel and the defense contract administration service 
the nature of these cuts were such that they could not get 
past our inspection he said they were very obvious and there 
is no fear that any damaged orings left our facility 
dockstader said the plant is operated under a strict security 
system among other measures employees are required to wear badges 
to gain access to the plant and visitors are always accompanied by 
an escort 
we have asked the fbi and nasa for a critique on security and 
we have not received any criticism he said we are always 
securityconscious

the veterans of foreign wars rejected jane 
fondas apology for her support of north vietnam during the vietnam 
war and passed a resolution asking congress to try her for treason 
at their 89th annual convention wednesday about 13400 vfw 
delegates passed three resolutions by voice vote one of which said 
the apology is not enough to redeem the situation 
the vfw is not insensitive to a sincere expression of 
contrition the resolution stated but the vfw wants to be 
assured that the apology is not simply a means of bolstering her 
sagging career and political fortunes 
the resolution said that in a speech at michigan state 
university in 1969 fonda said all of us should pray to become 
communists 
does her apology mean she also disavows her communist 
sympathies the resolution asks 
the third resolution passed unanimously by voice vote accused 
fonda of committing many treasonable actions and statements 
and called for congress to put her on trial for treason 
the resolutions also urged veterans to ask congress to 
investigate her actions during the war and denounced union 
street a movie that stars fonda and was partially filmed in 
waterbury conn 
fonda an ardent opponent of us involvement in vietnam took a 
highly publicized trip to hanoi during the war and posed for 
pictures next to a north vietnamese antiaircraft gun 
last june at her request she appeared on the abc program 
2020 to apologize 
there was no immediate comment from fonda or her 
representatives in los angeles a man answering the phone at the 
office of rick nicita an agent who works with fonda said 
spokesman ron meyer was not immediately available 
fonda was recently in connecticut filming union street with 
robert deniro her presence divided the town between those who said 
the movie would help the area economically and those who refused to 
forgive her for her controversial past

the first permanent household hazardous 
waste collection center on the east coast opened friday in this 
marthas vineyard community 
the center funded by a 28000 state grant will serve all six 
towns on the island state officials hope the pilot project will 
spawn similar regional centers elsewhere in the state 
until now the only way to dispose household hazardous wastes 
such as paints solvents and pesticides has been to wait for a 
onceayear collection day 
james gutensohn commissioner of the state department of 
environmental management said the project is especially important 
to marthas vineyard because a single underground water source or 
aquifer supplies water to the entire island 
we are reducing the threat to the water supply that stems from 
disposing of these wastes in a landfill gutensohn said

george bush is seeking support in texas with 
promises to revive the faltering oil industry oppose gun control 
and create jobs for minorities through business tax breaks 
texas which commands 29 electoral votes and 270 are needed to 
win the presidency has become a key battleground with the 
selection of sen lloyd bentsen of texas as the running mate of 
bushs democratic rival michael dukakis 
bush made no mention while campaigning thursday of his 
beleaguered running mate sen dan quayle of indiana but he 
predicted that he will win in his adopted home state in november 
bush seemed eager to get on with his campaign after many days of 
media focus on the background of quayle asked by reporters if he 
thought the quayle matter was behind him bush said yes i do 
however a new report today in the cleveland plain dealer says 
quayles official senate and campaign biography contains inflated 
claims about his service in the indiana attorney generals office 
the newspaper reported that quayle was an entrylevel research 
assistant for most of the time he claims to have been chief 
investigator for the consumer protection division of the indiana 
attorney generals office from 19701971 
bush focused thursday on his pitch to texas voters and after a 
warm reception from several hundred supporters at a san antonio 
rally he said there does seem to be forward motion 
on his fourday swing through texas the vice president was 
heading today to longview for a rally and on saturday will go to 
dallas for a speech to a marine corps group and a republican 
fundraiser 
i will win in texas but i will work hard to do that bush 
told reporters as he left the rally en route to houston 
the campaign stop in san antonio was tailored to appeal to the 
regions large hispanic population 
wearing a loosefitting shirt called a guayaberra for the 
occasion he was welcomed at the downtown san antonio river front 
by a banner in spanish and he was serenaded by a mariachi version 
of hail to the chief in his remarks to the sweltering outdoor 
rally bush promised to help those minorities who havent really 
had a shot at the starting line 
the best way to do that in employment is to have urban and 
rural enterprise zones a break in that tax structure that will 
encourage business to locate where those populations are bush 
said 
i support affirmative action so minorities have a better shot 
at the american dream he said i will be a good president for 
all americans 
at the rally bush promised he would put some incentive back 
into the energy business into the oil business and said he 
would resist gun control proposals 
in an interview published today by the new york times bush 
appeared to back away from earlier promises to deploy the star wars 
missile defense system as soon as feasible he indicated that 
cost would be a factor in determining whether to deploy it 
i dont think we yet know what the price tag will be bush 
said if you went to a full deployment of a full strategic 
defense it would be very expensive what i want to do is to 
continue research at the levels of funding essentially that we 
have requested 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said the vice president was 
not shifting his stance on star wars and has always supported 
research on the defense system 
she said bush has long contended that full deployment would be 
very very expensive that we would cross that bridge when we come 
to it 
in texas bush recalled his move to the state in the 1940s with 
his wife barbara to begin working in the oil industry 
i was drawn to this state by two things texas was a place of 
big opportunity a can do place and it was strong in the 
traditional values family faith and peace and patriotism he 
said im proud to be back in my home state of texas 
the vice president maintains a formal address at the houstonian 
hotel and condominium complex in houston where he is staying during 
his campaign trip 
we are getting to be a hightech state he said adding that 
he would help stimulate new business by cutting the capital gains 
tax and keeping congress from strangling small business with 
regulation

comedian joe piscopos fame is his 
fortune and it also should be his wifes a judge says 
ruling in piscopos divorce case superior court judge isabel b 
stark said this week that piscopos celebrity good will can be 
counted as an asset in dividing property with the stars wife 
nancy 
it is a quantifiable asset just as in any other profession 
ms stark said but she added that the way celebrity status should 
be quantified is somewhat different from a partnership or 
corporation 
one of piscopos attorneys gary n skoloff said thursday it 
was only the second time nationwide a judge in a divorce case had 
placed a value on celebrity status a judge in new york last march 
made a similar ruling regarding actress marisa berenson 
skoloff who vowed to appeal the ruling said it was unclear 
exactly what the value of piscopos celebrity was from the judges 
oral opinion delivered wednesday from the bench 
he said he would have to wait for a written opinion but added 
that under his understanding of what the judge had said mrs 
piscopo would be eligible to receive roughly 50000 
piscopo is a onetime star of nbcs saturday night live who 
has appeared in several movie comedies including wise guys and 
also stars in a popular series of beer commercials he and his wife 
separated three years ago 
the state supreme court has held that medical and dental 
licenses and a business degree are not assets that could be 
distributed in court said skoloff he said he would appeal ms 
starks ruling on those grounds 
the judge also said mrs piscopo could move with the couples 
9yearold son joseph john to florida

the government of president corazon 
aquino will appeal to the supreme court if a lower tribunal rules 
that ferdinand marcos can come home to face an accuser the chief 
prosecutor said friday 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez made the statement to 
reporters after a meeting between mrs aquino and chief legal 
advisers to study implications of a petition filed by the former 
president to return when a former cabinet minister testifies 
against him in november 
marcos petitioned the antigraft court wednesday to allow him to 
return so he could defend himself when baltazar aquino the former 
public works minister gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by 
japanese firms during the previous administration 
last week the antigraft court said marcos had the right to be 
present and crossexamine aquino if the testimony was to be used in 
criminal proceedings aquino is no relation to the president 
but the anticorruption court stopped short of ordering marcos 
to return chavez said he will file a motion next week asking the 
court to reject marcos petition 
if our position is not upheld then we will elevate the matter 
to the supreme court chavez said he added that he expected 
marcos to do the same if the lower court rejects the petition 
the government was trying to reconcile the demands of the 
judiciary and the demands of national security presidential 
spokesman teodoro benigno said 
mrs aquino cited national security as the main reason for 
preventing marcos from coming back from his exile in hawaii where 
he fled after the february 1986 uprising that toppled his 20year 
administration 
but she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts 
even if they order marcos home 
defense secretary fidel ramos said the military has begun 
preparing security plans in the event that marcos returns 
promarcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible 
for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the 
aquino government key leaders of those coup attempts remain at 
large 
the philippine government claims marcos embezzled up to 10 
billion during his graftridden administration

mourners at the funeral for president 
lazarus e salii were told that dissention and mistrust must be 
resolved after the first two presidents of this western pacific 
archipelago have died from violent means 
we must cooperate with one another said president thomas o 
remengesau who is serving out saliis term which ends this year 
salii was elected three years ago to succeed palaus first 
president haruo i remeliik who was shot to death 
salii was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head aug 20 in 
his home in the capital city of koror 
the government is withholding results of an autopsy performed 
monday to determine whether salii was killed by a gunman or 
committed suicide 
the government will delay releasing the results until they are 
reviewed by family members and the cabinet said presidential aide 
bonifacio basilius 
remeliik was gunned down outside his home three men convicted 
at trial later were acquitted of murder charges on appeal 
these two very tragic events have made us search our souls to 
see if our people can survive in todays world remengesau told 
the more than 1000 mourners at the national congress building 
high chief ibedul yutaka m gibbins called for unity and peace 
among palauans 
the people of palau must work together in unity and cooperate 
to bring prosperity to our future generations gibbons said 
we cannot afford to lose the cream of our leadership 
remengesau 57 said these are costly lessons that must never 
again be repeated 
palau is a 400milelong archipelago about 600 miles east of the 
philippines and 4500 miles southwest of hawaii its nearly 15000 
residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands 
the island chain which implemented constitutional government in 
1981 is a un trusteeship with its affairs administered by the 
united states department of the interior 
it has been seeking a new political status with the united 
states that would terminate the trusteeship and make palau 
selfgoverning 
salii was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free 
association under which palau would receive 460 million in us 
aid during the first 15 years of a 50year agreement 
however the pact has run into court challenges and an impasse 
in the us congress on legislation to implement the agreeement 
former us ambassador fred m zeder who negotiated the compact 
with salii and remeliik said that salii died for the cause of 
sovereignty and selfdetermination 
it is time for healing and forgiveness and that message should 
be carried as well to washington and the us congress zeder said 
james d berg director of the state departments office of 
freely associated state affairs in washington said the us 
government will redouble its efforts to bring into reality a 
freely chosen relationship for palau 
the way to honor president saliis memory is for national 
reconciliation he said after the twohour state funeral 
berg was part of a fourmember us delegation to the funeral 
headed by janet j mccoy principal deputy assistant secretary of 
interior

the fbi is using surveillance and 
unfounded investigations to intimidate attorneys for 311 hispanic 
agents suing the bureau in a classaction discrimination suit the 
lawyers charge 
but the fbis assistant director labels the allegations 
outrageous and repugnant 
the flurry of charges and countercharges in court thursday 
punctuated the end of the nineday trial before us district judge 
lucius bunton who said he hopes to render a decision by oct 1 
almost 100 witnesses testified 
the 311 hispanic agents joined in the classaction suit contend 
the fbi discriminates in the promotion discipline and assignment 
of hispanics they seek unspecified damages and changes in fbi 
policies 
about 400 or 43 percent of the fbis 9400 agents are 
hispanic compared to about 8 percent of the general population 
the plaintiffs attorneys hugo rodriguez and antonio silva 
complained tuesday and thursday that the bureau has kept watch on 
them and possibly begun an investigation to discredit them 
this is the fbi said rodriguez who resigned from the fbi 
last year after 18 years youve heard witness after witness 
state that the first rule of the fbi is dont embarrass the 
bureau thats what this case is doing its bringing out the 
dirty laundry of the fbi 
about 40 agents testified that the the bureau transfers hispanic 
agents more often to undesirable locations hands them assignments 
that are less glamorous or more dangerous promotes them slower and 
gives them less recognition for their successes 
witnesses called by the fbi denied the accusations 
rodriguez and silva were notified thursday that the fbi was 
concerned about a possible security breach in connection with the 
disappearance of an affidavit from rodriguez briefcase last month 
someone mailed the affidavit to fbi headquarters 
rodriguez and silva implied the fbi stole the document july 29 
so it could start an embarrassing investigation 
silva told bunton the government is attempting to put us in 
jail to ruin our legal careers for representing these men and 
women of the fbi 
but milt ahlerich fbi assistant director for congressional and 
public affairs said the charge was false and denied an 
investigation resulted from the affidavits disappearance 
theyre the ones making a veiled allegation of a document 
being taken from them he said the idea that the fbi would 
tamper with attorneys papers is outrageous and repugnant to the 
fbis mission 
on tuesday fbi attorney lainie simion tried to introduce into 
evidence a document concerning a closed investigation into whether 
rodriguez and silva were selling arms to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
bunton did not allow the document into evidence no charges 
resulted from the investigation which rodriguez dismissed as a 
groundless intimidation tactic that he said was started after he 
reesigned from the fbi 
an el paso police officer lent credence to the surveillance 
charges when he testified thursday that he saw a man hiding in the 
police garage last april taking photos through a telephoto lens of 
rodriguez and silva leaving the courthouse with the lead plaintiff 
bernardo matt perez 
the officer reported the incident to the fbi a brief 
investigation revealed nothing testified richard schwein special 
agent in charge of the el paso fbi office 
perez the no 2 agent in el paso filed the suit in january 
1987

a jury began deliberating today whether 
the copper7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a 30yearold 
minnesota woman 
the plaintiffs esther kociemba of elk river and her husband 
william asked the jury thursday to penalize copper7 maker gd 
searle amp co by awarding at least 165 million far more than any 
jury has awarded in 18 similar cases 
you are going to have the ability to step right into that 
board room and send a message michael ciresi the kociembas 
attorney told the jury maybe theyll learn a lesson 
ciresi who spearheaded litigation against ah robins that 
resulted in a settlement of 38 million for 198 users of the dalkon 
shield iud maintained during the threemonth trial that the 
copper7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease that rendered mrs 
kociemba sterile the chicagobased searle improperly tested the 
device he argued 
the copper7 was a time bomb ticking away in womens wombs 
ciresi told the jury searle knew and concealed the dangers of 
that device from the medical community 
but paul strain a lawyer for searle said the company exceeded 
us food and drug administration requirements in marketing 
copper7 which was once the most widely used iud in america 
he attacked the credibility of the plaintiffs witnesses and 
said ciresi did not even prove that mrs kociemba suffered from 
pelvic infection let alone that it was caused by the copper7 
time and again the searle doctors did more than they had to do 
to ensure the safety of the women who were going to use the 
copper7 strain said the medical literature fortifies the 
judgment that the copper7 is safe and effective 
strain termed raw and mean allegations that searle concealed 
evidence about the copper7 to hurt women and said one expert 
witness for the other side had testified in many trials and would 
always blame an iud unless a woman had a gunshot wound to the 
abdomen 
strain cautioned the jury to base its decision on facts instead 
of sympathy for mrs kociemba who wept quietly for much of the day

after months of wrangling that included a job 
action which forced 170 flight cancellations usair and its flight 
attendants union have hammered out a tentative agreement on wage 
parity for former pacific southwest airlines attendants 
officials for the airline and the association of flight 
attendants said friday the accord also extends for another year 
with some minor modifications a contract covering a total of 4203 
attendants the current contract was up for renewal and amendment 
sept 1 
the new contract which has to be ratified by the union members 
was reached late thursday in pittsburgh after 10 days of intense 
negotiations there said judy stack an official of the association 
of flight attendants 
usair acquired pacific southwest in may 1987 but operated it as 
a separate subsidiary until last april before merging the two 
operations 
the 961 former pacific southwest attendants had been represented 
by the teamsters but voted to switch to the association of flight 
attendants just prior to usairs acquisition of psa 
stack said the former psa attendants generally were on pay 
scales about 10 percent less than those at usair the company had 
offered to bring the two groups of workers to parity over a 
threeyear period 
the union had wanted that accomplished faster when the two 
sides reached an impasse last spring many attendants refused to 
work overtime on the memorial day weekend forcing usair to cancel 
some 170 flights then 
neither stack nor david shipley a spokesman for the airline 
would disclose details of the agreement they said completion of 
the ratification vote is expected in late september 
the union and the company now have to go through the same 
process to integrate a contract covering some 3000 flight 
attendants at piedmont airlines into the usair accord 
usair purchased piedmont last november and hopes to merge their 
operations next march

china and the soviet union will try to remove the 
last major hurdle to restoring relations when they meet this 
weekend to discuss cambodia 
the major obstacle in the way of normalizing sinosoviet 
relations is the kampuchean cambodian question foreign 
ministry spokesman jin guihua said thursday this obstacle must 
be removed before relations can be normalized 
the talks between soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev 
and his chinese counterpart tian zengpei are to begin sunday it 
will be the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss 
cambodia 
vietnam backed by the soviet union has occupied cambodia since 
1979 china supports the khmer rouge one of three guerrilla groups 
in the opposition 
the talks will concentrate on how to press vietnam to withdraw 
all its troops from cambodia at an early date jin said at the 
weekly briefing 
we hope that the talks will achieve positive results to 
contribute to the improvement of relations between our two 
countries he said 
rogachev is to arrive in beijing saturday 
the worlds two largest communist countries split over 
ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s moscow 
and beijing have met every other year since 1982 to discuss 
normalizing relations and have encouraged a steady increase in 
trade and cultural contacts 
but china has consistently held that three obstacles stand in 
the way of normalization soviet support of vietnams occupation of 
cambodia soviet military presence in afghanistan and soviet troops 
stationed along the chinese border 
premier li peng in a meeting thursday with prime minister 
noboru takeshita of japan said soviet support for vietnams 
occupation of cambodia blocks normalized political ties 
the soviet union has already taken steps to remove the other two 
obstacles by beginning a withdrawal of its troops from afghanistan 
in may and reducing troop strength along the chinese border with 
soviet ally mongolia 
china which backs the khmer rouge and other forces fighting 
vietnamese troops in cambodia says the soviet union which gives 
the hanoi government financial support must use its influence to 
end vietnams occupation 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the khmer rouge 
who killed hundreds of thousands of people during its fouryear 
rule 
vietnam agreed in may to withdraw 50000 troops this year and 
remove all its forces by 1990 it also has endorsed recent talks 
between the antivietnamese resistance coalition and the prohanoi 
government in phnom penh 
the success of the beijing talks would also pave the way for the 
first sinosoviet summit since nikita khrushchev visited beijing in 
1959 
both chinese senior leader deng xiaoping and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev have expressed interest in a summit but china 
refuses to participate in a meeting until moscow pressures vietnam 
to leave cambodia

the iranian envoy took a hard line today at the 
second day of the iraniraq peace talks saying a lasting 
settlement to the prolonged dispute depends on observance of a 1975 
border treaty repudiated by iraq 
the joint facetoface session between foreign ministers was 
temporarily abandoned this morning un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said it was difficult for the bitter rivals to 
continue meeting they met instead in separate rooms for about two 
hours 
but in the afternoon the facetoface session was resumed by 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati and iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz flanked by their delegations there was no 
immediate word on progress 
however velayati delivered a strong statement after the morning 
session about the validity of the 1975 algiers treaty on iraniraq 
boundaries the issue poses a major stumbling block in the 
negotiations 
emerging from the morning session velayati told reporters 
for reaching this comprehensive just and honorable solution we 
have valid criteria united nations resolution 598 the 
outline plan of the secretarygeneral and the 1975 treaty between 
iran and iraq 
in september 1980 president saddam hussein renounced that 
treaty which gave iran rights to the disputed shattalarab 
waterway and five days later invaded iraq 
the border issue and treaty are considered critical to a peace 
settlement because resolution 598 requires troop withdrawal to 
mutually recognized boundaries iraq now says the boundaries are in 
question 
iraqi officials recently reaffirmed their repudiation of that 
treaty 
earlier in the day perez de cuellar told reporters that 
problems between iran and iraq have lasted centuries and then it 
is not in one afternoon that we can decide 
the session began thursday with a joint session led by the 
secretarygeneral and both sides addressed each other through 
intepreters it was the first facetoface meeting of foreign 
ministers since the persian gulf war began almost eight years ago 
but after two hours the session was suspended and both sides 
met in separate chambers for three more hours with un officials 
meeting them and reporting to perez de cuellar 
the format of separate rooms was continued today un spokesman 
francois giuliani said the secretarygeneral first met separately 
with each minister then the delegations consulted in separate 
rooms he said 
un officials based in another room occasionally visited the 
delegations and perez de cuellar at times met the delegations 
separately 
meanwhile a small group of iraqi kurds and other iraqi 
opposition groups demonstrated outside the building and protested 
the baghdad governments use of chemical weapons on its rebellious 
kurdish minority 
iraq had demanded the direct facetoface talks before a 
ceasefire to test irans intentions iran refused and both sides 
agreed on direct talks shortly after the halt in hostilities 
i am sure the parties sincerely want to solve the problem 
perez de cuellar said today but i think we have to be a little 
patient 
he said the arrangement was made at the request of the two 
countries i would prefer to have them all the time in the main 
room with me but he said i have to accommodate myself to the 
wish of the parties 
the talks began about one hour late velayati declined to answer 
questions from reporters at the entrance of the building the bulk 
of the iranian delegation had arrived earlier on time for the 
meeting 
giuliani denied reports by un officials that the 
secretarygeneral was considering appointing former swiss president 
kurt furgler as his special representative to continue the 
iraniraq talks 
he also dismissed a swiss radio report that edouard brunner the 
no 2 in the swiss foreign ministry would be appointed he said if 
brunner is appointed swiss ambassador to washington there is no 
question of the secretarygeneral appointing him as his personal 
representative giuliani said 
brunner is being considered for the post but if appointed he 
would not take the position until next year 
the peace process is expected to be long and difficult possibly 
lasting years the direct talks were made possible after iran and 
iraq both accepted un security council resolution 598 calling 
for a ceasefire 
before the talks began perez de cuellar held several meetings 
with aziz and velayati in new york the warring sides agreed to 
hold direct talks following a ceasefire that began aug 20 
the truce appeared to be holding saeem fahmawi a spokesman for 
the 350 un observers monitoring the 733mile iraqiran warfront 
said in baghdad there have been no major violations 
the iranian and iraqi delegations in geneva include political 
figures military representatives and legal experts on war relief 
prisoner repatriation and reparations 
the agenda was not disclosed but the secretarygeneral said the 
talks were aimed at carrying out the ceasefire resolution which 
also calls for troop withdrawal to international boundaries return 
of war prisoners reparations and a comprehensive peace 
it also calls for an impartial body to determine which side 
started the war 
repatriation of pows is any thorny issue many of the 80000 war 
prisoners are expected to refuse repatriation because they have 
publicly supported the detaining country

us peace activists announced friday they are 
forming an international campaign to secure the release of all 
political prisoners in south korea after two americans were 
arrested for participating in a recent seoul rally 
susan bailey of the peoples antiwar mobilization a new 
yorkbased group that opposes the us military presence in south 
korea also called for the withdrawal of the 45000 american troops 
stationed there 
bailey told a news conference that she and another american 
charles scheiner were arrested aug 20 at a rally held five days 
earlier by supporters of the movement to unify north and south 
korea 
i was surrounded by plainclothes police on foot bailey 
said they began screaming at us forcibly grabbed us picked us 
up and threw us in the back seat of unmarked cars 
bailey maintains that she and scheiner were held by the seoul 
metropolitan police and by immigration authorites for 55 hours 
without being allowed to contact us embassy officials and then 
were deported without being charged with a crime 
south korean government officials told embassy representatives 
that bailey and scheiner violated laws prohibiting tourists from 
participating in political demonstrations according to the state 
department 
bailey also contends that young sook a south korean woman who 
had served as her hostess and interpreter was jailed after 
authorities charged she was associating with political subversives 
bailey a secretary at the university of maryland said her 
interpreters jailing is meant to have a chilling effect on south 
korean political activists 
clearly the south korean government is intent on making an 
example out of young sook as a way to discourage contact between 
the south korean government and the international community 
bailey said 
several international human rights organizations as well as 
former us attorney general ramsey clark are working to secure 
sooks release bailey said 
state department officials did not have information on young 
sooks case and calls to the south korean embassy in washington 
were not returned immediately

us sen quentin burdick should make a full 
recovery from an operation in which part of his colon was removed 
as a precaution against cancer aides and his doctor said 
we obviously think this will be a shortterm problem but we 
feel as the senator recovers and returns to work he will 
demonstrate his vigor and vitality burdicks chief of staff 
david strauss said thursday after the surgery 
the 80yearold north dakota democrat has served in the senate 
since 1960 when he won a special election and is running for 
reelection this year to a fifth full term he faces republican 
earl strinden in november 
an 18inch section of burdicks colon was removed during a 
2hour operation at bethesda naval hospital in maryland and the 
procedure was a complete success said charles blankenship who 
performed the surgery 
no cancer was apparent in the excised colon tissue but tests 
will determine if any was present the doctor said in a telephone 
interview 
three polyps were removed from burdicks colon during a routine 
screening in july and one was found to be cancerous according to a 
statement issued by burdicks office 
there was a slight chance the cancer could have spread to his 
lymph nodes so the section of the colon where the cancerous polyp 
was found was removed as a precaution blankenship said 
following the surgery burdick was conscious and appeared 
normal for an 80yearold man after a major operation the 
doctor said 
burdick is expected to remain in the hospital for seven to 10 
days and resume a full schedule sept 7 strauss said 
the operation was similar to one president reagan underwent in 
july 1985 when two feet of his colon was removed strauss said 
burdick has tried to deflect talk about his age and health with 
a public relations campaign emphasizing his commitment to fitness 
he has been photographed wearing a karate outfit and once offered 
to fight the candidates for the republican senate nomination toe 
to toe any rules you want 
party activists last year urged burdick to step down because of 
his age in favor of a senate bid by rep byron dorgan dnd 
burdick rejected the idea and eventually won the partys 
endorsement after dorgan declined to challenge him

equipment trucks caused massive traffic jams and 
craftsmen spent a week of sleepless nights setting up but the la 
scala opera company of italy is ready to open its second tour of 
japan its director said friday 
the milanbased troupe opens thursday in tokyo in an expensive 
tour that director carlo maria bandini hopes will promote italian 
opera culture throughout japan 
in europe almost all theaters are staterun with considerable 
support coming from the government bandini said at a news 
conference if only the japanese music scene could receive more 
assistance from the state 
the monthlong 16performance tour includes renditions of 
verdis nabucco i capulet e i montecchi by bellini and 
puccinis la boheme and turandot 
noted conductors riccardo muti carlos kleiber and lorin maazel 
are conducting the operas the casts are led by baritone renato 
bruson tenor peter dvorsky bass paul plishka and sopranos 
mirella freni ghena dimitrova and galia savova film director 
franco zeffirelli designed the sets for la boheme and 
turandot 
teatro alla scala known for the grandeur of its huge sets 
sent more than 63 containers of sets props and equipment that 
along with instruments and other supplies required 150 trucks 
when they delivered their loads from yokohama to tokyo they 
caused a massive traffic jam said tadatsugu sasaki director of 
the japan performing arts foundation the tours promoter its 
taking 900 people to set everything up 
most of the performances will be in two halls in tokyo with two 
performances in osaka and one in yokohama 
the performing arts foundation flew more than 550 performers 
musicians and machinists from italy housing them paying part of 
their salaries and giving each a daily allowance of about 200 
it is also hiring about 200 extras from the local foreign 
community to fill out crowd scenes 
the tour is costing the promoter about 165 million said 
sasaki but the yens dramatic rise means this is 22 billion yen 
today compared with 4 billion yen three years ago 
still sasaki says he expects to take a loss we expect to 
cover only 1 billion yen 75 million of the cost through ticket 
sales he said well try to cover the rest from la scala and 
some kind of assistance from arts foundations and such 
unlike most operas and musicals that tour japan la scala is not 
receiving japanese corporate sponsorship 
offers came from seven firms ranging from a pharmaceutical 
producer to a company that makes rice cookers sasaki said but 
i didnt want a firm to utilize culture just for their own 
publicity or to improve their image 
in milan ticket sales cover about 30 percent of the cost and 
the government pays the rest bandini said opening night tickets 
back home go for 750 but the top tickets usually are about 150 
he said 
tickets for the japan performances cost from 90 to 263 if 
they cost any more people could not afford to come he said 
the cultural affairs agency is not contributing a single 
yen sasaki said but they sure are asking for a lot of 
complimentary tickets

a federal appeals court today upheld contempt 
fines against the city of yonkers for defying an order to 
desegregate housing but capped the penalties at 1 million a day 
diminishing the threat of bankruptcy 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals also upheld contempt fines 
against the four city councilmen who voted against the 
desegregation plan 
previously us district court judge leonard sand imposed fines 
on the city of 100 that would double daily quickly going into the 
millions and breaking the citys annual budget in less than a month 
in a 39page opinion the appeals court also delayed 
reimposition of the fines for seven days to permit the city to seek 
an appeal before the us supreme court 
yonkers mayor nicholas c wasicsko who favors accepting sands 
order did not immediately return a telephone call today seeking 
comment on the ruling 
under the new timetable if the contempt continues yonkers 
would pay 12800 next friday and would reach the 1millionaday 
cap a week after that at which time the city would have paid more 
than 26 million in all the total would mount by 1 million each 
day after that 
the yonkers budget for the year 337 million would be wiped 
out in about 11 months but the city would face bankruptcy long 
before that a state agency has already taken over the citys 
pursestrings imposing spending restrictions and drafting a 
worstcase plan 
sand also imposed 500aday fines against the four councilmen 
and ordered their eventual jailing if they continued to balk at 
complying with his ruling 
those sanctions were suspended aug 9 when the city and the four 
councilmen appealed to the 2nd circuit if they had not been the 
council members were scheduled to go to jail aug 11 
by aug 9 the city had paid 12700 in fines and each 
councilman had paid 3500 
in upholding the fines against the four councilman the 
threejudge appeals panel said the threat of jail would resume in 
nine days 
the four councilmen had indicated thursday they would again vote 
once again to defy the courts at a special city council meeting set 
for 2 pm today 
the defiant council members said they hadnt changed their minds 
about the desegregation plan which would create 800 units of 
affordable housing throughout the city 
sand who in 1985 found yonkers liable for 40 years of 
segregated housing and schooling imposed the fines aug 2 after 
the council refused by a 43 vote to endorse the housing plan 
the city had argued that sands contempt finding and fines were 
unfairly punishing yonkers for the defiance of renegade council 
members who would not change their votes because of the political 
consequences 
lawyers for the council members in turn argued that sand 
exceeded his judicial discretion by ordering members of legislative 
body to vote a certain way 
but the 2nd circuit concluded that under the circumstances of 
this case the recalcitrant council members may be required to vote 
to implement the consent judgment and that the city in addition 
to the council members may be subjected to coercive sanctions 
for failure to abide with sands orders 
the court ruled that sand acted well within his discretion 
in starting the fines against the city at 100 a day but added 
that at some point however the doubling reaches unreasonable 
proportions 
the appeals court noted under the current schedule the fine 
for day 25 is more than 1 billion the fine for day 30 is more 
than 50 billion 
the panel said the doubling fines were excessive when the 
level of each days fine exceeds 1 million

scientists at oxford university have determined 
the shroud of turin said to be the burial cloth of jesus christ 
is a fake the evening standard newspaper reported today 
the newspaper claimed radiocarbon dating tests prove the shroud 
was made in about 1350 ad 
the 14foot cloth kept in turin cathedral bears the image of a 
bearded crucified man 
the evening standard gave no attribution for its report but 
quoted dr richard luckett of magdalene college cambridge 
university as saying i think that as far as seems possible the 
scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a fake 
i suppose there will be certain people who will never want to 
believe it but it seems unlikely these tests could be 1300 
years off luckett was quoted as saying 
an official at magdalene said luckett had left a message saying 
he wouldnt be giving interviews 
luckett whose university is an ancient rival of oxford was not 
connected with the oxford tests but he has been associated with 
investigations of its history and examined it in turin in 1973 
tests also were made at the university of arizona in tucson and 
the federal polytechnic in zurich switzerland all three 
institutions agreed to keep their findings secret to enable the 
catholic church to announce the results in september or early 
october 
professor luigi gonella in turin the liasion between cardinal 
anastasio ballestrero of turin and the three laboratories said 
today he had received no word from oxford and was amazed by the 
report 
gonella said oxford scientists made blindtests on three samples 
they were asked to date the three samples not to determine 
which of them belongs to the shroud he said 
gonella confirmed the oxford experiments were completed but he 
said the results wouldnt be released until after scientists from 
the three laboratories had met to coordinate them 
dr michael tite who supervised the oxford tests said the 
results from all three centers are now in and are being 
coordinated we are not saying anything because an announcement 
will be made in september or early october by turin via the vatican 
press office 
tite keeper of the british museums research laboratory 
stressed that while each laboratory received three samples of 
cloth they were not told what they were and samples were taken

more than a week of labor unrest is 
putting pictures of lech walesa and striking polish workers back 
into newspapers and on television screens here in 
questionandanswer format is some background on the unrest

q what are the issues this time 
a in the approximately 20 strikes since aug 16 the chief 
demand has been to make legal the banned trade union solidarity 
followed by calls for higher wages 
solidarity was suppressed and then outlawed following the 
imposition of martial law in dec 13 1981 but it has remained 
active at first mainly as an underground organization but in 
recent years more openly as the government has become less 
restrictive 
polands faltering economy has given new impetus to strike 
actions and when strikes broke out in april and again this month 
solidarity activists led the protests 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what is the state of the economy 
a the government this year launched its second stage of 
economic reform that aims to reduce government subsidies eliminate 
inefficient enterprises give managers more autonomy remove 
obstacles to private enterprise and make wages more dependent on 
individual performance 
broad price increases were announced as part of the program 
which sent inflation rocketing from about 25 percent a year to 
about 60 percent wages were raised too even higher than 
inflation according to the government but many workers felt that 
their incomes have not kept up with prices 
meanwhile supplies of consumer goods to the stores have been 
even more erratic than usual partly because of adjustments to the 
reform program 
after a wave of strikes in april and may the government 
announced the priceincrease program had been handled poorly and 
its top priority now would be controlling inflation and improving 
the availability of consumer goods 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what are the workers complaints 
a average wages in poland are low about 100 a month at the 
official rate of exchange many industrial workers say they are 
forced to work long hours and on weekends just to make ends meet 
about two pounds of meat costs about one days wages and a color 
television about four months wages 
young workers who have dominated the strikes want affordable 
housng the waiting period for cooperative apartments can be 20 to 
30 years in some parts of the country and private housing is beyond 
their means 
after solidarity was crushed the government set up an official 
trade union federation which has shown some militancy on behalf of 
workers 
but because the head of the federation is a member of the ruling 
politburo and it tends to be dominated by the party many workers 
do not trust the federation and want solidarity restored 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what does solidarity want 
a legal status and talks with the government about restoring 
the economy 
solidarity says econmic reform is necessary but it should be 
done with the consent and guidance of the workers but even 
solidarity admits that many of the goals of the reform require 
sacrifices 
while the union wants to encourage economic reform it also 
wants to preserve aspects of the socialized economy that benefit 
workers subsidized housing generous vacations and cradletograve 
security 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q why wont the government recognize solidarity 
a the government says solidarity started out with broad popular 
support but was hijacked by radicals who oppose polands communist 
system and is supported by money from abroad it says the former 
union is now a wholly political group with only about 30000 
supporters nationwide compared with 10 million members in 1981 
the new official unions with 7 million members are the legitimate 
representatives of workers it says 
the government says it is willing to talk to former solidarity 
members who are interested in constructive change but not while 
they are leading illegal strikes and not if they oppose polands 
constitution which gives the communist party the leading role 
in poland 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what is lech walesas role 
a walesa is solidaritys national chairman and is keeping in 
touch with strikers nationwide while leading the strike at the 
lenin shipyard in gdansk where he works as an electrician 
he has advisers with him in gdansk including some intellectuals 
like historian adam michnik other solidarity activists are running 
a nationwide information network to make sure the unions side of 
the strike is publicized 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q why is 1988 different from 1980 
a strikes in poland this year have not sparked the same degree 
of public enthusiasm as in 1980 when virtually the entire nation 
went on strike and an unbridled national euphoria gave rise to 
solidarity 
after the experience of martial law and eight years of economic 
decline the attitude expressed by many poles even among some 
sympathetic to solidaritys goals is strikes are useless what 
good will it do

a federal judge today extended his earlier 
action to bar eastern airlines from firing 4000 workers and said 
he would detail his objections to the companys reorganization and 
cutback plans by tuesday 
us district judge barrington d parker issued a terse 
twopage ruling saying that the three unions fighting easterns 
plans are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief 
the financially troubled airline a subsidiary of texas air 
corp said it anticipated an appeal of parkers actions 
the scope of the ruling was not immediately clear parkers 
ruling said a full opinion would be issued setting forth the 
limits of the the preliminary injunctive relief earlier this 
month the judge issued a restraining order blocking the carriers 
plans to reduce its service and close its kansas city hub sept 1 
a spokeswoman for the miamibased eastern karen ceremsak said 
in a statement that the company believes the unions are not 
entitled to relief of any sort and we expect we will be filing an 
appeal at the appropriate time 
the statement said the airline would take no action against the 
employees pending clarifications of what our obligation will be 
under terms of the ruling 
the eastern plan announced july 22 also calls for elimination 
of 140 of its 1225 daily flights to trim costs 
the three unions the airline pilots association the 
international association of machinists and the transport workers 
union contend the layoffs cant take place until the carrier 
negotiates with its employees under the railway labor act 
eastern which has lost about 1 billion over the last decade 
says the cuts are necessary to prevent further losses 
the unions allege the reductions are a part of a plan to move 
easterns assets to continental airlines another subsidiary of 
texas air corp 
at a hearing before parker earlier this month union attorneys 
produced a draft of a speech that texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
was to give to japanese investors in 1986 after texas air acquired 
eastern 
the draft said the purchase of eastern gave texas air a better 
bargaining position against its unions easterns airplanes can 
be repainted and moved over to continental where they will be 
flown by nonunion pilots the speech draft said 
lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking 
firm it was unclear from court testimony whether lorenzo ever 
delivered that portion of the speech

president pw botha was cheered 
and serenaded friday as he toured a black shantytown once targeted 
for demolition and now being upgraded following battles that ousted 
antiapartheid activists 
botha who has visited only a handful of black towns during his 
10 years in power opened a new jobtraining center for the 
township near cape town and inspected a housing project on land 
formerly controlled by squatters who opposed the government 
botha extolled the example set by appointed mayor johnson 
ngxobongwana the leader of the vigilantes from the oldest 
section of crossroads who burned out the militant squatters in 1986 
im encouraged by your positive attitude which can serve as 
an example for other communities to get similar facilities 
botha said 
he stopped at a jobtraining center where ngxobongwana welcomed 
him in the name of all crossroads residents the president 
briefly played a xylophone and listened while a choir sang in his 
honor thank you we accept you as our leader 
scores of people were killed and 70000 squatters left homeless 
during the 1986 factional fighting the conflict left nxgobongwana 
in control and last year crossroads was declared a township the 
first time since it was established in 1974 that its residents were 
not classified as squatters 
millions of blacks live in squatter camps elsewhere and the 
government has drafted legislation making it easier for authorities 
to evict them 
the government is building new homes for some of ngxobongwanas 
supporters who make up a majority of crossroads estimated 120000 
residents many of his displaced opponents have moved where the 
authorities wanted them into a vast township called khayelitsha 
farther from cape town 
botha accompanied by his wife elize and daughter rozanne 
concluded his visit with a halfhour drive past crossroads shacks 
he inspected a house under construction and spread mortar with a 
trowel later he shook the hand of a boy who ran alongside his car 
botha said the employment center exemplified his governments 
attempts to develop black areas 
to boycott is easy but it leads nowhere botha told about 
200 people in the center to cooperate is sometimes difficult and 
to take responsibility sometimes difficult but history remembers 
only those who build not those who destroy 
the center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry 
bricklaying sewing and other skills botha said 800000 people 
have been trained at such facilities since 1984 
i hope those who are only trying to belittle our country will 
also come and see what can be done if they leave us alone botha 
said 
sen paul simon dill on a fiveday south african visit made 
a simultaneous tour of crossroads he is a strong supporter of 
economic sanctions to protest south africas apartheid policies of 
racial segregation 
since crossroads began to grow in 1974 it was visited regularly 
by police bulldozers and eviction agents 
each time the shacks were smashed they reappeared in a 
different sandy field each time truckloads of women and children 
were driven away to rural homelands separated from their menfolk 
who worked in cape town thousands more families arrived by 1986 
an estimated 200000 blacks lived in its slums 
crossroads at a certain stage was seen almost as the starting 
point of the revolution information minister stoffel van der 
merwe said thursday it is significant that the state president 
is visiting there and no abnormal security will be necessary it is 
symbolic 
its troubled history centered around the governments former 
policy that mixedrace people had preference over blacks for jobs 
in the cape town region and that blacks lived there only as 
temporary workers 
crossroads was born as a result of the governments attempt to 
remove several black spots where blacks lived illegally 
in 1984 botha abandoned the idea that the cape should be a 
jobpreference area for mixedrace people and promised a halt to 
forced removals for separation purposes raids and demolitions 
continued under slum clearance and antisquatting laws 
a cape town court is hearing the first of more than 3000 damage 
suits by those who lost their homes in 1986 they contend police 
helped the vigilantes 
jan van eck an antiapartheid member of parliament said of 
crossroads the black community that rejects an archbishop 
desmond tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor mr pw 
botha is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of 
south africa 
he was referring to graffiti near the main entrance to 
crossroads that says no entry for tutu the black anglican 
leader who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his antiapartheid 
campaign

the tokyo stock exchange said friday that 34 
employees of nippon steel co and sankyo seiki manufacturing co 
bought more than 68000 shares of sankyo stocks before the 
companies announced a major deal 
there was apparently a leak of insider information said 
takao nojiri a senior managing director of the exchange we will 
issue a strict warning to both companies and request them to submit 
their report on the cause of the leak and measures they will 
implement to avoid recurrence of such a case 
fifteen workers of sankyo a precisionmachinery maker and 19 
workers of nippon steel the worlds largest steel maker each 
purchased an average of 2000 shares of sankyo as early as four 
months before the announcement the exchange said 
after markets closed july 29 the companies announced an 
agreement on nippon steels acquisition of a large stake of sankyo 
about a week before the announcement the share price of sankyo 
began skyrocketing the exchange suspected major insider trading 
and launched an unusually thorough investigation 
on the day of the announcement volume of sankyo shares traded 
on the tokyo stock exchange soared as much as 10 times the previous 
days leading the exchange to take an unusual measure of 
suspending the transaction of sankyo shares in the afternoon 
session 
under the current japanese securities law neither the companies 
nor workers will be a subject of criminal charges 
scandals involving stock dealings in recent months intensified 
pressure on the tokyo market to upgrade its ethical standards to 
that of the western countries and forced the finance ministry to 
revise the securities and exchange law 
parliament recently passed a law allowing the finance ministry 
and the exchange a greater investigatory power the law was 
partially implemented tuesday 
a provision enabling securities authorities to press criminal 
charges on insider trading will not take effect until next april 
we have to implement the new law step by step to make it 
work said kazuo futagawa of the finance ministrys securities 
bureau 
the exchange also said some of the 34 employees of nippon and 
sankyo were directly involved in coordinating the agreement but 
officials refused to give the exact number and their names 
under the current law those individuals did not violate any 
law and we cannot say they were involved in insider trading said 
nojiri 
the purpose of our investigation is not to pinpoint the people 
but to find out if there was a lack of appropriate control of 
information within those companies and make them to correct it 
he said 
hitoshi shimakura the exchanges director of the transaction 
review department said some of the employees bought more than 
5000 shares before the deal was announced but he added we 
would rather not go into details of what individuals did 
he also said the exchange will not release the names of 
individuals to their employers 
nippon president yutaka saito met the chairman of the exchange 
michio takeuchi on thursday and expressed regret for his 
employees wrongdoing

the tennessee valley authority is 
scrapping its employee suggestion program until somebody can 
suggest a more economical way to run it 
tva set up the program last fall to encourage costsaving ideas 
but the operation cost the federal utility more to administer than 
it saved 
the idea of the program was good but what we ended up with 
was a bureaucratic convoluted system that took so long to review 
the suggestions that it proved to be ineffective said sue 
wallace acting director of tvas human resources department 
tva received nearly 1000 suggestions from employees over 10 
months including 46 that collectively saved about 580000 ten 
percent of that savings was paid to the employees as a bonuses for 
their ideas 
the problem was that tva spent about 700000 on the program 
including 514000 in staff expenses said ms wallace 
among other things there was a twoinchthick handbook of rules 
specifying who and what could be included in the program to qualify 
for the bonuses 
tva directors voted earlier this week to end the program and a 
group of managers and employees is working on a new system

swedes are proud to have sheltered 
political refugees from all over the world but now theyre finding 
their hospitality abused by spies and terrorists officials say 
fifteen or 20 international terrorists may be moving to sweden 
every year to find sanctuary under false identities police say 
they are among thousands of immigrants or refugees seeking asylum 
the many terrorists we have in this country is the price we 
pay for our open society said krister hansen head of the 
antiterrorist section of the security police 
in a recent book titled espionage in sweden several leading 
defense writers claim that neutral sweden is becoming a playground 
in the game of eastwest espionage the soviet kgb keeps about 100 
agents here while the cia has about 10 the book said 
this week swedish police arrested two hungarianborn swedes 
suspected of being couriers for an international spy ring working 
against nato the ring is alleged to be headed by a former american 
army sergeant in west germany 
sandor kercsik 48 and imre kercsik 34 were arraigned in 
court friday prosecutors said they came to sweden in the 1960s 
both doctors they prospered and were wellliked by their 
neighbors who said they were stunned to learn that the brothers 
were agents of the hungarian intelligence service 
in another case this summer police raided the home of a 
palestinian businessman and uncovered documents indicating he was a 
senior commander of the abu nidal terrorist organization 
samir mohammed khadar married a finnishborn swede and moved 
here two years ago he traveled frequently but led an otherwise 
unremarkable life in a stockholm suburb 
in july khadar was blown apart by a bomb in athens the 
explosion was linked to an assault by a terrorist squad a few hours 
later on the city of poros cruise ship which killed nine people and 
wounded about 90 
before leaving on his fatal mission khadar had stashed away a 
supply of weapons in a forest north of stockholm which police said 
could have been used to attack the nearby arlanda international 
airport or an embassy in the city 
hansen told the svenska dagbladet newspaper this week that eight 
of every 10 people seeking political asylum arrive at arlanda 
airport without passports and police cannot be sure who they 
really are 
after years of largescale immigration sweden may have 25000 
residents whose real identities are unknown he said many could be 
common criminals 
it is not generally done to have a security check on 
prospective immigrants said marie andersson of the immigration 
ministry its up to the police to decide 
a newcomer is asked his name and birth date is photographed and 
fingerprinted and within hours can have a new identity 
last year 16000 people came to sweden seeking asylum and 
another 12000 immigrated for other reasons it can take up to two 
years to process the application and during that time the newcomer 
lives at the governments expense 
people like khadar and the kercsik brothers are able to relocate 
in sweden because of a tradition of open doors 
during world war ii sweden accepted jews and other refugees 
fleeing the nazi onslaught later hungarians came after the 1956 
invasion of their country as did czechs after 1968 
independenceseeking kurds fleeing homes in iran or iraq also 
came some belonged to the shadowy kurdish peoples party which had 
been involved in terrorism sweden refused them asylum but did not 
deport them to their native countries where they risked execution 
members of the kurdish group have been suspects in the unsolved 
1986 assassination of swedish prime minister olof palme although 
no one has been prosecuted in the case 
until the 1970s sweden encouraged immigration to fill jobs no 
one talked about terrorism until then ms andersson said in an 
interview 
even when we didnt need the workers any more the legislation 
never changed and the flow of refugees increased she said 
now despite the recent incidents an overhaul of the system is 
unlikely 
everyone is very proud of our generous policy i dont think 
the politicians want to change it said ms andersson

sen dan quayle conceded today that a 
portion of his resume indicating he spent two years as the chief 
consumer investigator for the indiana attorney generals office is 
inaccurate 
quayle said he did not know how the error occurred but that his 
staff was responsible for putting together his resume 
quayles official senate biography states that from 1970 to 
1971 he was the chief investigator for the consumer protection 
division of the indiana attorney generals office 
but the cleveland plain dealer reported today that quayle 
actually held that position for only two and onehalf months 
if it indicated that that is inaccurate i didnt hold that 
job for two years quayle told reporters aboard his campaign 
plane 
he acknowledged that he held the job for several months but 
said he did not have an exact time frame 
the paper said he was an entrylevel research assistant for most 
of his time in the office 
earlier quayle press secretary david prosperi called the 
newspaper report a cheap shot and said he held the office 
he worked his way up to that position and thats that 
prosperi said he was not sure how many months quayle had held 
the consumer protection job but added the important point is 
that he held the job he didnt make it up 
the plain dealer said the consumer protection division didnt 
even exist in 1970 and quayle had already gone to work in the 
governors office when it was officially opened 
he just helped set it up said robert e lybrook a 
martinsville ind lawyer who became the chief investigator when 
the division officially opened for business in september 1971 
he wasnt chief of anything when he went over there added 
m stanton evans a former editor at the indianapolis news who 
arranged quayles job interview with thenattorney general theodore 
l sendak 
the plain dealer said state records show that quayle went to 
work in the attorney generals office as a legal assistant in 
january 1970 it said the job is similar to that of a law clerk and 
involved drafting memoranda performing research and writing 
letters 
the newspaper said quayle held the investigators job for 2 
months but that state records show he already was working for 
thengov edgar whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the 
consumer division was officially launched 
quayle had completed campaigning for the day when the plain 
dealer story appeared and neither he nor his aides were immediately 
available to comment 
quayles campaign moves west today to montana utah and 
california 
quayles claim to have been chief investigator is contained in 
his senate biography which is being distributed as official 
background by the republican campaign 
the latest disclosures came just as quayle and republican 
presidential nominee george bush were seeing a weeklong dispute 
about quayles military record begin to dissipate 
during his campaign appearances thursday quayle aimed his pitch 
at farmers in missouri and south dakota 
in stops at state fairs in both states quayle met with farmers 
and told them dont let anybody ever tell you that america is 
not still dependent on agriculture and the farmers for our quality 
of life 
he called the trade bill signed into law recently and whose 
principal architect was his democratic counterpart sen lloyd 
bentsen a good first step to send a message that we are very 
serious about trade but promised stronger farm legislation next 
year to enhance exports and make agricultural goods more 
competitive 
quayle was asked in press encounters about his vote last month 
against establishing a cabinetlevel position for the veterans 
administration 
quayle on monday told a veterans group his vote on the va issue 
was a youthful indiscretion but he said at a news conference 
thursday in boonville mo that he did not regret his vote 
but his comments seemed to leave room for doubt as to whether he 
thought the vote was a mistake perhaps my vote was not the right 
vote i still think its the right vote and i stand by my record 
bentsen suggested wednesday that quayle is not mature enough to 
be in a job a heartbeat away from the presidency 
i am qualified if that situation arises quayle said

calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death 
by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to 
earthquake victims

dense bands of locust larvae will explode into 
massive swarms in the next two weeks in central and east africa 
and the insects will inflict severe damage on crops a un agency 
said friday 
the extent of infestation in certain african countries is 
enormous and we are extremely concerned said edouard saouma 
directorgeneral of the un food and agricultural organization 
there is no doubt that there will be heavy damage to crops in the 
middle of the agricultural season 
lukas brader head of the agencys emergency center for locust 
operations said that 14 million to 17 million acres of land in 
chad sudan and niger are infested with dense bands of locust 
larvae 
they are going to explode in the next two weeks and form 
massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural 
lands he said adding that the size of each swarm could cover 
hundreds of square miles 
the plague has reached unprecedented proportions and cannot be 
controlled in the near future brader said 
heavy rains particulary in sudan have created favorable 
breeding conditions for the locusts while the situation has been 
serious for several weeks in chad and sudan the problem has 
worsened sharply in niger recently with about 42 million acres 
infested the fao said

jeff pitman is blind but he sails for the same 
reasons sighted people do fresh air warm sunshine and the feel of 
the wind at his back 
you dont need eyes to sail he says as long as you can 
feel the wind and know where its going to take you 
pitmans not just optimistic sighted volunteers who accompany 
blind sailors in a program held at marinas in the charlestown and 
south boston sections of boston corroborate his claims 
ive learned more from them i havent taught them a thing 
said harry mcdonough 68 a former champion sailor whose courageous 
sailing center sponsors the 10yearold program with the carroll 
center for the blind in newton it is believed to be the only 
organized sailing program for the blind in the country 
mcdonough was inspired to help teach the blind to sail as a 
result of his own experiences learning to sail at age 4 he said 
his father taught him to sail blindfolded so he would learn to 
better sense the wind and gain balance 
its more about feel and balance than sight mcdonough said 
on a recent saturday while he motored around boston harbor checking 
on the blind sailors i always said that someday id teach the 
blind to sail and it works 
when you sail you sail in relation to the wind said 
volunteer guide john trickett 29 all the key factors about 
sailing have nothing to do with sight 
visually impaired people from all over new england participate 
in the sailing program the cost is 1 per season most have never 
been on a small boat when they step gingerly onto the vessels 
when i first went out i was a little scared the whole boat was 
going to tip over with me in it said gil busch but now i 
dont have that feeling anymore i just enjoy it 
rose prescott 41 a rehabilitation counselor blind since age 5 
and melinda conrad 41 who is legally blind travel by bus from 
concord nh every weekend to sail 
we may not beat anyone else out here but we have fun said 
conrad our friends think were a little crazy but then they know 
that well try anything we go crosscountry skiing we went to 
jamaica and london we like being outdoors 
prescott said she was a little fearful at first 
all they say out here is rose to let me know i should do 
something said prescott i kind of fill in the blanks and 
figure out what should be done 
volunteers sail in boats with the blind sailors teaching 
novices how to trim the sails how to tack and reminding them not 
to try to sail against the wind for those with some experience 
the guides are there merely to tell the blind sailors if other 
boats are coming or if they are too near shore 
to be a good sailor you need to be in harmony with the wind 
and the waves and the boat said arthur oneill who directs the 
program for the carroll center 
heather schroder 27 a volunteer guide said she was doubtful 
the blind could sail when she heard about the program but she was 
soon convinced 
it doesnt matter whether youre blind or not she said 
you just need a good instructor 
the blind sailors sail every saturday either at the courageous 
sailing center at the charlestown navy yard or in the protected 
waters of pleasure bay off castle island in south boston 
at the end of the summer they participate in a special regatta 
the rules are simple one sighted volunteer accompanies each blind 
sailor in a boat but the volunteer is not allowed to touch anything 
during the race he or she is allowed only to warn of hazards 
this isnt going to make them to be olympic sailors said 
mcdonough were just teaching them something to love that they 
otherwise would never get a chance to do

project were forced to kneel before drugsniffing dogs or lose 
their jobs an experience one angry union official likened to 
slavery 
municipal officials and representatives of the projects

company that is serving as construction manager said he and other 
managers knew about the search and submitted to it 
workers and managers were invidually taken to a room and asked 
to squat on one knee while a dog sniffed them 
the search which involved more than 200 workers was undertaken 
after a former employee reported that drugs were allegedly being 
used at the construction site the construction industry has a 
certain amount of risk and danger to it and that has to be 
controlled lady said 
clifford keheley dallas public works director said he 
authorized the search the day before it was conducted without 
consulting any other city officials 
they wanted our concurrence and we of course gave it 
immediately keheley said i would have seen a bigger problem 
of not doing it if theres any suspicion at all of illegal 
activity on that site we dont want it 
several workers said they would gladly have submitted to blood 
tests or other samples if there had been probable cause to suspect 
drug use 
this is the only major construction job going on in dallas 
right now and if you didnt submit to that search you got kicked 
off your job scott alcox a 28yearold flagman said it is 
degrading to have to get down on your knees to keep your job

a prosecutor saying there are more 
dangerous people to prosecute than a combative talk show host has 
decided not to arrest morton downey jr on a complaint that he 
scuffled with a weekly newspaper editor during a stage show here 
assistant states attorney burton a kaplan said he has rejected 
an arrest warrant charging downey with breach of peace based on a 
complaint filed by paul bass editor of the 24000circulation new 
haven independent 
i denied the warrant not based on the merits of the case 
because i believe there was a violation by mr downey but based 
on other considerations including the volume of business and the 
resources of this office kaplan said thursday 
downey was in detroit with his producer and publicist jim langan 
on a publicity tour friday according to a member of his shows 
staff at wwortv in secaucus nj who said one of the men would 
comment later 
downey scuffled with bass and james motavelli editor of the 
weekly fairfield county advocate when tempers flared during a show 
aug 14 at the palace performing arts center the show followed the 
confrontational format of downeys syndicated television show 
basss sister sharon bass charged on stage and slapped downey 
in the face after bass and motavelli walked off the 
standingroomonly audience of 2000 cheered 
i understand kaplans need to prioritize bass said 
thursday the courts are overbooked with cases im very glad 
he said in his statement that downey broke the law 
but he added i think its unfortunate that some guy whos a 
celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of 
groupies and he can get away with attacking someone if it was a 
poor black kid with three friends cheering him on i think he would 
get arrested

a squad of army special operations soldiers on 
a routine patrol at howard air force base panama traded gunfire 
with a small group of intruders but no one was hurt pentagon 
officials said friday 
the thursday night incident came as the army was poised to cut 
the required tour length in panama part of a continuing effort to 
reduce the number of military dependents in the troubled central 
american nation 
the service hopes to encourage more soldiers to opt for 
socalled unaccompanied tours leaving their families behind 
by reducing the tour commitment said defense officials who asked 
not to be named 
the exchange of gunfire which occurred thursday evening near an 
oil tank farm was the first such incident in nearly three weeks 
the officials said american soldiers spotted two or three 
intruders before nightfall thursday drawing fire from the 
unidentified men but not returning it later around 9 pm the 
soldiers were patrolling the tank farm area and again spotted 
intruders who again fired this time they returned the gunfire 
the intruders immediately broke contact and slipped into the 
jungle the sources said 
the pending tour reduction plan stemming in part from a 
campaign of harrassment against americans would allow pentagon 
officials to move more military families from civilian housing in 
and around panama city to military housing on us bases 
according to the sources the plan is awaiting final approval 
from gen carl vuono the armys chief of staff and army secretary 
john marsh that should come early next week the officials said 
friday 
once the army acts the other three military services are almost 
certain to follow suit predicted one official 
currently soldiers deployed to panama are expected to serve for 
three years if accompanied by their family and two years if 
unaccompanied the new plan would reduce an accompanied tour to 2 
years and slash the minimum unaccompanied tour to just 15 months 
given all the turmoil were hoping more soldiers will decide 
they can go unaccompanied and stick it out for 15 months said 
one official 
over the past five months the pentagon has succeeded in 
reducing by 50 percent the number of military families living 
outside us bases in panama dropping the total still offbase to 
about 1130 the effort has taken on more momentum this summer 
because of what the united states describes as a deliberate 
campaign of harrassing americans 
us officials in panama city said aug 21 that american 
personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by 
panamanian authorities this year including attempts to extort 
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail 
the harassment comes at a time when the united states is 
continuing to press economic sanctions against panama in a bid to 
oust the countrys leader military strongman manuel a noriega 
noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on 
drug trafficking charges 
panama is the home of the us southern command the 
organization responsible for all us military forces in central 
and south america there are about 10000 american servicemen 
stationed permanently in panama plus about 2200 servicemen who 
have been assigned there on a temporary basis since the spring to 
upgrade security at american bases 
sources said the move to reduce tour lengths for soldiers in 
panama comes amid rumors that noriegas government intends to 
cancel the leases on 100 offbase housing units rented by the army 
itself for military families

foreign minister nguyen co thach said he sent a letter aug 10 
to retired gen john w vessey a special us presidential envoy 
reaffirming vietnams opposition to congressional testimony july 28 
by us assistant secretary of state gaston sigur 
sigur had called for continued isolation of vietnam until it 
ends its decadeold occupation of cambodia 
thach spoke with reporters after talks with thai prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan and foreign minister siddhi savetsila on the 
last day of a fiveday visit he later flew home 
thach gave no details of his letter to vessey but said the 
cause of suspension of cooperation is there so to resume 
cooperation you must liquidate the cause 
vietnam said aug 3 it was temporarily halting participation in 
efforts to account for us servicemen missing in the war and in 
resettling former political prisoners in the united states despite 
recent agreements on those issues 
it cited sigurs testimony as the reason for its decision 
in his testimony sigur argued against a congressional resolution 
urging the establishment of interest sections diplomatic 
missions below the level of embassies in hanoi and washington 
saying the move would not improve cooperation on humanitarian 
issues 
thach and vessey agreed a year ago that vietnam would accelerate 
its accounting of nearly 1800 americans missing in action and in 
return the united states would help vietnam with its humanitarian 
problems 
thach told vessey in july that vietnam would try to resolve 70 
top priority mia cases by years end and welcomed joint 
excavations for remains between august and october 
also last month the two countries held talks on a us offer to 
resettle former us government employees and officials of the 
americanbacked south vietnam government who were sent to 
reeducation camps after the 1975 north vietnamese victory 
thach said that in talks with the thai foriegn minister he 
reaffirmed hanois willingness to take back vietnamese refugees who 
want to return and who pose the biggest burden to thailand but 
he noted that forced mass repatriation is not humanitarian

a kidnapping and attempted murder 
trial was postponed after the defendants lawyer said it would hurt 
the oakland athletics pennant chances and harm the career of his 
clients brother star pitcher dennis eckersley 
a new trial date has been set dec 12 for eckersleys older 
brother wallace 35 who is charged with the 1987 choking beating 
and stabbing of a 59yearold woman and leaving her for dead 
the trial was set aug 22 but a motion to postpone was filed 
aug 4 district court judge james franklin granted the motion 
after a hearing and set the new trial date 
the motion said a defense investigator recently visited 
california following leads and witnesses in order to support the 
defense of intoxication and had uncovered more potential 
witnesses wallace eckersley lives in los angeles 
wallace eckersleys lawyer dennis hartley contended the motion 
for postponement rested largely on the need for more time to 
prepare a defense 
but the twopage motion also dealt with dennis eckersley 33 
and the effect the trial might have on his career if he were called 
in midseason to testify 
the document said eckersley will be a critical defense 
witness 
dennis eckersleys ball club is in first place in their major 
league division and will go to the playoffs in all likelihood 
the court document said the management of the club is absolutely 
opposed to his appearance as a witness until after the baseball 
season 
the calling of dennis eckersley would cause tremendous adverse 
publicity for his ball club and for himself and could have a 
substantial effect on his major league career and this season in 
particular it would be grossly unfair to potentially ruin another 
life or career in this situation the document said 
i think its very interesting about this baseball said the 
victim sigrid marie griswold of colorado springs when i read 
the motion and found three paragraphs devoted to the baseball 
issue i was shocked 
daniel immel of denver pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the case 
and was sentenced in november to 48 years in prison wallace 
eckersley also pleaded guilty but changed his mind after immels 
sentencing and asked for a trial 
reached by telephone in oakland calif athletics general 
manager sandy alderson said thursday he was not aware of a motion 
to postpone and had not been contacted about the possibility of 
dennis eckersley testifying 
we were vaguely aware of something involving his brother 
alderson said but we were not specifically aware of a trial 
pending 
but alderson added that clearly something of this sort would 
be a distraction to dennis during the course of the season from 
our standpoint it would certainly be in our best interest that 
dennis not be involved

smoldering fires and the risk of 
collapsing buildings friday prevented investigators from finding 
the cause of a blaze that destroyed much of the historic chiado 
shopping district 
civil engineers and other experts were told their inquiry would 
have to wait until the fire completely subsided in the cellars of 
the 150 and 200yearold buildings that were used to store highly 
combustible materials such as textiles and paper 
firefighters also said the burnedout shells of the armazens do 
grandela and the grandes armazens do chiado department stores were 
probably beyond propping up and could collapse at any minute 
the fire broke out in the armazens do grandela early thursday 
and in the next four hours swept through buildings on the narrow 
streets of the neighborhood known for its speciality shops and 
cafes where artists and writers gathered 
one man died and 43 people six of whom remained hospitalized 
friday were injured 
fire officials say they dont know what caused the blaze the 
worst in the capital in 200 years news reports raised the 
possibility of arson 
union representatives said about 2000 people mostly clerical 
and shop workers lost their jobs 
lisbon shopowners association president jose ferreira de matos 
put damages at 600 million nearly double the estimate of 
insurance adjustors 
he told a news conference that stores in the entire downtown 
area would suffer from the effects of the fire despite official 
promises to rebuild the chiado 
we fear that people will change their shopping habits he 
said remember that it took 14 years to restore the national 
theater after it burned 
matos said 40 stores were destroyed not counting the offices of 
many lawyers and accountants on upper floors 
lisbon mayor nuno kruz abecasis who met thursday night with 
architects urban planners and cultural officials told reporters 
it would be a year before reconstruction of the area could begin 
matos called the old battered state of the equipment used by 
firefighters shameful 
the daily correiro de manha said reporters sent to the central 
fire station discovered that none of the buildings destroyed in the 
chiado was connected to the departments centralized alert system 
neither of the two department stores had sprinkler systems 
installed and no recent fire inspections had been carried out in 
the areas shops the paper said 
the weekly sabado said the most serious outcome of the fire was 
that lisbon citizens who have long lived with the impression 
that their city is under permanent threat are now aware how 
little is done to avoid such disasters 
jorge monteiro owner of three stores destroyed in the chiado 
fire urged matos to demand an impartial inquiry into why the mayor 
had ignored shopowners protests and built stone planters and 
tables in the middle of the rua do carmo that prevented 
firefighting equipment from reaching the armazens do grandela 
store 
the chiado district is in a part of lisbon that was rebuilt 
following a disastrous 1755 earthquake and fire that destroyed much 
of the medieval part of the city

young workers this summer are experiencing the 
lowest unemployment rate since 1969 with a record 685 percent of 
the nations youths holding jobs the labor department said friday 
the unemployment rate among workers aged 1624 was 109 percent 
in july compared with 117 percent a year ago the department said 
but all of the improvement was among whites blacks did not 
share in any of it the government said only about half of the 
nations black youths have jobs this summer compared with 
threefourths of white youths 
black youths continued to be about twice as likely as whites 
to work in government jobs said the bureau of labor statistics 
their proportion in these jobs however 126 percent this 
summer has dropped 4 full percentage points from the high reached 
two summers ago 
the jobless rate for white youths in july was 89 percent 
compared with 97 percent a year earlier the rate among black 
youths was almost three times higher 253 percent the same as in 
july 1987 
the proportion of youths either working or looking for work 
climbed to an alltime high of 786 percent in july 06 percentage 
point above what it was a year ago 
but because of the continuing decline in the size of the youth 
population the actual number of young workers in the labor force 
has fallen by 270000 in the past year to 253 million the 
department said 
labor force participation among white youths has reached a 
record 794 percent this summer after hovering around 786 percent 
the past four years 
in marked contrast the government said labor force 
participation for black youths which had dropped more than 2 
percentage points between 1986 and 1987 held steady at 657 
percent in july

seek to establish a sphere of influence in cambodia 
zhao also urged japan to invest more in chinas coastal areas 
and said an economically strong china will benefit japan and the 
rest of asia 
takeshitas meeting with zhao concluded two days of extensive 
talks with chinese leaders that both sides said heralded a new era 
of close relations between the two asian countries 
takeshita met earlier friday with president yang shangkun and 
senior leader deng xiaoping who said their countries should seek a 
new type of relationship based on mutual trust japanese 
officials and the official xinhua news agency reported 
zhao said china main backers of the khmer rouge and other 
antivietnamese guerrillas in cambodia supports a democratic 
neutral government in the southeast asian nation

not approve a return to power by the khmer rouge who killed 
hundreds of thousands of people during its 197578 rule 
the national evening news quoted zhao as saying a greater danger 
was that the provietnam government of hun sen would use its 
military strength to gain sole power 
zhao said china demands that vietnam which toppled the khmer 
rouge in 1978 and installed hun sen withdraw all its troops 
vietnam has agreed to pull out its estimated 100000 troops by 1990 
zhao said china seeks the formation of a fourparty coalition 
including hun sen and the threeparty resistance headed by 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
sihanouk frequently at odds with his resistance partners has 
suggested he might seek a government with hun sen that would shut 
out the khmer rouge 
zhao said the four factions should disband their armies and 
establish a unified national defense army with each faction 
contributing equal numbers of troops the evening news said 
japanese officials said takeshita agreed with chinas approach 
and was considering ways to contribute to a political settlement in 
cambodia japan has suggested it might help finance an 
international peacekeeping force 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
takeshita did not offer to act as a mediator in the cambodian 
conflict 
on sunday foreign ministry officials from china and the soviet 
union the main backer of vietnam will meet for the first time in 
beijing to probe ways to end the vietnamese occupation and bring

economic assistance and pushed for japanese participation in his 
pet project the development of chinas coastal areas into a vast 
economic zone for exportoriented processing industries 
on thursday at a meeting with premier li peng takeshita 
announced that japan will provide 64 billion in loans for about 
40 chinese development projects in the 199095 period 
japan accounts for only about 8 percent of foreign investment in 
china well below hong kong and the united states and china has 
complained the japanese are too cautious about putting their money 
into chinese projects

panamanian military leader manuel antonio 
noriega has fired the panamanian consul in tampa fla whose 
office had been used by state department envoys for obtaining visas 
for travel to that country a panamanian diplomat said friday 
the noriega government has been rejecting visas approved by 
panamas consulate in washington because it is staffed by officials 
loyal to ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
as an alternative american diplomats had been obtaining travel 
documents from the tampa consul elizabeth martinez who had 
maintained ties with both the noriega government and delvalle 
loyalists 
but a panamanian diplomat in washington a supporter of 
delvalle said ms martinez was fired this week by noriega 
a receptionist at the tampa consulate reached by telephone 
said ms martinez was ill on friday she said she was unaware of 
the report that ms martinez had been removed from her post 
a state department official could not confirm that ms martinez 
had been fired but said the noriega government was no longer 
accepting visas signed by the tampa consulate the official and the 
panamanian diplomat insisted on anonymity 
another department official said us diplomats have 
alternatives other than the tampa consulate for obtaining visas but 
he refused to elaborate 
the reagan administration has declined to recognize the noriega 
government and regards delvalle as the legitimate authority in 
panama even though he was ousted six months ago and has been in 
hiding in panama ever since 
it also recognizes delvalles ambassador to washington juan b 
sosa as the official panamanian representative in the united 
states 
sosa who has ignored attempts by noriega to replace him told a 
news conference thursday that the embassy officially recognizes the 
tampa consulate implying that ms martinez had broken with noriega 
the new york times said in its editions of last sunday that the 
tampa consulate recently had approved visas for 14 american 
officials who were either serving in panama on expired visas or 
recently assigned to panama 
the administration has barred its diplomats from having official 
dealings with representatives of the noriega government as a 
result us diplomats have been prevented from obtaining visas 
from consuls loyal to noriega

republican george bush on friday accused 
michael dukakis of lax crime policies turning the tables on the 
democrats criticism of reagan administration drug efforts a day 
before 
during a campaign trip in his adopted home state bush also took 
up the defense of his embattled running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana telling a rally that quayle would be an outstanding vice 
president 
bush told the rally in eastern texas that it was an insult 
for dukakis to refer to president reagans drug policies as 
criminal and absurd when thousands of federal and local law 
enforcement officials are putting their lives on the line every 
single day to stop the narcotics flow 
dukakis bush said is the governor who vetoed the mandatory 
sentencing for drug dealers he opposes capital punishment for drug 
king pins and he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous 
furlough program that lets murderers rapists and drug dealers out 
on appeal 
as to his own plans to combat drugs bush who headed a reagan 
task force on drugs said one way we must do it is support our 
local law enforcement officers who are out there every day 
bush also repeated his support for quayle who he has not 
mentioned by name in two previous days of campaigning 
bush touted the congressional qualifications that the bush 
campaign had hoped to emphasize before quayle became embroiled in 
questions about using his family influence to join the national 
guard rather than be drafted during the vietnam war 
heres a man elected twice to the congress twice to the 
senate a wonderfully thoughtful person who has taken a leadership 
role in job retraining but also is a member of the armed 
services committee knows as i do that only a strong america can 
prevent expansion of totalitarianism around the world bush told 
a hall filled with about 2500 supporters 
hell be an outstanding vice president 
bush telephoned quayle from his plane friday morning said bush 
chief of staff craig fuller the vice president told quayle i 
think things are going very well 
bush last spoke to his 41yearold running mate two days 
earlier said press secretary shiela tate who said the two keep 
in touch 
bush aides said the campaign believes the firestorm over quayle 
has peaked quayle himself now refuses to answer further questions 
about his national guard service 
bush is pushing hard to tout his credentials as a texan a state 
where he moved 40 years ago to go into the oil business and later 
served as a member of the house 
this is a key state and im not going to let them take it away 
from me he told the longview rally its my state i 
understand this state 
at the end of his speech bush briefly donned a white 10gallon 
hat he put it on again at the airport before leaving longview and 
when he stepped off air force two in houston 
he told the texans he would do more for them than dukakis 
highlighting their differences on energy defense and gun control 
my opponent opposes offshore drilling and i support it 
bush said 
he also called for a tax credit for oil exploration to increase 
the industry drilling rig count adding and i do know what a rig 
count is 
he reiterated his support for the strategic defense initiative 
which dukakis opposes he says it is fantasy i say it is 
essential i will support research vigorously and fully and when it 
is ready i will deploy it bush said

a judge friday ordered the seizure of jewelry and 
other luxury items that maria desillers allegedly bought with some 
of the 690000 donated by strangers last year for her dying sons 
liver transplants 
dade probate judge francis christie granted a request from 
lawyers for a courtappointed curator of the estate of ronnie 
desillers who died in april 1987 at age 7 the order also struck 
ms desillers 150000 claim on the estate 
im going to ruin you lady a furious ms desillers said as 
the curator karen gievers left the judges chamber friday ms 
gievers ignored the comments and declined to say anything about 
them later 
you call this justice shell never run for public office in 
this state ms desillers said loudly as her attorneys sought to 
quiet her 
in a separate ruling thursday christie dismissed ms gievers 
request to hold ms desillers in contempt for not handing over 
records of her purchases and the disputed items themselves which 
include a diamondsapphire ring and diamondstudded gold cross 
being forced under threat of jail to turn over the records and 
purchases could violate ms desillers right against 
selfincrimination because criminal investigations are under way 
in dade and broward counties the judge had ruled thursday 
michael dribin an attorney for ms gievers said having a third 
party seize the items did not expose ms desillers to 
selfincrimination fridays order does not cover the records only 
the disputed items 
ms gievers has estimated that the amount of donations that ms 
desillers may have improperly spent on herself family and friends 
was 200000 
the seizure order does not list any dollar value for the items 
besides the ring and the cross it includes such things as an ibm 
computer a diamondstudded gold bracelet about 4000 in 
furniture a car phone and a gold watch 
ms gievers declined to say when the seizure might take place 
the national spotlight turned on ms desillers in early 1987 
after the theft of 4000 raised by ronnies classmates for a 
needed transplant donations poured in including 1000 from 
president reagan and 200000 from miami beach millionaire victor 
posner 
ronnie died after three failed liver transplants at pittsburgh 
childrens hospital his mother has refused to pay the 262000 
balance of his medical bill claiming the boy received inadequate 
care a charge the hospital denies vehemently 
ms gievers an attorney was appointed curator of the childs 
estate in march after ms desillers handling of the donations 
came under fire when it was learned she rented an apartment in a 
posh waterfront apartment building and had purchased a used bmw 
for 13500 
roy black one of ms desillers lawyers 33 says some of his 
clients purchases may not be improper as claimed because some of 
the donations were given for her personal use 
black said his client has been unfairly portrayed as greedy 
and grasping when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families 
with sick children

a senate committee accused the reagan 
administration friday of placing excessive political pressure on 
the federal reserve board to speed up the growth of the nations 
supply of money 
since the time of the stock market crash in october of 1987 
the federal reserve has come under excessive political pressure 
from the administration the senate banking committee said in a 
report 
remarks by former treasury secretary james baker and council of 
economic advisers chairman beryl sprinkel as well as a letter 
written by assistant treasury secretary michael darby were cited as 
examples of political pressure 
following the october 1987 crash the federal reserves open 
markets committee sent a large infusion of cash into the economy 
but then began tightening again rekindling administration concerns 
the report quoted federal reserve chairman alan greenspan as 
saying he was concerned about efforts to influence the fed and that 
such moves might end up backfiring because we will feel a 
necessity to do precisely the opposite 
in los angeles presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater rejected 
the reports contention 
we are not doing that fitzwater said the banking 
committee is wrong the fed is independent we are not applying 
pressure of any kind 
four republican members of the panel also issued a statement 
saying the report loses objectivity and perspective in 
portraying the remarks of sprinkel and darby as an effort to 
exert improper pressure 
the statement was signed by sens jake garn rutah david k 
karnes rneb kit bond rmo and phil gramm rtexas 
the republicans also scoffed at the reports contention that 
sprinkel attempted to influence the federal reserve through the 
press saying his views were not supposed to be kept secret and 
noting that the banking committee itself had called him as a 
witness in open hearings 
the report said sprinkel has made repeated attempts to 
influence federal reserve policy through the press and through 
criticisms published in the economic report of the president for 
1988 
it said darby wrote a letter to the governors of the federal 
reserve board and to the reserve bank presidents on the federal 
open market committee just before the february meeting suggesting 
that money growth was too slow 
the report said the remarks could be ironically 
counterproductive because they could result in the fed acting 
less vigorously than it otherwise would in the recommended 
direction or acting in a direction contrary to the suggesting of 
the administration in an effort to preserve the federal reserves 
reputation for independence 
the problems of political independence are particularly acute 
at the present time when all members of the board of governors were 
appointed by the reagan administration said the report 
the report described as somewhat diversionary attempts by 
some within the administration to blame the crash on the feds 
slowgrowth policy preceding october 1987 
it said slow growth was a result of an agreement between the fed 
and the administration made necessary by the 1987 louvre accord 
between the united states and six other major industrial nations 
the accord was aimed at stabilizing the dollar after a twoyear 
lowering 
the administration is therefore jointly responsible for the 
slow rate of money growth and any of the resulting consequences 
the report said attempts to single out the federal reserve as 
the scapegoat for the stock market crash or any of the consequences 
of the slower than normal growth in the money supply are therefore 
incredible

the navy said friday it would begin random 
drug testing of selected civilian employees this fall 
the service said its final plan for the tests had been signed 
aug 6 by navy secretary william ball and that 81000 of the navys 
337000 civilian workers are being notified they will be subject to 
urinalysis testing for drugs 
although testing legally could begin as early as oct 6 the 
navy does not plan to start the program until early november said 
lt ken ross a navy spokesman 
the navy becomes the second military service to launch a testing 
program for civilian workers the army already is testing civilian 
workers in sensitive positions the air force still is working on 
its testing guidelines 
all of the military services have long tested men and women on 
active duty 
three months ago the department of health and human services 
forwarded to congress the drug testing plans of 24 different 
government agencies technically clearing the way for the agencies 
to begin testing when they were ready 
the plans were developed as part of a broad administration 
campaign to ensure a drugfree workplace 
in forwarding the defense departments plan to congress hhs 
said the pentagon had tagged about 200000 civilian positions as 
sensitive enough to warrant testing but did not provide a 
breakdown among the various services 
the department employs about 1 million civilian workers 
according to ross most of the 81000 navy positions designated 
as subject to testing are in the areas of public health and 
safety protection of life and property law enforcement and 
national security 
civilian workers who receive a notice that their job has been 
designated sensitive and who then immediately request 
assistance for drug use will be offered counseling and 
rehabilitation without penalty ross said 
those who do not voluntarily come forward in the very beginning 
and who subsequently test positive for drugs will be subject to 
administrative and punitive sanctions up to and including 
dismissal the spokesman said 
ross said the navy plans to test about 20000 civilians during 
the first year of its program unlike military personnel the 
civilian workers will be allowed to provide urine samples without 
being directly observed the spokesman said 
the drugs to be tested for include marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and phencyclidine

george bush and republican ticketmate dan quayle depicted 
michael dukakis as weak on crime on friday and the vice president 
said his democratic rivals criticism of reagan administration 
antidrug efforts were an insult 
dukakis spent the day working in his governors office in 
massachusetts and offered no immediate rebuttal to he latest 
republican campaign blasts democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen called for more spending on rural health care 
programs as he toured mississippi 
bush behaved more and more like a man who felt the controversy 
surrounding his running mates service in the indiana national 
guard was fading the vice president talked with quayle by 
telephone for the first time in two days and reporters were told 
that bush advised his running mate that things are going very 
well 
but quayle also conceded an error in his official biography 
after his press spokesman first denounced a newspaper story about 
the matter as a cheap shot 
the indiana senator said it was inaccurate to say that he 
had spent two years working as chief consumer investigator for the 
indiana attorney generals office but blamed the error on his 
staff if it indicated that that is inaccurate he said of his 
official biography i didnt hold the job for two years 
the issue arose after the plain dealer of cleveland reported 
that quayle actually held the position for a little over two 
months quayle was hired as an entrylevel employee in the attorney 
generals office in indiana in 1970 several months before the 
consumer division was created he later held the investigator 
position 
but after more than a week of fending off controversy about 
quayle and his service in the national guard the republicans went 
on the offensive 
bush attacked dukakis as he spent his second straight day trying 
to firm up support in his and bentsens home state of texas 
he is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing for 
drug dealers he opposes capital punishment for drug kingpins and 
he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous furlough program 
that lets murderers rapists and drug dealers out on appeal the 
vice president said of his democratic opponent 
bush also fired back at dukakis sharp attack thursday on the 
reagan administrations war on drugs dukakis said parts of it were 
criminal and added the enterprise was a failure 
that is an insult bush said adding that his democratic 
rival should have noted that many federal and local law enforcement 
personnel have lost their lives trying to stop the illegal flow of 
narcotics 
his press aide sheila tate denied the vice president was 
shifting his position on star wars bush said three weeks ago he 
favors deployment of the missile defense system as soon as 
feasible in an interview with the new york times bush noted 
that full deployment would be very expensive and said any 
decision would have to await further research 
quayle campaigning in billings mont criticized dukakis for 
supporting gun control during his tenure as governor of 
massachusetts americans would be much better off if our opponent 
believed in crime control rather than gun control he said 
dukakis tended to state business but paused to answer a 
question after swearing in a new transportation official asked 
about bushs statement on star wars the governor said i think 
hes taking the right position and im pleased that he has 
dukakis has long been a firm opponent of the reagan 
administrations spacebased missile defense proposal while bush 
is a supporter 
aides said dukakis would soon scale back the amount of time he 
devotes to statehouse duties and increase his campaigning around 
the country from three days a week to five or six 
bentsen on a swing through the south went with 87yearold 
sen john stennis to a hospital ward where premature infants are 
cared for he later said he will continue to seek increased 
spending for rural health care programs including those dealing 
with newborns 
bentsen was unable to make a scheduled appearance in atlanta 
later in the day when his chartered jet was grounded 
the front door of the boeing 737 was damaged when federal agents 
guarding the plane forced it closed they broke a hinge mechanism 
which props the door open when its on the ground and that in turn 
punctured the door the damage meant the door might not stay open 
in case of an emergency evacuation and the federal aviation 
administration ordered repairs said campaign spokesman mike 
mccurry 
the incident came on the heels of several mishaps with planes 
chartered for reporters covering bushs campaign but it marked the 
first time a candidate had to alter his travel plans because of 
problems with his aircraft 
in washington onetime dukakis rival jesse jackson pledged to 
get out the vote for the democratic ticket dukakis and bentsen 
represent an alternative a chance to change jackson said 
in the colorful rhetoric that marked his campaign jackson said 
bush and quayle want to privatize the justice department they 
want to privatize foreign policy they want to privatize public 
education and since they like privacy so much i want to help them 
move back into private life

bomb squad conducted carefully controlled explosions over five 
hours to make the device harmless police said

toyota motor corp sometimes repays dealers who 
make repairs on outofwarranty parts but an executive on friday 
denied that the practice constitutes a secret warranty used to 
quiet customers who complain 
bob daly toyotas national service operations manager 
confirmed information from a 12page toyota document published 
friday in the detroit news that lists 41 components for which 
toyota motor sales usa can be reimbursed by its japanese parent 
company 
the reimbursements let dealers provide free service on the 
components but toyota spokesman jerry giaquinta stressed that the 
list does not set guidelines on what work can be done free of 
charge 
toyota district offices decide what parts will be repaired or 
replaced without charge he said 
the document lists items including cracked dashboard pads 
peeling blue paint slipping automatic transmissions worn engine 
cylinders camshafts cruise controls catalytic converters fuel 
pumps and brakes 
daly said a customer generally has to complain to get the free 
repairs 
a dealer might point out to him that a component shouldnt 
have failed and offer to seek reimbursement from toyota but in 
most cases it would be up to the customer to request it he said 
most automakers long have acknowledged paying for selected 
postwarranty repairs to keep customers satisfied but toyotas 
list apparently is the longest made public the newspaper said 
clarence ditlow director of the center for auto safety a 
public interest group in washington dc called the policy a 
secret warranty used to quiet complaining customers while 
others who do not complain are charged for the same repairs 
what theyre doing is taking care of customers who are likely 
to cause them image problems by squawking too loudly while 
ignoring thousands of others who dont complain ditlow said 
we do not have a secret warranty daly said we make a 
casebycase determination under our customer satisfaction policy 
whether to reimburse for a repair that occurs beyond the normal 
warranty

local officials have asked the 
federal aviation administration to investigate north perry airport 
after a small plane crash killed three people the latest in a 
string of accidents at the airport a county spokesman said friday 
meanwhile federal investigators were at the printing shop that 
was destroyed when a twinengine piper aerostar crashed shortly 
after takeoff thursday and exploded into flames all three people 
aboard the plane were killed 
they are still there completing the onscene investigation and 
getting ready to move some of the wreckage said george prellezo 
of the national transportation safety board office in miami faa 
officials also are examining the wreckage 
before thursdays crash four people had been killed in 16 
accidents involving planes taking off or landing at the airport in 
this fort lauderdale suburb since 1982 broward county spokesman 
ron gardner said the airport is used mainly by small planes 
gardner said faa officials in florida had agreed to the county 
aviation departments request for an investigation he also said 
the department had asked the national aircraft owners and pilots 
association and the north perry airport safety committee to examine 
the airports operations 
jack barker an faa spokesman in atlanta said he was not aware 
of plans to investigate the airport nevertheless he said a 
special faa inspection of the facility in may found fewer safety 
problems than a similar inspection a year before 
county officials recently announced a 575000 plan to add 1000 
feet to the 3000foot airport runways 
this will put aircraft at a higher altitude when they cross 
the airports boundaries and this gives a pilot who gets in 
trouble the maneuverability area to possibly turn back to the 
airport gardner said 
some residents of the densely populated neighborhoods 
surrounding the airport strongly oppose to the small aircraft 
traffic 
im going to start a petition to get those small planes out of 
here said real estate broker jeanette piazza im serious 
about this 
according to witnesses and faa reports the sixseat piper 
circled several times before clipping power lines and plunging into 
a strip shopping plaza about a mile from the runway 
he didnt get very high maybe 100 to 150 feet at the most 
said bruce hill an accident investigator with the ntsb 
faa spokesman charles wright in atlanta said no flight plan was 
filed and the planes destination was unknown but gardner said 
flight plans arent required for many local flights 
the dead pilot was identified as lewis phillips 55 who owns 
lauderdale aviation at north perry names of his two passengers 
were not immediately released 
a typesetter at the printing shop kelli crist 24 suffered 
burns over 27 percent of her body and was in critical condition at 
jackson memorial hospital in miami said spokesman michael mirando 
three other stores in the shopping center were destroyed 
officials estimate the damage at about 1 million 
im a pilot myself said phillips widow pat i know 
theres been a lot of problems at that airport and i dont want it 
to look bad or i dont want my husband to look bad

michael dukakis applauded republican rival george 
bushs statement that deployment of the costly star wars space 
defense system should be contingent on further research saying 
friday that im glad to see that the vice president now agrees 
with me 
the massachusetts governor spent friday at the statehouse but 
campaign aides said his time in the capital would soon begin 
dwindling they said dukakis planned to spend only one full day in 
boston after labor day devoting at least five days a week to 
campaigning 
dukakis only public event was a swearingin ceremony for a new 
member of the massachusetts port authority the agency that 
oversees logan international airport the boston fish pier and 
several roads and commerce centers 
he was not scheduled to field questions from reporters but he 
responded when asked about bushs comments published in fridays 
editions of the new york times that the strategic defense 
initiative the formal name for the space defense system was 
very expensive and that deployment decisions should await 
further research 
dukakis said the comments showed that bush was backing away from 
his earlier position although the vice president said several 
weeks ago that he would deploy the system as soon as it was 
feasible 
i think that makes sense dukakis said of bushs latest 
statement im glad to see that the vice president now agrees 
with me and a great number of american citizens 
dukakis was attending a fundraiser friday evening and heading 
to washington on saturday to participate in ceremonies marking the 
25th anniversary of the civil rights march on the nations capital 
led by the late martin luther king jr

farmers suffering drought losses will not be 
allowed to double up on benefits under ongoing emergency livestock 
feed provisions and the new disaster payment program the 
agriculture department said friday 
undersecretary roland r vautour said that if a farmer has a 
crop loss that would qualify him for both programs he cannot 
collect on the same loss twice 
however a livestock producer who has a loss of 1988 crop corn 
production could receive emergency livestock feed assistance based 
on part of his loss and disaster payments based on the remainder 
vautour said 
the basic restrictions are spelled out by the disaster 
assistance act of 1988 vautour said the while the statutory 
provisions of the new law went into effect on friday the 
regulations and operating procedures which will implement these 
provisions have not been completed 
producers should start assembling their sales receipts and 
other data to substantiate their actual production information 
he said 
department officials have said they hope to begin actual 
operation of the 39 billion droughtaid law by oct 1 at that 
time they hope farmers can begin applying at country offices of 
the departments agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service for benefits

besides the damage the 
forest fires ravaging the nations oldest park are giving those 
visitors who are still around a new persective on a landscape 
normally crowded with summer tourists 
at mud volcano an area of boiling cauldrons several miles north 
of fishing bridge the smell of smoke from distant fires mingled 
with the stench of sulfer from the cauldrons 
the fires have charred more than 400000 acres of forest and 
forced large sections of the park to close 
the parking lot for mud volcano is sprawling but melanie and 
lanny simcoff and their children were alone in it one other small 
group was working its way along the boardwalk through the area 
the family from san francisco had planned to leave the 
community of lake on wednesday and head south into grand teton 
national park but the fires closed the road to grand teton 
were going to go back to lake and rent a rowboat and row 
around by ourselves said mrs simcoff actually though i 
kind of enjoy being alone in yellowstone at the height of the 
tourist season 
ed and sue kline were staying at fishing bridge a small resort 
on the north end of yellowstone lake that has avoided the flames 
weve been just enjoying ourselves on this side of the park 
said kline of irvine calif well do some fishing go on a 
couple of hikes and make the best of a difficult situation 
bob shaw assistant manager of the general store at fishing 
bridge shook his head at his almost empty store which had roughly 
a dozen people in it friday morning 
normally the first three weeks in august are peak season 
said shaw 
sandy snell is a rangernaturalist who has been turned into a 
media escort once the fires are gone shell have a new lesson to 
impart on park visitors 
well tell people about what happened this summer about it 
being an usually dry year and about park service policy on fires 
she said and well talk a lot about fire ecology and hopefully 
give people walks through some of the fire areas and compare them 
with some of the unburned areas 
it will be a real good opportunity to see the changes that 
take place snell added its like a living laboratory well

sen paul simon defended us 
sanctions against south africa on friday the end of a fiveday 
visit and contended that most blacks support the measures 
simon an illinois democrat who ran unsuccessfully earlier this 
year for his partys presidential nomination said the united 
states has the responsibility to protest south africas system of 
race discrimination 
referring to silence in america when adolf hitler first began 
persecuting jews he said we dont want to repeat that 
simon heads the senate foreign relations subcommittee on african 
affairs and will have a major role in debate on pending legislation 
to stiffen us sanctions 
at a news conference friday simon said washington should wait 
for greater political change before easing sanctions even if south 
africas white authorities free nelson mandela the african 
national congress leader who is serving a life prison sentence 
one of the ways that dismay will be expressed is through 
sanctions by my country and increasingly by other nations also 
simon said 
we find no pleasure in imposing sanctions it is not done as 
punishment but as the only clear signal we know how to send that 
we want this great country of yours to also become a just country 
simon met with both government and opposition leaders during his 
tour 
he said some blacks he met opposed sanctions but he said a 
majority support them many americans who oppose sanctions say they 
hurt south african blacks more than the government and south 
africa has made similar arguments 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
government officials say they are pursuing gradual race reforms 
and will not be hurried by sanctions 
the sanctions approved by the us congress in 1986 forbid all 
new public and private loans to this nation and bar trade in 
certain products

the person who did this to my child said the mother but the 
feeling never left me and i always had a very strong premonition 
that he would return 
police said the woman standing at the same bus stop where her 
daughter was attacked in june 1987 acted as a decoy while her 
armed husband watched and waited in the dark 
the couple who agreed to a news conference on the condition 
they not be identified said they staked out the spot only a few 
times before the wife was attacked aug 5 she was grabbed from 
behind carried to a nearby yard and thrown to the ground before 
her husband managed to frighten the man off the couple got a 
license number that led to biddings arrest 
biddings 34 was charged by the grand jury with 12 counts of 
rape six counts of kidnapping two counts of aggravated robbery 
and one count of felonious assault in connection with the attack on 
the mother and the rapes of her daughter and four others 
prosecutor michael miller said the investigation is continuing 
and more charges could be brought the nickname handcuff rapist 
resulted from the use of handcuffs early in the fouryear series of 
attacks 
at the news conference the couple sat nervous and unsmiling 
but holding hands as reporters questioned them their 23yearold 
daughter was with them and all three were hidden from television 
cameras by a screen 
the mother said she and her husband decided to go looking for 
their daughters attacker shortly after the incident occurred she 
said she was never afraid during the stakeouts 
i was furious she said 
her husband said police discouraged both of them 
i was not hesitant at taking the law into my own hands he 
said me and my wife had concerns we had talked about it for 
numerous numerous hours the dangers of it i made a serious 
attempt at discouraging her from doing it 
their daughter said she had no idea what her parents were doing 
initially 
after i found out i was very scared for them and i was upset 
that my mother was hurt over this she said im very proud of 
them however 
the courthouse news conference was arranged by the prosecutors 
office in addition to media inquiries the office said it had also 
been deluged by people interested in producing a television movie 
about the case 
i dont understand all the attention actually the mother 
said were private people we did what we had to do and dont 
feel we should get any credit for doing anything were 
embarrassed im very embarrassed 
although their persistence paid off the couple said they would 
discourage others from doing the same 
its very dangerous everything went wrong it didnt happen 
the way it was supposed to the mother said he wasnt supposed 
to get his hands on me i could have been killed 
but their daughter said the arrest encouraged her 
it makes me feel like there is hope the daughter said 
never give up on your police and not to be afraid to step forward 
because even though he has assaulted you and its all said and 
done maybe you can stop him from assaulting someone else and stop 
someone else from going through the pain

researchers have determined 
something other than a viral epidemic killed thousands of north sea 
seals but a government spokesman making the announcement friday 
refused to give the cause 
officials in london said seals had begun to die in british 
waters and estimated more than 10000 of the marine mammals have 
died in recent months 
if accurate that estimate would represent a major increase in 
the number scientists elsewhere in western europe have estimated 
the number about 3000 lower 
animal health experts and environmentalists had speculated 
chemical pollution in the water may have lowered the seals ability 
to fight disease 
the dutch national institute for public health and environmental 
protection has determined what caused the seal deaths and is 
working on a cure according to a health ministry official who 
spoke friday on condition of anonymity she said the researchers 
would disclose their findings next week 
neither the herpes nor the picorna viruses widely held 
responsible for the seal deaths are the main cause the spokeswoman 
said adding that the findings resulted from months of research by 
the institute and the seal clinic in the nothern dutch village of 
pieterburen western europes biggest hospital for seals 
she said the researchers have proved it was one definite 
factor that killed the seals although other factors may have 
contributed to the disease the spokeswoman said it was the 
straw that broke the camels back all the dead seals had it 
the disease apparently undermines the mammals diseasefighting 
immune system and they usually die of pneumonia or liver infection 
whether environmental pollution has played a role i dont know 
she said 
according to the spokewoman the researchers are expecting to 
disclose details of a possible cure for the disease when they 
publish their findings thursday in the british scientific magazine 
nature 
all im allowed to say is that im very happy seal clinic 
director leniet hart told the associated press 
since may 1 a total of 216 seals died along britains coasts 
and 18 perished killed off northern ireland officials of the 
governmentrun natural environment research council said friday in 
london 
officials of the councils sea mammal research unit said more 
than 10000 seals have died in the north sea they estimated the 
world population at 500000 
previous estimates said up to 3500 seals have died in west 
german coastal waters and 3000 more deaths had cut the danish seal 
population in half more than 800 were reported to have died off 
norway and the netherlands 
britains royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
said it had organized a conference for next tuesday to formulate 
plans to handle the immediate problems created by dead and dying 
seals

jane fondas apology for supporting north vietnam 
during the vietnam war has failed to impress the veterans of 
foreign wars who voted to ask congress to try her for treason 
during their 89th annual convention this week 13400 vfw 
delegates adopted three resolutions concerning fonda including one 
saying a mere apology is not enough to redeem the situation 
the vfw also denounced her upcoming movie union street and 
called for her to be tried by the united states government as a 
traitor the last resolution passed unanimously by voice vote 
how do you go back 20 years and make amends vfw spokesman 
vern pall said what is this woman really after this is no way 
to redeem the hurt and pain she caused those troops in vietnam 
fonda an ardent opponent of us involvement in vietnam took a 
highly publicized trip to hanoi in 1972 
last june at her request she appeared on the abc program 
2020 saying she was very sorry for some of what i did 
fondas publicist steve rivers said friday from los angeles 
the justice department stated in 1972 that jane hadnt done 
anything wrong 
fonda reached an outofcourt settlement with the federal 
government in 1979 in which she agreed not to press a 1 million 
lawsuit in exchange for the fbis admission that it spied on her 
improperly and its promise to adhere to justice department 
guidelines in the future 
one resolution passed by the group wednesday said the vfw is 
not insensitive to a sincere expression of contrition 
but the vfw wants to be assured that the apology is not 
simply a means of bolstering her sagging career and political 
fortunes it said 
fondas husband california assemblyman and former antiwar 
activist tom hayden has faced similar campaigns including an 
unsuccessful attempt by veterans groups to have him ousted from the 
legislature as a traitor in 1986

two bombs jolted the moslem part of the 
city friday and residents joined a strike against what they view as 
israeli and us support for christian militias blocking election 
of a prosyrian president 
the bombs exploded in west beirut in the early evening within 
hours of each other police said but no casualties were reported 
one went off at a garbage dump and the other in a narrow street 
off a commercial district they shattered windows and wrecked 
shutters of shops in both areas no group claimed responsibility 
in south lebanon un peacekeeping troops what they suspected 
of being a car bomb but the vehicle did not contain explosives 
the strike closed government offices banks shops restaurants 
gasoline stations amusement centers and other businesses in west 
beirut and areas policed by syrian soldiers sponsors said 
bakeries pharmacies hospitals and the news media were exempt 
however life was normal in christian east beirut and the 
385squaremile christian enclave northeast of the capital police 
said 
the lebanese forces the main christian militia opposed the 
strike and a spokesman described it as a reflection of syrias 
hegemony 
the syrians have forced their surrogates to call the strike 
after the defeat of their candidate in the first round of the 
presidential elections the lebanese forces official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
syria is lebanons main power broker it has 40000 soldiers 
stationed in the north and south and in sections of beirut 
parliament failed aug 18 to muster the needed quorum to elect a 
president the only serious candidate was suleiman franjieh 
syrias closest christian ally in lebanon and a personal friend of 
syrian president hafez assad 
leftists and moslem militia leaders have blamed parliaments 
failure to elect franjieh 78 on american and israeli opposition 
beiruts leading independent daily paper annahar said last week 
the quorum was not achieved because the united states opposed the 
election of a confrontational candidate 
several businessmen in west beirut voiced doubt that the strike 
would lead to the election of a new head of state before the 
sixyear term of president amin gemayel expires sept 23 
this is playacting said a grocer who identified himself 
only as abu musbah i dont believe that a president brought in 
by a strike would be good for a country which has been on strike 
for years 
he was referring to the 13yearold civil war which has claimed 
more than 130000 lives and shattered the nations economy once 
the most flourishing in the middle east 
a spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon said fijian 
soldiers found the red renault deserted a few yards from their 
checkpoint and reported it was rigged with a quantity of 
explosives 
the peacekeepers swedish engineers fired two antitank shells 
at the car almost seven hours after it was discovered deserted the 
spokesman said 
the shells exploded destroying the vehicle there was no other 
explosion apparently the car didnt contain any explosives said 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
un troops sealed off the area and blocked traffic along the 
coastal highway south of the port of tyre after the car was 
discovered

the security council condemned on friday 
the use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war expressing deep 
dismay over their more intense and frequent use against iran 
the 15 council members voted unanimously to condemn the use of 
chemical weapons a violation of a 1925 geneva protocol 
the britishsponsored resolution did not name iraq as the 
attacker but cited reports by un chemical weapons experts 
accusing the government in baghdad of using poison gas including a 
mustard gas attack on an iranian city aug 2 
at that time both iran and iraq had accepted security council 
resolution 598 demanding a ceasefire in the 8yearold war but no 
truce date had been set 
peace talks opened thursday in geneva a kurdish guerrilla 
group the kurdish democratic party claims iraq dropped poison gas 
bombs on six kurdish villages in northern iraq that day 
kurds have been fighting iraq iran and turkey for more than 50 
years for a separate homeland 
sir crispin tickell the british ambassador to the united 
nations said there are extremely delicate discussions taking 
place in geneva at the moment we would not wish to do anything to 
upset those discussions 
the resolution makes perfectly clear in the preamble who we 
think has been using chemical weapons and i think its best for 
the moment to leave it at that 
the preamble notes the security council is deeply dismayed by 
the investigative missions conclusions that there had been 
continued use of chemical weapons in the conflict between iran and 
iraq and that such use against iranians had become more intense and 
frequent 
iraq admitted last month that it had used chemical weapons but 
claimed iran used them first iran says it has the ability to 
produce such weapons but has not done so 
the resolution asked other nations to halt the export of 
chemicals used to produce such weapons and encouraged 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to promptly investigate 
allegations of the use of chemical weapons 
it noted the continuing negotiations of the conference on 
disarmament in geneva on banning the development production and 
stockpiling of chemical weapons and arranging the destruction of 
current stockpiles 
the 1925 geneva protocol bans the use of chemical and biological 
weapons but does not prohibit their manufacture 
the security council passed a similar resolution in may but 
that one did not specifically cite the use of chemical weapons 
against iranians 
on tuesday the security council released a report by un 
investigators that blamed iraq for using mustard gas aug 2 in an 
air raid on oshnaviyah an iranian city near the northeast corner 
of iraq 
un experts found chemical and medical evidence of mustard gas 
use and found splinters of shells similar to those found after 
attacks on iranian civilians in 1984 1986 1987 and earlier this 
year indicating their utilization during an iraqi air attack on 
oshnaviyeh 
iranian authorities said the air raid injured 2680 civilians 
no deaths were reported the un experts interviewed 24 patients 
who were still hospitalized when they visited the areas aug 1214 
council members stood for a minute of silence at the opening of 
their meeting friday in memory of pakistans president mohammad zia 
ulhaq who died in a plane crash aug 17

the un chief recessed persian gulf peace talks 
friday for a day of reflection after a fourhour session during 
which iran and iraq apparently took uncompromising positions on how 
define their common border 
i hope that on sunday after reflection flexibility perhaps 
will start un secretary general javier perez de cuellar told 
reporters after presiding over a joint session with the two 
delegations we are making progress slowly but we are trying 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati first raised the 
border problem in a brief public statement friday the second day 
of talks which are expected to last months if not years 
he said iran insists that implementation of the un ceasefire 
resolution 598 which provides for withdrawal of forces to 
internationally recognized boundaries be based on a 1975 treaty 
between iran and iraq 
that treaty was aimed at settling centuries of border disputes 
between iran and iraq president saddam hussein of iraq repudiated 
it on sept 17 1980 five days before iraqi forces invaded iran 
following border clashes iraq wants the peace talks to include a 
renegotiation of the border 
velayati also made it plain that iran wants an independent body 
to be formed quickly to assign blame for the 8yearold war which 
claimed more than a million dead or wounded 
iran expects the body to identify iraq as the aggressor a 
verdict that could also be the basis for reparation claims 
velayati called the 1975 treaty and an outline plan prepared 
by perez de cuellar for putting the treaty into effect vital 
criteria for reaching peace 
the most controversial part of the 1975 treaty made the southern 
boundary between iran and iraq the middle of the shattalarab 
waterway iraqs only access to the sea at the persian gulf the 
treaty granted iran its claim to the eastern half of the 127mile 
waterway 
a major cause of the war was the dispute over the shattalarab 
the truce continued to hold meanwhile but guerrilla groups from 
both sides traded new accusations of governmentordered massacres 
in new york the un security council condemned the use of 
chemical weapons in the war expressing deep dismay over their 
more intense and frequent use against iran 
the britishsponsored resolution adopted unanimously by the 
15member council did not name iraq as the attacker but cited 
reports by un chemical weapons experts blaming baghdad for using 
poison gas including a mustard gas attack on the iranian city of 
oshnaviyah on aug 2 
after thursdays twohour opening talks in geneva facetoface 
talks were abandoned temporarily and both sides stayed in separate 
chambers with un officials meeting them and reporting back to 
perez de cuellar 
but friday afternoon both parties met again in joint session 
outside the sprawling un complex about 200 exiled iraqi kurds 
protested iraqs use of chemical weapons and waved banners 
demanding stop the massacre of kurds 
a kurdish guerrilla group the kurdish democratic party charged 
that six iraqi air force planes dropped poison gas bombs on kurdish 
villages in northern iraq on thursday the day the geneva talks 
started a spokesman who telephoned the nicosia bureau of the 
associated press said that 88 civilians were killed and 500 were 
injured 
moslems attending the friday prayer service in genevas 
imposing saudifinanced mosque passed a large colored poster 
illustrating the chemical bombing of the iraqi kurdish town of 
halabja which iran said killed 5000 people last march 
iraqbased iranian guerrillas meanwhile accused iran of 
killing political prisoners 
massoud rajavi leader of the iranian peoples mujahedeen 
guerrillas called on perez de cuellar to send a mission to iran to 
halt an accelerated pace of killings 
he charged iranian authorities arrested more than 10000 people 
on political charges in the past few weeks and that hundreds of 
mujahedeen sympathizers were executed

a jury friday convicted a man of murdering 
and dismembering a prostitute whose remains were discovered three 
years later stuffed in a back porch freezer 
the 12member panel later returned to deliberations and 
unanimously recommended james warren bailey 45 of tampa be 
electrocuted for the march 1985 slaying of kimberly ann hanlon 
in florida a jury recommendation is not binding on the judge 
who in capital cases has the final say between life in prison and 
death hillsborough circuit judge richard lazzara set sentencing 
for sept 26 
the jury convicted bailey after more than five hours 
deliberations over two days 
hanlon 27 was shot once in the back of the head her limbs and 
head were then severed with a power saw 
baileys 14yearold daughter tipped police after she and a 
friend found the frozen body on the familys cluttered back porch 
in march 
the state argued that hanlon was killed because she was dealing 
drugs for bailey and he thought she had cheated him 
james a whyte 26 a twotime florida felon with an admitted 
drug problem testified for the prosecution that he helped hold the 
woman at baileys home while she was beaten and raped by bailey and 
codefendant irvin george riley a 28yearold former martins 
ferry ohio resident who is schedued for trial on the same charges 
later this year 
whyte testified that riley on baileys orders shot ms hanlon 
as bailey held down her arms and whyte laid across her legs bailey 
then cut off her arms legs and head with a power saw whyte said 
whyte was promised 25 years probation in a plea bargain with 
prosecutors for his testimony 
it must be clear to you that i dont like making deals with 
people like mr whyte assistant hillsborough state attorney mike 
benito told jurors in closing arguments i made a deal with this 
guy so you would hear what mr bailey did to kimberly hanlon i 
think you needed to know that 
defense attorney bob fraser noted that after bailey was arrested 
in march authorities had only a circumstantial case until whyte 
voluntarily contacted police four months later and offered details 
he probably knew there was a body in the freezer he must 
have fraser said in his closing statement but that doesnt 
mean he killed it whoever killed her loathed her for you 
to convict my client on whytes testimony is preposterous 
bailey did not take the stand

a british newspaper reported friday that the 
shroud of turin said to have been wrapped around jesus after his 
crucifixion is a fake but experts discounted the newspaper report 
as unsubstantiated rumor 
as yet we do not have a final figure dr michael tite said 
friday night in an interview on independent television news 
the 14foot cloth kept in turin cathedral in italy bears the 
image of a bearded crucified man 
tite is coordinater of radiocarbon dating tests made on the 
cloth by oxford university the university of arizona at tucson 
and the federal polytechnic in zurich switzerland 
he said results from each testing center have been circulated to 
the others with a proposal for a coordinated date on the shroud 
from the samples but i havent heard from anyone as of yet 
tite is keeper of the british museums research laboratory and 
supervised the oxford tests 
the london evening standard reported without attribution friday 
that radiocarbon dating tests conducted by scientists at oxford 
university showed the shroud was made about 1350 
however it quoted dr richard luckett of magdalene college 
cambridge university as saying i think that as far as seems 
possible the scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a 
fake i suppose there will be certain people who will never believe 
it but it seems unlikely that the tests could be 1300 years off 
this report is without any serious foundation said susan 
black of the british society for the holy shroud of turin 
established 10 years ago to pursue investigations into the cloth 
there have been so many of these type of reports and theyre 
all rumors its all got totally out of hand 
all three institutions conducting tests agreed to keep their 
findings secret and forward them to the roman catholic church in 
italy for an official announcement in september or early october 
both luckett and professor robert hedges head of the 
radiocarbon dating laboratory at oxford which was responsible for 
the tests were unavailable for comment friday 
luckett whose university is an ancient rival of oxford was not 
connected with the tests but has been associated with 
investigations of its history 
in turin professor luigi gonella the liaison between cardinal 
anastasio ballestrero of turin and the three laboratories said he 
had received no word from oxford and was amazed by the evening 
standard report 
gonella said oxford scientists made blindtests on three samples 
they were asked to date the three samples not to determine 
which of them belongs to the shroud he said 
he confirmed that the oxford experiments were completed but said 
results wouldnt be released until after scientists from the three 
laboratories met to coordinate them 
tite said earlier friday that an announcement on results will 
be made in september or early october by turin via the vatican 
press office 
he said each laboratory received three samples of cloth but 
were not told what they were he said samples were taken from the 
shroud and from medieval and other cloths 
it was blindtesting he said 
announcement of the results is expected to come from 
ballestrero who authorized thumbnailsize samples to be cut from 
the shroud kept in his cathedral 
university of arizona geoscientist paul e damon and physicist 
douglas j donahue headed the arizona study of the shroud but 
declined comment 
spokeswoman janet bingham said she was pretty sure our guys do 
not know the results from the other institutions and that the 
arizona scientists just cant make any comments until its the 
official announcment they will not comment on any rumors 
ms bingham said she had spoken with tite who assures me that 
they have not released any information

prime minister sadek elmahdi said 
censoring foreign media this week was an overreaction to 
unfavorable coverage of floods and sudans lagging relief efforts 
the restrictions are being dropped 
he told an italian television interviewer thursday that 
falsehoods had been written about the situation in sudan but the 
censorship was a mistake 
abdullah jallab acting undersecretary in the information 
ministry told the associated press on friday we do not have 
censorship and we do not believe in its effectiveness 
information minister elsayed abdallah mohammed ahmed ordered 
foreign journalists and photographers wednesday to take pictures 
and interviews only while accompanied by a ministry representative 
he also said news or photos could not be sent from sudan without a 
censors stamp 
elmahdi said thursday that sudan is a free country with an 
independent judiciary and anyone whose rights are violated by the 
press has recourse to the courts 
jallab interviewed in english said friday the prime 
minister is the highest executive so his statement would 
eventually cancel any previous measures 
sudanese officials including the prime minister have denounced 
stories in foreign news media attributing corruption and 
incompetence to the relief effort for 15 million people left 
homeless by three weeks of flooding in the khartoum area 
jallab said no journalist had been censored and none would be 
he said ministry representatives assigned to accompany 
photographers and television crews were there to help with 
logistics not to censor 
we are only facilitating their missions we do not tell them 
what to do jallab said one of the reasons that led to the 
ouster of the former regime was the lack of press freedom 
the measures ahmed outlined were similar to those in effect 
during most of the 16year rule of gaafar nimeiri whose presidency 
ended in a military coup in april 1985 
elmahdis civilian government took over a year later and has 
maintained some of the most liberal press laws in africa

a defendant in what is believed to be the 
longest federal criminal trial in american history wanted special 
consideration because of his sleep disorder so he asked the judge 
about his sleeping motion 
i thought we had put that to bed us district judge harold 
a ackerman replied to the laughter and groans of the defendants 
and attorneys in his newark courtroom 
on another day ackerman angered some when he called one motion 
creative nonsense at best 
ackerman 60 spent nearly two years with the herculean task of 
handling the us v accetturo et al case 
the trial ended friday when the jury after 21 months of 
proceedings but only 14 hours of deliberations acquitted all 20 
defendants of racketeering charges the defendants alleged to be 
members of the lucchese crime family had been charged with 
organized crime activities in new jersey 
during the trial 20 litigators including some of new jerseys 
most highly regarded lawyers and two defendants representing 
themselves filled ackermans courtroom he acted as referee to a 
throng of egos and sometimes one of his toughest tasks was just 
keeping the courtroom quiet 
he made more than 100 rulings on legal motions legal papers 
from the case fill 15 feet of file drawers 
ackermans judicial record includes a landmark decision in a 
civil racketeering case brought by the government against teamsters 
local 560 in 1984 ackerman ruled that the union city local had 
been dominated by organized crime for a quarter century and placed 
it under a trustees control the first such action in the nation 
earlier this year because of comments he had made in news 
reports in his typically outspoken fashion ousted union officials 
sought to have ackerman removed from the case the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals refused 
at about the same time the appellate court was considering 
another ackerman matter the judge had ordered a lawyer and his 
firm back into the lucchese trial after a key defendants attorney 
contracted cancer 
the lawyer fought his appointment in appeals to the us supreme 
court and lost along the way though the 3rd circuit mildly 
chided ackerman for the leisurely pace of the trial 
the judge then lengthened trial days and reduced delays 
ackerman attended seton hall university and rutgers university 
where he received his law degree in 1951 
the former sportswriter served as a judge in the state division 
of workmens compensation and was a state judge in union county 
before president carter nominated him for us district court in 
1980

opposition deputies had walked out of the session early thursday 
to protest what they view as the governing partys unwillingness to 
check reports of voting fraud in the elections they returned to 
the chamber thursday afternoon 
lawmakers pledged friday to work roundtheclock if need be to 
install a new national house of deputies in time for outgoing 
president miguel de la madrids stateofthe union address thursday 
to a joint session of lawmakers 
the political sparring reflects a new atmosphere resulting from 
the elections the opposition made major gains against the 
institutional revolutionary party known by its spanish initials 
pri which has dominated national politics for nearly 50 years 
president miguel de la madrid is expected on sept 1 to formally 
present his successor elected in july carlos salinas de gortari 
salinas officially takes over for a single sixyear term in 
december 
opposition leaders say the voting was riddled with fraud and 
challenge the official results that give salinas a victory with 50 
percent of the vote his two leading challengers have barnstormed 
the country urging people to reject the election results 
the pressure for time is on and this will oblige the deputies 
to sit continuously in the house congressional spokesman pedro 
pablo trevino said in a telephone interview 
trevino said a majority of deputies had agreed to stay 
roundtheclock in permanent session through the weekend if 
necessary to certify the vote count 
the proceedings have unfolded in a raucous atmosphere with 
opposition sympathizers chanting whistling and throwing coins and 
other objects from the public galleries the session resumed friday 
with all public but the news media excluded 
the deputies are sitting as an electoral college to certify the 
results of their own elections and the senate members have been 
doing the same the house later will certify the presidential vote 
count 
guillermo jimenez morales leader of the pri bloc told 
reporters that if necessary the pri can muster a bare majority of 
one vote install the lower chamber and proceed with business 
without the opposition 
according to the preliminary vote count the pri should get 247 
of 500 house seats and the opposition 227 with 26 seats undecided 
the pri has never lost a major election since it was formed in 
1929 years ago and usually won the presidential race by more than 
70 percent of the votes cast 
cuauhtemoc cardenas a dissident who broke away from the pri in 
november to demand a cleaner electoral process came in second on 
the leftist national democratic front ticket with 31 percent he 
claims he actually won the election 
the conservative national action partys manuel j clouthier 
came in third with 17 percent 
also for the first time in six decades the pri lost four seats 
in the senate all to the cardenas coalition

a bestselling author whose hard luck 
has forced him to live out of his van was offered shelter by the 
widow of a man who harbored a famous stolen violin for almost 50 
years 
marcelle hall of bethel conn said friday she tracked down 
charles webb author of the graduate and his exwife wife at a 
western massachusetts motel earlier this week and offered to take 
them in after reading of their plight 
i jumped right to the phone as if some power was leading me 
mrs hall said in a telephone interview i saw their picture and 
i thought they probably do the same things i do give it all 
away and sometimes you get shafted 
she said she hoped webb would write a book about the stolen 
violin and how she came to be married to the man who held it for a 
halfcentury 
but webbs exwife who uses only the name fred and who 
continues to live with him said webb might not be able to write 
such a book 
the only problem is that charles doesnt know if he can write 
the story about the violin he hasnt written anything factual 
she said 
mrs hall gained national attention last year when she said her 
second husband julian altman confessed before he died in aug 15 
1985 that his violin was a stolen stradivarius he had bought for 
100 from the man who had stolen it the violin was stolen at new 
yorks carnegie hall in 1936 from bronislaw huberman an 
internationally known violinist who died in 1947 
the violin was authenticated for its insurer lloyds of london 
which had paid 30000 to huberman last year lloyds insured it 
for 800000 and reportedly intended to sell it and mrs hall said 
lloyds was going to pay her a reward 
mrs hall said she met altman in washington in 1968 and they 
married in las vegas in march 1985 two days before he was 
sentenced to two years in jail for sexually molesting one of her 
granddaughters 
she said friday that she had married him to regain control of 
her financial holdings after serving four months of his sentence 
he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and moved to a hospital where 
he died mrs hall said 
webbs 1962 novel was made into the hit movie of the same name 
starring dustin hoffman the movie evoked the discontent of a 
generation fed up with materialism he and fred came to 
massachusetts in search of a publisher after living for a decade in 
their van in southern california 
in more prosperous days the webbs had given away two houses out 
of a need webb said to get free of things 
fred said the couple would drive to connecticut on saturday to 
meet mrs hall and consider the offer it sounds a little bit 
gothic but we might be able to handle something like that she 
said 
webb wrote four novels until 1978 when he stopped writing 
the webbs divorced eight years ago after 20 years of marriage 
because they believed the institution of marriage violated their 
constitutional rights to freedom fred said

a court rejected a government 
bid friday to merge the countrys secondlargest black township 
with an impoverished homeland 180 miles away 
the union decreed by president pw botha last december met 
widespread opposition among the halfmillion residents in the 
township of botshabelo many feared the government would declare 
the distant homeland qwaqwa to be independent and deprive them of 
south african citizenship 
botshabelo comprised mostly of clusters of shanties spread 
across a treeless plain is in orange free state the most sparsely 
populated and conservative of south africas four provinces 
a threejudge panel of the provincial supreme court declared 
bothas proclamation invalid friday saying it would not promote 
the political development of botshabelos residents 
the government issued no statement after the ruling made in 
response to a case brought by township resident gauta lefuo the 
government can appeal the ruling 
governing officials said the merger is compatible with their 
longstanding policy of locating black ethnic groups in 
selfgoverning or nominally independent homelands botshabelo is 
made up predominantly of south sotho people as is qwaqwa 
but the judges said there were few similarities between 
botshabelo and qwaqwa aside from ethnicity 
established nine years ago botshabelo has been depicted by 
antiapartheid activists as a dumping ground for blacks not needed 
or wanted in the rest of the orange free state most of its 
residents were expelled from whiteowned farms 
the homeland policy is part of the nations policy of racial 
segregation known as apartheid by law and custom apartheid 
establishes a racially segregated society in which south africas 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
after pamphlets were dropped from security force helicopters 
announcing the merger nine botshabelo clergymen wrote to botha 
they warned that the situation was a recipe for frustration and 
resultant violence 
it is unfeasible that one of the poorest selfgoverning states 
should administer and develop the secondlargest black township in 
south africa the clergymen said 
soweto near johannesburg is the largest black township in the 
country 
the judgment marked the second major court defeat this year for 
the governments policy of homeland consolidation 
the countrys highest court the appeal court ruled last april 
that botha had acted without proper authority when he incorporated 
the 120000member community of moutse into the adjoining 
semiautonomous homeland of kwandebele northeast of pretoria 
most moutse residents do not belong to the ndebele tribe that 
predominates in kwandebele

the officer in charge of the navy rescue 
swimmer school went on trial friday in the death of a recruit after 
a military judge refused to dismiss the derelictionofduty charges 
lawyers for lt thomas a torchia had asked for dismissal on the 
grounds that vice adm nr thunman chief of naval education and 
training was biased against torchia in convening the courtmartial 
and had tried to influence its outcome defense lawyers cited the 
admirals comments to news media mireckis family and a 
congressional committee 
but the judge cmdr newell d krogmann ruled that thunmans 
statements were nonprejudicial 
he never indicated any culpability by any one with regard to 
the death krogmann said 
also friday torchias lawyers exercised their right to have the 
case decided by a panel of officers rather than the judge and four 
officers were selected they will hear opening statements and 
initial testimony saturday in a trial that will last at least 
through monday krogmann said 
torchia 32 of princeton ill was in charge of the school at 
pensacola naval air station on march 2 when airman recruit lee 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis died after he panicked climbed out 
of a swimming pool and shouted that he wanted to quit 
instructors allegedly pushed mirecki back into the water and 
held his head under until he collapsed and died from a fearinduced 
heart attack or drowning 
torchia who was talking on the telephone in his office 
overlooking the pool at the time is accused of failing to 
safeguard the physical wellbeing of mirecki and other 
subordinates the prosecution contends he should have prevented the 
use of unsafe and unlawful force and had failed to establish 
policies banning the use of force and recognizing the right of 
students to drop out 
in arguments on the admissibility of certain evidence lt 
thomas c leighton one of torchias lawyers argued that using 
force on students was crucial to proper training 
since mireckis death instructors have been prohibited from 
touching students 
torchia is one of two navy men being courtmartialed in the 
case if convicted he could face a letter of reprimand loss of 
seniority for promotion and forfeiture of twothirds of his pay for

a us anthropologist and two 
amazon indian chiefs were arraigned friday on charges of engaging 
in illegal political activities and could be expelled from brazil 
darrell posey 41 of henderson ky and chiefs paulo paiakan 
and kubei of the kayapo tribe were accused of breaking brazils 
foreigners law during a trip to the united states this year 
the law passed in 1980 when brazil was under a military 
government prohibits nonbrazilian residents or visitors from 
speaking out publicly on domestic political issues 
the trial has caused a sensation here it is first time native 
indians have been legally considered foreigners 
poseys lawyer wellknown human rights defender jose carlos 
castro said friday the trial was suspended at least until 
december because kubei had returned to his village for the 
harvest and festival period and refused to show up at court 
the court gave kubei 90 days to present himself for arraignment 
this is a landmark case ive been studying native peoples for 
24 years and this is the first time a native group has been 
considered foreign by a white government posey said by telephone 
from his office in belem a city at the mouth of the amazon river 
2140 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
he said the two kayapo chiefs were invited by florida 
international university in miami to speak about forest 
conservation posey who has lived and worked in brazil since 1977 
said he went along as a friend and interpreter 
they the two indians said they were worried about 
deforestation in the amazon erosion mercury pollution from gold 
mining and hydroelectric projects that displace indian tribes 
theyre especially upset at the xingu project that will inundate 
about 188 million acres of land mostly indian territory 
posey said 
the kayapos number about 5500 and live in the southern amazon 
jungle 
environmental groups later invited paiakan and kubei to speak 
to the world bank in washington the bank suspended funding for the 
xingu project 
many brazilians believe the indians were responsible for 
blocking the project but posey said funding already had been 
suspended because of financing problems with the government power 
company eletronorte 
the trial began friday in belem at the 3rd federal court of 
para a northern amazon jungle state if found guilty the three 
face a prison term of up to three years each and expulsion from 
brazil 
it was not clear where the indians could be expelled to 
thats a very interesting question but its the governments 
problem posey said 
legally indians are wards of the state and dont have the full 
rights of other citizens 
posey said he felt the trial was an attempt by the government to 
intimidate scientists and native indians and keep them from 
speaking out on politically sensitive issues 
no matter what the outcome of the trial is the effects will 
be very unpleasant i am prohibited from working in any indian area 
as long as the case is pending my work is paralyzed he said 
the foreigners law was enacted and often used by the military 
governments that ruled brazil from 1964 to 1985 foreign priests 
and students who spoke out about political affairs were charged and 
sometimes expelled from the country 
however this is the first time the law has been used since 
brazil returned to civilian rule in 1985 under president jose 
sarney 
posey said he wasnt afraid of being expelled 
if im found guilty i wouldnt want to stay here any 
more

the fbi said friday it is investigating 
apparent sabotage of orings destined for space shuttle booster 
rockets a problem a nasa official said may have been motivated by 
a company incentive program 
the defects were detected before any damaged rings were sent to 
the rocket maker 
a very small number of orings that appeared to have been 
deliberately cut were discovered in june by the manufacturer 
hydrapak inc and the incident was immediately reported to the 
fbi nasa and rocket maker morton thiokol said james dockstader 
hydrapak vice president of operations 
he said a check showed none of the flawed seals was shipped to 
morton thiokol 
these things are inspected more times than you can hardly 
believe but its a serious nature this oring has a great deal of 
visibility in the space program and around the world and we can 
understand that they are handled very carefully dockstader said 
however television station ktvx quoted a former morton thiokol 
employee friday night as saying one deliberately cut oring was 
placed in a rocket segment under assembly at morton thiokol 
i was there when they received the damaged oring and it was 
labeled from hydrapak and it was in a package that had gone 
through quality assurance at morton thiokol said the unnamed 
worker 
the man said when he called attention to the flawed seal he was 
told to keep quiet because the exposure could cause further delays 
in the space shuttle program 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab denied the allegations 
saying no unacceptable component has either been delivered to us 
or been delivered by us for use in the shuttle program 
the company conducts extensive acceptance inspections of any 
parts intended for flight hardware and records of those 
inspections show there was virtually no possibility that any 
damaged oring has ever gotten into the flight hardware raab 
said 
a faulty oring that allowed superhot exhaust gases to escape 
sideways through a joint and ignite the shuttles exterior fuel 
tank was blamed by a presidential commission for the jan 28 1986 
challenger explosion which killed the crafts sevenmember crew 
and grounded the nations shuttle program 
jr thompson director of nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said some hydrapak employees are suspected of 
damaging orings to receive bonuses awarded to workers who found 
defects 
my understanding is they tightened internal final inspection 
incentivized it or came up with some kind of program to make sure 
no flawed orings got out thompson told the huntsville times 
on friday 
after hydrapak set up this internal thing perhaps some 
employees may have been taking advantage of it thats whats 
suspected whether its a fact i dont know were treating it as 
an internal hydrapak thing he said 
under the incentive plan workers reportedly were awarded points 
for finding defects missed in previous inspections when they 
accumulated enough points they received a cash bonus however the 
system was eliminated since the defects appeared the times 
reported 
dockstader denied however that hydrapak employees were given a 
cash incentive and said thompson was either misinformed or 
misquoted 
employees do not benefit monetarily from finding a defect 
he told the associated press asked if the company had a 
pointsystem incentive plan dockstader said he could not comment 
he did confirm a times report that in addition to the orings 
that were deliberately cut several others were left in a curing 
oven believed to have been left deliberately on a 
hotterthannormal setting 
former hydrapak inspector cathy crocker told ksltv friday that 
she discovered three orings with slash marks as early as may but 
management was unable to determine who was responsible 
after more cuts were found crocker said she was asked to take a 
liedetector test 
i did i had nothing to hide i liked my job at that company 
i took the test and i failed it they came in and took me off my 
inspection she said 
crocker said that when cuts continued to surface in some 
orings she was moved to a filing job and was asked by management 
to resign 
dockstader said no employees were fired as a result of the 
investigations but he would not say if any were disciplined 
dockstader said security at the suburban salt lake plant was 
strict including employee badges for admission and escorts for 
visitors but crocker claimed security was lax and that anyone 
could walk into the plant 
hydrapak with offices solely in utah also produces various 
industrial seals and hydraulic components and employs about 85 
people 
fbi agent cal clegg said his agency was investigating the 
possibility of sabotage but he declined to elaborate 
nasa inspector general bill colvin likewise refused to discuss 
the space agencys investigation but he said national aeronautics 
and space administration officials believe none of the damaged 
orings ever made it to morton thiokol and that their discovery 
would not affect shuttle launch plans 
morton thiokol decided not to conduct an investigation because 
the company never received any damaged orings said spokesman 
rocky raab 
its always upsetting to hear that someone may for whatever 
reason be deliberately damaging stuff thats intended for the 
space program but we are satisfied that the steps taken by 
hydrapak to resolve the situation are in fact adequate raab 
said 
dockstader would not comment on hydrapaks efforts to resolve 
the matter except to say the company had taken steps to prevent 
similar incidents in the future and the problem is now solved 
the damaged rings were discovered by a hydrapak inspector he 
said had the rings passed the companys inspection however they 
still would have been examined by resident inspectors from morton 
thiokol and the federal defense contract administration service 
on aug 18 morton thiokol culminated a 2year effort to 
overhaul the booster with an apparently successful testfiring of 
the redesigned rocket at the companys wasatch operations plant 70 
miles northwest of salt lake city 
the firing was the fifth and final qualifying test before the 
booster can be cleared for flight 
nasa is expected next week to set a date for the launch of 
discovery the first postchallenger mission 
at the launch pad at kennedy space center engineers continued 
to troubleshoot two problems that cropped up during a test firing 
of discoverys engines on aug 10 
one involves a small leak of hydrogen in an area where fuel 
lines extend into the shuttle from the external fuel tank the 
other is the sluggish behavior of three valves that control the 
flow of liquid oxygen into the orbiter

a federal jury friday acquitted 20 reputed 
mob figures of racketeering charges ending what is believed to be 
the nations longest federal criminal trial and handing the 
government a stunning defeat 
the jury which had been selected 21 months ago read 77 
separate innocent verdicts before the courtroom erupted in 
pandemonium the defendants and their attorneys hugged and gave a 
standing ovation to the jury which had deliberated just 14 hours 
the jury forewoman wept 
whats there to say assistant us attorney v grady 
omalley said apparently the jury just resented the length of 
the trial and the breadth of the indictment 
the government had charged that anthony tumac accetturo of 
hollywood fla and his codefendants controlled a powerful new 
jersey faction of the lucchese organized crime family that had 
illegal gambling loansharking drugdealing and fraudulent credit 
card operations 
the defense tried to discredit government witnesses many of 
whom had serious criminal records the government contended that 
only such insiders could tell the story of the organized crime 
family 
defense attorney david ruhnke said the verdict was a complete 
rejection of long government racketeering prosecutions against 
numerous defendants 
we think this is certainly the last prosecution that can be 
brought like this added defense attorney miles feinstein 
my client is enormously thrilled by the result said 
accetturos attorney stephen skoller 
im just glad it was everybody acquitted said michael 
taccetta a florham park resident charged with supervising the 
organization in new jersey 
the defendants and their lawyers waited outside the courthouse 
to applaud the jurors as they emerged before going to a restaurant 
to celebrate some of the jurors blew kisses waved and smiled 
broadly 
they should never ever do anything like this to anybody 
again said juror dorothy bannigan its really unfair not 
only to defendants but to jurors 
the jurors went through each charge against each defendant and 
reached a conclusion so quickly because they had a good system 
another juror hospital maintenance worker gerald caesar jr 
reached at his home in east orange said i just want to enjoy my 
family and get back to my lifestyle 
i dont want to be bothered dont call me any more he 
added before hanging up the phone 
before they were dismissed us district judge harold a 
ackerman thanked the jury saying i commend you in the highest 
terms for your dedication your patience your attentiveness 
im just glad its over the judge said later adding he 
planned to go on vacation as soon as possible 
the panel began deliberating thursday morning with a record to 
consider that included 40000 pages of transcripts testimony from 
89 witnesses and 850 exhibits including 400 tapes 
the governments star witness was joseph alonzo a diagnosed 
schizophrenic admitted drug addict and alcoholic and convicted 
criminal who had shot one of the defendants his cousin five 
times 
defense attorney robert l brown elected mayor of orange during 
the trial criticized the government for calling liars thieves 
crooks and criminals as witnesses 
american jurors realize thats not enough under our 
constitution he said 
michael critchley who represented taccetta called the verdict 
a collective victory 
the odds in this one were against 1000 to 1 he said 
the government had alleged the defendants charged in an 
indictment unsealed in march 1986 operated out of the 
holeinthewall luncheonette in newark where pictures of 
gangsters al capone and meyer lansky hang on the wall witnesses 
testified about kisses of respect for the boss tribute 
payments and mob sitdowns 
us attorney samuel a alito jr who came to office after the 
indictment was unsealed in august 1985 said he had no regrets 
about the prosecution but in the future would try to keep cases 
as short and simple as possible 
despite this loss the days of the mafia are numbered said 
alito 
according to the administrative office of the courts in 
washington the trial surpassed in length the pizza connection 
heroin smuggling case which ended after 17 months in march 1987

many in this bluecollar town remember 
clyde lee conrad only distantly a 1960s classmate who was shy 
with a sly smile and in recent years was generous with his family 
now authorities in west germany say the former army sergeant may 
have headed an international spy ring that sold nato defense 
secrets to the soviets at high prices for 10 years 
conrad 41 enlisted in the army on aug 9 1965 soon after he 
graduated from sebring mckinley high school acquaintances said he 
seldom returned to his hometown of 5000 people about 55 miles 
southeast of cleveland although he came back in 1985 for a 20year 
class reunion 
he had flown home from germany it was in august and he told 
us that in a month or two he would retire said joseph e igro 
who was on the schools track team with him it was about 20 
years since anyone had seen him since he joined the service right 
out of high school there was just small talk about old days in 
school not about what he was doing now 
the conrad family lived in two houses on mckinley avenue 
neighbors say the first house where clyde grew up caught fire a 
short time after the family moved across the street 
clyde sent cash money to his mother to buy a house about 
five years ago said tammy andrews 22 a neighbor before the 
conrads moved from here several years ago what we heard was that 
every time he would move in germany he would buy a new house 
the conrads still own their former home on the street and a 
tenant is trying to buy it neighbors said neighbors said they 
were not sure where the conrads now live although his father and a 
sister lives in alliance about six miles west of here 
conrads father harry said friday he had not seen his son in 
nine years other relatives were not immediately available for 
comment his sister caron henschen told the alliance review that 
family members have not spoken with conrad since his arrest 
conrad was arrested tuesday and was being held in a west german 
prison pending further investigation he was charged with 
compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially 
grave case according to the prosecutors office west german 
authorities have said millions of dollars may have been involved 
at the tin lantern restaurant in downtown sebring owner dennis 
rohde made light of the allegations 
you want our spy sandwich rohde asked patrons it comes 
with a secret decoder ring 
but rohde admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback 
theyre just shocked nobody expected it said rohde 50 
they live in this town for years and they suddenly have a spy 
scandal and they say my god how could it be someone from here 
 
one mckinley street resident who would give her name only as 
mrs robert blake said she remembered clyde conrad as a youngster 
but learned little about him or his family despite living on the 
same street for more than 30 years 
wed talk every now and then just occasionally mrs blake 
said of the family but people around here pretty much mind their 
own business i knew them but their business was their business 
and i didnt get into it 
the family was real wellliked said susan reed 33 who 
lived three houses from the conrads i didnt know clyde the one 
that was in germany but i ran with his sister 
they just minded their own business and never got into no 
arguments or nothing 
bill gill 65 said he used to go to the racetrack with clyde 
conrads father darrell 
we used to go to the track quite often gill said wed 
bet a couple of dollars on each race a little here a little 
there sometimes wed win most of the time wed win but 
sometimes wed lose 
of the allegations against clyde gill said i dont believe 
he done it i dont know for sure but i knew his daddy and i just 
dont believe it

a jury began deliberating friday whether 
the copper7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a minnesota 
woman 
esther kociemba 30 and her husband william of elk river are 
seeking at least 165 million from gd searle amp co manufacturer 
of the birthcontrol device the damages sought are more than any 
jury has awarded in 18 similar cases 
the jury which has heard three months of testimony began 
deliberations friday morning and was sent home about 5 pm jurors 
were instructed to return monday 
michael ciresi the kociembas attorney argued during trial 
that the copper7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease and rendered 
mrs kociemba sterile he said the chicagobased searle was 
negligent in designing the device with a tailstring that he said 
provided a haven for bacteria 
the copper7 was rushed to market without proper testing and 
sold to women without adequate warning that it could cause public 
inflammatory disease and without warning that it was too large for 
women who had never given birth ciresi said 
searles attorney paul strain of baltimore said the company 
exceeded us food and drug administration requirements in 
marketing copper7 which was once the most widely used iud in 
america he attacked the credibility of witnesses called by ciresi 
and said ciresi did not even prove that mrs kociemba suffered from 
pelvic infection let alone that it was caused by the copper7 
ciresi asked the jury for 15 million in punitive damages 15 
million to 2 million in compensatory damages for mrs kociemba and 
300000 in compensatory damages for her husband 
the fda approved the copper7 in 1974 and searle sold between 
300000 and 400000 of the iuds in the united states before 
withdrawing the product in the wake of numerous lawsuits 
ciresis minneapolis law firm represents more than 150 of the 
500 copper7 users who have sued searle and mrs kociembas case is 
the first it has tried

former black panther leader huey 
newton who had refused parole from prison until a fellow inmate 
and expanther also was released decided to leave after all 
prison officials said friday 
newton in san quentin for two months for parole violations 
refused to leave on his scheduled release date tuesday demanding 
that convicted murderer elmer geronimo pratt also be freed 
newton apparently changed his mind about staying behind bars 
when prison officials served him with extra conditions of parole 
including a clause that should he again decline to leave it would 
be considered a parole violation said prison spokeswoman jeanne 
ballatore 
newtons refusal to leave so far has merely been a violation of 
prison rules she said the new clause would make it a parole 
violation a much more serious offense 
newton was processed friday she said 
pratt is serving a life term for the 1968 slaying of a santa 
monica woman during a 30 robbery he entered prison in 1972 and 
lost his eighth bid parole two weeks ago for parole when a state 
panel called him a danger to the public 
pratts supporters contend he was framed that hes a political 
prisoner and the victim of police efforts to jail panther leaders 
and dismantle the oaklandbased black liberation movement of the 
late 1960s and early 70s 
newton 45 cofounder of the defunct black panthers and its 
defense minister has had two decades of scuffles with the law

a decree made public friday gives broad powers to 
paramilitary police accused by political activists of unprecedented 
brutality in breaking up demonstrations 
the decree says the special police attached to the interior 
ministry will be responsible for keeping public order at 
demonstrations which have become more frequent under soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
it gives them the power to enter homes and businesses in pursuit 
of suspects seize autos and communications equipment and use a 
wide range of weapons 
crowd control previously was the responsibility of regular 
police who also are governed by the interior ministry the 
paramilitary police until now had been assigned only to guarding 
prisons and labor camps and protecting government property and 
special shipments 
the presidium of the supreme soviet approved the decree july 28 
and it was published in a legislative digest that reached 
subscribers friday 
soviet media have not reported the measure signed by president 
andrei gromyko but carried extensive dispatches on a decree of the 
same day that requires advance permission for public demonstrations 
and meetings and sets stiff fines and jail terms for violators 
political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at a 
demonstration sunday in moscow and during this years unrest in 
armenia 
in peacetime the army is taking on extraordinary powers 
said yuri mityunov a leader of an unofficial opposition political 
group called the democratic union what is happening here is what 
happens in other countries only under martial law 
mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police not 
regular police jurisdiction for the first time over political 
meetings and demonstrations 
dissident journalist sergei grigoryants said unprovoked beatings 
at sundays protest were unprecedented in recent times 
on sunday the paramilitary police helped regular police stop a 
democratic union protest in moscows pushkin square against the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 20 years ago 
they wore khaki uniforms without insignias black boots and 
berets with interior ministry markings more than 100 protesters 
were arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat and 
kicked about 30 of them 
mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested they 
had served in the soviet army in afghanistan 
paramilitary police units were reported in armenia as early as 
february months before the decree they helped quell 
demonstrations by armenians demanding the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian region attached to the 
neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
under the decree paramilitary police need not obtain a search 
warrant from a prosecutor as regular police are required to do

every elementary school child has an opportunity to say the

commissioner harold raynolds said in an interview thursday 
republican george bush has attempted to make dukakis 1977 veto 
of a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into a 
campaign issue in their presidential contest 
dukakis in vetoing the bill cited advisory legal opinions and 
us supreme court precedents that making the pledge mandatory 
would be unconstitutional he says he supports saying the pledge 
itself

a year after a leaking gasoline line caused 
his car to explode 25yearold donald cowart remained so severely 
burned that he would die without long and painful treatment cowart 
asked to be allowed to die 
question should the hospital grant his request 
the increasing frequency of questions like this has led to a 
national resurgence in the study of ethics according to preston k 
covey director of carnegie mellon universitys center for the 
advancement of applied ethics which opened in june 
ethicists say the number of such centers has been increasing in 
the last decade especially at medical schools 
if your medical school or center doesnt have a serious 
program to address the ethical as well as the scientific you are 
kind of behind the times said bruce jennings associate for 
policy studies at new yorks hastings center perhaps the oldest 
ethics research institute founded in 1969 
i would say there has been a change in attitudes since the 
1950s and 1960s when philosophers felt the study of ethics was not 
very interesting he said now its one of the most vital areas 
in academic philosophy 
carnegie mellon decided to open an ethics center because like 
many other universities we felt that a new priority should be 
given to ethics and values covey said instead of just caring 
about them we should start doing something about them 
the university expects its center will help students and 
professionals deal with a wide range of ethical issues including 
insider trading influence peddling managing aids in the 
workplace sexual harassment south african divestment 
whistleblowing fetal tissue research abortion organ transplants 
and affirmative action covey said 
a carnegie mellon videodisc telling the story of cowarts 1973 
accident and subsequent medical care called the right to die 
is used to guide businessmen government officials and health care 
professionals through the complexities of moral questions that 
didnt exist 20 years ago covey said 
at certain points in the story the videodisc is stopped to 
allow seminar participants to debate the ethical issues and make 
their own decisions about what should have been done 
cowart was not allowed to die and today he is remarried and a 
practicing attorney in texas covey said 
the kennedy institute of ethics at georgetown university in 
washington dc lists 56 us ethics centers or programs in its 
international directory of bioethics organizations many of them 
formed in the last few years 
spectacular science fictionlike news stories about new medical 
techniques and capabilities have helped glamorize ethics said 
albert jonsen who heads the university of washington school of 
medicines new department of medical history and ethics 
the first heart transplant was done in the late 1960s and that 
captured the attention of everyone jonsen said every one was 
asking is that right taking the heart out of one person and 
putting it in another the media played that up in a big way and 
got a big response 
the reaction also enlivened debate among philosophers 
scientists and doctors he said 
the reactions to that within medicine was to say this is 
fantastic technology whats its best use it may have adverse 
consequences jonsen said 
in medicine youre supposed to benefit your patients thats 
the first rule the ethical question we are asking is can this 
benefit my patient 
the university of pittsburghs center for medical ethics which 
opened in february 1987 was formed after administrators and 
faculty began reflecting on medical cases that grabbed the publics 
attention said center director alan meisel 
one day in 1984 i picked up the paper and found a frontpage 
story on baby faye the little girl who received a baboons heart 
at loma linda university medical center in california i reflected 
about that every day for a week and i thought of similar 
stories meisel said 
finally we said that this is an important topic and we should 
do something about it 
kidney dialysis and organ transplantation sparked ethical 
debates in the 1970s said leroy walters director for the kennedy 
institutes biomedical ethics center 
today the new developments are in genetics and reproduction 
he said also with the emphasis on the civil rights movement and 
the womens movement more patients have been demanding more 
information from doctors about themselves about their conditions 
and there has been more emphasis on the patients right to 
determine what treatment he or she should have 
the university of minnesotas yearold center for biomedical 
ethics also was formed after medical school administrators 
students and doctors agreed more attention should be paid to 
ethics said center director arthur caplan 
you need new ethical norms at a time of rapid change caplan 
said 
although only a few weeks old the carnegie mellon center 
already has been busy conducting seminars for the edison electric 
institute the pittsburgh office of the internal revenue service 
the federal department of agriculture and a number of other groups 
and agencies 
advances in medical technology have led to perhaps the most 
uncomfortable most highly publicized ethical questions but 
difficult issues also arise in other areas ethicists say 
suppose you sat down and thought about rearranging your 
investment portfolio to avoid businesses and investments in south 
africa covey said could you come out just as well and if you 
could and it doesnt cost you anything wouldnt that be a good 
thing to do 
for a variety of reasons the business world is becoming more 
alert to ethical issues either to keep out of trouble or make 
their operations run more smoothly or because they simply want to 
be more responsible ethically to their employees and to society 
covey said 
like other ethics centers the carnegie mellon center does not 
advocate particular moral values however 
the idea is not to sell ethics consulting but to help people 
come to grips with ethical issues on their own covey said

sometimes one can get sick of all that 
culture during a european vacation 
that anyway is how it appears to dr graziella magherini the 
head of psychiatry at santa maria nuova hospital in central 
florence 
in the past 10 years she has treated more than 115 tourists for 
what she calls stendhals syndrome an emotional reaction to 
hundreds of years of history and art all hitting the traveler at 
once 
the historical memory in these cities of art stirs the 
emotions she says they can be emotions of great pleasure but 
also of great pain 
with its vast pinkandgreen duomo cathedral its museums filled 
with renaissance art and its dark cobbled streets florence is a 
throwback to another century except of course for the hordes of 
backpackers and signs reading in english we make real italian 
ice cream 
magherini maintains that the overwhelming sense of the past 
sometimes disorients tourists and leads to panic attacks intense 
feelings of persecution and abandonment and a loss of a sense of 
reality and identity 
very often theres the anguish of death she says prompted 
by the vivid sense of historical figures that reminds visitors of 
their own mortality 
magherinis work has aroused considerable interest not to 
mention debate in the hometown of michelangelo botticelli and 
donatello 
it sounds simply ridiculous declares serena padova 
assistant director of the palatine gallery 
patrizio ostecresi administrator of the duomo says hes seen 
no unusual effect inspired by the church 
people have committed suicide here he says knitting his 
brow but i dont think its the art 
nonetheless the local government is interested in the research 
the city of 425000 receives 5 million tourists a year who spend 
upwards of 670 million 
the province of florence last year gave magherini and several 
researchers a grant to expand their study they are now trying to 
get data from venice and jerusalem to see if the phenomenon exists 
there 
magherini says she first noticed something wrong a decade ago 
as more and more tourists visiting the works of art arrived at the 
hospital filled with anguish a thing of beauty it seemed was not 
always a joy to behold 
most people suffered psychological problems but some also 
complained of heart palpitations or dizziness 
she perceived two categories of sufferers solitary travelers 
often europeans of a sentimental bent and members of organized 
tours who apparently have difficulty adjusting to new things 
many of the latter group she says are americans from small 
towns and with a cultural level that is not very sophisticated 
the team has studied the cases of 115 people who were 
hospitalized but many other people were treated and released 
magherini says 
the researchers decided to name the problem after stendhal the

tennessee williams the tortured and 
talented pulitzer prize winner is being reborn at the edinburgh 
festival in a oneman show that pays homage to one of americas 
greatest playwrights 
i like to think of it as a tribute to the man actor ray 
stricklyn said of confessions of a nightingale his solo show 
about the late author of the glass menagerie and a streetcar 
named desire 
the 90minute play adapted by stricklyn and charlotte chandler 
from chandlers book the ultimate seduction had its european 
debut on aug 24 at edinburghs st cecilias hall it is the only 
american theatrical offering among this years official lineup at 
the scottish capitals 42nd annual arts binge 
the 54yearold stricklyn introduced the show in january 1985 at 
the beverly hills playhouse in california the tanned 
silverhaired actor has taken it on regular tours ever since 
stopping at new yorks jack lawrence theater for a brief run in the 
fall of 1986 
its been a wonderful high stricklyn said in an interview 
prior to the first of five edinburgh performances 
he said that williams who died in 1984 one month before his 
73rd birthday had been an important influence in his life 
figuring in the beginnings the socalled end and then the 
restart of my career 
in 1953 newly arrived in new york from his home in houston 
texas stricklyn used a williams oneact play to audition for drama 
school the first broadway play he ever saw was the glass 
menagerie and the fledgling actor even found himself acting 
opposite the playwright at a party in the mid1950s 
i always said tennessee was my first leading lady chuckled 
stricklyn the reading from the hungarian play fata morgana 
cast williams as an older woman in love with the young man played 
by stricklyn 
in 1972 stricklyn decided to give up acting to join a public 
relations firm in los angeles and he made what he thought would be 
his farewell stage appearance playing lord byron in a houston 
production of williams camino real 
then in 1983 he returned to the stage in a los angeles 
production of williams vieux carre and the chance to embody 
the playwright soon followed 
i started it in a small way never dreaming it would have a 
life he said of confessions which began as a short piece to 
accompany the unveiling of a bust of williams at the beverly hills 
playhouse 
stricklyn was wary at first of continuing the impersonation i 
was very hesitant i had always avoided oneperson shows but he 
soon found the rewards irresistible 
it opened up a whole new career for me because i had been a 
juvenile actor when i quit he said when i was 35 i was still 
getting occasional calls to play teenagers doris day had nothing 
on me 
stricklyn empathized with williams own concerns about 
depression aging and the vicissitudes of life in the theater 
i certainly felt i could identify from the point of view of a 
career that had started off well as a young actor and then the 
years when it wasnt working and i had to get out of the 
business he said 
stricklyn is working again with seasons on tvs the colbys 
and dynasty behind him and a stint on the cbs series wise 
guy 
following edinburgh stricklyn takes confessions to north 
carolina and then is hoping for a run in london 
the experience he said has been cathartic in a way williams 
might have understood 
tennessee had a wonderful line if i get rid of my demons i 
lose my angels said stricklyn im trying to do everything in 
reverse to get rid of my demons and gain my angels

ok so youve managed to stay awake all the way 
through late night with david letterman now its time to hit 
the hay right 
wrong nbc is torturing sleepyheads sans vcrs by tacking on a 
new half hour after letterman thats gonna be hard to turn off 
later with bob costas 
yeah costas is that sports guy the one who does baseball for 
nbc but this is not a sports show and costas has quickly proven 
himself a facile interviewer with an intelligent easygoing style 
that fits just about any kind of guest 
for his premiere week last week he had a candid twopart 
interview with newswomanauthor linda ellerbee handled delicate 
questioning of former child superstar gary coleman and traded bits 
with comedian billy crystal part 2 of the crystal interview airs 
tonight 
the first show with ellerbee was extremely serious outspoken as 
she is ellerbee seemed even more open than usual when she talked 
about her late colleague jessica savitch the subject of a couple 
of recent tellall books that raise questions about the way nbc 
handled the troubled star 
ellerbee told costas of her onetime jealousy toward the 
beautiful blond anchorwoman then her eventual realization that 
savitch was a woman out of her league and painfully aware of it 
gradually sinking into drug abuse ellerbee said she and some nbc 
colleagues met over a weekend to plan some kind of psychological 
rescue mission but it was too late savitch drowned when her car 
fell into a canal adjoining a restaurant parking lot the accident 
was unrelated to drugs 
costas handles the subject sensitively the next night with 
ellerbee was lighter as she offered up her irreverent assessment of 
network news and the two ended up in a funny casual discussion of 
the movie broadcast news viewers might as well have been 
sitting around the kitchen table with them 
with coleman costas had another serious story on his hands the 
onetime toast of tv when he starred on diffrent strokes 
coleman is now a grown young man with serious health problems he 
needs a third kidney transplant and very little acting work he 
is bitter toward his parents and management for not giving him more 
guidance as a child costas elicited the necessary information but 
allowed the young actor to maintain his dignity throughout 
costas seemed overprepared for crystal occasionally asking 
questions that contained answers whats different about your 
muhammad ali impression compared to others who may have gotten 
the voice but not the character or about life on the road as a 
standup comic is it true you often ate dinner by the bathroom 
light in the motel 
by tonights show costas hits his stride with crystal theres 
a very nice exchange when crystal recalls the genesis of perhaps 
his best comedy bit his bittersweet impersonation of an old black 
jazz musician can you dig it i knew that you could 
crystals father produced jazz shows and he remembers being around 
those guys when he was a child and being profoundly influenced by 
them 
thats the reason ive always performed was these guys he 
tells costas because no matter what was happening to them when 
they got up and played they felt good 
costas gets to combine his first love baseball in this 
interview when he and crystal discuss the brilliant 8minute film 
crystal and christopher guest made for saturday night live in 
which they played two retired negro league baseball players 
rooster and the king costas doesnt miss a beat when crystal 
suggests being interviewed for a few minutes in character as 
rooster 
for the next two weeks costas continues his eclectic guest list 
with larry king sonny bono chuck norris rona barrett phantom 
of the opera star michael crawford and night court star john 
larroquette 
the show airs only mondaythursday because as costas notes 
nobody wants to tinker with that great american institution 
friday night videos which incidentally also has dick ebersol 
as its executive producer 
costas will not be relegated to only latenight all season hes 
on nbcs team covering the primetime summer olympics starting next 
month but insomniacs neednt worry costas has taped enough shows 
to cover him while hes in seoul

a big change could be coming in payroll merit 
increases as an intense period of corporate belttightening begins 
to relax 
the possibility doesnt represent any change of heart by those 
who control payrolls but instead is simply the hardnosed 
recognition of an economic reality that there may not be much to 
be gained through further tightening 
it is nothing new in american life it has happened before and 
will happen again because it is a selfcorrecting cyclical 
phenomenon as a bit of recent history illustrates 
at the tail end of the 1970s for example major companies 
sought to improve their net income by cutting staffs limiting pay 
raises and otherwise becoming leaner meaner and more efficient 
it wasnt a choice easily arrived at and in fact it was long 
delayed for nearly two decades american companies had been 
developing an enormous midriff of whitecollar workers and 
becoming less competitive because of it 
the problem was exacerbated by inflation which rose to 
doubledigit levels and effectively priced many american products 
out of the growing global marketplace change was imperative costs 
had to be cut 
one company after another adopted the same policy pare staffs 
and restrain pay raises get more net for the payroll dollar some 
companies went further and closed plants but most just watched the 
payroll 
then as the economy recovered from the big recession of the 
early 1980s the pressure came off again growth was in again in 
1982 according to a compensation survey released this week merit 
raises rose 91 percent 
and then once again the lid came down american companies 
though more efficient now continued to receive stiff competition 
from abroad payrollwatching was in again work forces shrank 
salary increases dwindled 
since 1982 according to sibson amp co a management consulting 
firm salary increases have declined steadily by 1988 merit 
increases averaged just 53 percent and next year says sibson 
the average will be 52 percent 
but now it states the cutting may have reached its limit the 
jobless rate is down to the mid5 percent range meaning most of 
those laidoff workers have found new jobs companies now are 
looking for workers 
it could mean a big shift of emphasis by those who watch the 
bottom line instead of improving profits by squeezing payrolls 
some companies now might have to seek results by rewarding good 
workers with bigger pay raises 
the result says sibson could be the end next year of seven 
years of steadily declining salary increases and downsizing of 
staffs 
it appears companies may have achieved all they can in those 
areas says james mitchell a sibson principal who managed the 
survey the results of which are based on responses from 653 
companies 
many companies are much leaner today than four years ago said 
michell adding that the key issue now facing companies is how to 
retrain and motivate those employees who have remained with their 
organizations 
he concludes that incentive programs which allow companies to 
share the risks and reward with their employees will take on a 
greater role as organizations address this issue 
mitchell said threequarters of survey participants now have 
incentive compensation programs and that many are planning to 
extend them 
the reason he says is corporations recognize they need to pay 
more attention to motivating workers to rewarding performance and 
to increasing productivity 
and as it was in the earlier part of the cycle when downsizing 
and pay restraints were in vogue the goal is the same the bottom 
line

she was a waiflike but winsome coquette whose 
delicious romantic romps added a touch of whimsy to the 1950s and 
early 60s today leslie caron the gigi of yesteryear is a 
grandmother whos about to portray the matriarch of fashion coco 
chanel in a tv movie 
shes also written a book of short stories called vengeance 
and a screenplay she describes as a parable of war 
i suppose i have two sides to my nature caron said in an 
interview but im not cute whatever i am cute is not the 
word 
caron retains a place in film history a time when the musical 
embodied the spirit and romance of an era beginning in 1951 with 
gene kelly in an american in paris through daddy longlegs 
with fred astaire in 1955 to 1958s academy awardwinning gigi 
she won the hearts of audiences around the world 
but now more than three decades later at the age of 57 she is 
remembered mainly as americas french gamineinresidence 
while still a teenager caron was plucked from a paris ballet 
by kelly who took her to hollywood where she went under contract 
for mgm 
i was stereotyped after an american in paris she said 
and i think americans a long long time ago decided that i was 
cute a gamine and all those things actually im a very serious 
person 
caron credits much of her artistic bent to the legacy left by 
her americanborn mother a dancer whose own dreams went 
unfulfilled my mother protected me and helped me fulfill my 
wishes but i think they were the expression of her wishes 
her mothers suicide in 1967 stoked her determination and left 
a feeling of unfinished business as she approached 40 she 
took up writing and refuge in paris her hometown 
a word processer sits on a table in her living room caron had 
just returned from the printer with the script of the film she 
wrote and plans to direct 
its a moral tale its about the incapacity of people to get 
along in other words its a parable of war on a family scale 
she said 
the screenplay whose title she refuses to divulge is to be a 
family affair she hopes her children christopher and 
actressdaughter jennifer who has given her a grandchild will 
participate in the project both are the children of her second 
marriage to peter hall director of britains national theater 
caron has been married three times 
she has written what she calls a good part for herself 
meaning neither cute nor guileless i might have been innocent 
and guileless when i was 18 she said but my god the years 
have passed and ive lived quite a lot of drama and the public 
keeps seeing the same films on the television 
in 1984 doubleday and co published a collection of her short 
stories vengeance 
they are sort of brutal she said no cruel is the better 
word i do have a sharp eye and a wicked sense of humor 
as a onetime star still at work caron is finally able to 
stretch herself as an actress in a variety of roles 
for the last 10 years the spectrum of parts im offered just 
swings widely she said 
most recently she portrays chanel in a syndicated tv miniseries 
for the fall season the man who lived at the ritz based on 
the bestselling novel by ae hotchner it is the story of an 
american artist played by perry king caught in wartime paris 
between the resistance and the nazis 
last year caron played the submissive wife of lenin portrayed 
by ben kingsley in the movie the train which recounted the 
exiled lenins journey home to start the russian revolution she 
also appeared in an episode last year on tvs falcon crest 
caron thinks of herself as a survivor 
i remember a rather cruel producer cruel and rude who said 
as she hired me that she so admired brigitte bardot for retiring 
when she was losing her looks caron recalled i think its so 
against everything i believe because so long as there is life 
theres a contribution you can make i think one must not just 
be banking on ones looks

film producer irwin winkler prefers being on the 
front line to thinking about the bottom line 
for the good producer raising capital is about the last thing 
to worry about he said if youre good the money comes very 
easily 
everybody sees themselves through the golden light i see 
myself as somebody involved from the very conception every film i 
do im involved with from the very conception of the project 
winkler rocky the right stuff raging bull sticks 
to that principle on his latest production betrayed he 
developed the screenplay helped with casting was on the set 
during filming and worked on the postproduction and promotion 
betrayed was directed by costagavras z missing 
and stars debra winger and tom berenger winger plays an fbi agent 
who must learn whether berenger a texas farmer is involved with 
rightwing extremist activities 
the opening scene of betrayed shows the murder of a 
controversial radio personality by a white extremist group similar 
to the 1984 slaying of denver talkshow host alan berg 
i was interested in the subject of the murder of berg and then 
i did some research winkler said i found this kind of 
widespread group of extremists this is a group of people looking 
to overthrow the united states government 
though the producer does not call betrayed a message 
film he hopes it will increase awareness about extremist groups 
what we say is that youve got to face it he said you 
cant run away the only problem i can see for the film is not 
enough people want to recognize that it exists in our country 
berenger was the first to be cast his work as the scarred 
sergeant in the academy awardwinning platoon attracted the 
filmmakers we really wanted someone who was very allamerican 
there arent that many of them winkler said 
winkler prides himself on the care put into each of his films 
his active participation is atypical of film producers 
probably in this business you couldnt name more than a dozen 
really hardworking caring producers that are involved creatively 
making the film he said 
winkler worked as a mailboy a projectionist and a clapper one 
who goes to live tv shows and applauds and laughs before deciding 
to get into the movie business 
he began producing films in the 1960s and had his first major 
hit in 1969 with they shoot horses dont they which received 
nine academy award nominations and won the best actor prize for gig 
young winklers biggest success came with rocky which 
received 10 nominations in 1976 and won the oscar for best picture 
it was just a nice little movie very cheap winkler 
recalled i think it caught the american conciousness at the 
time maybe because we were just coming out of the vietnam war 
and everybody wanted to believe in something and here was a 
character who believed in himself 
the whole purpose of the movie was even if you dont win the 
title if you have selfrespect its more important 
despite his string of successes winkler like most producers 
is largely unknown to the general public which tends to associate 
producers with the financial aspect of the film 
most of the producers dont know what they do the 
misconception of the producers function is really not a 
misconception most producers dont do a very good job he said 
that perception of the producer whose just out there packaging 
all of this is generally right 
while film critics usually detect a pattern in the films of a 
certain director or actor the producers contribution often 
remains unnoticed winkler believes a basic theme does exist a 
winkler trademark so to speak in many of his films 
somebody pointed it out to me that almost every film im 
involved with deals with how people react in a particular 
situation usually a situation of stress he said 
whether its a guy like rocky responding with courage and 
daring or debra winger in betrayed if you go through all those 
films you find that common thread 
winkler does not see that pattern in most of the films now being 
made i think the biggest change in the industry is that the 
studios have really become conglomerates so theres not the 
personal touch you used to have 
he is also concerned about the lack of quality screenplays 
thats whats hurting the business the most what we really have 
to do is show some respect for the writers and encourage more young 
people to become writers so well have better stories 
although many of winklers productions have been financially 
successful he does not claim any expertise in what makes a film 
popular at the box office 
you can never figure he said its a mysterious set of 
circumstances 
as for his movies im just trying to tell a nice story 
whether youre a writer or a producer all you want to do is tell a 
good yarn

when jazz great miles davis recently 
praised the originality of carlos santana the lowkey musician 
expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on 
the musical scene after two decades 
for miles to tell me this hey thats a great compliment but 
it shows that im not on stagnant water said santana whos 
admired for his stirring guitar solos stagnant water stinks you 
need water to go out you need water to come in all the time and 
in order to do it you have to become a student once you have a 
masters and you know everything its a drag 
to keep his music flowing santana will release a threerecord 
lp early next month and has launched a tour that reunites gregg 
rolie jose chepito areas and michael shrieve three original 
members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in san 
franciscos heavily hispanic mission district 
the santana blues band made its debut in 1968 at the fillmore 
west where santana recently held court at a small side table 
overlooking busy geary street talking about his new album the 
feelings behind his music and the popularity of latinrhythm groups 
the mexicanborn santana arrived in san francisco in 1961 
entering the national spotlight with a showstopping performance at 
woodstock in 1969 he has gone on to earn 14 gold albums nine 
platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide 
despite a pocketful of popular hits including evil ways 
black magic woman oye como va soul sacrifice and 
europa the 41yearold santana has continued experimenting 
the new anthology including some unreleased cuts serves to give 
a testimony of the things we have become and lived 
were looking to take the music further i mean play the 
music and respect it for the way you play it but also embrace the 
future and take some new chances said the slender mustachioed 
santana 
we want to serve the people with our music he said music 
is a healing force if played correctly i really believe that 
aside from being the universal language its a healing force and 
reminds us that we have more things in common than we think 
for santana who began playing guitar at age 8 music has never 
been a strictly commercial endeavor 
music is not to make a living he said music is to help 
the conditioning of life people play for many different reasons 
and all of them according to their hearts capacity my capacity 
tells me that i can do a great service by doing music correctly 
people know when youre playing something from your heart and when 
youre just giving lip service 
before gloria estefan and the miami sound machine began doing 
the conga and los lobos started playing texmex santana 
was infusing his music with the latin rhythm 
in past cuts such as samba pa ti oye como va and 
black magic woman santana showcased salsa when it was 
still considered something to add to mexican dishes 
still most of the recent publicity surrounding hispanictheme 
movies la bamba stand and deliver and milagro 
beanfield war and latinrhythm musical groups fail to even 
mention santana 
for gloria estefan and los lobos and all the other 
spanishspeaking people today if they want to go to the future 
they got to go through me first santana said 
on the other hand santana expressed satisfaction his music has 
not been easily categorized and points out his innovative music 
has endured for two decades 
i consider myself a musician and a stylist in bringing forth 
a certain thing that all generations can relate to he said 
thats better for me than being something megaeverything for 
three years 
the new album titled viva santana is the latest of 25 lps 
released during his career he also cut albums with buddy miles and 
john mclaughlin 
the tour began on aug 26 at tacoma wash some scheduled stops 
include st louis richmond va new york boston atlanta dallas 
and los angeles

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle built up a record in congress that departed only 
occasionally from the reagan administrations line but along the 
way he took some positions he doesnt mention in his resume 
for example he advocated special tax breaks for smokers 
dieters foreign golfers batboys and batgirls for professional 
baseball teams and college football coaches 
the tax breaks for smokers and dieters was proposed in a kick 
the habit tax credit bill which he sponsored and which in the 
interest of health would have allowed a tax credit up to 150 for 
half the cost of enrolling in a weightloss or stopsmoking 
program it didnt become law 
and quayle once threatened to try to rename chicago in honor of 
former sen vance hartke dind unless some illinois lawmakers 
dropped efforts to rename the indiana dunes national lakeshore in 
memory of the late sen paul h douglas dill 
during his four years in the house and almost eight years in the 
senate the indiana senator has been a steady advocate for military 
spending and for reducing the governments role in daily life some 
votes have put him at odds with organized labor veterans and other 
interest groups 
quayle sought to overhaul federal budget procedures in an effort 
to cut the budget deficit he voted for president reagans big 1981 
tax cut and then followed that with votes to raise taxes in 1982 
1983 1984 and 1987 tax increases that reagan signed after vowing 
to oppose tax increases quayle now is on record with his running 
mate george bush to oppose future tax increases 
on may 10 1985 quayle and most other senate republicans voted 
for a budget that would have eliminated the costofliving increase 
in social security pensions while boosting the defense budget to 
offset inflation the vice president broke a 4949 tie and the 
budget passed the house subsequently refused to cut the social 
security increases 
the 41yearold quayle is best known as an author of the 1982 
job training partnership act which emphasized involvement of local 
government and private employers in training young and unskilled 
workers his senate coauthor was sen edward m kennedy dmass 
whose name the republicans invoke with ridicule on the campaign 
trail 
as a member of the senate armed services committee quayle 
developed a reputation for learning the intricacies of the defense 
budget and weapons systems few are more vocal in support of 
reagans strategic defense initiative nicknamed star wars 
after some initial skepticism he fought tirelessly for approval 
earlier this year of the ussoviet armslimitation treaty and 
to the surprise of some conservatives opposed most of a dozen 
conservative challenges to the pact 
quayle fought just as consistently against another top 
initiative of 1988 a democraticsponsored bill requiring that 
large companies give workers at least 60 days notice before a 
shutdown he voted for every effort to water down the bill 
he voted for aid to the antigovernment rebels in nicaragua for 
a constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in schools 
against abortion against gun control and for capital punishment 
although he endorsed extension of the voting rights act he 
fought restoration of some civilrights protections that had been 
nullified by a supreme court decision 
breaking with the white house he voted to override reagans 
vetoes of economic sanctions against south africa and of a bill 
authorizing 18 billion in cleanwater projects last year he voted 
for an 88 billion highwaymasstransit bill but would not vote to 
override reagans veto of that measure 
here are some other stands taken by quayle

twentyseven times this year sen lloyd 
bentsen has voted against the majority of his democratic colleagues 
in the senate on a variety of issues including star wars abortion 
and immigration policy and some of his votes put him at odds with 
his running mate michael dukakis 
when 77 percent of senate democrats voted on feb 4 against 
granting 60 million to rebels fighting the nicaraguan government 
bentsen was on the opposite side on july 13 75 percent of 
democrats voted against allowing oil drilling in parts of the 
eastern gulf of mexico but bentsen voted for it 
those votes were an exception for the texas senator who now is 
his partys nominee for vice president 
during 17 years in the senate he has usually been found in the 
middle of the pack of 212 substantive votes bentsen has cast this 
year 185 or 87 percent sided with the majority of democrats 
in 1987 bentsen voted on 408 roll calls and 90 percent of the 
time on 365 votes he sided with most other democrats 
averaging his annual ratings by the americans for democratic 
actas bentsen has 
said referring to the leftist government in nicaragua 
dukakis favors federal financing of abortions bentsen calls the 
issue one of the toughest for him but generally supports federal 
money only in the case of rape or incest or when the mothers life 
would be endangered by carrying a baby to term 
on the basic question of abortion bentsen says its a 
womans right to make that decision after consulting her physician 
hopefully her pastor or priest 
dukakis apparently is unequivocally opposed to capital 
punishment bentsen has voted for it most recently on may 16 when 
the senate approved the death penalty for certain drugrelated 
murders more than half the democrats opposed that bill 
dukakis favors handgun control bentsen is on the other side on 
the most recent vote on the issue in 1987 bentsen opposed an 
amendment prohibiting firearms that cannot be detected by airport 
security devices seventyfour percent of democratic senators voted 
for the amendment 
dukakis and bentsen appear unconcerned about their differences 
i didnt pick lloyd bentsen to be a clone of michael dukakis 
the presidential nominee explained we agree on most things but 
we disagree on some 
bentsen was in the minority on april 20 when the senate on a 
6135 vote killed an amendment that would have required a balanced 
federal budget before any financial reparations could be paid to 
japaneseamericans interned during world war ii only eight other 
democrats were with bentsen on that vote 
bentsen later voted for the reparations bill which passed 6927 
more than twothirds of democrats favored a sixmonth extension 
of the amnesty period during which illegal immigrants could apply 
for legalization but bentsen voted with most republicans and the 
extension failed 5640 
bentsen whose states energy industry is in deep trouble voted 
july 13 to allow the interior department to approve drilling on 
existing leases in the eastern gulf of mexico the amendment failed 
5937 with 75 percent of democrats voting no 
on 150 of the 212 substantive votes this year bentsen voted on 
the same side as majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
and liberal sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts on 17 
occasions bentsen was aligned against the two he was allied with 
byrd against kennedy on 23 votes on eight he sided with kennedy 
against byrd 
bentsen has consistently been among a minority of democrats on 
key defense issues he has been considerably more hawkish 
on the 27 votes this year in which bentsen was opposed by most 
members of his party six were on major defense questions 
including the mx mobile missile the strategic defense initiative 
he opposed cuts in both dukakis opposes sdi also known as star 
wars and on requiring the mothballing of two aging aircraft 
carriers when their replacements are commissioned he opposed it 
some other key bentsen votes this year 
down the line against conservative efforts to modify the 
ussoviet inf arms treaty 
for the grove city civil rights restoration bill and most 
attempts to weaken it against most democrats he supported 
amendments involving abortion and schools controlled by religious 
organizations 
for a bill generally prohibiting employers from using lie 
detectors on employees 
for legislation prohibiting a president from withholding 
details of covert operations from congress 
against a resolution disapproving a usjapanese agreement on 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
for three major bills that he as chairman of the finance 
committee shepherded through the senate welfare overhaul 
medicare benefits for some expenses of catastrophic illness with a 
tax increase on the elderly to pay for them and a sweeping trade 
bill 
for an amendment requiring that government aidsrelated 
literature emphasize abstinence from illegal drug use and from sex 
outside a monogamous marriage 
against stripping federal courts of authority in cases 
involving disputes about school prayer 
for requiring that lucrative golden parachute benefits for 
corporate executives be subject to stockholder approval 
against requiring written parental consent before government 
clinics may provide contraceptives to minors 
for creating a department of veterans affairs in the cabinet

politicians and olympic sponsors usually try for 
the limelight with advertising every four years but their efforts 
this year have failed to make ad company stocks stars on wall 
street 
industry analysts estimate that the major advertising stocks as 
a group have underperformed the broader market by about 10 percent 
this year 
they say the outlook for the group remains tied closely to the 
performance of the economy next year 
the industry has gone through three tough years said alan 
gottesman who follows the ad business for the investment firm 
painewebber 
but he said the rigors of industry consolidation and 
costcutting may have put the group in a position to benefit from 
whatever surprises may lie ahead 
over the past two years consolidation created some huge ad 
holding companies omnicom group inc wpp group plc and a bigger 
saatchi amp saatchi plc the publiclyheld ad companies also include 
interpublic group of companies inc ogilvy group and foote cone amp 
belding communications inc 
simultaneously agencies were laying off workers and taking 
other costcutting steps gottesman estimates ad industry 
employment is down 3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago 
the belttightening came in time for the industry to reap 
earnings benefits from ad spending growth expected due to the 
elections and the olympic games 
but the anticipated spurt has largely failed to materialize 
in june the industry guru robert j coen of the ad agency 
mccannerickson scaled back his estimate of us ad spending growth 
for the year to 84 percent down from the 9 percent gain he had 
forecast six months earlier 
some other ad industry analysts expect even slower growth 
james dougherty who follows advertising stocks for county 
securities said the quadrennial year is turning out to be a big 
zero he expects an increase excluding direct mail spending of 5 
percent to 6 percent this year 
dougherty said the economy is at a different stage in the 
business cycle than it was when ad spending climbed at doubledigit 
rates in 1976 and 1984 
the economic news this year hasnt been bad but it hasnt 
been as good as it was in those years at the beginning of a big 
expansion he said 
charles crane who follows the ad business for prudentialbache 
securities said us ad spending should rise about 7 percent this 
year 
he said spending didnt get its normal quadrennial lift because 
consumer spending increases have been anemic that hurt ad stocks 
he said because the market has been shying away from consumer 
cyclical stocks this year 
looking ahead coen expects ad spending will grow 75 percent in 
1989 while dougherty and crane expect growth roughly matching this 
years pace 
dougherty noted that commercial time is sold out on the summer 
olympics broadcasts and that advance sales of time on the three 
major television networks for the fall exceeded last years strong 
totals 
but even so he said i dont have anybody telling me clients 
are increasing their budgets 
crane said a pickup may occur in consumer spending as the trauma 
of last falls stock market crash recedes and said that would make 
the case for 1989 not being a bad year at all 
as a result he finds the ad stocks attractive with the caveat 
that i dont expect a recession before 1990 
in their search for new ways to generate revenue some of the 
major ad agencies have been buying marketing services firms that 
offer the consulting promotion and design work that ad companies 
once spurned 
dougherty said the results from this shopping spree have been 
mixed 
crane said a gradual movement by major advertisers away from the 
flatfee system of compensating ad agencies could be a boon to 
wellmanaged agencies 
under some new methods agencies are taking lower base rates but 
get incentive payments if their advertising works boosting sales 
or market share 
gottesman said the recent pace of new product introductions 
indicates that consumer products companies are taking risks and 
becoming more agressive that could be a plus for ad companies 
because new product rollouts usually mean more advertising 
he is not pushing the group but feels good about it 
if there are no surprises the ad stocks go sideways 
gottesman said but if we see some surprises the surprises will 
likely be on the good side and the stocks are going to go up

ever alert for investment opportunities many 
americans have been burned in recent years by unscrupulous 
operators promoting overpriced art and collectors coins the 
federal trade commission warns 
while both rare coins and art can prove good investments 
avoiding mistakes requires either considerable knowledge or 
reliance on a trustworthy adviser 
perhaps the most important thing to avoid is allowing oneself to 
be pressured into a quick decision especially by a telephone 
salesperson the ftc says 
and do not give out credit card numbers or bank account numbers 
to anyone calling you 
often salespeople will claim you have won some sort of contest 
and the numbers are needed for verification dont fall for it 
the ftc warns you risk big losses by giving out such numbers to 
unfamiliar callers 
salespeople often try to snow buyers with tales of big increases 
in the value of prints or coins 
in the case of art they will sometimes ghoulishly claim the 
artist is seriously ill and that when he dies the price will 
skyrocket 
but the technology for reproducing pictures is excellent today 
so that what is claimed to be a limited edition print worth 500 to 
3500 can in fact turn out to be a good quality reproduction 
worth 50 at best 
therefore it is very important to consult a reputable local 
authority on the subject such as an art appraiser or museum 
curator before purchasing any work of art the ftc says in a new 
consumer fact sheet on art fraud 
copies of the alert as well as ftc investor alerts on rare 
coins telephone investment fraud and telemarketing travel fraud 
can be obtained at no charge by writing public reference 
federal trade commission washington dc 20580 
the ftc urges consumers to be skeptical of claims of 
authenticity for coins and art noting that crooks often print up 
fraudulent certificates or authenticity for art or fake coin 
grading certificates they sometimer refer buyers to experts 
who are actually paid by them and may promise refunds which they 
later refuse to make good on 
it can help to check out sellers with the local better business 
bureau consumer office or state attorney generals office but 
remember it isnt unusual for a company to change its name 
periodically to avoid being identified with past complaints 
whatever the situation dont be rushed the ftc urges no offer 
is so good that it cannot wait for a cool professional examination 
ask yourself if this offer is so good why is a total 
stranger making the effort to sell me this investment the agency 
suggests 
in the case of rare coins the ftc suggests checking with 
professional organizations to see if the dealer is a member in good 
standing before sending any money these groups include the 
american numismatic association in colorado springs colo industry 
council for tangible assets washington dc and professional 
numismatists guild in van nuys calif

dan quayle born into a world of indiana 
privilege and conservative causes preached the gospel of 
rockribbed republicanism long before he ever walked the corridors 
of congress or became george bushs running mate 
politics comes naturally to the family said ernest 
williams retired editor of the nearby fort wayne news sentinel 
dan represents the fulfillment of a family dream 
in his road to the republican ticket quayle never wavered in 
his personal or political leanings the popular fraternity boy 
became an amiable candidate the teen who learned golf made the 
game his passion the youth who displayed a barry goldwater sticker 
on his car in the 60s proudly voted for the tenets of the reagan 
revolution from his back bench in the senate 
back at depauw university in the late 1960s he was basically 
a little political commentator recalls delta kappa epsilon 
fraternity brother john socolofsky i think you genuinely could 
see something light up there there was definitely a spark 
he was really well versed he added it was obvious that 
was the fabric of the family 
however not everyone saw him quite that way quayle was 
undistinguished and mediocre said michael lawrence a 
former depauw professor who taught quayle constitutional law he 
didnt work very hard he was not very bright he didnt get much 
done 
asked about quayle being chosen for the no 2 spot on the gop 
ticket lawrence said it confirms what i was told when i was a 
little kid that anybody can grow up to be president 
in the days since quayle was anointed by george bush the fabric 
of his family has turned into political drama as quayle struggled 
to vindicate himself amid a torrent of controversy about his 
lackluster academic career his personal life and most of all his 
national guard service during the vietnam war and whether he used 
family clout to secure bulletfree duty 
in a matter of days james danforth quayle 41 the first baby 
boomer on a national ticket has catapulted from relative obscurity 
to the withering glare of the limelight a man on the hot seat a 
secondterm senator vying to be a heartbeat away from the 
presidency 
from a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized bang 
hes suddenly put in the spotlight law school friend and federal 
appeals judge dan manion said this week he was unprepared and 
thats probably not a very good way to put a vice president in 
if this is a test of quayles mettle hell pass with flying 
colors his friends believe 
from everything i have seen hes demonstrating very definite 
resilience said gerald warren quayles former economics 
professor at depauw hell survive very well 
quayle surely inherited his fervor for conservative politics 
from his grandfather eugene c pulliam a media mogul who founded 
a multimilliondollar newspaper empire that includes the arizona 
republic phoenix gazette indianapolis star and indianapolis news 
the quayle family owns the huntington ind heraldpress 
quayles father james is publisher the senator who worked as a 
young associate publisher before entering politics is vice 
president the circulation of the paper is less than 9000 
quayle spent his childhood in indiana and arizona moving west 
with his family as a small boy in the mid 50s when his father 
helped run the pulliam newspapers they returned to huntington in 
1963 when dan was a high school junior 
for quayle life in this rural northeast indiana town was filled 
with pennyante poker games with his buddies dancing to juke box 
tunes at the nowdefunct swing inn part of the ymca and cruising 
down jefferson street stopping at the aampw root beer stand and the 
penguin point drivein 
he had a regular kid existence said high school pal taylor 
cope now a chicago area cardiologist its been said he was a 
rich kid but that never showed when he was a teen he didnt have 
his own car he borrowed his mothers 
as a senior in college he was a big man on campus and drove a 
beatup international scout 
already his political philosophy was forming he was very 
very conservative at the time he was pro goldwater cope 
recalled he was prowar because the president was prowar 
carla rice who dated quayle in high school told a reporter 
quayle had a bumper sticker on his car with the chemical symbols 
for gold and water and he said in this big voice and that is 
the next president of the united states 
the conservative sentiment light years away from the angry 
chants and windowsmashing rampages of the antivietnam protests 
also prevailed at depauw a small upper middleclass liberal arts 
college in greencastle where quayle majored in political science 
it was not a very controversial social environment said 
socolofsky the war wasnt even debated in classrooms there 
michael miller economist with the us bureau of labor 
statistics and a former fraternity brother was a freshman when 
quayle was a pledge trainer 
i remember the night richard nixon was elected in 1968 dan 
had a party in his room there were a couple of tvs going the only 
thing i can remember he quayle was at the convention he was an 
usher to the stage he really got a big kick out of that 
the democrats were studying somewhere i suppose

following his fathers and grandfathers footsteps quayle 
joined delta kappa epsilon also bushs fraternity at yale and 
became vice president at the socalled campus animal house 
we were the beer generation socolofsky added we really 
enjoyed getting a keg of beer putting some music on and having 
dates whatever the trend on other campuses quayle has said he 
never used or even experimented with marijuana 
quayle was popular making friends easily he also was a premier 
golfer but his academic record was less impressive quayle says he 
was the proverbial cplus student but he flunked a 
comprehensive political exam he needed to graduate he later took a 
different test and passed 
ted katula depauws athletic director and former golf coach 
says quayle was a very tough competitor i liked his confidence 
it gave me confidence hes very aggressive id like to 
have six dan quayles playing for me 
quayles nonetoostellar academic career later became a touchy 
topic when depauw faculty members rejected a proposal to award the 
senator an honorary law degree they later reversed themselves 
after the university president appealed 
after college quayle entered the national guard at the height 
of the war wendell phillippi a former indianapolis news editor 
and a family friend said he recommended quayle to a top guard 
official who asked the guard personnel office to put a slot on 
hold for him he was brought aboard as a welder before being 
shifted to a public relations post 
questions about whether the hawkish quayle pulled strings to 
avoid the front lines have dogged the senator who at weeks end 
refused to answer any more questions about it i was not seeking 
special treatment he said no rules were broken 
james quayle also denied suggestions this week that clout got 
his son into indiana university school of law when his grades 
couldnt his father told a reporter that dannys a pretty good 
salesman who talked his way into law school arguing depauw was 
tougher than other schools 
in law school quayle met his wife marilyn another law 
student they wed after a 10week courtship and have three children 
associates say the quayles live a middleclass existence in 
suburban northern virginia with marilyn cutting and styling her 
husbands hair and both sharing parental duties such as 
babysitting 
starting out in indiana quayle worked as investigator for the 
state attorney generals office administrative assistant to the 
governor and at the huntington paper before a gop official orvas 
beers approached him to challenge democratic eightterm rep ed 
roush in 1976 
he is a real charmer beers says now i thought hed get 
a lot of the womens vote because of his friendliness his 
personality and his good looks 
beers said quayle took to politics naturally only one time 
did i ever have to suggest anything danny was standing talking to 
a group of people when he was running for the first time i said 
danny get yourself out and shaking hands he didnt argue a bit 
and he didnt stop shaking hands the rest of the campaign 
quayles former press secretary larry smith said the 
blueeyed blond senator bristles at talk about his looks and 
comparisons to matinee idol robert redford he wanted to be taken 
seriously he wanted to be taken as a professional trying to do a 
job said smith news director of whastv in louisville ky 
one day a trade group from indiana visited quayles office and 
as is custom they were asked if they wanted a photo taken with the 
senator one woman in particular was thrilled smith recalls 
she made a compliment about his beautiful blue eyes he was very 
embarrassed he tried to lighten the moment he said larrys got 
blue eyes 
quayle served two terms in the house before defeating threeterm 
sen birch bayh in the 1980 reagan landslide taking on bayh it 
gives you an idea about his competitiveness katula said hes 
not afraid to take a chance 
quayle easily won reelection in 1986 and is known as an expert 
on defense issues and an ardent supporter of reagans star wars 
antimissile shield he also led the administration fight against 
providing advance notice of plant closings and wrote the job 
training partnership act a nationwide employment program 
earlier in his career quayle was on the fringes of a scandal 
that resurfaced with his nomination to the bush ticket in 1981 an 
insurance industry lobbyist paula parkinson said she had had a 
relationship with a delaware congressman and shared a vacation 
house in florida a year earlier with him and two other house 
members one of whom was quayle 
playboy magazine for whom parkinson subsequently posed 
reported this week that she will say in an upcoming issue that 
quayle propositioned her and she refused quayle has angrily denied 
the accusation and said he was there on a golfing outing 
smith says of his exboss i never saw dan quayle give a 
second look to any woman he was as straight an arrow youd ever 
want to meet 
smith said quayle has a hard time keeping on schedule he said 
one day they were running from one meeting to another and they were 
trying to get to an airport we passed a driving range and im 
watching the clock 
quayle made them stop dan picked up a can of balls and he 
fired off a few said smith while they anxiously waited that 
was his release and his relaxation they made it to the airport 
friends say that although theyre a little surprised at quayles 
fast climb up the political ladder hes used his assets well 
what hes done shows he had some talent and organization and 
friends in the right places cope says his success speaks well 
for himself

speculated that an end to the fighting between the two opec nations 
could mean the fractious 13member oil cartel would set production 
limits thus helping to raise world oil prices 
but on thursday analysts said the market reacted to rumors that 
iran had refused to go along with a quota proposed by other opec 
members

strong world economies attractive airline fares 
and a movement by airlines to more fuelefficient aircraft have 
helped boeing co break its own 10yearold record for commercial 
jets ordered in a year the company says 
boeing announced thursday that an linjeflyg a domestic swedish 
airline had ordered six 737500 jetliners and took options on six 
more giving boeing 466 jetliner orders for the year 
that broke the old record of 461 planes boeing set in 1978 
the order worth more than 175 million boosted the dollar 
value of boeings announced 1988 orders to 207 billion boeing 
several weeks ago surpassed the record of 199 billion in new 
orders set last year 
this represents four consecutive years of record orders for 
boeing john hayhurst vice president of marketing for boeing 
commercial airplanes told a news conference 
this has been a very good year added chris longridge vice 
president of sales for the boeing operating company next year 
were forecasting to have a reasonable year perhaps not as good as 
this one 
still hayhurst said boeing is predicting that over the next two 
decades the worlds airlines will need almost as many new planes 
as the 8171 now in service and boeing should continue to provide 
the largest share 
boeing this year picked up a number of large orders including 
15 747400 jumbo jets by japan air lines 50 757s by american 
airlines 30 757s by united airlines and the biggest commercial 
jetliner order ever a 46 billion deal with international lease 
finance corp for 100 aircraft 
in addition both gpa rolls ltd of shannon ireland and delta 
air lines of atlanta have said they may be interested in ordering 
large numbers of boeing planes possibly this year 
with the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with gpa 
rolls a delta order and another possible 75 jets which could be 
used in the navys longrange antisubmarine warfare patrol 
aircraft program boeing could keep going like gangbusters said 
paul nisbet an aerospace analyst with prudentialbache securities 
in new york 
hayhurst said boeing has benefited from strong world economies 
that permit people to travel airline fares also are attractive he 
said particularly in the united states 
further airlines are starting to turn to more fuelefficient 
and economical aircraft including new boeing planes that hayhurst 
said are significantly cheaper to operate and far quieter than 
earlier jets 
hayhurst said boeing predicts that air traffic growth will 
continue at about 5 percent a year through 2005 
all of this means a significant amount of traffic growth in 
the next 17 years he said in fact in the year 2005 that 5 
percent traffic will mean that the traffic growth will be about 2 
times what it is today and we forseee a requirement for about 
7400 airplanes new airplanes in that delivery timeframe 
longridge said boeing now has backlog of 1036 jets the 
industrys highest which translates to years of work on its 
commercial production lines 
presently boeing is turning out 14 737s and four 757s a month 
at its renton wash plant with 757 production to increase to 
five a month next february longridge said the company is making 
five widebody 767s and three 747s a month at its everett wash 
plant but plans to boost that rate to five jumbo jets a month by 
mid1989 he said 
he declined to say whether these plans mean additional hiring at 
boeing which now employs about 92000 people in the puget sound 
region 
stockholmbased linjeflyg a new customer for boeing will take 
delivery of the first of the 108passenger 737500s in february 
1991 the new jets will be powered by cfm563b1 engines 
boeings stock closed down 12 cents a share thursday at 
5862 after rising 212 a share wednesday

we have the manpower we need but not all the equipment 
said mike tracy a spokesman for the idaho farm bureau which 
organized the project in conjunction with the iowa farm bureau

to donate equipment for the harvest but there was still a need for 
swathers hay balers and tractors he said 
burlington northern is donating railcars to ship the hay back to 
iowa 
farmers in the colfax wash area also donated more than 1000 
bales of their own hay to the iowans 
midwestern farmers lost as much as 75 percent of their hay crop 
to the worst drought in 50 years this summer 
tracy originally estimated as much as 5000 tons of hay could be 
harvested on the original 4500 acres it was not known how much 
could be expected to be harvested on 20000 acres 
the 64 men women and teenagers arrived tuesday after a 
40hour 1600mile bus trip from south and central iowa

miles northeast of moscow on land set aside in a government 
erosioncontrol program the us department of agriculture 
recently released the conservation reserve program land which is 
normally not farmed for harvest by droughtafflicted farmers 
the harvest could take as long as 10 days but cutting and 
baling must be finished by aug 31 a deadline set by the 
agriculture department tracy said organizers have notified the 
office of sen james mcclure ridaho that they may have to ask 
for an extension from agriculture secretary richard lyng

community was overwhelming the iowans said harvest equipment was 
donated by local farmers and implement dealers

the price of cocoa on the london market dropped to 
its lowest level in seven years friday 
in morning dealings cocoa beans for december delivery changed 
hands at 831 pounds 1404 per metric ton a loss of 24 pounds 
40 on last nights close and the lowest price for cocoa since 
june 1981 traders said a metric ton is equivalent to 220462 
pounds 
the markets weakness reflects the prospect that 198889 which 
runs between october and september could be the fifth consecutive 
season of overproduction the sources added 
hopes are also dwindling that international cocoa organization 
producer and consumer member countries can settle differences and 
open the way for new pricesupport measures 
the two sides meet here next month to discuss a possible 
stockpiling scheme but its introduction depends on agreement on 
the minimum price that should be defended and payment by producers 
of arrears to the organization industry sources said 
crop prospects in west africa and the far east are said to be 
better than at this time last year when drought was causing some 
concern and another record crop is therefore in prospect for 
198889 
latest figures from the international cocoa organization and 
private traders indicate that the current 198887 crop will reach 
an alltime high of more than 2 million metric tons 
many countries including the ivory coast brazil malaysia and 
indonesia are expecting record 198788 production figures 
traders said that the ivory coast the worlds biggest cocoa 
producer could harvest an even bigger crop in 198889 than this 
seasons estimated 630000 to 645000 tons 
such a prospect would increase pressure on the countrys cocoa 
marketing authorities to relax their present reserve selling 
strategy 
since april the ivory coast has been refusing offers under 
1300 per ton for its highquality cocoa ivorian officials said 
this has pushed up the price for best quality beans generally 
but there is a big surplus of poorer quality cocoa that is 
depressing the london market traders said

will explode in the next two weeks causing severe damage to 
crops the un food and agriculture organization warned friday 
the extent of infestation in certain african countries is 
enormous and we are extremely concerned fao directorgeneral 
edouard saouma said in a statement there is no doubt that there 
will be heavy damage to crops in the middle of the agricultural 
season 
dr lukas brader head of the agencys emergency center for 
locust operations said that 6 to 7 million hectares 14 to 17 
million acres of land in chad sudan and niger are currently 
infested with dense bands of locust larvae 
they are going to explode in the next two weeks and form 
massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural 
lands he said adding that the size of each swarm could cover 
hundreds of square kilometers 
the plague has reached unprecedented proportions and cannot be 
controlled in the near future brader said 
heavy rains particulary in sudan have created favorable 
breeding conditions for the locusts while the situation has been 
serious for several weeks in chad and sudan the problem has 
sharply worsened recently in niger with some 17 million hectares 
42 million acres infested fao said

eight states want to find out whether claims 
made by dozens of food companies in advertising are misleading 
authorities in minnesota california massachusetts new york 
missouri texas iowa and wisconsin are examining advertising that 
could lead consumers to believe that some products are low in such 
substances as cholesterol sugars and fats officials said 
the states have been cooperating in a summerlong investigation 
norine olsonelm a minnesota special assistant attorney general 
said thursday 
we are not challenging ingredients ms olsonelm said from 
her st paul minn office we are concerned about advertising 
and labeling how products are marketed and promoted to the 
public 
the states have not decided how to proceed if they find evidence 
of false or deceptive advertising but they ultimately could sue 
the companies the attorney said 
fines would range from 2500 in california to 25000 in 
minnesota for each violation she said 
the states started the investigation because the claims in some 
of the advertising were not covered by federal law ms olsonelm 
said 
consumers interpret light to mean low in calories rather than 
light in color and texture ms olsonelm said light is not 
defined by federal law consumers have no clear perception other 
than it is a reduction 
five companies known to be under scrutiny are procter amp gamble 
co of cincinnati kitchens of sara lee deerfield ill nabisco 
brands inc east hanover nj campbell soup co camden nj 
and louis rich co madison wis the newspaper said such diverse 
products as soup cereal cheesecake and meats are involved 
procter amp gamble has been asked to provide information 
substantiating its claims that its allvegetable crisco shortening 
contains no cholesterol 
spokesmen for the companies said they stand behind the 
advertising 
the investigation covers television radio and print advertising 
regarding nutrition and such ailments as heart problems cancer and 
osteoporosis 
companies have been asked to provide samples of advertising ms 
olsonelm said 
we have set different deadlines for each company she said 
there is no one target date 
one concern of the states is the use of palm oil which ms 
olsonelm said is higher in saturated fat than many other oils 
although soybean oil is the primary ingredient in pampgs crisco 
shortening advertised as being cholesterolfree it contains 
some palm oil 
studies indicate that saturated fats in palm oil will increase 
cholesterol and therefore we are concerned about palm oil being 
included in products that are otherwise lower in saturated fats 
ms olsonelm said 
cholesterol is a fatty substance in the blood that clogs 
arteries often contributing to heart attacks 
palm oil is added to crisco to give it texture at room 
temperature procter amp gamble spokesman don tassone said 
the saturated fat content of palm oil is 40 percent but because 
of the relatively small amount of it in crisco the overall level 
of saturated fats in crisco is 28 percent tassone said he said 
palm oil as a vegetable oil does not contain cholesterol

americans personal incomes climbed a healthy 
06 percent in july while consumer spending slowed from its 
breakneck pace of the previous month the government reported today 
the commerce department said that the increase in incomes 
matched a 06 percent rise in june and would have been even 
stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to 
farmers 
personal consumption spending which includes virtually 
everything except interest payments on debt rose 05 percent in 
july less than half the 11 percent rise in june the report 
attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars 
the slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the 
economy because of worries that demand this year has been 
outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods thus 
creating rising inflationary pressures 
the income gain looked particularly impressive because the key 
component wages and salaries shot up 1 percent during the month 
reflecting continued strong employment gains 
this was offset somewhat by a 9 billion rate of decline for 
farm subsidy payments excluding these payments which show extreme 
monthtomonth volatility personal incomes would have risen 08 
percent in july 
americans disposable or aftertax incomes rose 06 percent in 
july down only slightly from a 07 percent june increase 
with incomes rising slightly faster than spending the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable incomes edged 
up to 43 percent in july compared to 42 percent in june 
following the 11 percent rise in spending in june which had 
been the biggest advance in 10 months the 05 percent july 
increase reflected gains in purchases of nondurable goods and 
services 
nondurable goods spending rose at an annual rate of 35 
billion compared to a 55 billion june increase purchases of 
services which includes housing costs increased 122 billion 
following an even stronger 186 billion june increase 
but purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following 
a 12 billion rise in june because sales of new cars fell during 
july

the son of hamburger magnate carl n karcher 
admitted under oath to insider trading saying he ordered the sale 
of carl karcher enterprises securities when he found out the 
company was about to have a drop in earnings according to federal 
documents 
the securities and exchange commission said in recently filed 
papers that carl leo karcher hould be found guilty and fined 
without a trial because the admissions clearly established guilt 
us district judge edward rafeedie is expected to rule on the 
secs motion for a summary judgment on sept 12 it was disclosed 
this week 
the younger karcher told sec lawyers during an outofcourt 
hearing in 1985 that he didnt believe he was doing anything wrong 
by selling the debentures to the company that operates the carls 
jr fastfood chain four days before the firms losses were 
publicized 
i firmly believe that it was my legal right to sell those 
at the time if i was selling it at a loss karcher told the 
lawyers 
karcher saved at least 10500 by selling the debentures and 
avoiding the drop in market price the sec says 
insider trading charges have been filed against karcher his 
father and 13 other family members 
the sec alleges the elder karcher illegally tipped off some of 
his relatives in 1984 that the anaheimbased company was headed for 
a drop in earnings 
all the defendants have denied the charges the sec is seeking a 
summary judgment only against the younger karcher

dallasbased foxmeyer drug co 
melvin zahn the companys owner and son of its founder 
declined to give a reason for the sale or to disclose the purchase

the tokyo stock exchange said friday that 34 
employees of nippon steel co and sankyo seiki manufacturing co 
bought more than 68000 shares of sankyos stock before the 
companies announced a business deal 
fifteen employees of sankyo a precision machinery maker and 19 
employees of nippon steel purchased an average of 2000 sankyo 
shares each as early as four months before the announcement 
according to the exchanges transaction review section 
officials at the finance ministry and the exchange have been 
investigating trading in sankyo whose stock soared hours before 
nippon japans largest steelmaker purchased an 18 percent stake 
in the company 
the exchange took the unusual move of suspending trading in 
sankyo shares on the afternoon of july 29 but the volume of sankyo 
shares traded in the morning session still was nearly 10 times the 
previous days level 
securities officials have said they had suspected massive 
insider trading 
the exchange refused to name any of the 34 employees or charge 
them with insider trading even though it confirmed that some of 
them were directly involved with coordinating the business 
agreement 
under the current law those individuals did not violate any 
law and we can not say they were involved in insider trading 
said takao nojiri a senior managing director of the exchange we 
believe it is not appropriate for us give out information which may 
lead to identifying them 
but nojiri acknowledged that there apparently was a leak of 
insider information

a lawyer for entertainer merv 
griffin has proposed a trust agreement in which griffin would take 
control of resorts international inc stock and then place the 
atlantic city casino under a trust headed by a former industry 
executive 
the casino control commission was to rule today on the proposal 
which could clear the way for griffin to apply for interim 
authorization to run the casino he is trying to buy it from 
developer donald trump and other shareholders 
this morning resorts international adjourned a special 
stockholders meeting in atlantic city because not enough votes were 
cast to approve griffins offer to acquire the hotelcasino 
business 
company head ig jack davis said the american stock 
exchange erroneously reported the meeting would be held sept 13 so 
an insufficient number of votes were cast 
the meeting was scheduled to resume tuesday at 3 pm at the 
atlantic city casino he said 
under a proposal outlined to the commission thursday by lawyer 
nicholas casiello the griffin co solely owned by the former talk 
show host would take control of the resorts stock the company in 
turn would be placed under a trust headed by al luciani a former 
casino executive 
the state attorney generals office has opposed that 
arrangement deputy attorney general mary jo flaherty told 
commissioners the stock should be placed directly under the control 
of the trust rather than griffins company 
griffin has agreed to buy resorts stock for about 300 million 
and sell back to trump the unfinished taj mahal casino complex 
the deal is contingent on state approval of a trust agreement 
and an interim authorization for griffin to operate the casino

a federal bankruptcy judge ruled today 
that former financier marvin l warner cannot escape the payment of 
22 million in restitution he was ordered to make by an ohio court 
lawrence kane jr special prosecutor for the state of ohio 
said the order by us bankruptcy judge george l proctor was 
very significant 
proctor granted the state of ohios motion for summary judgment 
in the case 
warner 69 a former us ambassador to switzerland owned the 
cincinnatibased home state savings bank which collapsed in 1985 
after losing 144 million in investments 
warner was sentenced in march 1987 by an ohio judge to 3 years 
in prison and ordered to pay 22 million in restitution after he 
was convicted of six counts of unauthorized acts and three counts 
of securities fraud in connection with the banks failure he is 
appealing that conviction and sentence 
warner who filed for reorganization of his finances under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in october 1987 had 
sought a ruling that he was no longer liable for restitution 
ordered by the state of ohio because he had filed for bankruptcy 
but the judge ruled warner cannot avoid the 22 million order 
through the bankruptcy mechanism kane said 
the ruling kane said will allow the state of ohio to proceed 
against warner to collect the money including any future assets he 
may obtain 
according to warners financial schedules creditors are seeking 
to recover 45 billion from him he claimed he has only 384 
million in assets

prices closed lower on the london stock exchange 
friday as concerns over rising global interest rates and poor 
british trade figures continued to unsettle the market 
trading dwindled almost to a standstill during the afternoon as 
most players covered positions ahead of the threeday bank holiday 
weekend in britain dealers said 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index finished down 
95 points or 05 percent at 17707 
volume was a moderate 4156 million shares compared with the 
5241 million shares traded thursday however most of the 
sessions volume was recorded during the course of the morning and 
a scant 182 million shares changed hands in the last hour of 
trading 
analysts said the market was still reeling from thursdays news 
that britains merchandise trade deficit widened to 215 billion 
pounds in july from about 1 billion pounds in june 
the trade deficit double the markets expectations provoked 
the bank of england to signal a 1 percent hike in british 
commercial banks base lending rates to 12 percent 
the market is clearly taking its time to absorb and adjust to 
news that was as shocking as the trade figures said charles 
larkum an equity analyst at james capel and co in london 
larkum said little economic or corporate news was expected over 
the course of the next two weeks and predicted that the ftse 
100stock index would remain around its current levels the only 
factor that could upset this scenario is if wall street pulls lower 
with any significant momentum he said 
the market is bound to stay nervous until we get some more 
data coming through larkum said

when shes not tending to her sheep or 
horses sara shaw is busy running a mailorder food business out of 
her farm house that ships smoked pheasant and other locally 
produced foods all over the country 
shaw who was involved in the antiwar movement in the 1960s and 
worked as a book designer in new york city before moving to 
minnesota in 1973 started prairie gourmet last summer 
i dont envision myself as the head of a big corporation 
said shaw whose business is located near ortonville in western 
minnesota i just want it to be a stable business that offers 
employment to people in the area 
shaw was raised in meriden conn but said shes found her 
niche in rural america 
this is my way of counting very quietly i can make a 
difference by the jobs for women by responsible agriculture 
said shaw who lives in a comfortably cluttered farm house 
surrounded by farm fields in my own small way ive come full 
circle rather than thinking that i have to go out and protest 
ive chosen to come back to the country and work 
shaw said she decided to start her own company following a 
divorce and after hearing an inspirational speech by texas 
agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
hightowers talk was about how he was trying to turn around 
the texas food economy by not shipping all of their produce out to 
be processed but instead doing it in state his talk was the basis 
for my doing something like that she said 
prairie gourmet ships fresh and smoked pheasant wild rice 
smoked sausage and lutefisk and lefsa as well as other foods 
including desserts all of the foods are produced in minnesota 
for example she buys her wild rice from the leech lake band of 
chippewa most of the pheasants are supplied by the pomme de terre 
game farm in morris and area families sell shaw the duck wild 
turkeys and mallards 
shaw employs two local residents parttime during the summer and 
about eight during the holiday season to help with packing and 
shipping 
she called the business so far extremely successful and said 
she had sales of 10000 her first season 
for the fact that i just got the business going last year i 
was just thrilled said shaw who got started with a 5000 loan 
for computer equipment from the big stone county revolving loan 
fund 
its important for lenders to support rural residents trying to 
start new companies shaw said 
i want other counties to understand that they have to take 
risks sometimes especially with women who are just trying to get 
things going she said were desperate in many situations but 
with a little help and a little confidence shown in us were able 
to get some things off the ground 
shaw said shes now working on setting up a cooperative cannery 
where rural residents can sell jams and jellies 
in their own gardens they can raise a lot of these products 
id like ownership to be spread to different men and women within 
the community and for them to be responsible for it said shaw 
being a single woman was not a disadvantage in starting prairie 
gourmet she said 
the only problems ive run into have been because of the lack 
of my own experience she said 
shaw said she plans to meet informally with women this fall to 
talk to them about starting their own companies 
they just need to hear from another woman and talk to someone 
else to say yes you can do it i know youre scared i know you 
dont see how in the world youre going to pull this together 
its amazing how much confidence you can give someone else she 
said

watch your economic assumptions 
this warning could be offered at any time of the year and at any 
point in the economic cycle but it is especially relevant now the 
reason if your assumptions are wrong your conclusions could be 
terribly wrong 
an example of the problem is now circulating in the popular 
media to wit that rising interest rates make it almost inevitable 
that a consumersector recession will develop 
the assumption is that rising rates on variable home mortgage 
loans and other variablerate instruments will cost the consumer 
so much that little will be left for the purchase of goods and 
services 
true rising rates could force many consumers into awkward and 
even destructive financial situations but many others might 
benefit in fact it is likely that more money not less might 
be put into the hands of consumers 
the conclusion that higher rates could ruin the consumer economy 
is based largely on the assumption that there are more debts than 
assets 
not so says e eric heinemann chief economist of the 
investment firm ladenburg thalmann amp co 
he observes that the reverse is true explaining data 
compiled by the federal reserve and the commerce department show 
plainly that during periods of rising rates consumer interest 
income goes up more than consumer interest payments 
the reason for this is simple overall american consumers are 
enormous net creditors their financial assets exceed their debts 
by at least 4 trillion a margin of more than 2 to 1 
another error of assumption might entrap those who argue that 
the economy faces a downturn for the simple reason that the 
economic expansion now in its 69th month is due for a fall it is 
too old they say 
maybe so maybe not 
some economists arent convinced that the economy has been on a 
steady roll for nearly seven years they concede that the official 
figures indicate an uninterrupted expansion but they wonder if the 
figures are correct 
some of the questioning arises from data supplied by sindlinger 
amp co a wallingford pa research firm that obtains its 
information from intensive telephone interviews with a 
crosssection of households 
the key to the consumer economy says albert sindlinger is what 
he calls household liquidity or a continuing measurement of 
the financial ability of households that he says is the engine 
of the economy 
by our calculations based on household liquidity the current 
economic recovery is about 20 months old says sindlinger 
household liquidity he says bottomed out in november 1986 at the 
time he listed 31 states in recession 
he contends this was a genuine recession a bona fide 
interruption of the economic expansion but that it was obscured 
from national figures by unusually strong economic activity on the 
east and west coasts 
sindlinger measures only a few states remaining in recession 
now but asserts that if that wasnt a recession we went through 
two years ago then an unidentified monster was plodding through the 
economic woods 
another incorrect assumption trapped some of the haughtiest 
economic minds last october when so many of them stated flatly 
that a securities market collapse of such great magnitude would 
lead inevitably to recession 
some will continue to argue that in spite of a strong economy 
the verdict isnt in yet that a recession still lies ahead but 
they arent likely to get much of a hearing 
a recession could be in the offing since recessions are always 
in the offing some economists would have nothing to say if that 
threat wasnt there to talk about 
but linking the next recession to the securities market collapse 
is getting more difficult by the day the collapse might indeed by 
a contributant to that recession but it will be difficult to cite 
it as the trigger or chief factor

the international monetary fund announced 
friday it will lend debtor governments more money if they are hit 
unexpectedly by higher interest on their old debts 
the world bank the funds sister organization estimates third 
world debt will reach more than 12 trillion at the end of this 
year much of that was lent at interest rates that vary every day 
so when rates go up the outflow of money from the borrower country 
grows heavier 
for example if a country has borrowed 50 billion at a variable 
rate it has to pay out an extra 500 million a year whenever the 
annual rate goes up by one percentage point 
the fund calls its new system the compensatory and contingency 
financing facility if the borrowing country accepts the funds 
conditions it will be able to borrow up to 35 percent of its 
contribution to the fund called its quota 
argentina the country now in the most acute financial trouble 
would qualify to borrow another 504 million if it could make an 
agreement with the fund argentina has not been able to borrow from 
the fund recently because it has failed to get its government 
deficit down to the promised level 
the fund and the world bank are owned by 151 governments with 
the united states holding the largest block of votes 
for a purchase loan to take to take place the members 
economic performance under the associated arrangement loan 
agreement from the fund must be satisfactory and the member must 
be prepared to adapt its policies if necessary the imf 
announcement said 
the fund typically makes its loans by installment when a 
borrower is found not to be performing satisfactorily the next 
installment is not disbursed often commercial banks also stop 
disbursements when the fund does this has occurred with argentina

americans personal incomes bolstered by the 
biggest increase in wages in seven months rose 06 percent in july 
while consumer spending slowed because of a drop in auto sales the 
government reported friday 
the 06 percent increase in incomes was identical to the june 
advance and would have been an even stronger 08 percent if it had 
not been for a big drop in farm subsidy payments 
spending on personal consumption which includes virtually 
everything except interest payments on debt rose a 05 percent in 
july while this was less than half the 11 percent june advance 
economists said it showed that overall demand remained strong 
despite a decline in car purchases 
as with other recent statistics economists found signs of 
growing inflationary pressures in the report primarily in a 1 
percent gain in wages and salaries the biggest rise in this key 
income component since last december 
while rising incomes are normally viewed as healthy economists 
have begun worrying that demand pressures are outstripping the 
economys ability to produce goods thus creating a classic recipe 
for rising inflation 
those fears were heightened thursday when the government 
reported that the overall economy as measured by the gross 
national product was growing at a 33 percent annual rate from 
april through june faster than previously believed while a gnp 
price index shot up at the fastest rate in six years 
we have a lot of economic activity out there and it is 
generating a lot of jobs and spending power for american 
consumers said sandra shaber an economist with the futures 
group a washington consulting firm 
she said that for the first time since the late 1970s consumers 
appeared to be basing purchases on a belief that they needed to act 
before prices went higher 
up until recently we have had enormous resistance to price 
increases but i think we are beginning to see a buildup of 
inflationary expectations she said 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
governemnt securities dealer said the personal income report 
showed that economic growth was showing no signs of slowing down in 
the julyseptember quarter despite efforts by the federal reserve 
to dampen demand by pushing interest rates higher he predicted 
further credit tightening in the months ahead 
this is too much of a good thing for the fed he said we 
are seeing the strength in consumer spending coming on top of an 
already strong trade sector and steppedup spending by businesses 
for plant and equipment it raises the threat of accelerating 
inflation 
however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in los angeles 
with president reagan called the report good news 
the figures in the report are favorable with steady income 
growth good growth in consumer spending and an in the personal 
saving rate fitzwater said 
the 06 percent rise in incomes in both june and july was the 
best showing since a 1 percent increase last march 
wages and salaries rose 245 billion in july compared to an 
increase of 189 billion in june with increases in manufacturing 
contributing 38 billion of the increase 
the overall increase was offset by a 9 billion drop in farm 
subsidy payments which are extremely volatile from month to month 
americans disposable or aftertax incomes rose 06 percent in 
july down only slightly from a 07 percent june increase 
with incomes rising slightly faster than spending the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of disposable incomes edged 
up to 43 percent in july compared to 42 percent in june 
the 05 percent increase in spending followed a 11 percent june 
advance which had been the largest gain in 10 months 
total spending rose 157 billion compared to a huge 361 
billion june advance the july performance represented slower 
growth in spending for nondurable goods and services and no change 
at all in the durable sector because of a drop in auto sales 
but analysts noted that car sales have rebounded in august and 
they predicted further spending gains because of this 
the changes left incomes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
407 trillion while personal consumption spending rose to an 
annual rate of 324 trillion

the chairman the new york mercantile exchange 
has resigned following an unusual criticism of him in an 
investigation by the federal agency that supervises 
commoditiesfutures trading 
william m bradt an independent energyfutures trader on the 
exchange quit after the commodities futures trading commission 
said in a 98page report that he had conducted himself 
inappropriately in some exchange matters 
the report on a previously disclosed inquiry concerning bradt 
said that he had improperly engaged in discussions on a new 
business venture with kevin p conway the exchanges former 
compliance director 
the report also criticized bradt for accepting fees from a 
chicago member firm of the exchange evidently for his work in 
helping create an oiloptions contract traded there 
bradt announced his resignation thursday after the commission 
issued the critical report considered highly unusual for a 
government agency that historically has played a minimal 
supervisory role in the markets 
the report stopped short of asserting bradt had broken any 
rules but recomended changes to strengthen the exchanges 
standards of conduct that would avoid giving the appearance of 
conflicts of interest 
in a statement about bradts resignation the exchange made no 
mention of the criticism contained in the report saying only that 
it had cleared him of allegations of wrongdoing the exchange said 
vice chairman zoltan guttman replaced bradt 
i am pleased with the findings contained in the cftc report 
and that at no time were any exchange or cftc rules or regulations 
violated the statement quoted bradt as saying however i 
believe it is in the best interest of my business my family and 
the exchange now that ive been vindicated to step down as 
chairman 
the rapidly growing exchange is the worlds major crudeoil 
futures market it also is an important center for contracts in 
heating oil gasoline propane platinum and palladium

as many as 265000 travelers who bought discount 
fares on the former western airlines are eligible to receive credit 
for up to 7000 frequentflier miles under a settlement approved in 
a chicago court 
judge albert green of cook county circuit court on thursday 
approved the settlement of a classaction lawsuit filed three years 
ago against western which has since been acquired by atlantabased 
delta air lines inc 
the lawsuit alleged that western overcharged customers when it 
levied cancellation or alteration fees ranging from 25 percent to 
50 percent of the ticket price 
lawyers alvin w block and russell c green representing the 
plaintiffs said western added transportation taxes onto the basic 
fare price before computing the penalties instead of levying the 
penalties only against the fare price 
eligible fliers are those who changed or canceled the discount 
tickets on western flights between jan 1 1985 and april 1 1987 
under the settlement which carries a maximum cost to delta of 
100000 the airline did not admit any wrongdoing but agreed to 
give affected travelers their choice of a 480 refund 3000 more 
miles on a delta frequentflier account at any time or 7000 
additional miles if the traveler uses them by dec 31 
green said the deadline for rebates some of which could have 
been higher with documentation from customers was aug 2 and 
notices were sent before that to 265000 people and published in 
more than 60 newspapers 
claim forms are available from delta many travel agents and 
airports as well as from the lawyers representing the plaintiffs 
western operated mostly in the west but also served other 
cities including chicago new york and washington

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in 
light trading friday on the chicago board of trade in the absence 
of any news to influence the market analysts said 
it was a dull session with further erosion of values said 
ben george a merrill lynch futures inc grain trading specialist 
on the exchange floor 
george said talk circulated that the soviet union was in the 
market for us corn but he added the item was becoming almost a 
daily rumor and had little market impact 
analysts said the corn and soybean markets were gradually 
shifting their focus from the dry growing season to the harvest 
when prices typically move lower 
were starting to see some corn harvest activity in the south 
and two weeks from now well probably see it moving into the corn 
belt said walter spilka a grain analyst with smith barney 
harris amp co in new york its pretty difficult to buy the market 
when the harvest is just around the corner 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 390 a bushel corn was 3 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 277 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 254 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 5 cents higher with

manville corp announced friday that a group of 
asbestos claimants had not met a deadline for petitioning the us 
supreme court to review the companys chapter 11 reorganization 
plan 
that means just one appeal must be reviewed by the court before 
manville can implement the plan 
obviously were pleased because it means that were just one 
step closer to emerging from chapter 11 and being able to operate 
as a normal company again said manville spokesman david samson 
it also means were just one step closer to the point where 
the personal injury settlement trust can be activated and 
asbestos health claimants can begin to be compensated he said 
manville filed for bankruptcy protection six years ago on aug 
26 1982 when more than 400 asbestosrelated lawsuits were being 
filed against the company each month 
a proposed reorganization plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy 
court for the southern district of new york in december 1986 but 
it cannot be consummated until all appeals are exhausted 
the plan created the personal injury trust as well as a property 
damage trust to settle asbestosrelated claims it also devised a 
schedule for paying secured and unsecured creditors 
a group of about 700 asbestos health claimants had challenged 
parts of the plan that prevent payment of punitive damages to 
asbestos claimants and that require lawsuits for asbestos injuries 
to be filed against the manville personal injury settlement trust 
rather than manville corp the company said 
the appeal was turned down by the new york bankruptcy court 
us district court and the us court of appeals manville 
officials said the group failed to petition the supreme court for a 
review of the plan by the deadline at midnight thursday 
earlier this summer macarthur co and western macarthur co a 
minneapolisbased building materials distributor petitioned the 
supreme court for a review of the bankruptcy courts approval of 
more than 700 million in settlements negotiated between manville 
and 29 insurance carriers 
the supreme court has not acted yet on macarthurs petition

stock prices posted a small gain today in one of 
the slowest sessions of the year taking some inspiration from a 
small decline in interest rates 
worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would 
prompt the federal reserve to push interest rates higher have 
weighed on the market 
on thursday the government revised upward its earlier estimates 
of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter 
but today the government reported personal income rose by 06 
percent in july a bit below expectations while personal spending 
rose 05 percent 
analysts said todays report calmed worries that inflationary 
pressures were continuing to build 
stocks were supported by a mild rally in the bond market 
yields on the closelywatched 30year treasury bond for 
instance fell to 942 percent from 945 percent late thursday

has agreed to pay 430000 to settle claims that the company 
overbilled the defense department the justice department said 
friday

baltimore md improperly charged costs directly related to its 
unsuccessful effort to win a major defense department contract for 
the light assault vehicle the costs were charged to an indirect 
account that was partially reimbursed by the government 
the government also claimed that in 1983 the company changed the 
account numbers from certain independent research and development 
efforts to an account that was partially reimbursed by the 
government 
a company spokesman who asked not to be named confirmed the 
430000 settlement but added that the corporation believes it 
did nothing wrong and specifically disputes the validity of the

one day after the anniversary of the stock 
markets highest point in history trading slowed to a trickle 
friday with business on the new york stock exchange falling to its 
lowest level in nine months 
i looked at my calendar and thought it was a holiday said 
lawrence r helfand manager of retail sales at the chicagobased 
investment firm rodman amp renshaw inc 
i just think a lot of people are finding an excuse to take 
vacations or an early labor day he said theres no question 
that people are just sitting on the sidelines 
nyse volume totaled 8924 million shares that is the first time 
volume has fallen below 100 million shares this year and is the 
lowest since an 8636 million share day last nov 27 the day after 
thanksgiving 
other measurements of the markets performance were considered 
equally uninspiring traders said the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 658 to 201743 for the week it rose 143 
points 
by contrast on aug 25 1987 the dow average hit a record high 
level of 272242 and nyse volume totaled 21348 million shares it 
was from that point on that the market began a nervous decline that 
led to the historic oct 19 crash when the dow average lost 508 
points 
traders generally have blamed the stock markets performance of 
late on an underlying postcrash investor apathy and concern about 
rising interest rates

the central banks appear to have won the latest 
round in their bout to subdue the dollar which finished lower 
friday against several key foreign currencies 
but just how long the victory will last remains in question as 
bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar still lingers 
traders spent the day assessing a round of interest rate hikes 
that began thursday in west germany and were mimicked by a number 
of european countries 
the west german mark continued to draw broad strength from the 
rate hike as well as from a statement by bundesbank president karl 
otto poehl who said the central bank would do everything to 
prevent the mark from weakening 
although the dollar moved lower against the mark and several 
other major currencies analysts said there is an underlying 
favorable sentiment toward the dollar that simply wont go away 
people have been buying dollars recently on the basis of 
interest rate increases to come said stephen leach a currency 
analyst at chemical new york capital markets group 
they have been somewhat restrained in selling dollars because 
of the view that the dollar will be going up later he said 
higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of 
dollardenominated securities 
while many analysts say us interest rates are taking a 
breather now they are looking for further upward moves after 
novembers presidential election that will stop the dollar from 
falling said david wyss chief financial economist at data 
resources a lexington massbased consulting firm 
the federal reserve which surprised the financial markets 
earlier this month by hiking its key lending rate is more 
concerned about keeping the economy from overheating than 
manipulating the level of the dollar he noted 
still keeping the dollar in a reasonable range partly so that 
the us trade deficit continues to decline requires some skilled 
juggling 
a dollar that is too high makes foreign goods cheaper whetting 
american consumers appetite for imports and you cannot solve 
that by raising interest rates overseas because that slows down 
other economies and theyre going to import fewer us goods 
said frank watson a vice president at swiss bank corp 
despite the muchtouted rise in the dollar analysts agree that 
its climb has been pretty much confined to the european currencies 
with the exception of the british pound 
based on thursdays closing rates the dollar was up 27 percent 
against the mark from yearago levels data resources said but it 
was off 61 percent against the japanese yen and 42 percent 
against the british pound 
the huge japanese segment of the market is quiet and that 
suggests weve come off in part because people recognize there 
isnt enough momentum at this stage leach said the central 
banks have won this round but it may not last very long 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar fell to a closing 13350 yen from thursdays 
13376 later in london it was quoted at a higher rate of 13365 
yen and in new york the dollar closed at 13378 yen up from 
13344 yen on thursday 
thursdays report that britains trade deficit swelled to 215 
billion pounds in july from 1 billion pounds in the previous month 
continued to pummel the pound in london it cost 16910 to buy one 
pound cheaper than 16995 late thursday in new york it cost

resorts international adjourned a 
special stockholders meeting on friday because not enough votes 
were cast to approve entertainer merv griffins offer to acquire 
the gaming and real estate company 
griffin also ran into a stumbling block at a meeting of the 
state casino control commission which postponed a vote on a 
proposed trust agreement griffin must have approved to take over 
resorts from developer donald trump 
griffin plans to purchase trumps controlling class b stock for 
135 a share and has made a tender offer for all of the companys 
class a stock at 36 a share 
he wants to acquire the class a and class b stock of resorts for 
about 300 million and will pay trump 60 million to terminate his 
lucrative management contract with resorts after that trump will 
pay griffin 255 million to purchase the 1250room taj mahal 
casino complex which is under construction next door to resorts 
the entire deal is contingent on state approval of the trust 
agreement and interim authorization for griffin to operate the 
casino 
fridays procedural snags left some people unhappy namely 
stockholders who had traveled a distance to attend the meeting at 
resorts in atlantic city the meeting was rescheduled for 3 pm 
tuesday 
in explaining why the stockholders meeting would have to be 
adjourned resorts president ig jack davis jr said the 
american stock exchange erroneously reported the meeting would be 
held sept 13 so an insufficient number of votes were cast 
when davis adjourned the meeting immediately after opening it 
several people among the 100 or so stockholders present protested 
loudly and demanded at least an update 
davis however calmly stated ive been advised by our legal 
counsel that it is inappropriate and perhaps even counter to 
regulations that i discuss anything relating to the merger 
he added that he would answer questions privately after the 
meeting adjourned 
once he left the podium he was immediately surrounded by 
stockholders and offered his apologies 
we have about 2 million proxies and we need about 28 
million he said merv griffin isnt going to buy the stock 
until the shareholders have voted on the merger 
meanwhile the casino control commission delayed a vote on 
griffins proposed trust agreement because commissioners could not 
agree whether a simple majority vote of 32 or a more rigorous 41 
vote was required the panel is scheduled to vote tuesday 
under the proposed trust agreement the griffin co solely 
owned by the former talk show host would take control of the 
resorts stock the company in turn would be placed under a trust 
headed by al luciani a former atlantic city casino executive now 
working at the golden nugget casino in las vegas 
the state attorney generals office has opposed that 
arrangement deputy attorney general mary jo flaherty told the 
commissioners thursday the stock should be placed directly under 
control of the trust rather than griffins company 
unable to agree on what form of majority was necessary to 
approve the trust agreement the casino commission asked lawyers 
for both sides to submit briefs 
at tuesdays meeting they will vote first on the majority 
question and then on the trust proposal itself said commission 
spokeswoman carol kokotajlo

an 800 million contract to put new wings on the 
navys aging a6e attack jets has fallen nine months behind 
schedule boeing military airplanes has confirmed 
the new wings made of graphite and other advanced composite 
materials are to extend the life of the airplanes which went into 
production in the late 1950s approximately half the navy and 
marine corps 340 a6es have been grounded or restricted because of 
metal fatigue 
an article in this weeks aviation week amp space technology an 
aerospace industry publication said the wichita kanbased boeing 
subsidiary had fallen 41 wings behind schedule so far only three 
wings have been delivered 
the magazine reported the navy has decided to buy more of the 
original metal wings from grumman corp as replacements and will 
restructure the rewinging program 
no contract has been signed with grumman to make the additional 
metal wings capt michael kearney naval air systems command a6e 
program manager told aviation week it will take grumman 18 months

cocoa futures prices plunged to their lowest level in 12 years 
friday on reports the international cocoa organization was 
considering drastic changes in the funding of its pricesupport 
operations 
cocoa for september delivery on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange fell 37 to settle at 1266 per metric ton the lowest 
price since late 1976 
on other markets cattle futures advanced while pork futures 
were mixed grains and soybeans were mostly lower precious metals 
declined energy futures rose and stockindex futures were 
unchanged 
the cocoa market already weakened by large surpluses was 
shaken by reports the secretary of the international cocoa 
organization had circulated a memo suggesting producer nations stop 
paying a levy to the icco on oct 1 the beginning of the 198889 
marketing year 
the current icco agreement requires producers to pay the 
organization a 30 levy for each metric ton of cocoa they sell the 
organization of the worlds largest cocoa producer and consumer 
nations uses the money to control world prices by buying and 
maintaining a buffer stock of surplus cocoa 
producers have fallen 68 million behind in their levy payments 
with the largest producers the ivory coast and brazil owing 48 
million and 9 million respectively according to sandra kaul 
cocoa market analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the icco secretarys memo to the organizations members 
suggested the organization should abandon any hopes of collecting 
the levy payments and devise another way to finance its operations 
ms kaul said 
this proposal is a drastic measure that people had not been 
expecting she said in effect this would be the end of the 
icco pact 
the secretary suggested as a financing alternative that the 
icco sell a total of 25000 metric tons of buffer stock cocoa over 
the next two marketing years

face amount and its yield softened to 943 percent from 945 
percent late thursday earlier in the trading session the 30year 
bond was up about 5 
bond brokers said the market initially strengthened after the 
commerce department reported americans personal income rose by 06 
percent in july and personal consumption spending rose 05 percent 
department figures showed that two components of inflation 
rising wages and surging demand for goods were not as excessive as 
many bond investors had anticipated the bond market is sensitive 
to inflation because it erodes the value of fixedincome 
investments 
the commerce department report caused shortcovering which 
means professional traders who had sold borrowed bonds on the 
assumption that the market would drop because of the new rushed to 
buy them back the effect was to raise prices 
nevertheless bonds eased as the day drew to a close partly 
because market professionals were reluctant to go into a weekend 
with risky positions and decided to take some profits on whatever 
gains they had made for the week 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose about 132 point intermediates rose about point 
and longterm maturities rose about 332 point the financial 
reporting service telerate inc said 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value

price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 046 to 112353

the stock market posted a slim gain friday as 
trading volume withered to its lowest level of the year 
analysts said stocks took some support from a mild runup in bond 
prices which sent yields on some fixedincome issues a bit lower 
but they said the sluggish trading totals indicated investors 
continue to play it safe while awaiting a clearer signal on the 
direction of the economy inflation and interest rates 
there have been some very selective areas that have been 
trying to pull ahead but there is no conviction the market has 
been in this holding pattern for most of this week said charles 
jensen technical analyst for mki securities corp 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 1582 on 
thursday rose 658 to 201743 that left the markets bestknown 
index with a gain of 143 points for the week 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7to6 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
725 issues up 605 down and 601 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 8924 million shares 
down from 12764 million in the previous session the nyse index 
rose 030 to 14724 
that was the slowest trading level of 1988 and the lowest since 
8636 million shares were traded on nov 27 1987 the day after 
thanksgiving 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trading at regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market 
totaled 10696 million shares 
worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would 
prompt the federal reserve to push interest rates higher have 
weighed on the market 
but the government reported friday that personal income rose by 
06 percent in july a bit below expectations while personal 
spending rose 05 percent 
analysts said the report calmed worries that inflationary 
pressures were continuing to build 
the report sent bond prices mildly higher reducing their yields 
slightly 
nonetheless jensen said relatively high rates on fixedincome 
securities such as treasury issues are giving investors appealing 
alternatives to stocks 
no one wants to get out there and be aggressive they can stay 
on the sidelines and generate some pretty nice yields without much 
risk he said 
gene jay seagle director of technical research at the brokerage 
gruntal financial inc said he thinks the slow trading indicates 
a market that seems to feel the worst that can hit us has 
happened 
this is a very sold out market he said there is so much 
pessimism and so much cash that the chance is for a breakout on 
the upside 
northeast utilties was the most active issue on the nyse rising 
to 18 friday was the deadline for shareholders to qualify for a 
quarterly dividend

a threeyear battle over the seattletokyo air 
route took another twist friday as a federal appeals court ordered 
the department of transportation to award the route now held by 
united airlines to rival continental airlines 
the decision by the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia left continental joyful united silent and a 
third contender for the route american airlines puzzled 
a transportation department spokesman said the agency would have 
no immediate comment 
the lawyers are studying it and a response will be 
forthcoming the spokesman bill mosley said 
united spokesman joe hopkins in chicago responded we will 
have no comment until we have time to review it 
continental president martin r shugrue said his airline was 
extremely gratified with the decision 
the law was on our side as we maintained all along 
were clearly disappointed said american spokesman jim 
brown in fort worth texas however at this point since we were 
not involved in that particular litigation theres not a great 
deal of action we can take that we are aware of we will look more 
closely at the decision by the appeals court to see if in fact 
american airlines has any options at this point 
its difficult for us to see how continental airlines would be 
a carrier that would help strengthen national interests as it 
regards service to tokyo and transpacific service in general 
continental american and united have been vying for the 
seattletokyo run and at various times each has been recommended by 
administrative law judges or senior dot officials to fly the route 
this summer alone an administrative law judge recommended that 
united be awarded the route a top dot official subsequently 
recommended it go to american and a dot assistant secretary then 
said further study was needed 
the appeals court in a highly technical order ruled dot 
violated administrative procedures when in june 1987 it decided to 
begin again the process of selecting an airline rather than making 
a final decision 
at that time an administrative law judge recommended 
continental be awarded the route but a senior dot official 
disagreed recommending united retain it 
in fridays ruling the appellate court said continental and 
american had a statutory right to a prompt decision on the merits 
of their applications for the route and the department cannot 
escape this obligation 
the court said the dot had had 90 days to either accept the 
administrative law judges recommendation or come up with its own 
decision on who should fly the route starting the proceedings over 
was not acceptable the court said 
the court ordered that dot recommend to president reagan that 
continental receive the route 
mosley said the white house would review the recommendation for 
foreign policy or national defense implications but approval 
was usually proforma 
all three airlines had engaged in a heated competition for the 
route 
united president stephen wolf said at a hearing it would be 
unfair for the department to strip his airline of the route after 
it had spent years trying to acquire it and had sunk millions of 
dollars into developing it at a time when it was just becoming 
profitable 
united had previously warned it would have to cancel its 
seattlehong kong run if it lost the route and transfer many of its 
2500 employees workers based at seattletacoma international 
airport 
american president robert crandall testified that united which 
already flies between los angeles and tokyo and san francisco and 
tokyo wanted to retain the seattle route to block other airlines 
from gaining a foothold in far east markets 
continental chairman frank lorenzo said his airline was prepared 
to slash fares to the far east if it received the route including 
oneway seattletokyo fares as low as 299
