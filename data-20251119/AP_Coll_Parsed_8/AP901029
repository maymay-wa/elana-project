a national survey has found that up to 
50 percent of vietnams children are malnourished according to the 
official vietnam news agency reports 
fifteen percent of the malnutrition cases are serious or very 
serious says the recent government survey of nearly 13000 
households in 20 provinces and cities the agency reported monday 
it said the survey found that 62 percent of men and 38 percent 
of women were underweight 
the study said the average vietnamese had the worlds highest 
rate of rice consumption but the diet lacked sufficient protein 
fat vitamins and minerals 
vietnams economy is one of the worlds poorest and the 
majority of its 65 million people work the land the economy was 
hurt by rigid communism until recent reforms and by a western aid 
embargo after vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 
there are clear signs the reforms have produced good results 
vietnam has harvested its second good rice crop in a row and 
its target of producing some 22 million tons of food this year is 
attainable the vietnam news agency said it said farmers reaped 
nearly 12 million tons of rice in the summer and autumn harvests 
up by 400000 tons from last year 
the report also said inflation remains under control 
although it continued at 33 percent per month during this years 
first three quarters

along with the bullets guns and 
food the military needs to wage war theres a precious commodity 
that links the troops in saudi arabia to home the mail 70 tons a 
day of it 
but the systems becoming clogged with boxes of cookies books 
newspapers and letters to any soldier from stateside 
wellwishers courtesy of dear abby campaigns and drives by 
churches and schools 
with christmas around the corner its going to get wrse 
i think were getting so much of it that it bogs down the mail 
from loved ones said sgt jw allen postmaster for the 1st 
tactical fighter wing 
were getting to the point of maximum utilization were 
constantly filling up said air force capt philip jewitt at the 
militarys main sorting center to be honest i dont know 
anybody whod rather get a newspaper in exchange for a loved ones 
letter 
but with christmas in mind reinforcements are on the way 
maj gen william pagonis who heads the army support command 
for operation desert shield said he plans to activate two more 
reserve postal units to help the four units not counting 
volunteers now carrying the mail that will boost the total of 
people working in the mail system to 450 
were handling 70 tons a day thats killing us the united 
states is going superpatriotic said pagonis 
it wouldnt be fair to say the system doesnt have some 
problems were improving conditions every day he said when 
was the us army ever set up across miles of desert 
pagonis is aiming for a delivery time of less than 10 days for 
letters or packages for troops in the desert 
soldiers are sending four tons of mail back home every day 
officers said 
some troops are getting so many old newspapers books and 
cookies from wellmeaning strangers that they send them back from 
the desert to the mail room said staff sgt russ lewis of newark 
calif 
well try to throw them on the trucks but a lot of people 
dont want them he said 
however taxed the system is pagonis says the letterwriting 
campaigns are not interfering with keeping the fighting men 
supplied with essential needs 
i never allow mail to interupt supply im not going to let 
that happen supplies get priority he said 
i know the mails just as important to the troops when i 
see the mail interrupting something i put more guys on supply 
and the generals not about to ask for a slowdown in the dear 
abby and other volunteer operations 
for the one soldier who gets that letter its going to be 
worth it pagonis said 
one marine was tickled to get 300 birthday cards from the 
students at rw kershaw school in mount ephraim nj 
at least we know somebodys thinking about us said cpl 
dominic guinto of the 1st battalion 3rd marine regiment 1st 
marine expeditionary force hell celebrate his 21st birthday on 
nov 1 in the desert 
meanwhile supply lines that stretch 12000 miles back to the 
united states are working at full throttle 
the total tonnage is unavailabe but the system has unloaded 
42000 pieces of equipment ammunition pallets and food crates from 
101 ships and 677 air force transports in 80 days 
thats probably unheard of in history said pagonis who has 
6000 soldiers under his command in vietnam it took five or six 
years to have this many troops on the ground weve done it in 80 
days 
until now cargo has been limited to everything that is combat 
essential now supply ships are bringing in spare parts 
stockpiles of ammunition recreation gear things that make living 
in the desert a little easier that includes winter gear such as 
sweaters and space heaters because the temperatures are beginning 
to cool 
theres been no chokepoint at this time pagonis said we 
have fresh fruit in every foxhole 
but some in the field worry that the desert grit is taking its 
toll on tanks trucks and helicopters as soldiers train for war 
were going through so many parts right now while theyre 
doing their exercises that my biggest concern if the real thing 
happens is rnning out of parts said sgt charles owen 35 of 
mobile ala who works in the marine combat service support 
detachment 
theres usually equipment going down every day it takes a lot 
to get it going again owen said 
whats important is to stockpile critical parts said col alex 
powell commanding officer of the marines direct support group 
instead of just ordering a part that happens to go bad like a 
starter on a tank well assume that weve got 100 tanks look at 
whats happened so far and say that in 90 days were going to need 
150 of these starters he said 
despite gripes about late mail and lack of parts the troops say 
theyre well supplied 
maybe not everything we want but everything we need said 
maj john bates of the 3rd marine regiment asked what he wanted 
that he didnt have bates said beer and ice water

since the government began tearing down the 
green line that divides beirut into christian and moslem sectors 
hundreds of people have reunited with longlost friends or 
relatives associated press reporter mohammed salam a sunni 
moslem recently tracked down a christian friend nicolas sayegh 
</TEXT>

nicolas and i fell into each others arms 
when we met for the first time in 11 years thank god i survived 
to see you alive he said 
niclas a 52yearold telecommunications employee and i have 
been friends for 22 years we last saw each other in 1979 when he 
was no longer able to cross from christian east beirut to the 
telecommunications authority in moslem west beirut because of 
fighting 
i ventured into east beirut to find my old pal when nicolas 
recognized me he knelt down and kissed the ground in a traditional 
gesture of thanks 
then he hugged me choking back sobs saying i want to be 
sure you are not a dream 
he introduced me to his wife mary their two daughters and 
their son telling them i want you to meet my moslem brother 
we talked for an hour about the old days recalling the 
girlfriends we had before we got married and we talked about the 
future 
when we knew each other it made no difference whether you were 
moslem and i was christian sayegh said do you think these 
barriers that have separated the lebanese for 15 years will ever be 
removed 
our reunion was a scene that has been repeated hundreds of times 
in the two weeks since president elias hrawis government began 
tearing down the green line the fivemile wall of fortifications 
that has divided beirut during 15 years of civil war 
many moslem parents are taking their children on tours of the 
christian hinterland north of the capital a part of lebanon the 
war generation youngsters have never seen 
the green line the most potent symbol of lebanons sectarian 
divisions started coming down after syrian troops backing hrawi 
crushed rebel christian gen michel aoun to end an 11month mutiny 
against the government 
in eight hours of fighting on oct 13 more than 750 people were 
killed it was the fiercest battle since the war began in april 
1975 
hrawi is struggling to implement an arab leaguebrokered peace 
plan he has already secured the agreement of the main christian 
and moslem militias to pull out of beirut and create a 
militaryfree zone 
under the peace plan the maronites the main christian sect 
which has dominated politics since independence from france in 
1943 will surrender many privileges and share power equally with 
the moslem majority 
hrawis next move will be to disband the militias and absorb 
some of their fighters into a reconstituted national army which 
years ago fractured along sectarian lines 
that will be easier said than done sectarian rivalries remain 
deeprooted already druse moslem warlord walid jumblatt is 
trading insults with christian chieftain samir geagea 
jumblatt whose 200000strong community is one of the smallest 
and therefore vulnerable sects is also highly critical of the 
peace plan 
despite hrawis advances and the initial euphoria of seeing the 
green line fall the lebanese have been down this road before they 
have seen peace efforts collapse in bloodletting 
many maronites longtime enemies of syria resent the syrians 
return to east beirut 
we want the lebanese army to extend their authority over the 
whole of lebanon said christian saleswoman nancy khoury we 
dont want the syrians 
aouns loyalists fear reprisals by geageas rapacious 
militiamen who fought the generals forces earlier this year 
whos going to protect us against geagea asked aoun 
supporter raffoul tayan to the syrians we and geageas men are 
enemies they wont mind seeing both of us get slaughtered 
i dont feel safe at all said tayan 25 a mechanic at a 
garage in hazmiyeh east of beirut 
marlene taber a christian housewife compared the situation in 
aouns former enclave to what happened when israel invaded lebanon 
in 1982 
when the israelis came our christia militiamen entered 
moslem areas behind them and behaved like conquerers she said 
the moslems didnt take it for long they fought back and 
peace collapsed mrs taber said now prosyrian militias who 
entered our areas are behaving like conquerers this cant last for 
long someone will fight back 
but many lebanese are daring to hope that this time it will be 
different they believe that with the lebanese army strengthened 
and the syrians apparently determined to enforce peace it could 
just work 
in syrianpoliced moslem west beirut and much of the christian 
enclave life is as normal as it has ever been in the last 15 
years 
the value of the lebanese pound usually a reliable barometer of 
confidence has recovered nearly 50 percent since aouns defeat 
the currency which was at 1200 to the dollar when iraq invaded 
kuwait aug 2 closed at 720 to the dollar on beiruts money market 
late last week 
restaurants casinos night clubs and entertainment centers are 
packed with lebanese who have learned to enjoy themselves while 
they can 
electricity for most of beirut which was cut off for nearly two 
months is back three hours a day and government officials hope to 
soon restore it completely city water supplies are trickling back 
people who once lived near the green line are returning to their 
homes or whats left of them 
my house is in ruins but truly im very happy the war is 
over said auto dealer samir tabish as he cleaned debris from the 
apartment in the moslem ras elnabeh district that he fled 13 years 
ago 
were dying to move back but the repairs will cost 15000 
and we dont have that kind of money he said

made in germany appears on much of 
iraqs mighty arsenal from missiles to poison gas rocket fuel to 
helicopters 
six iraqi poison gas plants were built with german help 
according to an independent report commissioned by german 
authorities 
other companies allegedly delivered technology and knowhow that 
helped iraq upgrade sovietmade missiles obtain parts for a 
supercannon and acquire equipment needed to produce nuclear 
weapons 
reports by german media and foreign groups about the involvement 
of german companies aroused anger in foreign capitals including 
washington and among jewish groups at home and abroad opposition 
politicians in germany demand stronger export controls even a ban 
on arms deliveries outside nato countries 
prosecutors are investigating dozens of companies and some 
arrests have been made two company officials have confessed to 
helping iraq obtain the technology to make chemical weapons 
the government already tainted by the scandal two years ago of 
german involvement in a libyan poison gas factory says it is 
considering steps to curb illegal arms exports 
that will not be easy in a country whose economy is based on 
exports 
there is no doubt that german companies participated in the 
iraqi rocket program said norbert gansel a member of parliament 
from the oppositon social democrats and an expert on arms exports 
i am not saying that the government wanted it to be that 
way he told the associated press 
gansel said the government had taken intelligence reports on 
involvement in illegal weapons sales to iraq all too lightly 
german law forbids arms exports to areas of tension gansel said 
german companies convicted of illegal dealings with iraq should 
have their arms producing licenses revoked 
economics minister helmut haussmann has proposed milder steps 
he wants each company to name a manager of weapons exports who 
could be held responsible if export laws were broken 
other countries also delivered war material to iraq but the 
level of technology provided by german companies allowed saddam to 
pursue poison gas and missile programs according to reports in der 
spiegel a weekly news magazine 
a report commissioned by the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles lists 86 german companies that helped iraq become a 
military power 
raymond seitz assistant us secretary of state told congress 
this month there were german footprints all over equipment 
shipped to iraq in recent years but acknowledged it is not 
exclusively a german problem 
in a fact sheet published six days after iraq seized kuwait on 
aug 2 the stockholm international peace research institute said 
germany was far behind some other nations in providing military 
hardware to iraq in the last decade 
it said the soviet union france and china three permanent 
members of the un security council were the main suppliers in 
that period 
the moral question is especially troubling for germany 
saddam has threatened to attack israel with chemical weapons 
poison gas was developed and used by the germans during world war 
i and was used to kill jews in nazi gas chambers 
spiegel said a german company helped iraq develop a 
highperformance fuel that increased the range of its rockets 
ian anthony a coauthor of the stockholm institutes report 
sad it was hard to stop illegal exports from wetern europe 
there are virtually no border controls in the european 
economic community he said in a telephone interview it is 
very very difficult for governments with rather limited resources 
to enforce the regulations that exist 
a high official of germanys federal customs office said 98 
percent of arms exports are shipped in parts making them difficult 
to track 
many goods also fall in the dualuse category allowing 
companies to claim they did not know their equipment was destined 
for military use the official said on condition of anonymity 
he said iraq often ordered equipment from small firms that had 
financial problems but some of germanys bestknown companies also 
have been implicated 
according to spiegel messerschmittboelkowblohm helped iraq 
obtain the fuel air explosive bomb which sprays fuel into the 
air and ignites the mixture of fuel and air creating a huge 
fireball and a shock wave comparable in strength to a small nuclear 
explosion 
the company a major defense contractor denied the allegations 
it said a study was conducted for the egyptian government but the 
project was discontinued in 1988 spiegel said iraq obtained the 
study through egypt 
much of spiegels reporting has been based on a confidential 
report delivered to parliament in august by haussmann the 
economics minister 
according to the magazine haussmanns report said mediumsized 
german companies were deeply involved in supplying iraq with parts 
and the knowhow to upgrade sovietmade scudb rockets 
another company named by spiegel was water engineering trading 
gmbh of hamburg which it said supplied iraq with chemicals to 
produce nerve gas 
two managers at the company have admitted to prosecutors that 
they helped iraq obtain equipment to make poison gas both also had 
spent several years with german intelligence

federal regulations that bar the staffs of 
governmentsubsidized family planning clinics from discussing 
abortion with their clients are coming under supreme court 
scrutiny 
although fueled by the continuing struggle over abortion the 
legal dispute being argued before the court today more directly 
involves free speech rights rather than womens right to end their 
pregnancies 
at stake is the information available to the 5 million 
lowincome women who depend on family planning clinics and similar 
health care providers 
several antiabortion organizations are urging the justices to 
use the family clinic case to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion 
justice department lawyers defending the regulations at issue 
said the bush administration still favors reversal of the 1973 
decision but they did not say this was the appropriate case for 
such court action 
federal regulations imposed by the reagan administration in 1988 
called for the ban on counseling about abortion but court 
challenges have kept the rules from being enforced virtually 
everywhere 
a federal appeals court upheld the 1988 regulations but other 
federal courts have ruled them an unconstitutional infringement on 
free speech rights 
the justices are expected to resolve the conflicting rulings by 
next july 
last year about 4000 family planning clinics nationwide 
received about 140 million in federal assistance 
the family planning clinic program enacted by congress as title 
x of the public health service act pays for creating and operating 
the clinics for most clinics federal money accounts for only a 
portion perhaps 10 percent of their budgets 
challengers of the regulations say they represent a kind of 
viewpoint discrimination 
women who have come to rely on title x for medically sound 
advice will be misled they told the court in written briefs 
the silence of a trusted doctor on the subject of abortion will 
lead many women to believe that abortion is not an appropriate or 
medically indicated option for them 
but bush administration lawyers argue that the government may 
choose to favor childbirth over abortion when deciding how to spend 
taxpayer money 
the clinics always have been banned from using federal money to 
perform abortions but regulations originally let the clinic staffs 
doctors and counselors tell women about the abortion option and 
make referrals 
after those regulations drew criticism from antiabortion 
groups the reagan administration said the clinics may not 
encourage promote or advocate abortion as a method of family 
planning or distribute written materials about abortion 
under the 1988 regulations a woman who visited a federally 
funded family planning clinic and asked about abortion would have 
to be told that the clinic staff does not consider abortion an 
appropriate method of family planning 
staff members then could offer help in obtaining prenatal care 
the high court has not been the sole battlefield legislation to 
sweep away the counseling ban was introduced in congress last week 
and is expected to be reintroduced when the new congres convenes 
in january 
i dont think this is so much a prochoice or prolife 
question said rep john porter rill a sponsor of the house 
bill to lift the ban its a question of counseling of providing 
full information

a 1200pound polar bear called major 
will lose his home next month so will elderly orangutans stanley 
and betty and a skinny siberian tiger named sasha the 85yearold 
stone zoo is closing because of state budget cuts 
you cant help but develop attachments to the animals 
said mark goldstein the zoos director you think of them as 
individuals 
the zoo in this boston suburb was already running on a 
shoestring when its budget was slashed by 30 percent from last 
year because of the states financial problems zoo officials 
decided to close nov 12 rather than house the animals in shoddy 
conditions 
there are things worse than no zoo like a bad zoo 
goldstein said 
about half the zoos 200 or so residents will find homes at the 
franklin park zoo the larger of the two facilities run by 
metroparks zoos some will be moved to other zoos around the 
country 
but some are just too old or too big to relocate easily 
for some it will take months to find them a good home 
goldstein said but we wont let them end up in private 
collections and we hope none will have to be euthanized 
large meateaters are expensive to feed and maintain said john 
linehan curator of mammals for the metroparks zoos 
that doesnt help major who eats about 14 pounds of meat and 
biscuits a day when hes on a diet 
sasha has an enzyme problem that leaves her a little on the 
skinny side and though lions and tigers are increasingly scarce in 
the wild they are actually fairly abundant in us zoos 
orangutans stanley 31 and betty 30 look like a pair of 
sadeyed rusthaired buddhas sitting quietly in their separate 
glass enclosures 
but they are more mischievous than tranquil 
betty steals tools and you have to trade them back linehan 
said she gets a brush and starts scrubbing the walls like we do 
she wont go through doors she wants you to go through she demands 
a lot of attention 
the two primates have been together 20 years and produced four 
offspring but theyll probably be separated when the zoo closes 
stanley may return to brookfield zoo near chicago his first 
home but bettys future is less clear since she is old fat and 
has an abdominal cyst that has left her unable to reproduce 
but dont think the separation will leave either orang 
heartbroken keepers said 
betty steals stanleys toys linehan said stanley is 
nice except when he wants to have his way with betty they wont 
miss each other 
wherever he ends up stanley will be happy to have females 
around said linehan hes pretty feisty for his age 
goldstein hopes that stone zoo can reopen someday a bill in the 
legislature would take the zoo out of state control and make it a 
public nonprofit corporation similar to a structure used by most 
other successful zoos nationwide 
but for now the outlook isnt bright for the zoos animals or 
its patrons 
thelma dennis 69 has been a volunteer zoo tour guide for 
children for the past 11 years 
of course im awfully sad dennis said this is the real 
thing or next to the real thing kids cant get the same feeling 
for an animal on tv that they can seeing them here 
were trying to get kids off the streets and were taking away 
the zoos the museums said goldstein 
you can be 75 years old and want to take a 3yearold out for 
the day he added i challenge you to find something else youd 
both enjoy

international air traffic is expected to increase 
by about 8 percent this year and more than 6 percent in each of the 
next four years with the far east experiencing the most growth 
the leading industry group says 
guenter eser the german director general of the international 
air transport association iata said sunday that the forecasts 
were set before the effects of the persian gulf crisis on passenger 
traffic became clear 
regardless he said the industrys major problem continues to 
be the lack of airport and airspace capacity and this is likely to 
be the case for a number of years to come 
the problem remains most severe in europe but is rapidly 
increasing in the far east eser said in his report to 
associations annual assembly 
the gulf crisis which has raised fuel and insurance costs 
tightened a profit squeeze on the industry he said 
overall profits by member airlines on international scheduled 
flights dropped sharply last year to 04 percent on revenues of 
1445 billion the lowest margin since 1986 
it is impossible to forecast the outcome for the full year 
1990 but the industry aggregate result is probably not going to 
be very good said eser 
iata member airlines carried nearly 212 million international 
passengers last year a 7 percent rise 
traffic is expected to grow 8 percent this year 69 percent in 
1991 and remain at about 65 percent annually through 1994 latest 
iata figures showed 
the far east is the fastest expanding area with nearly 10 
percent average annual growth forecast for northeastern asia and 
88 percent for the southeastern region 
iata which groups 200 airlines worldwide helps coordinate fare 
levels ticketing and other areas of airline operations

the temperature in the coal mine 3900 
feet down had hit 100 degrees when volodya kyechins vision started 
to blur then the rock floor became rubbery and the dimly lit 
shaft went black 
kyechi awoke hours later on the surface with a case of heat 
stroke over the next nine years the stout ukrainian developed 
high blood pressure lost half his pay and began dreaming of 
leaving the mines for good 
the average life expectancy of a soviet coal miner is 48 years 
they can retire at 55 but only 5 percent reach that age 
the work conditions are hard and ive come to the conclusion 
that i should leave the mine said the 40yearold kyechin 
sitting with his wife tanya at a table in his apartment on the 
outskirts of this industrial city 
soviet miners are relatively well paid earning an average of 
375 rubles a month 50 percent more than the national average but 
no matter what the pay kyechin said whats the point to go 
underground where each time nobody knows what will happen 
miners from across the soviet union echoed that sentiment at a 
fiveday congress in donetsk last week accusing the staterun 
union of failing to represent their interests they voted to form 
the countrys first independent nationwide labor union 
among their principal demands are safety improvements and a say 
in the operation of their mines 
kyechin a miner for nearly 20 years said he would wait to see 
what the new union promises before joining i need to know what 
they would do for me he said 
a television flickered in the comfortable twobedroom apartment 
as the couple poured out their lives over a feast that included 
caviar and vodka both difficult to find in stores 
as a department store manager tanya is plugged into a network 
of contacts who help each other obtain the latest goods whenever 
and wherever they show up 
if we come across a can of fish we buy not one but 10 and 
distribute them among friends she said 
the walls and floors of most rooms were covered with valuable 
bukharan rugs its better to put your money into such things 
kyechin said and a china cabinet stretched across the living room 
wall jammed with a halfdozen sets of fine hardtofind dishes 
the kyechins and their two daughters ages 14 and 6 live in a 
block of prefabricated apartment buildings on the outskirts of 
donetsk a sprawling city of 12 million there are some 40 mines 
within the city limits and about 80 others scattered across the 
hilly coal basin 
with lax enforcement of safety rules and unreliable medical 
care mining is one of the countrys most hazardous jobs an 
average of 800 soviet miners die on the job every year 55 died in 
the united states in 1988 
among other problems the extreme depth of many soviet mines 
makes it difficult to ventilate them and lower the heat generated 
by churning machinery and the earth itself 
most countries prohibit mining when the heat reaches a certain 
level soviet miners say their bosses ignore such rules in a 
heedless drive to win bonuses for fulfilling plans or avoid 
punishment for failing 
the deputy director of the mine told the doctor not to write 
down heat stroke kyechin said bitterly recounting his collapse 
in 1981 he said let it be an ordinary case of accidental 
trauma 
if heat stroke had been reported kyechin explained a committee 
would have questioned the mines supervisers about it and of 
course they would catch hell from their superiors and would make 
less money 
kyechin said he protested at first then capitulated deciding 
his relations with the mine director were too important to be 
risked 
if you are against them you are nothing he said 
after the heat stroke episode kyechin began to suffer high 
blood pressure over the next nine years he was transferred from 
mine to mine around the donetsk basin 
on aug 6 while working in a ventilation shaft he suffered 
heat stroke again kyechin said he was hospitalized for nearly a 
month with high blood pressure then released with an 
occupational disease and given a job as a tunneler which pays 
260 rubles a month about 480 
even with additional compensation for his illness kyechins 
salary is now little more than half the 700 rubles that he once 
earned as a chief engineer and that allowed him to fill his 
apartment with valuables 
because of his long absence from work he also lost a chance to 
buy a car through the official union 
fed up with his treatment by superiors all members of the 
communist party kyechin ended his 20year party membership 
the party does nothing theres nothing in it for our 
future he said 
now kyechin has his eye on a new career an engineer by 
training he has a dream of forming a cooperative to repair and 
remodel apartments i was even thinking of buying a shop he 
said

republican jon grunseth dropped out of the 
minnesota governors race sunday amid allegations that he had an 
affair while he was married to his first and second wives and that 
he tried to get teenage girls to swim nude with him in 1981 
there are three things that are extremely important to me my 
wife my family first and foremost the republican party the 
people of minnesota grunseth said from his home 20 miles east of 
minneapolis 
and the events of the last three weeks have put enormous 
pressure on the family and i think on the political process and on 
the people of minnesota he said i therefore decided to 
withdraw as the republican candidate for governor 
it was not immediately clear whether there would be a 
replacement republican candidate on the ballot in the nov 6 
election 
grunseths campaign was thrown into turmoil oct 15 when it was 
reported that two women said in sworn statements that he tried to 
get them to swim nude with him during a 1981 pool party at his 
home 
the women who were then 13 and 14 said they refused but that 
grunseth his teenage daughter and a 16yearold girl took off 
their bathing suits one of the women also said grunseth tried to 
pull down her bathing suit top and touch her breast grunseth 
denied the allegations 
grunseth nearly withdrew from the race thursday but changed his 
mind several hours later 
on saturday grunseth acknowledged to the star tribune newspaper 
he had a romantic relationship with 32yearold tamara taylor 
of minnetonka but said it ended a long time ago in the early 
80s 
grunseth 44 divorced katharine winston in 1983 and married his 
second wife vicki in 1984 
taylor claimed she had an intermittent sexual relationship with 
grunseth from 1980 to 1989 while he was married to his first and 
second wives 
grunseth said his affair with the woman ended before he 
remarried in 1984 he has denied the nudeswimming allegations 
later sunday grunseth told reporters he had over the last two 
weeks been on the verge of quitting the governors race 
its wear and tear its just simply pure wear and tear 
grunseth said the whole thing becomes sickening its 
exhaustion is what it is mental physical emotional exhaustion 
at a point theres an end you just say man its more than i 
can bear 
his wife said she believes her husbands contention that he 
ended the affair before they married she said she did not try to 
dissuade him from dropping out of the race 
taylor said in a statement sunday she disclosed her affair with 
grunseth to prevent his further deceptionof the voters in 
regard to his past antics his character and what ruthless actions 
he is willing to take in order to be elected governor 
leon oistad grunseths campaign manager had vowed saturday 
that grunseth would remain in the race 
oistad blamed the latest controversy in the republicans bid to 
unseat democratic gov rudy perpich on a witch hunt led by the star 
tribune which published taylors story sunday 
grunseth said his withdrawal from the race will be effective as 
soon as the necessary paperwork was processed 
perpich is seeking a fourth term and state auditor arne carlson 
the runnerup in the sept 11 gop primary reentered the race as a 
writein candidate last week 
the state gop executive committee can name a replacement for 
grunseth on the ballot however party cochairwoman barb sykora 
said it was uncertain whether the committee can be convened in time 
before fridays deadline for candidates to be formally named if 
they are to appear on the ballot 
it looks like we should support arne carlson sykora said 
arnes very well qualified to be governor can the party survive 
we have to survive we have terrific candidates running at all 
levels 
grunseth said republicans should unite behind his successor 
theyve got a superb opportunity to defeat rudy perpich even 
though its a very short period of time he said 
as ive said before the road to the defeat rudy perpich has 
been paved with my reputation and the tears of the grunseth family 
and i think its wide open for the republicans to take grunseth 
said 
carlson said he was surprised that grunseth was pulling out 
im sad for jon and his family one doesnt revel in another 
persons difficulty carlson said 
im going to spend a lot of time now to make sure we heal the 
wounds he said i have to reach to all areas of the republican 
party to bring this together so we can put together a winning 
election

affair with grunseth because she believed she was the one person 
who could prevent grunseths further deception of the voters 
most troubling to me knowing what jon had told me about his 
personal life in the past was the fact that he was willing to go 
to such great lengths to publicly try to exonerate himself in order 
to forge ahead with his campaign with total disregard to the 
knowledge that he was seriously affecting the reputations and 
future of these two women by calling them liars taylor said in a 
statement sunday

the golfcrazy japanese are flocking to 
thailand to enjoy low greens fees friendly caddies and courses 
laid out by some of the worlds top designers 
thailand is in a golf boom mana sookbank honorary secretary of 
the thailand golf association said there are 60 courses in 
operation 40 under construction and many more planned 
for the japanese golfing in thailand costs a fraction of what 
it does at home they are joined by burgeoning ranks of domestic 
players from corporate climbers to prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan who conducts a lot of political business on the links 
players soon will be able to tee off near the river kwai where 
allied prisoners died by the thousands building a railway for the 
japanese in world war ii and in the hills of the infamous golden 
triangle opium region 
a complex of courses hotels and an airstrip billed as asias 
largest golf development will stretch along the gulf of siam 
southwest of bangkok it is to include a meditation center 
thailands boom comes at a fortunate time said desmond 
muirhead a leading golf course designer instead of building 
secondrate courses by themselves like the japanese did after 
world war ii the thais are getting top foreign talent 
muirhead a briton based in the united states said he plans to 
design at least five courses in thailand and has begun work on the 
century country club in the eastern coastal province of rayong 
the 100 million project includes individual homes 
condominiums a hotel and two golf courses one by muirhead and the 
other by topranked professional nick faldo among the other big 
names at work in thailand are jack nicklaus arnold palmer and greg 
norman 
people are going to beat a path from all over to play these 
courses muirhead said in an interview we expect them to be 
more visually pleasing than those in the united states 
while genuine interest in the sport is behind the boom many who 
wouldnt know a birdie from a bogey are getting in on the action 
acquiring golf club memberships for speculation as if they were 
commodities futures has become a lucrative business 
mana of the golf association said a membership at green valley 
golf course had gone up nearly 700 percent in three years to 
800000 baht or 32000 
even so club memberships remain cheaper than in japan taiwan 
singapore and hong kong golfers and investors from those 
countries are lining up for the leading thai clubs some of which 
have had to place quotas on foreigners 
golf was introduced by thai royalty in the 1920s it has 
attracted the elite ever since and spread to other classes because 
of economic prosperity tourism and the sports growing worldwide 
popularity 
the japanese including members of the large expatriate 
community frequently describe playing here as being in golfers 
heaven greens fees at luxurious uncrowded clubs are about 40 
and low labor costs permit levels of course maintenance and service 
that are rare in other countries 
many golfing parties have a trail of caddies often young women 
who carry portable stools umbrellas cold drinks and towels as 
well as clubs 
at home japanese golfers must reserve playing time far in 
advance then battle weekend traffic to reach congested courses at 
clubs in the tokyo area nonmembers pay at least 240 for 18 
holes meals and transportation 
south korea and taiwan closer than thailand still are favored 
foreign destinations for japans 15 million golfers but the thais 
expect their traffic to grow travel agencies in japan offer 
fiveday allinclusive golf tours for about 1600 the cost of 
half a dozen rounds at home 
critics of the golf explosion say valuable farm land is being 
lost and the environment harmed in some areas officials have 
questioned whether investing millions in a sport for the wealthy is 
appropriate for a developing nation 
promoters argue that golf courses provide more higherpayed 
jobs than the same land devoted to agriculture they say courses 
are environmental assets in urban areas serving as the green belts 
that government planning has not provided

the latest wave in the sea of refugees 
created by the persian gulf crisis is cresting here in this small 
nation for some it is a sad and bitter homecoming to a land that 
no longer feels like home 
in the wake of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the yemenis 
were cast out of their promised land saudi arabia where they had 
earned good wages and made new lives for themselves some spent 
decades there 
in the past five weeks up to 750000 yemeni nationals have 
returned to their mountainous homeland at the tip of the arabian 
peninsula where north and south yemen reunited earlier this year 
to form the new nation of yemen 
they bring with them what they can in cars and trucks piled 
high as parade floats but they leave much behind 
saudi officials have said yemenis were stripped of their right 
to stay because of president ali abdullah salehs sympathies for 
saddam hussein and antisaudi demonstrations in sana the yemen 
capital 
yemen denies it sided with saddam although it failed to support 
un resolutions against him soon after the invasion 
the total number of those returning based on saudi and yemeni 
figures could not be determined accurately since many families 
crossed the border here on a single document and individuals were 
not counted 
the numbers dwindled after saudi authorities recently extended 
until late november the deadline for 1 million to 2 million yemenis 
to find a local sponsor or get out but a new wave is expected 
this was not a reasonable decision said jamal mohammed 
saad 35 standing amid his remaining possessions after 16 years in 
saudi arabia people had no time to time to sell their houses or 
property it is impossible 
departing yemenis were allowed to transfer bank deposits and 
take out property but saudi authorities trying to curb smuggling 
have been confiscating some goods 
they have my tires 70 tires wailed mohammed sultan who 
said he abandoned his automotive shop for lack of a buyer and piled 
his stock onto a truck saudi officials said he had no vouchers for 
the tires 
another man jostling for attention among a crowd of people 
waiting at a border post in the baking sun said plaintively 
they took my box of apples 
col ahmed mohammed shamrani head of the saudi border post near 
here said about 350000 yemeni passports had been stamped since 
sept 18 
another 100000 people were cleared without documents and tens 
of thousands returned via other crossings he said since many 
passports listed several family members the overall total was 
believed in the range of 750000 
few returnees reported any serious maltreatment and most seemed 
to take the disruption to their lives with a certain fatalism 
but the distress was plain to see ramshackle settlements of 
burlap and plywood sprouted on the highway housing people who had 
lost touch with families during their time in saudi arabia some 
had been away for as long as 40 years 
in saudi arabia the impact of the yemeni exodus has been severe 
in sectors of retail trade and some services along roads in jiddah 
and riyadh rows of shops are bolted shut 
many companies arranged to sponsor their yemeni employees but a 
number of returnees said that saudis were afraid to back them for 
fear of official reprisals saudi authorities deny this 
at the yemenis old bedouin silver souk in saudi arabia at 
khamis mushet khalid haji was the last to go he sold off 
heirlooms at giveaway prices 
weve made our life here not there and i have nothing to do 
with politics but what choice is there he said 
asked when he came to settle in saudi arabia he smiled ruefully 
and tapped out the digits on his calculator 1957 
in jiddah a luggage merchant who asked to be called only hamid 
was packing up in bags from his own shop 
saudis and yemenis have always been like this he said 
interlocking his fingers why are we suddenly thrown out like 
enemies 
yemeni authorities said the influx would burden yemens fragile 
economy but insisted the longterm effect would be healthy 
however remittances from yemenis living in saudi arabia had 
made up onethird of the gross national product well over 1 
billion counting unofficial transfers already college graduates 
here can wait six months for a job 
at the port city of hodeidah the sagear family stopped to rejig 
the mountains of luggage atop two sedans bedding tires 
tricycles suitcases a television they have been away 20 years 
ali sagear 15 has never seen yemen 
ayshe sagear 23 said saudi arabia is their home but if they 
dont want us well find something here 
yahya ali aljouri sent home from mecca after 35 years was 
bitter he sold his grocery business at a fourth of its value and 
counted himself lucky to get that much now he passes time in the a 
sana tea room in an ancient mud building 
when the saudis need us we are welcome he said when 
they dont we are nothing to them

lance cpl juan baca hunkered 
down in the belly of a us marine assault vehicle lurching across 
the night desert asked about the demonstrations back home against 
operation desert shield 
it ticks me off said baca 20 of lubbock texas this 
isnt vietnam this is a totally different situation 
vietnam was long ago and far away but the conflict is much on 
the minds of young soldiers in saudi arabia 
word of antiwar demonstrations back home has trickled back to 
the troops here who are the tip of the military spear pointed at 
saddam husseins forces 
they are mindful of the hostile reception that greeted vietnam 
veterans a generation ago when they came home from an unpopular 
war 
they fear a loss of public support for the deployment of us 
forces in the persian gulf region could bring similar anger down on 
their heads 
id feel betrayed if people turned against us said cpl 
john vaughn 23 of bravo company of the 3rd marine regiment based 
in hawaii vaughn from detroit is nicknamed lifer the 
military slang for a career military man 
vietnam was americas longest war the only war america lost a 
war marked by campus riots and draft card burnings bitterness and 
shame the scars are still apparent 
i would hope people would put it aside and learn from it but 
not judge every conflict by what happened in vietnam said baca 
wed like it a whole lot better if people were patting us on the 
back 
several soldiers approached reporters to ask about support on 
the home front for the troops in the gulf 
public backing for the deployment was initially high but there 
has been increasing criticism of president bushs actions as the 
high cost of the operation sinks in and people face up to the 
prospect of a shooting war in the region 
some of the soldiers in saudi arabia have firsthand memories of 
vietnam and painful ones 
maj john bates 44 of little rock ark an executive officer 
for a marine battalion was wounded in the conflict he was shot in 
the lung 
from his standpoint the american people misdirected their anger 
at the fighting men in southeast asia instead of targeting the 
politicians who sent them there 
the military doesnt make policy we only enforce it said 
bates in a mess tent set up in the sand people were pointing 
the finger in the wrong direction 
vietnam memories are still strong for 1st sgt chuck woodruff 
38 of oroville calif he was on the secondtolast helicopter 
that left the roof of the us embassy when saigon fell on april 
30 1975 
the question keeps coming up because theres nothing to 
compare this to except vietnam this is the biggest military 
operation since then said woodruff who has the marine corps 
emblem tatooed on his left arm i think it will take generations 
and decades before people forget 
support from home means a lot to troops huffing puffing and 
sweating it out under a relentless saudi sun 7000 miles from the 
east coast 
staff sgt charles woods 31 of north glenn colo said the 
troops could deal with the conditions as long as they know the 
american people are behind them 
woods fresh from a tactical exercise in which marines practiced 
assaulting a fortified bunker was quick to point out how much the 
troops appreciate letters from schoolchildren churches and 
individuals who write encouraging notes addressed just to any 
soldier 
vietnam veterans make their presence felt in other branches of 
the military as well at the us navys fleet hospital no 5 a 
sign on one desk read vietnam veteran and proud of it 
another vietnam veteran is col jim gass 48 of carney okla 
an artillery unit commander in the armys 1st cavalry division 
no soldier wants to go somewhere away from home and have the 
country not support him gass said todays soldiers want to 
know their causes are just

egypts military involvement in the persian 
gulf crisis is proving to be a financial windfall for president 
hosni mubaraks government 
its us and arab allies are moving to write off 14 billion in 
debts almost a third of a 50 billion obligation to foreign 
creditors that for years has crippled the egyptian economy 
aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars also is pouring in 
and prospects are considered bright for agreement with the 
international monetary fund to reschedule the remaining foreign 
debt 
mubarak is reaping political benefits as well egyptian 
commentators are praising his handling of the gulf crisis that 
began aug 2 with iraqs invasion of kuwait 
mahfouz elansary editor of the governments algomhuriya 
newspaper hailed mubaraks determination and skill his 
patience wisdom and hard work 
at the onset of the crisis it hardly looked as if mubarak would 
emerge a winner he was humiliated by the failure of a lastminute 
bid to stave off the iraqi invasion an effort that saddam hussein 
let him believe had succeeded right until the iraqi president sent 
tanks into kuwait 
back then egypt had looked likely to be a big financial loser 
in the conflict it faced losses estimated at 45 billion in the 
form of a ruined tourism industry reduced suez canal revenues and 
dwindling remittances from egyptians working in gulf countries 
what turned the tide was mubaraks strong quick response to the 
iraqi takeover 
he muscled through an arab league summit a resolution condemning 
iraq demanding withdrawal from the emirate and authorizing 
dispatch of troops to the gulf region 
then he sent nearly 16000 egyptian troops to saudi arabia and 
the united arab emirates they were there to help defend those arab 
states but more importantly the arab involvement made the 
presence of the multinational force in saudi arabia far more 
politically palatable the united states has an estimated 220000 
troops in the gulf 
mubarak has made repeated efforts to find a diplomatic solution 
to the crisis but he said sunday he was ready to send more troops 
as well as military planes to saudi arabia if they were requested 
with peace efforts that does not mean we can relax military 
action the egyptian president said at a news conference 
mubarak spent four days in the gulf region last week visiting 
four states allied with him against iraq at the end of the tour 
it was announced that saudi arabia qatar the united arab emirates 
and kuwaits exiled government were writing off more than 7 
billion that egypt owes them 
in the united states forgiveness of a 6 billion egyptian 
debt was part of the foreign aid program that congress approved and 
sent to president bush before adjourning early sunday 
bush in honolulu said sunday he would sign the measure 
prime minister atef sedki said saturday that interest on the 
military debt alone amounts to almost 1 billion annually 
as for other debt relief egypt has been trying to negotiate a 
new package with the international monetary fund since a 1988 
rescheduling agreement expired 
western economists in cairo say egypt and the imf have ironed 
out most of their differences and expect to sign a new pact early 
next year that will pave the way for cairos main creditors the 
paris club to convene and arrange rescheduling 
a wellinformed economist speaking on condition he not be 
further identified said egypt has agreed to reduce subsidies 
further on basic food items a key imf reform demand additionally 
he said cairo will further devalue the egyptian pound and raise 
bank interest rates 
but he said signing will be delayed because some of the 
commitments must be ratified by the peoples assembly egypts 
parliament which is presently dissolved a new parliament will be 
elected in late november and seated in december

the clout of this countrys maronite 
catholics who have dominated its politics for a half century is 
rapidly crumbling amid blood feuds and a new moslem ascendancy 
the end of an era is looming for the only christians in the 
overwhelmingly moslem middle east to have controlled a state since 
the crusaders in the middle ages 
the gemayels chamouns and franjiehs the clans that have ruled 
fractious lebanon since independence from france in 1943 are 
entangled in a new round of vendettas that will probably seal their 
fate 
the oct 21 slaying of maronite political leader dany chamoun 
and most of his family was the latest 
no one listens to the voice of reason papal nuncio pablo 
puente lamented recently christians are destroying christians in 
senseless bloodbaths 
the nearly 1 million maronites the main christian sect in 
lebanon have suffered more from their own feuds than from conflict 
with moslems in the nations 15yearold civil war 
under a proposed arab leaguebrokered peace plan the maronites 
would have to share power with moslems who now comprise a majority 
of the 35 million people in a nation where islamic fundamentalism 
is on the rise 
but many maronites are reluctant to give up their privileges 
im afraid were going to go back to even worse times if the 
maronite establishment fails to respond to the winds of change 
warned elie hobeika a syrianbacked leftist maronite at odds with 
the dominant rightwingers of his sect 
hobeika foresaw the need for the maronites to give ground or 
eventually perish and signed a syrianbrokered peace treaty with 
the main moslem warlords in 1985 when he headed the christians 
main militia the lebanese forces 
but he was ousted by rightwing diehards the next year and fled 
to territory controlled by the syrians who have about 40000 
troops in lebanon 
hobeika returned to the christian heartland northeast of beirut 
after syrian and government troops crushed rebel maronite gen 
michel aoun on oct 13 removing the main obstacle to the new peace 
plan 
the return of hobeika 34 has raised fears of a showdown 
between him and samir geagea the rightwing maronite who ousted 
him in 1986 in a shootout that claimed the lives of 350 christians 
but even without the feuding the power of the maronite 
political dynasties has ebbed 
christianity has been on the retreat in the middle east for 
years christian leaders noted at a recent conference in cyprus 
that christian emigration from the region including lebanon is 
growing amid rising islamic fundamentalism 
there are an estimated 12 million christians in the middle east 
compared with about 120 million moslems 
the maronites named for st maroun a 5th century syrianborn 
monk who settled in the pinecovered lebanese mountains have seen 
themselves as part a centuriesold fight for survival against 
islam 
yet their reluctance to share power with moslems helped ignite 
the civil war which has left more than than 150000 people dead 
theyre the only christian community with a distinct political 
history said prof kamal salibi who teaches history at the 
american university of beirut they fear being overwhelmed if 
the system is democratized theyll be outvoted and they cant 
carry the day 
of lebanons three great maronite patriarchs only 79yearold 
suleiman franjieh is alive his rivals pierre gemayel and camille 
chamoun survived several assassination attempts and died of 
natural causes 
now their heirs are at each others throats 
patriarch nasralla sfeir the maronites spiritual head has 
proved helpless in efforts to try to reconcile them 
his appeals for ceasefires and threats of excommunication have 
gone unheeded a far cry from the days when maronite politicians 
took their instructions from the patriarch 
two days after aoun was crushed gunmen killed dany chamoun his 
wife and two small sons at their home east of beirut 
chamoun was a staunch supporter of aoun and the slayings 
appeared to be aimed at ending the political legacy founded by 
chamouns father camille 
other scores have also to be settled among the maronite clans 
phalangist militiamen loyal to pierre gemayels youngest son 
bashir attacked franjiehs domain in north lebanon on june 13 
1978 and slaughtered his son and political heir tony along with 
his wife and daughter and 21 bodyguards 
geagea led the assault and the elder franjieh a close friend of 
syrian president hafez assad vowed revenge so far the massacre 
has gone unanswered 
bashir gemayel made no secret two years later that he ordered 
his men to slaughter more than 300 members of chamouns tigers 
militia north of beirut 
gemayel was elected president aug 23 1982 with israels 
backing but he was assassinated in a bombing at phalange 
headquarters in beirut on sept 14 1982 a week before he was to 
be sworn in the bombing was blamed on a leftist prosyrian faction 
dominated by greek orthodox christians 
gemayels elder brother amin was elected as his successor 
but when amins violenceridden term ended in 1988 he fled to 
selfimposed exile in paris signaling the end of the gemayel 
dynasty 
tony franjiehs son suleiman jr 23 contends his father was 
not avenged by bashir gemayels death he is reported to be waiting 
in the franjiehs power base of zghorta to send his 2000strong 
militia against geagea

a rekindled dispute over specks of inhospitable 
rock in the east china sea is feeding antijapanese sentiment in 
quarters already fearful that tokyo is drifting away from pacifism 
the five tiny islands the largest only 25 miles in diameter 
and three rocks are claimed by japan china and taiwan the area is 
considered a rich fishing ground and is believed to contain oil 
japan calls the archipelago the senkakus but china and taiwan 
know the islands as the diaoyutai after a decade in abeyance the 
argument over them was revived by reports in taiwan that a 
rightwing japanese group planned to renovate a lighthouse on the 
main island 
two fishing vessels carried taiwanese politicians and athletes 
to the islands on oct 21 in an attempt to reinforce taiwans 
claim but were turned back by patrol boats of the japanese coast 
guard 
in hong kong about 10000 people turned out for a rally and 
march to demand that japan give up its claim to the islands 
the confrontation comes at a sensitive time for tokyo 
many asian nations that were brutally occupied by japan during 
world war ii already have expressed concern about a government 
proposal now before japans parliament to send noncombat troops to 
the persian gulf 
that bill would allow the first overseas deployment of japanese 
soldiers since the war many believe sending the troops would 
violate japans postwar constitution which forbids it to use force 
in international disputes 
taiwan and china usually at loggerheads because of their rival 
claims to be the legitimate government of all china have objected

protesters in taiwan which was a japanese colony for 50 years 
until world war ii ended have burned the japanese flag thrown 
eggs outside japans representative office in taipei and vow to 
launch another voyage to the islands 
japan has to recognize the diaoyutai islands are our 
territory protest leader lee chinghwa said last week they 
should stop expanding militarism 
probeijing newspapers in hong kong which reverts from british 
to chinese sovereignty in 1997 have printed emotional editorials 
on the islands that recall japans expansionist past 
china has been a victim of japanese militarism the ta kung 
pao said there still exists a widespread sentiment among the 
chinese people opposing militarism 
a fullpage newspaper advertisement by the hong kong 
professional teachers union made a clear connection between the 
island dispute and fears of renewed japanese militarism 
protect diaoyutai teach the next generation it said the 
ad included photographs of chinese slaughtered by japanese soldiers 
in world war ii 
japan has repeatedly denied any intention of reviving 
militarism 
it incorporated the islands in 1895 the united states 
administered them from the end of world war ii until 1972 when 
they were returned to japan 
china has claimed the chain since ancient times the chinese 
nationalist government now on taiwan contends the islets came 
under its sovereignty in 1945 when japan was defeated 
a 1968 united nations report said large oil deposits may lie in 
nearby seabeds japan shelved a joint exploration plan with china 
in 1979 because they were too far apart on the sovereignty issue

prime minister toshiki kaifu has been quoted as saying japan 
would act prudently on the lighthouse matter foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe has said there are no plans to have the 
navy patrol the islands 
in taiwan chang lungyi of the institute of international 
relations said he did not see the island incident as a sign of 
japan becoming a military power but added 
japan could easily transform its welldeveloped industries to 
making weapons and people are concerned that it would quickly build 
up its military power 
some commentators in tokyo question whether fear of japanese 
militarism is the main factor 
yozo yokota professor of international law at international 
christian university believes china may see a chance to reinforce 
its claim to the islands while japan is trying to project a world 
image of peacemaker 
taiwan which has been isolated diplomatically because of its 
claim to china may want to demonstrate that it is a regional 
power some japanese academics believe 
they say taiwan also may be trying to portray itself as the 
champion of chinese nationalism

for 120 years the machinery at 
cheshire mills turned out textiles and helped weave the fabric of a 
community 
on sunday about 50 former employees gathered to remember that 
community spirit and how that fabric was torn when the decline of 
the textile industry in new england forced cheshire mills to close 
20 years ago 
it cast a tremendous pall over the town when it happened 
said warren thayer who was office manager when the mill closed 
it was like your security blanket was gone 
wellpreserved and still housing a descendant business of the 
cheshire mills the mill buildings and much of the center of the 
small town population of fewer than 1000 were designated a 
national historic landmark in 1977 
thayer who took part in the reunion organized by a historic 
preservation group said he joined the company full time in 1956 
50 years after his father went to work at cheshire mills for a 
time his family lived in mill housing 
you lived with this for many years it was a very 
paternalistic organization he said we always felt that 
thered always be cheshire mills 
the thayers were one of many families who sent multiple 
generations to work at the mill or at harris mill next door 
even cheshire mills president at its closing john colony jr 
was a descendant of josiah colony who founded the mill about 1850 
colony said it was hard to shut the mill that was practically the 
sole source of employment in harrisville 
it was a working plant and it was the spine of the town 
colony said a lot of people around here working in the mill were 
fifth sixth generation we felt we had a unique responsibility to 
them 
but the us textile industry suffered in the face of cheap 
foreign labor after world war ii much as the british textile 
industry suffered from american competition that peaked during the 
civil war said colonys son john chick colony iii 
we did it to the british and the japanese did it to us he 
said 
the closing came as a shock to the 30 to 50 employees still 
working at the mill that once had employed about 300 
colony said he called shop overseers into his office one by one 
in early october 1970 and sent them out to tell the workers the 
company would shut down in two weeks 
the employees retired moved away or went to work elsewhere in 
the area a few found work at harrisville designs founded by the 
colonys the year after cheshire mills closed it continues to carry 
on mill work in a small way 
harrisville designs which employs about 25 and is housed in 
some of the old cheshire mills and harris mill buildings makes 
looms and yarn for home weavers 
the yarn is made on some of the same machines that spun thread 
for cheshire mills fabrics 
every year for nearly 150 years woolen yarn has been spun 
in this town chick colony said its a tradition

police are questioning and taking 
thumbprints from people passing through neighborhoods where five 
college students were slain two months ago 
the american civil liberties union said it may challenge the 
practice in court 
were stopping people in the area if there are any questions 
why theyre there and taking thumprints if they arouse suspicion 
this is not being done in an accusatory way state highway patrol 
spokesman maj ernie leggett said 
robyn blumner executive director of the aclu of florida said 
the group wants to talk to people who have been stopped and may 
challenge the patrols they violate constitutional protections 
against unlawful searches and seizures she said 
leggett said in fridays the gainesville sun that officers 
question and take prints from people on foot bicycles mopeds or 
motorcycles 
the newspaper earlier reported that investigators believed the 
killer rode a bicycle to at least one of the crime scenes 
leggett said he did not know when the patrols began and refused 
to say whether they had provided any clues 
it doesnt sound as though they can articulate any objective 
criteria for suspicion blumner said they have to articulate 
some reasonable suspicion to even stop someone 
two university of florida freshmen both women were found slain 
aug 26 in the apartment they shared near campus a few hours 
later a student at sante fe community college was found 
decapitated in her apartment the next day two more university 
students were found slain 
investigators have followed up some 5000 leads but made no 
arrests 
a 941639 federal grant paying for the investigation is about 
to run out leaving authorities scrambling for money said sgt 
dick gerard 
although students remain apprehensive most have returned to 
classes 
university professor anne jones had planned to begin the 
semester teaching paris trout a novel about a string of 
murders in a small georgia town she postponed the assignment 
figuring the book hit too close to home 
last week paris trout author pete dexter spoke to jones 
students the book won the 1989 national book award 
although the campus seems to have returned to normal fear lurks 
below the surface he said 
that guy represents a force of nature he said its like 
something blowing in off the ocean its hard to even hate the guy 
doing this its so foreign its so unreasonable its so

warsaw pact armament experts have 
agreed on the number of tanks and cannon each member nation may 
maintain under an agreement with nato 
the state news agency ctk announced sunday that the pacts 
foreign ministers would meet nov 3 in budapest to sign the 
agreement 
the 23 nato and six warsaw pact countries are expected to sign a 
conventional arms treaty in paris during a summit meeting of the 
34nation conference on security and cooperation in europe that 
opens nov 19 
there had been concerns that the warsaw pact nations would not 
be ready to sign the comprehensive eastwest agreement and 
president bush has said he will not attend the meeting if the 
treaty is not ready 
while overall quotas for nato and the warsaw pact had been 
accepted by both sides there had been disagreement within the pact 
on how its allotment should be divided among member nations 
agreement saturday seemed to rest on a compromise between the 
soviet union and the five other pact members formerly moscows 
subservient allies but now increasingly favoring the alliances 
dissolution 
about 490 tanks had to be scrapped to be within the warsaw 
pacts agreed total of 20000 the soviet union agreed to cut its 
force by 150 reducing the number of its tanks to 13150 while the 
other nations made corresponding reductions said robert harenciar 
czechoslovakias deputy foreign minister 
soviet artillery was reduced by 500 he added without going 
into further detail on the negotiations

president bush said sunday the united states is 
not looking for war in the persian gulf but vowed to a cheering 
military audience that we will not walk away from the showdown 
with iraqi president saddam hussein 
its clear that the strength of our arms and the strength of 
our will is up to the challenge that we all face in the persian 
gulf he told thousands of members of the armed forces and 
dependents at hickam air force base 
he assured the families we want every single american home 
no american will be kept in the gulf a single day longer than 
necessary but we will not walk away until our mission is done 
bush has sent more than 200000 us forces to the gulf to 
counter saddam whose troops invaded the tiny oilrich nation of 
kuwait on aug 2 bush has ruled out any concessions for iraq and 
said as recently as saturday theres nothing to negotiate until 
baghdad bows to united nations resolutions demanding his withdrawal 
and setting terms for solving the crisis 
the speech wrapped up a twoday visit here that blended a gop 
campaign appearance with a meeting with 11 pacific island leaders 
bush also found time for jogging swimming a catamaran boating 
excursion and golf 
after his speech bush flew to san francisco where he signed a 
stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through 
nov 5 
the president will use the intervening days to review the 
various appropriations bills congress has passed for spending in 
specific categories bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush signed the stopgap measure after arriving for a political 
stop he is to attend a private fundraiser monday for republican 
sen pete wilsons race for governor he will stop in oklahoma 
later monday to campaign for gop gubernatorial candidate bill price 
at the cowboy hall of fame 
the president who had spent the weekend in hawaii will sign 
the deficit reduction package sometime after he returns to 
washington monday night 
bush addressed the crowd at hickam from a tarmac platform in 
front of the gleaming new air force one a blue and white 747 jumbo 
jet the appearance came as the united nations neared a vote on a 
resolution holding iraq liable for war damages and economic losses 
bush said his appearance at hickam next to pearl harbor 
brought back personal memories from world war ii when he was 
stationed in the pacific 
no member of that generation can ever forget the clarion call 
that pearl harbor represented the president said things 
changed instantly the country came together and like you here 
today we each knew our duty 
he said the situation in the persian gulf is a challenge of 
perfect clarity good and evil right and wrong 
bush said americas determination in the gulf is unwavering 
america never went looking for a war but in world war ii the 
world paid dearly for appeasing an aggressor who could have been 
stopped the president said appeasement leads only to further 
aggression and ultimately to war and we are not going to make the 
mistake of appeasement again 
referring to the deployment of forces to the gulf bush said 
make no mistake the decision for this deployment was not made in 
washington the decision for this deployment was made by the men in 
baghdad 
he ticked off an indictment of four crimes that he said are 
punishable under international law saddam hussein will be held 
accountable bush said 
iraq has waged a war of aggression plundered a peaceful 
neighbor held innocents hostage and gassed its own people he 
charged 
in his meeting saturday with the pacific island leaders bush 
pledged that johnston island southwest of hawaii will not be used 
as a permanent incinerator for chemical weapons and hazardous 
waste critics have questioned the facilitys safety and 
reliability 
bush said it would be used only to destroy the 300000piece 
munition stockpile already stored there and 100000 nerve gas 
artillery shells en route from germany 
with 240 million invested in the johnston plant the island 
leaders appeared resigned to his decision we wish you could tell 
us that you would break down the facility tomorrow said cook 
islands prime minister geoffrey henry we know of course that 
cannot be done that is not sensible 
they also expressed skepticism about the administrations 
cautious approach about global warming bush said he was committed 
to a 1 billion annual program to study the issue

the 101st congress was wracked by ethics 
scandals and ridiculed for a budget process that seemingly wouldnt 
end but by the time it was over lawmakers managed to pass 
legislation that had eluded enactment for many years 
people ought to take some hope from that process instead of 
dumping all over it said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
we have persevered on a hard unpleasant difficult process up to 
the very week before election 
in its final days before adjournment sunday during a time when 
all previous congresses would have been home campaigning the 
101st congress made its biggest accomplishments 
a huge tax hike and spending cut package which combined with 
spending restraint promises to reduce the federal deficit nearly 
500 billion over the next five years 
a child care package including a new grant program and 
increased tax credits for lowincome families with children 
the first overhaul of the federal clean air law in 13 years 
which would require new pollution controls on automobiles 
factories and utilities 
the first major revision of the nations immigration system in 
25 years providing more visas for families and those with special 
job skills 
passage of all 13 of the annual spending bills for federal 
agencies none of which was completed by the oct 1 deadline in a 
major reversal from the reagan years defense spending will be 
heading down over the next five years while domestic spending 
increases 
a fiveyear farm bill designed to contain costs and address 
environmental concerns 
congressional leaders held multiple news conferences during the 
weekend to boast about those accomplishments and others they 
acknowledged some legislative failures no major bills on crime 
education health care or campaign reform 
but what really marked the 101st congress was the ugly political 
infighting and the ethics scandals 
i think our congress leaves washington with a renewed sense of 
purpose as it relates to fulfilling our responsibilities to people 
who questioned our motives and questioned our integrity said 
rep vic fazio dcalif 
it started last year with senate rejection of president bushs 
nomination of john tower for secretary of defense because of his 
reputation as a boozer and womanizer 
then there was the pay raise in round one a torrent of public 
criticism killed a proposed 50 percent boost in congressional 
salaries 
the house became embroiled in a historic ethics scandal that 
culminated in the resignations of speaker jim wright and majority 
whip tony coelho both were accused of ethical lapses in their 
personal finances 
after taking over as speaker at midyear foley parlayed the 
demand for tighter ethics rules into a new pay raise plan 
lawmakers would get a big salary boost if theyd agree to give up 
taking special interest money for making speeches 
the house approved it while the senate decided to stick with 
the lobbyists bucks house salaries which were 89500 last year 
will soar to about 125000 in january while the senate will 
settle for a costofliving adjustment 
this year one house member was disciplined and a second forced 
to resign in sex scandals one did favors for a homosexual lover 
the other was convicted of having sex with a teenage girl and was 
accused of sexually harassing a congressional employee 
in the senate a group of lawmakers became known as the keating 
five all under investigation for their ties to the head of a 
failed savings and loan institution 
meanwhile for most of its existence legislation in this 
congress crawled 
an attempt at a meaningful bipartisan budget deal last year 
collapsed into a nasty partisan fight over president bushs 
proposed capital gains tax cut 
until this month the biggest legislative successes were an 
increase in the federal minimum wage ending aid to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua an oil spill prevention bill and the 
americans with disabilities act giving new rights to people with 
impairments 
democrats defeated bushs proposed constitutional amendment to 
ban flag burning 
but the democratic congress couldnt overcome the presidents 
veto of legislation guaranteeing workers six weeks of paid leave 
for childbirth or family medical emergencies 
the 101st congress never overrode any of 16 bush vetoes 
the debate through the spring summer and into the fall of this 
year was dominated by the budget even with bush abandoning his 
nonewtaxes pledge progress was slow 
finally at the end of september the white house and 
congressional leaders signed a budget pact calling for a 500 
billion reduction in federal deficits over the next five years 
but rank and file lawmakers of both parties rebelled at the 12 
cent gasoline tax deep cuts in medicare subsidies and dozens of 
other new fees or service reductions on oct 5 the day congress 
had been scheduled to adjourn the house killed the deal 
a government shutdown and legislative chaos ensued but from the 
wreckage a new package slowly emerged one less to bushs liking 
but still acceptable to him it had higher taxes on the wealthy 
only a nickel in new gas taxes and a lighter hit on medicare the 
senate gave it final congressional approval on saturday 
with the budget moving legislators put other bills into place 
including the clean air bill child care and the longdelayed 
annual spending bills 
theyll be back in january

the administration is adopting a new tactic in 
afghanistan reflecting a determination to end one of its last 
proxy wars against the soviet union 
officials and experts say the united states has shifted support 
away from the exiled afghan political leadership in pakistan to the 
rebel commanders inside afghanistan who are fighting the 
sovietarmed government 
us officials hope the rebel commanders can break the stalemate 
in the fighting and clear the way to a peace agreement with moscow 
and its surrogate government in kabul 
the rebels armed by the united states and saudi arabia have 
failed to fulfill predictions they would defeat the kabul 
government after it lost the support of the soviet troops who 
invaded afghanistan in 1979 and went home 20 months ago 
but the commanders recently set up a new council and earlier 
this month 40 commanders from around afghanistan met to coordinate 
an offensive against provincial capitals 
for the first time since the soviets withdrew the mujahedeen 
islamic holy warriors are pulling together said one us 
official 
both the united states and the soviet union want out of 
afghanistan just as they are trying to extricate themselves from 
supporting rival factions in the protracted civil wars in cambodia 
and angola 
the united states has made a decision at the highest levels 
that we make a deal with the soviets and get out said barnett 
rubin an afghanistan expert at columbia university 
soviet and us officials say they are near agreement on 
afghanistan but they still differ over what role if any 
sovietinstalled president najib will play in an interim 
government secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze are scheduled to hold more 
talks next month 
initially the united states had high hopes for a sevenfaction 
afghan interim government set up in pakistan last year to oversee 
rebel operations against kabul and prepare for a transition to 
democratic rule 
but the administration was forced to reevaluate due to 
continued fighting divisions among the aig factions us 
disagreements with pakistan and growing pressure from congress to 
cut aid to the rebels 
the administration now is pinning its hopes on the newly 
organized council of guerrilla commanders to put military pressure 
on the kabul government and strengthen the us position at the 
bargaining table 
there has definitely been a tilt toward dealing directly with 
the commanders said zalmay khalilzad a researcher with the rand 
corp and a frequent adviser to the state department 
they came to the conclusion that the real power lies with the 
commanders who control territory he said they matter more 
than the political leaders exiled in pakistan 
the commanders council represents broad segments of the 
population inside afghanistan unlike the aig whose constituency 
was narrow and generally excluded more secular and liberal 
elements us officials say 
but the oncesolid congressional support for covert aid to the 
mujahedeen has cracked congress this year cut 30 million from 
last years 280 million covert aid package 
the soviets too have cut their support for the afghanistan 
government in response to a severe budget crunch from 5 billion 
last year to 2 billion this year us officials say 
the administration which asked for 300 million for the rebels 
argued that now is not the time to let up the pressure on the 
soviets continued arming of the rebels it argued could help the 
commanders win more territory before winter arrives and enhance the 
us position at the bargaining table 
but many supporters of the mujahedeen in congress doubt the new 
strategy will be any more successful than the old one as long as 
pakistans military intelligence services serve as the conduit for 
the weapons 
lawmakers who closely follow the afghan conflict have repeatedly 
accused the intelligence service of favoring radical moslem 
factions within the mujahedeen over the more moderate prowestern 
groups 
gulbuddin hekmatyar the most radical of the seven aig leaders 
has received most of the arms delivered by the pakistani 
intelligence service congressional sources said 
the state department has been pressing the pakistanis in recent 
months to stop playing favorites the sources said the urgings 
have resulted in increased weapons deliveries to moderates but 
hekmatyar still receives a disproportionate amount they said

president bush noted for his devotion to the 
sporting life did not miss the chance to make his twonight stay 
in the nations island paradise into a rolling opportunity for fun 
sandwiched in with the more tedious business of political 
fundraising conferring with pacific island leaders and giving a 
foreign affairs speech bush managed two morning runs on waikiki 
beach and two dips in the ocean a catamaran cruise out of honolulu 
harbor and 18 holes of golf at hickam air force base before leaving 
sunday for san francisco 
his dawn outings on the beach at the hilton hawaiian village 
hotel attracted dozens of tourists who tend to rise early in the 
balmy climate 
on saturday night bush gathered about 30 staff members 
political supporters and ambassadors for a twilight cruise on a 
catamaran owned by his longtime supporter fred zeder head of the 
overseas private investment corp 
bush sported a splashy print hawaiian shirt and told reporters 
that his attire was getting very good reviews 
he said he had come to the harbor fresh from telephone 
conversations with congressional leaders in washington who had 
finally toiled to a finish on the budget agreement that he has 
agreed to sign 
the chipper smiling bush indicated as the catamaran pulled away 
from shore that he got the impression the lawmakers werent having 
much fun 
everyone was very tired but theyre glad to be done he 
said 
the boaters returned after dark their cruise topped off by an 
offshore view of the shimmering waikiki skyline in the background 
and bush headed off for dinner in an elegant restaurant 
on sunday after his 630 am swim in the ocean bush changed 
into his golf togs and headed out to hickams palmtree dotted 
links by the sea 
he invited two of the 11 pacific island leaders with whom he met 
on saturday prime minister geoffrey henry of the cook islands and 
fiji prime minister ratu sir kamisese mara 
others in the two groups of three were bushs national security 
adviser and frequent golfing buddy brent scowcroft zeder and the 
commander of us pacific operations adm huntington hardisty 
rain began to fall about an hour after they teed off and bushs 
new partners learned that it takes more than rain to get him to 
come in off the course in any event the sun returned and they 
completed the 18 holes 
it was unclear whether henry got the chance to press again his 
public comments of saturday when he said the pool of good will 
islanders felt toward the united states had begun to dry up since 
world war ii 
he also spoke of a gulf of misunderstanding and 
misinformation on the issue of global warming a matter of great 
concern to the islands because any rise in the ocean caused by 
fossil fuels warming the earths atmosphere would greatly affect 
their lives 
while some scientists predict harmful climate changes and other 
effects from global warming the bush administration notes other 
scientists say the trend is not firmly proven and that more study 
is needed before dramatic action is taken

the final budget that emerged from congress 
has such a strong democratic stamp that it will remind republicans 
for years to come of the perils of saying no 
the house gop abandoned president bush when he asked for its 
votes three weeks ago for a bipartisan deal democrats also 
rejected their leaders appeals as a majority of both parties in 
the house voted against it 
so both bush and the democratic leaders who participated in the 
budget summit were embarrassed the difference was the house 
democrats knew where they could look for votes 
this was not rocket science said a top democratic aide 
the budget summitteers knew the defects of the package 
they reduced the medicare cuts of 60 billion nearly in half 
ditto the proposed increase in the gasoline tax they eliminated a 
proposed tax on home heating oil and a twoweek delay in 
unemployment benefits 
in their place were inserted big new levies on the wealthy which 
fit in perfectly with some wellpracticed soaktherich 
rhetoric 
we have to change the debate from tax increases to who gets 
taxed and the fairness of it said house majority leader richard 
gephardt 
with recession fears high what the classconscious debate 
democrats had been trying for years suddenly worked 
the white house meantime was hamstrung 
it was too late for a veto strategy the next best tool for 
moderating the package republican votes was taken away by deep 
divisions between those willing to accept some taxes to cut the 
deficit and those who wouldnt 
i see 50 members on my side on the extreme right who 
wouldnt vote to tax prostitution said rep robert michel 
rill the house gop leader when were a divided minority 
party weve got no strength at all 
michels deputy house minority whip newt gingrich rga led 
the opposition to the original bipartisan plan for members of a 
minority party used to saying no his was an easy position to 
accept 
but this time it backfired 
when the final package was shoved down their throats with even 
more taxes skewed in favor of the democrats constituency some 
lawmakers began referring to the difference as the newt tax 
without gingrich this budget could have been a setback rather 
than an uplift the democratic aide said 
the final negotiation necessarily moderated the democratic plan 
since in the senate both democratic and republican votes were 
needed for passage and there was a lot of votebuying at the end 
for example dropping a provision that forces public employees in a 
handful of holdout states to enroll in medicare 
but with the unwitting help of republican renegades the 
democrats won a shift away from the policies of the reagan years 
everyone pays but the focus of the tax increases is on the 
wealthy there are medicare cuts but not nearly so deep as bush 
proposed medicaid the health program for the poor is expanded 
domestic programs will grow while the pentagons share of the pie 
shrinks 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said democrats 
had managed to stop a trend that started in the past decade and 
began to reverse it 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash heralded a new era in 
dealing with fiscal problems in the country 
of course republicans who voted against the plan will find 
plenty in it to attack including tax boosts for beer and gasoline 
medicare premium hikes and income tax increases for the wealthy 
out campaigning for republican candidates bush has been 
attacking the very plan that he will sign into law 
rep sander levin dmich compared bushs stance to the old 
comedy routine of flip wilson the devil made me do it the devil 
made me do it said wilsons character geraldine 
all because the republicans would only say no bush was 
forced to accept more taxes on the wealthy fewer cuts in medicare 
a smaller gas tax increase and numerous other changes from the 
original package 
mr president the democrats made you do it levin said

the federal budget mess couldnt have come 
at a better time for democrat anthony j celebrezze jr who wants 
to be ohios next governor 
celebrezze the state attorney general has trailed republican 
george voinovich the popular former mayor of cleveland throughout 
the campaign 
but now celebrezze is gaining ground as he ties voinovich to the 
unpopular washington establishment and to a republican party the 
democrats painted as the protector of the rich in the monthlong 
budget battle 
it gets to what ive been saying that in washington for the 
last 10 years people have been creating a very wealthy class in 
this country and then the rest of us celebrezze says 
voinovich rejects the idea that the presidents problems are 
rubbing off on him he says the public is blaming democrats and 
republicans alike for the disarray in washington 
george bush is not hurting me one bit voinovich said the 
general public thinks that theyre all not being very 
responsible right now 
independent polls have showed voinovich holding a doubledigit 
lead through most of the race but celebrezze last week said his 
internal polls showed him in the lead a gop poll put celebrezze 
within 4 percentage points 
a gallup poll released sunday showed voinovich was favored by 47 
percent of those surveyed and celebrezze by 39 percent with 14 
percent undecided the survey sponsored by the blade of toledo and 
tv stations wtol in toledo and wlio in lima had a margin of error 
of 4 percentage points 
pollsters said interviews with respondents to the gallup poll 
suggested that celebrezze has gained in popularity as public 
resentment toward the bush administration has grown 
but voinovich spokesman curt steiner said gop polls offer no 
evidence that the democratic attack has hurt voinovich 
we are still getting half of the blue collar vote he said 
his campaign strategy has been to tie celebrezze to alleged 
corruption and mismanagement during the eightyear tenure of 
democratic gov richard celeste who was barred from seeking 
reelection 
the celestecelebrezze administration is the most corrupt 
scandalridden unethical in our memory voinovich said at a 
recent debate 
at one debate voinovich told celebrezze there was a right way 
and a wrong way to manage state government 
tony i want to say to you you and dick celeste have done it 
wrong for the last eight years he said 
celebrezzes new populist theme includes attacks on a string of 
fancy voinovich fundraisers featuring bush and other gop 
luminaries 
taking a swipe at one 25000percouple bush fundraiser 
celebrezze asked a crowd at a union rally how many people in 
this room make over 200000 a year how many people in this room 
can afford to write a check for 25000 to spend 20 minutes with 
george bush 
voinovich 54 has proved himself adept at capturing democratic 
votes during 10 years as mayor of cleveland in heavily democratic 
cuyahoga county he is credited with helping to pull cleveland out 
of a financial morass and revitalize its downtown 
abortion has been the single biggest point of difference between 
the two candidates celebrezze last december abandoned his 
longheld opposition to abortion and said women should have the 
right to choose 
voinovich opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest or a 
threat to the life of the mother 
he has criticized celebrezze for flipflopping isnt it 
unbelievable what some politicians will do to get voters one 
voinovich ad asks 
voinovich last week was mentioned as a possible successor to 
labor secretary elizabeth dole who is resigning democrats seized 
on the reports as a chance to suggest voinovichs campaign could be 
in trouble 
we thought it was very nice for president bush to offer our 
opponent a consolation prize two weeks before the election said 
celebrezze spokeswoman melinda swan 
voinovich said his campaign knew nothing about the search for 
possible successors to mrs dole 
his campaign said sunday that voinovich had picked up additional 
newspaper endorsements giving voinovich the support of all the 
states largest newspapers and many smaller dailies and weeklies 
the ohio race is one of 14 gubernatorial contests around the 
country that are too close to call the others are in california

private banks have begun asking the 
agriculture department to make good on 2 billion worth of credit 
guarantees for the sale of wheat rice and other commodities to 
iraq 
not all of the 2 billion is coming due at once however the 
loans are spread out some of them running through 1995 or later 
the guarantees mostly involve two export credit programs 
called gsm102 and gsm103 that are operated by usda to boost sales 
of farm products to selected overseas buyers 
unlike concessional or longterm programs such as food for 
peace these are for shorter periods involving commercial loans 
underwritten by private banks 
the gsm102 program provides credit and repayment over six 
months to three years a wide variety of us farm products are 
exported to dozens of foreign countries with these arrangements 
under gsm103 an intermediate program loans can run from three 
to 10 years and focus on products with longer economic lifetimes 
such as breeding livestock 
the programs are backed up by the departments commodity credit 
corp and are administered by the foreign agricultural service the 
ccc also is the financing agency for all federal commodity support 
programs 
no money is lent directly by the department once a country is 
approved for the guarantee private lenders and exporters work out 
a plan with the foreign buyer subject to usda approval 
larry mcelvain director of ccc operations for the foreign 
agricultural service said claims are coming in now every day 
from lenders who want their payments for grain sold to iraq 
no estimate of the number of credit guarantee claims or amounts 
was readily available 
what you want to understand about the claims is that we dont 
just pay out the 2 billion all at once he said that is 
because lenders cant file a claim until it comes due 
iraq had been buying us farm commodities with credit 
guarantees since 1983 and had an excellent record of repayment 
mcelvain said 
there has never been a claim filed or paid on iraq until this 
situation here he said 
this situation began aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait as a 
result president bush severed all trade with baghdad including 
further credit sales of farm commodities 
the annual credit line under the guarantee program was at a peak 
of slightly more than 1 billion in fiscal 1989 for 1990 the year 
that ended sept 30 iraq had been cleared for 500 million with 
another 500 million available subject to further review 
 
washington ap moderately strong demand for highprotein meal 
and vegetable oil is helping bolster soybean prices this season 
according to agriculture department analysts 
a major factor however is the size of the 1990 soybean 
harvest currently estimated at 182 billion bushels a slight 
decline from 1989 output 
overall yields bushels per acre are expected to be near 
average and about the same as last years the departments 
economic research service said in a recent outlook report 
accounting for the drop in production is a reduction in acreage 
planted in 1990 more than three million under the 1989 level 
soybean use in the 199091 marketing year that began sept 1 is 
expected to be up slightly from last season the total crush by 
processors to make meal and oil is estimated at 118 billion 
bushels up 3 percent the report said exports of beans are 
expected to drop slightly this season to 615 million bushels 
the domestic use of soybean meal in 199091 is expected to rise 
further from last seasons record level 
a profitable livestock production outlook aided by moderate 
grain prices should boost meal use the report said in the 
export market expected soybean meal sales to the soviet union and 
latin america account for a nearly 10 percent surge in exports over 
last year to 55 million tons 
the domestic use of soybean oil is forecast to match last years 
record although oil exports are expected to trail 198990 the 
report said 
economists projected the farm price of soybeans in 199091 at an 
average of 570 to 7 per bushel up 570 last marketing year 
 
washington ap the nations hens produced an estimated 553 
billion eggs in september according to a monthly report by the 
agriculture department 
an average of 268 million layers were at work during the month 
a fractional increase from september 1989 those birds averaged 
2062 eggs per 100 layers compared with 2037 a year earlier the 
report said

thousands of police officers provided security 
as a ku klux klan march and rally drew about 30 robed and hooded 
members to the nations capital fortythree counterdemonstrators 
were arrested and 14 people were injured 
the rally at the capitol on sunday was the second in as many 
months more than 5000 officers from three police departments 
prevented a few thousand counterdemonstrators from coming 
facetoface with the klansmen 
six protesters were treated at a local hospital for minor 
injuries according to local police 
eight police officers were hurt most suffering minor injuries 
in confrontations with the counterdemonstrators said city police 
spokesman sgt joe gentile a female officer suffered a serious 
neck injury when she was struck by a rock according to ed wilson 
another police spokesman 
gentile said the metropolitan police arrested 40 demonstrators 
three others were held by the us capitol police on charges of 
disorderly conduct demonstrating after revocation of a permit and 
disobeying the orders of a police officer said spokesman dan 
nichols 
we knew this was going to happen district police chief 
isaac fulwood jr said at a news conference afterward referring to 
a federal judge who rejected a city bid to restrict the march to a 
shorter path he added we thought that the judge erred i 
thought he used poor judgment 
several officers struck counterdemonstrators with clubs but 
fulwood said he did not believe they used excessive force none of 
the klan members was hurt 
kkk were here to stay shouted the klansmen as they 
marched the 11block route from the washington monument to the 
capitol 
even before the march began police dressed in riot gear along 
constitution avenue were pelted with bottles cans and sticks by 
counterdemonstrators 
the counterdemonstrators chanted slogans including hey get 
down were going to run the klan out of town 
at the capitol a klan leader exhorted his followers to remove 
from office all senators and representatives who voted to override 
president bushs veto of the civil rights act of 1990 
they tried to override the veto but thank god it was kept out 
of law an unidentified klansman said during the 30minute rally 
vote the hypocrites out he added 
virgil griffin of shelby nc leader of the christian knights 
of the ku klux klan said he was pleased with his groups success 
weve done good griffin said 
he criticized police for not arresting counterdemonstrators who 
confronted police along the march route 
they should have arrested the people making threats against 
the klan he said they would have arrested me if i made 
threats against the communist party 
the capitol police deployed just about every uniformed 
officer in its ranks about 800 to the fourblock perimeter 
surrounding the rally site said nichols 
officials said all 4750 city police officers were dispatched 
sunday at an estimated cost of 800000 they were assisted by 
about 300 us park police and some national guardsmen who directed 
traffic around areas blocked by police 
on labor day weekend dc police escorted 44 klan members to 
the capitol grounds where they held a rally 
earlier this week police said they couldnt guarantee the 
safety of the marchers if they walked to the capitol from the 
washington monument city officials went to court to try to 
restrict the marchers to a path along the perimeter of the mall 
around the washington monument 
but after the american civil liberties union challenged the city 
on constitutional grounds us district judge louis oberdorfer 
ordered the march to proceed along constitution 
the city won a temporary reversal of that order saturday when a 
threejudge appellate panel sent the matter back to oberdorfer but 
he reaffirmed his order

crimes motivated by racial religious and 
cultural prejudice are increasing and likely will escalate faster 
if the nations economy continues to deteriorate experts say 
as economic conditions decline the civility of society 
declines also jeffrey ross director of campus affairs for the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith told a conference of the 
washington journalism center 
at the very least things will get worse before they get 
better he said 
ross said the league received reports of antisemitic incidents 
on six college and university campuses in 1984 and the figure 
increased to 51 in 1989 
things seem to be heating up he said 
other experts at the conference agreed that incidents of bigotry 
are increasing and are likely to be stimulated by a declining 
economy 
some attribute it to the pressure of competition for jobs among 
blacks whites and other racial or religious groups 
the increase in antisemitism is clearly related to an 
increase in bigotry in general on campus ross said you also 
have increased numbers of assaults upon blacks upon hispanics 
upon asians upon gays and lesbians 
he said most of the antisemitic crimes were directed against 
property whereas the assaults on gays and lesbians were against 
people 
adele d terrell acting executive director of the 
baltimorebased national institute against prejudice and violence 
said we dont know how much of it goes on we just know there is 
a lot of it we know there appears to be an increase 
we are in very tight economic times ms terrell said we 
know that the blue collar jobs just arent there whenever we have 
tight economic times we have scapegoating and blaming we know 
that weve got lots and lots of immigrants coming into this 
country and historically each and every wave of immigrants that 
has ever come into the united states has been greeted by violence 
there is lots and lots of violence motivated by prejudice 
lots and lots of harassment motivated by prejudice and my feeling 
is that given our demographic and economic circumstances it cannot 
help but increase she said 
most of these incidents are perpetrated by individuals or 
small informal groups of individuals she said the majority of 
the acts are not in our opinion committed by organized hate 
groups 
steven salmony a psychologist from chapel hill nc who has 
studied the ku klux klan and similar groups said their activity 
may also be bolstered in economic hard times 
i am concerned that the financial uncertainty and the economic 
insecurity might cause some especially vulnerable people to turn to 
groups like the klan for support for protection for security 
he said this is a distinct possibility 
jack mcdevitt associate director of the center for applied 
social research at northeastern university in boston said there 
are hundreds of thousands of people who feel some resentment and 
when to this resentment we add in the economic difficulties we are 
going through it can lead to a variety of intolerant acts people 
really feel threatened and they are looking for a way to do 
something about it 
he said raciall motivated incidents may increase in boston this 
year after several years of declining or remaining steady and i 
fear it is the beginning of a trend 
it is poor whites against poor blacks and that is where the 
friction is coming from he said 
lisa navarette public information director of the hispanic 
rights group national council of la raza said there is a 
feeling among blacks that immigrants take jobs away from blacks and 
that this lowers wages this has fortified the antihispanic 
sentiment in the black community 
she said la raza is worried that this will intensify as the 
economy worsens and if we do go into a recession 
there is a real correlation between downturns in the economy 
and antiimmigrant feeling ms navarette said

more than 750000 children will be helped in 
the first year of a new system of federal grants and higher tax 
credits for child care say sponsors of the program approved as 
congress adjourned for the year 
the child care benefits were part of a massive budget agreement 
completed before lawmakers left washington for the campaign trail 
early sunday also completed in the sessions waning hours were a 
major immigration law rewrite a foreign aid bill watereddown 
crime legislation and a ban on offshore oil drilling 
the child care bill marked the first time since world war ii 
that the federal government has supported child care for working 
parents outside of welfare and employment programs said sen 
christopher dodd dconn one of its authors 
it also will require states to establish health safety 
registration and quality requirements churchrun day care centers 
will be eligible for the federal subsidies a recognition that 
churches play an important role in child care in many areas 
in other major legislation congress approved a substantial 
boost in the number of immigrants who will be allowed into the 
united states each year 
the bill the first major rewrite of immigration law in a 
quartercentury would boost the current limit of 490000 a year on 
legal immigrants to 645000 in each fiscal year through 1994 and 
675000 thereafter 
the measure keeps reuniting families as its primary test but 
also would open the door to foreigners with special skills those 
who are wealthy and even some shunned for years for political or 
medical reasons 
president bush on sunday night signed a stopgap spending measure 
to keep the government operating through nov 5 he will use the 
intervening days to review specific bills approved by congress 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush signed the stopgap measure after arriving for a political 
stop in san francisco 
the president who had spent the weekend in hawaii will sign 
the deficit reduction package sometime after he returns to 
washington monday night 
as they ran for the exits lawmakers also 
slashed military aid to el salvador hoping to pressure the 
salvadoran government and leftist fmln rebels to negotiate an end 
to their 10year war president bush said he will sign the 155 
billion foreign aid bill that includes the restrictions apparently 
because it also includes 67 billion in debt forgiveness for egypt 
as a reward for its leadership in the persian gulf crisis 
voted 3131 for a strippeddown anticrime bill leaving out 
contentious issues like the death penalty and a ban on assault 
weapons left in were provisions toughening penalties for certain 
whitecollar crimes including possible life terms for certain 
savings and loan fraud cases the bill also for the first time 
makes possession of child pornography a federal offense 
banned offshore oil drilling along coastlines from alaska to 
new england for another year the moratorium on offshore oil leases 
along thousands of miles of coast was in the 1991 spending bill for 
the interior department 
endorsed a mildly worded admonition against obscene art the 
provision governing the national endowment for the arts ended 
efforts to take more stringent action including banning federal 
support for works that denigrate religious symbols or beliefs 
approved a new departure fee of up to 3 for airline 
passengers which could add as much as 12 to a roundtrip ticket 
that includes connecting stops the provision also would require 
air carriers to retire their noisiest jetliners by the end of the 
decade

with voters angry and their party plummeting 
in the polls republicans who face congressional elections a week 
from now are running hard away from their president 
i dont like to go against what the president is saying 
said rep tom tauke a republican who is running for the senate in 
iowa but my judgment is that in this case the president has a 
different job than i have 
gop candidates who share taukes task getting elected are 
trying to put as much daylight as possible between themselves and 
the republican occupant of the white house 
the focal point for conflict is the 496 billion budget package 
congress approved this weekend before adjourning to the campaign 
trail the fiveyear deficit reduction bill which president bush 
has said he will sign includes 137 billion in new taxes and the 
rest in spending cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt 
but that mix isnt sitting well at home tauke said in an 
appearance sunday on cbss face the nation iowans certainly 
arent interested in sending a whole lot more money to 
washington he said 
in nebraska gop senate candidate hal daub wasted no time in 
attacking the package this new budget will give nebraskans an 
idea of how a small country feels being overrun by a larger 
power he said 
and rep claudine schneider a republican running for the senate 
in rhode island was asked how she felt about bushs inability to 
make another trip to her state to campaign for her before nov 6 
thats fine she said 
schneider said voters are going to vote for me not for the 
president in this next race and so they do see the distance 
between the two of us 
bushs budget director richard darman admitted the deficit 
reduction package approved by congress on saturday was not popular 
but said it was needed nonetheless 
its regrettable that its come in the middle of an 
election darman said but the president is doing the right 
thing 
darman and white house chief of staff john sununu turned to a 
triedandtrue line of attack blaming democrats for tax hikes in 
the new budget and crediting republicans for the spending cuts 
sununu called the tax increase ransom that bush had to pay 
to democrats to get the spending cuts he wanted conceding that it 
had temporarily hurt the presidents popularity 
he cashed in some of his political capital for the benefit of 
the country he said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
but making that argument is complicated by bushs acceptance of 
both aspects of the fiveyear 496 billion budget deal reached 
just before the 101st congress left town for the campaign trail 
democrats moved quickly to tie the knot linking bush to the deal 
even tighter house majority leader richard gephardt dmo noted 
in the waning moments of the congressional session that bush has 
seemed ambivalent and then angry about the budget package 
the public should not be confused by the president he was a 
central player when this budget was written and it would never 
have gone forward without his approval of every item in it 
gephardt said the comment was a pointed reminder that bush had 
abandoned his nonewtaxes pledge last summer 
and democratic national committee chairman ron brown also 
appearing on abc pounded home his partys fairness theme 
democrats shaped the tax package to put more of the burden on the 
wealthy the only ones who really made out during the 1980s he 
said 
because democrats have been in the congress fighting the 
middle class ended up better off with the new budget brown 
contended 
vice president dan quayle who has campaigned widely for 
republicans in recent weeks said he senses americans are fed up 
to here with government and incumbents and predicted that will 
work for the gop on election day 
i think youre going to see a major sea change in this 
election because people have had it quayle said on nbctvs 
meet the press the democratic congress has a lot of 
explaining to do 
but the difficulty came when quayle sought to defend bush as a 
successful president by citing a list of accomplishments all of 
which congress either was closely involved in or approved of 
deficit reduction a rewrite of the clean air act persian gulf

united mine workers members tired of 
working from the outside are trying to get inside the legislatures 
of west virginia alabama and illinois 
the umw traditionally has supported candidates through its coal 
miners political action committee and has been a lobbying force in 
some coal states 
but this year brings a new strategy for dealing with politics 
from the inside 
i know the ins and outs of the state legislative body said 
gene claypole a mine workers district president and a candidate 
for the west virginia senate 
it seems that we have quite a few attorneys that are elected 
to those positions and quite a few businessmen elected to those 
positions and i saw labor on the outside he said 
we need to have somebody from the working class to present the 
views of the workers i dont know anybody who would represent 
labor any better than somebody in labor claypole said 
two other mine workers members are running for the west virginia 
house of delegates and two more are running for reelection to the 
state house 
two umw members also are running for the state house in alabama 
and one is running for the illinois house all the umw candidates 
are democrats 
the campaigns follow last years surprising victory by district 
28 president jackie stump in virginia who won a lastminute 
writein campaign as an independent for the states house of 
delegates 
he defeated longtime rep donald mcglothlin sr the father of a 
circuit judge who had fined the umw heavily for activities during 
the pittston coal strike 
at last months umw convention in florida union leaders urged 
members to become involved in state politics pointing to the 
success of canadas laboraffiliated new democratic party which 
has sent several union members to parliament 
the umw is hoping for the same success in this country to enact 
a national health care plan and a law prohibiting companies from 
hiring permanent replacement workers during a strike 
the new political goal was ratified in a report adopted by umw 
delegates at miami beach 
the delegates said that basically if there isnt a candidate 
in either party willing to stand up for the working men and women 
of this country they will seek through all appropriate channels 
candidates outside of those parties who are willing to stand up for 
those working men and women and their rights said union 
spokeswoman kirsty smith 
umw members also are becoming more actively involved in local 
races running for county and city posts smith said 
the unions looking at political involvement at all levels and 
theyre looking for politicians who are going to live up to their 
campaign promises to help working men and women smith said

the accidental shooting death of a young 
stockbroker by an officer looking for a burglar is one more strike 
against a police force already struggling with allegations of 
brutality and racism 
terry d barnes 24 was shot between the eyes in his apartment 
police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had 
entered the apartment at 330 am and fired after barnes got out 
of bed to see what was wrong 
it was the seventh shooting death involving kansas city police 
officers this year in the previous three years five people were 
shot and killed 
i just hope that this case will draw the line on where the 
police can kill an innocent man where do you draw the line said 
roommate andy brez 23 who was sleeping in another bedroom when 
police entered on saturday 
barnes was white as is the officer who shot him however other 
recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black 
citizens 
police said they were told the prowler might have run to the 
floor on which barnes lived two police officers whose names were 
not disclosed noticed the door to his apartment was not tightly 
shut and entered authorities said 
an officer encountered barnes unarmed in a tshirt and boxer 
shorts standing in his bedroom police spokesman sgt greg mills 
said barnes made a kind of lunging motion and the officer 
fired from about 5 to 8 feet mills said 
friends of barnes questioned whether his apartment door was ajar 
and whether he would have lunged at the officer 
we are defending the officers being in that apartment mills 
said as for the shooting itself we will make no assessment of 
the propriety of that until after the investigation 
the department has suffered a string of complaints about 
excessive force and racism since the spring police chief steven 
bishop said before the latest slaying that the departments 
standing has fallen in the community and a behavior 
modification program is being developed for offending officers 
were part of the problem out there on the street and weve 
got to get back to good basic police work bishop said after 
barnes death 
in june several white officers bloodied a nigerianborn roman 
catholic priest with nightsticks as he lay on the ground the rev 
joseph okoye said officers who stopped him on suspicion of drunken 
driving mistook his foreign accent for drunken speech 
in may another black clergyman was hit on the head with a 
shotgun by a white officer while lying on the ground police said a 
youth in the car of the rev william fountaine matched the 
description of an armed robber 
neither clergyman nor the passenger in fountaines car was 
charged both clergymen alleged racism bishop suspended some of 
the officers involved in the may incident 
in another case three undercover officers were suspended for a 
shooting this spring that left a young black man crippled the 
officers and the victim accused each other of starting the fight 
that led to the shooting 
also this year four oficers riddled a man brandishing a 
barbecue fork with 15 bullets killing him and an officer killed a 
man who was spraying him with a fire extinguisher no officer 
involved in the two killings was charged 
the officer who shot barnes was a twoyear veteran of the force 
he was placed on paid leave pending a police investigation and that 
of a grand jury 
this is a tragic chain of events that is regrettable for mr 
barnes family and for this officer bishop said the officers 
were reacting appropriately to a number of circumstances which 
together led them to that apartment 
terry was a good man he would have been a good husband and a 
good father said barnes fiancee alison brady they had planned 
to marry in june

the red berets are back 
they stand at street corners and patrol outside the hotels and 
at the pyramids sidearms wrapped in white holsters a reminder 
that the persian gulf crisis could erupt in terror in cairo at any 
time 
egypt often accused of talking a lot but doing little about its 
problems seems to be taking security seriously since the countrys 
parliament speaker was assassinated on a downtown street oct 12 
the red berets are military police 
they were last seen on the streets of this city of 12 million in 
february 1986 after the army suppressed riots by police draftees 
angered by rumors that their tours of duty had been lengthened 
special police security units are also out in force wearing 
black uniforms and combat helmets traffic policemen are wearing 
sidearms again purses are searched at the entrances to floating 
restaurants on the nile 
many egyptians began to worry about terrorist attacks early in 
august when president hosni mubarak committed troops to the 
persian gulf to check iraq which had just invaded kuwait 
but there were few visible signs that the threat of attack 
from iraqi palestinian or islamic fundamentalist agents was 
being taken seriously 
more worrisome was the economy 
egypt faced losses estimated at 45 billion in the form of a 
ruined tourism industry reduced suez canal revenues and lost 
remittances from an estimated 500000 egyptians who had to return 
home from the gulf 
the financial picture has brightened somewhat egypts us and 
arab allies are moving to write off 14 billion in debts aid worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars is pouring in and there are good 
prospects for agreement with the international monetary fund to 
reschedule the remaining foreign debt 
but security suddenly took the forefront on oct 1 when gunmen 
ambushed rifaat elmahgoub killing the speaker his driver and 
five security men 
so far at least 10 suspects have been arrested on suspicion of 
involvement in elmahgoubs murder two other suspects were shot to 
death in a street gunbattle on saturday 
police have ordered security checks at hotels in the downtown 
area near where elmahgoub was assassinated security trucks now 
guard entrances and exits at sporting clubs frequented by diplomats 
and foreigners police details have been reinforced at cairo 
american college an international school in maadi at the sphinx 
and giza pyramids 
but traditions of lax security die hard 
the opposition newspaper elwafd reported last week that its 
reporter and a photographer talked their way through cairo 
international airport checkpoints and walked up the gangway and 
into the cockpit of an empty airliner 
government newspapers the next day reported a new program of 
television monitors and other security steps

kuwaitis are counting on war to end the 
terror of life under iraqs occupying forces a refugee says 
it is not only the brutal iraqi treatment or the doings of the 
iraqi death squads that makes us terrified to step out of our 
homes he said sunday the very living is horrible 
desolation 
the man a public employee in his mid30s arrived in bahrain 
after leaving via saudi arabia last week he spoke on condition of 
anonymity to prevent reprisals against friends left behind 
the man who said he had lost 30 pounds since the invasion sent 
his wife and children out a month earlier but stayed on until he 
could no longer stand it 
from the very young to the very old we all hoped for war 
the kuwaiti said we dont mind dying we want the hell ended 
iraqis control government offices and schools and many kuwaitis 
refuse to go to work or send their children to school he said 
he said resistance has died down in the city but continued on 
its fringes 
resistance was of two types and the enthusiastic youth have 
been destroyed since about a month ago by torture and killing he 
said now it is the second type an underground resistance that 
goes for ambushes of military posts in the desert 
underground fighters are well aware of the risks he said iraqi 
death squads bring young men they suspect of resistance acts to 
their family homes call the family members out and then shoot 
the youth in the head heart and foot and leave the dead bodies at 
their feet 
he said the number of iraqi troops had declined in the heart of 
the city the number of checkpoints also had decreased and some 
mines had been removed from facilities 
but what does it mean i cant tell he said 
the iraqis are very tricky one iraqi soldier will tell a 
kuwaiti look i am removing a mine as we are leaving another 
iraqi soldier will tell another kuwaiti we will never leave 
kuwait

the gun jack ruby used to kill lee harvey oswald 
is at the center of a nearly 24yearold dispute on the court 
docket this week 
a trial was to begin today in probate court to determine 
distribution of rubys assets and consider a petition to remove 
jules mayer as executor of his will 
the most valuable asset by far is the 38caliber colt cobra 
revolver that ruby a dallas nightclub owner used to kill the 
assassin of president kennedy in 1963 
mayer a lawyer who knew jack ruby and rubys brother earl 
ruby have been fighting nearly 24 years since ruby died this is 
at least the fifth time earl ruby has gone to court in attempts to 
unseat mayer 
jack ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to death 
in the electric chair an appeals court overturned the conviction 
in 1966 but ruby died in 1967 at age 55 before a new trial could 
be held 
earl ruby claims his brother from his deathbed told him that 
mayer had been instructed to tear up the will in which he had named 
mayer executor 
jack ruby bought the revolver for 6250 in a dallas gun shop 
and used it to shoot oswald two days after kennedy was 
assassinated 
mayer has estimated the gun which he keeps in a safe deposit 
box would bring 125000 from a collector mitch martin a board 
member of the jfk assassination information center put the amount 
at no more than 50000 
other than the gun that estate includes only the clothing and 
jewelry ruby wore at the time he shot oswald some personal papers 
and other clothing 
whatever the value of the gun mayer has contended that proceeds 
from its sale must be used to pay rubys debts among them 
65000 in expenses he claims he has incurred in handling the 
estate and fighting rubys lawsuits 
earl ruby who lives in boca raton fla counters that mayer is 
trying to make money off the estate 
the struggle over the estate isnt the only bizarre aspect of 
rubys legacy 
last year 22 years after ruby died the internal revenue 
service entered the case contending that when ruby died he owed 
17000 in back taxes that amount the irs said has now accrued 
to 86010 with interest and penalties 
earl ruby contends the irs sacrificed any claim by waiting so 
long

a noncommunist coalition that wants 
full political independence for soviet georgia appears to have won 
the southern republics legislative elections an election official 
said today 
sundays was the first true multiparty vote in soviet history 
the round tablefree georgia coalition appeared likely to win 60 
percent to 70 percent of the vote said david dzhaparidze a member 
of the central election commission 
the round table led by zviad gamsakhurdia won majorites in all 
26 districts in the capital of tbilisi dzhaparidze said 
this is great said robert petriarshvili a spokesman for 
the coalition he said the vote would give round table 110 out of 
the 250 seats in the supreme soviet 
dzhaparidze said the communist party appeared to be doing well 
in areas where nongeorgian ethnic groups hold a majority and it 
was expected to win 20 percent to 25 percent of the legislative 
seats the remainder would be split among smaller parties he said 
among the 15 soviet republics all but kirgizia have declared 
some form of sovereignty or independence the three baltic 
republics of lithuania latvia and estonia were the first to make 
the move but they are still negotiating with moscow 
gamsakhurdia interviewed over the weekend predicted that 
georgias transition to political independence would take about two 
years and that the republic would maintain extensive economic 
relations with the soviet union 
it also seems likely that georgia will rely on the soviet union 
in national security matters he said 
about 35 parties most grouped by coalition took part in 
sundays election 
noncommunists have won election in several cities and republics 
elsewhere in the soviet union but georgias vote was the first in 
which formal parties created under new soviet laws were listed on 
the ballot 
long lines snaked from polling sites in the capital tbilisi as 
well as the surrounding countryside about 3 million people were 
eligible to vote 
official results were not expected until the end of the week 
the official tass news agency reported runoffs in close races are 
set for nov 11 
maguli latariya cast her ballot swathed head to foot in black 
mourning clothes her 16yearold daughter was one of 19 georgians 
killed on april 19 1989 when soviet troops broke up a peaceful 
nationalist protest in tbilisi 
the killings strengthened independence aspirations even the 
ruling communist party of georgia was forced to advocate 
independence from moscow as part of its platform 
mrs latariya wept as she voted saying it was as if my 
daughters voice was telling me what to do she said she voted 
for the round table coalition a bloc of seven political parties 
under the election law a party must get at least 4 percent of 
the republicwide vote to gain representation in the legislature 
that provision was designed to encourage coalitions and large 
parties and to discourage splintering into small factions 
tass reported that the elections were observed by experts from 
the united states france belgium germany sweden austria spain 
and finland 
many voters interviewed as they left polling stations said the 
communists had gained ground in recent months because they 
represented stability 
we would like life to be peaceful again said nari 
chanturia complaining about the uncertainty and violence that have 
gripped georgia in recent months 
some politicians boycotted the election claiming it was not 
democratic one of them the leader of the national democratic 
party gia chanturia was shot in the arm saturday as he left a 
political meeting 
chanturia and others formed a 200seat national congress of 
georgia to act as a shadow parliament and push for independence 
two members of the national democratic party gia kobakhedze and 
irakli tsereteli spoke on georgian television and accused 
gamsakhurdia the round table head of organizing the shooting of 
chanturia on orders from soviet authorities 
gamsakhurdia denied the charges

closed due to over aggressive squirrels 
the squirrels are just acting squirrelly now said lowe 
they are so busy burying acorns they are aggravated at the 
people 
a bumper crop of acorns over the past two years has produced a 
bumper crop of gray squirrels who are gathering food with 
particular fervor lowe said 
when park patrons offer food as was the case with the children 
who were bitten the animals move in close and dont take no for an 
answer lowe said

a 15yearold staging a gallows scene at a 
halloween party accidentally hanged himself when the noose somehow 
tightened authorities said 
william anthony odom of charlotte nc was pronounced dead 
friday night amid fake spider webs and plastic bats decorating an 
aunts home odom and several of his friends had staged a haunted 
house in the basement 
a week ago a 17yearold died while staging a similar halloween 
hangman gag along the route of a hayride in lakewood nj 
odom had crouched inside a wooden cupboard said his grandmother 
hattie carpenter he was dressed as a pirate wearing black 
trousers a red shirt and a gold earring around his neck was a 
3foot length of nylon rope 
it was a slipknottype noose the more pressure you apply 
the tighter it gets coroner jim chapman said evidently it 
was tight enough to cause some problems with his breathing and he 
either passed out or panicked 
chapman said hes unsure how the rope tightened odom could have 
slipped and lost his balance or was playing with the knot causing 
it to tighten chapman said 
the coroner said its also possible that the knot gradually 
tightened and reduced blood to the brain causing him to faint and 
then suffocate 
what was really sad was that the kids thought we were going to 
be able to revive him but it was too late they were scared when 
we got there but then they became hysterical chapman said

allegations that jon grunseth cheated on his 
wives and swam nude with teenage girls combined to drive him from 
the governors race and plunge the republican party into turmoil 
nine days before the election 
citing enormous pressure on his family the political 
process and the state the 44yearold business executive called it 
quits late sunday and apologized to supporters and contributors 
i always havent been a perfect person i think im a pretty 
decent guy but ive made some mistakes and i feel badly about 
that too grunseth said at his home about 20 miles east of 
minneapolis 
grunseth was accused of having an affair during both of his 
marriages and of skinny dipping with teenage girls in 1981 he 
denied the nudeswimming allegations and said the affair ended 
before his second marriage in 1984 
democratic gov rudy perpich is seeking an unprecedented fourth 
term he had no immediate comment 
republican state auditor arne carlson who placed second in the 
sept 11 gop primary launched a writein campaign a week ago as 
pressure mounted on grunseth to drop out 
his name will go on the nov 6 ballot if the party fails to name 
someone else by friday afternoon 
theres no question he carlson is in the best position but 
right at this moment im not saying im supporting arne carlson 
said state gop chairman bob weinholzer if someone else can show 
me how they can put a campaign together in one week and win id be 
receptive to take a look at it 
carlson a moderate who supports abortion rights is 
unacceptable to the religious conservative faction that controls 
the state party 
im going to spend a lot of time now to make sure we heal the 
wounds he said i have to reach to all areas of the republican 
party to bring this together so we can put together a winning 
election 
republicans had begun the year with high hopes of unseating 
perpich who had been derided as eccentric and put on the defensive 
about living too grand a style with a luxury car and bodyguard 
in the most recent independent poll conducted oct 1921 
carlson was favored over perpich 51 percent to 41 percent the 
statewide star tribunekstp minnesota poll of 601 likely voters had 
a margin of error of four points 
grunseths campaign was crippled oct 15 after two women made 
sworn statements alleging grunseth tried to get them to swim naked 
with him during a 1981 pool party at his home 
the women who were 13 and 14 at the time said they refused but 
that grunseth his teenage daughter and a 16yearold girl took 
off their bathing suits one of the women claimed grunseth tried to 
pull down her bathing suit 
on sunday the star tribune of minneapolis reported that 
32yearold tamara taylor of minnetonka claimed to have had a 
sexual relationship with grunseth on and off from 1980 to 1989 
grunseth divorced katharine winston in 1983 and married his second 
wife vicki in 1984 
grunseth acknowledged having a romantic relationship with taylor 
but said it ended a long time ago in the early 80s 
taylor said she spoke out to prevent grunseths further 
deception of the voters in regard to his past antics his 
character and what ruthless actions he is willing to take in order 
to be elected governor 
grunseth said sunday he had been on the verge of quitting the 
race for two weeks 
its wear and tear its just simply pure wear and tear he 
said the whole thing becomes sickening its exhaustion is what 
it is mental physical emotional exhaustion at a point 
theres an end you just say man its more than i can bear 
mrs grunseth said she believes her husbands contention that he 
ended the affair before they married she said she did not try to 
dissuade him from dropping out of the race 
the accusations she said prove theres no floor in the 
decency scale anymore about what people will write or say

minority gagauz militants in the moldavian 
republic have set up cordons to prevent soviet troops from entering 
their region and enforcing stateofemergency measures tass 
reported today 
the moldavian parliament imposed the state of emergency and 
soviet troops were standing by ready to move in under the command 
of gen yuri shatalin if lawmakers issue the order the official 
news agency said 
a provisional parliamentary committee was monitoring the 
standoff from chimishlia a small town in southern moldavia 
bordering on the gagauz territory which was declared a 
stateofemergency zone on friday 
although there were no clashes between moldavian and gagauz 
volunteers representatives of gagauzes set up cordons to prevent 
the soviet troops and republic militiamen from entering tass 
said 
the gagauz are a closeknit group of about 150000 people all 
descendants of christians who fled to moldavia from turkey because 
of religious persecution about 160 years ago 
worried by rising moldavian nationalism and angry over a law 
that made moldavian the republics official language the gagauz 
claimed the southern corner of the republic last week and began 
holding elections for an autonomous government 
brigades of moldavian volunteers said by various sources to 
number between 12000 and 50000 streamed into the area to try to 
stop the independence movement 
gagauz youths in turn formed defensive units aided by some 
ethnic russians who also oppose moldavian nationalism 
negotiators for both sides were trying to defuse the crisis 
soviet officials holding negotiations with representatives of 
the gagauz provisional committee in the southern city of komrat 
called for the withdrawal of militant gagauz volunteers from the 
emergency zone tass said 
if this condition is complied with moldavian volunteer 
detachments will be withdrawn from areas adjacent the 
stateofemergency zone the news agency said 
on sunday night the chairman of the executive council of the 
disputed komrat region appealed in a television broadcast for 
peace 
the interethnic conflict in the republic has reached the 
point beyond which there will be bloodshed and the deaths of 
innocent people he said 
according to tass the two sides have agreed to set up a joint 
commission for the mutual inspection of the volunteer units in 
preparation for their withdrawal

abroad has encountered widespread opposition because of japans 
constitutional ban on using force overseas its passage is in 
doubt lawmakers have said 
a member of the advance medical team said us and saudi 
hospitals were so well staffed and equipped that japans 
contribution might just result in confusing the already 
established medical system of the forces the newspaper asahi

organic coffee and retrochic appliances will 
be big hits in 1991 but the popularity of new age religions and 
baseball doubleheaders will fade the american forecaster 1991 
predicts 
other anticipated hits are success surgery for executives 
field trips for kids and gourmet ice home videos and the 
southwestern interior design style will bomb 
kim long 41 of denver began compiling the book on whats in 
and whats out in 1983 it sells about 10000 copies a year 
organic coffee grown without pesticides has all the makings 
of a major food fad long said 
people are becoming a lot more literate about what they put 
into their mouths he said theyre willing to spend more money 
for the details 
he predicts that the boxy appliances that marked the dawn of the 
postworld war ii era will reappear next year its the visual 
appeal so solid and heavy the beginning of the atomic era he 
said 
long says more executives will have cosmetic surgery and workers 
will eat at their desks so they can be more productive signs of 
americans intensified interest in their work 
the ideal look will be relatively small noses not a prominent 
chin but a chinless look is unacceptable and wrinkles would be 
out he said 
however 1991 will not be the year for workaholics 
i think the 90s is going to be a fun decade said long 
most people in the big baby boom age group will be in their 40s 
and 50s they will have earned a living and raised families i 
think that equates to a potential situation where people will look 
to do fun things to worry less about what the neighbors think or 
families think 
a trend that has hit japan and is expected in the united states 
is the popularity of gourmet ice the ice reportedly up to 
10000 years old is chipped from alaskan ice floes and valued for 
its purity 
next year will bring a reduced interest in new age religions 
it wont die but my observation is that it will just be less 
faddish 
long predicts a revival of interest in millenialism as the year 
2000 approaches generating a fascination with crackpot 
religions 
interest in home videos a fad that soared this year with the 
success of televisions americas funniest home videos will 
also wane long said 
the santa fe fashion look including laughing coyotes and cactus 
cutouts has been overmarketed and will no longer be hip the 
forecaster says 
long a newspaper columnist said he researches trends by 
reading numerous newspapers and magazines keeping files on 
particular topics and monitors computer data bases

the countrys yearold coalition government 
resigned today after the uneasy centerright alliance split over 
how much norway should open itself to trade with the european 
economic community 
conservative prime minister jan p syse told parliament that his 
government could not agree on the countrys position in talks 
between the eec and the sixnation european free trade association 
of which norway is a member 
the talks are to center on the creation of a joint economic 
region 
syse had worked through the weekend seeking common ground that 
would allow his coalition of the conservative center and christian 
democratic parties to remain in power 
but the antitrade bloc center party with strong support from 
the countrys subsidized farmers rejected the idea of sweeping 
changings in norwegian laws that protect domestic industry and 
resources 
during talks on the creation of the joint economic region the 
european community has pressed for changes in the norwegian laws 
the eec claims the laws discriminate against foreigners 
the center party the governing coalitions smallest member 
wants continued border controls and some protection of domestic 
argriculture fishing grounds and other resources 
syses government will remain in office until a new government 
is formed which could take several days 
norways parliament was divided into nearly equal blocs of 
socialist and nonsocialist blocs after sept 11 1989 national 
elections and news reports have said that the near deadlock has 
made both sides reluctant to govern 
anders talleraas the conservatives parliamentary leader said 
the party has enouraged syse to form a new single party government 
because of the small nonsocialist majority 
i am prepared to form a new government syse said before 
delivering his governments formal resignation to crown prince 
harald norways figurehead monarch king olav v is recovering 
from a stroke 
syse would need backing from all four nonsocialist parties 
without it he will likely ask former prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland to form her third labor party government since 1981 
her leftleaning party is the countrys largest in addition to 
socialist allies it would need backing from the center party to 
form a government 
it is still not clear how the new government will be made 
up brundtland said in a television interview she said labor is 
in a clear observer role waiting to see what happens 
when the coalition agreed on a joint platform and toppled 
brundtland last year the sensitive european economic community 
issue was left vague 
the proeec conservatives had said they would not allow discord 
within the coalition to hamper talks 
the conflict may have been aggravated last week when neighboring 
sweden strongly hinted that it would seek eec membership prompting 
calls in norway for both countries to join the community 
anne enger lahnstein of the center party said the issue was no 
longer the joint economic region negotiations but a battle over 
eec membership 
news reports speculate that a purely conservative government 
would probably be shortlived the next government will be the 
norways sixth since 1980 
leaders have expressed fears the country could suffer frequent 
government changes due to the nearly deadlocked parliament and no 
provision for calling new elections 
public disenchantment has increased due to tough austerity 
programs intended to pull norways oil dependent economy out of a 
fouryear slump that has brought record unemployment 
labor controls 81 seats in the 165seat parliament including 63 
of its own 17 from the socialist left and one independent 
the conservatives have 37 seats the christian democrats 14 and 
the centers 11 
for a majority the nonsocialists would have to depend on the 
the rightwing party of progress which soared from two to 22 seats 
in the last national election 
the center party was reportedly more willing to support a new 
socialist government than allow the progressives which was viewed 
as too extremist to be invited into the conservativeled coalition

bored policemen shoo monkeys and glance 
sleepily at closedcircuit television cameras as they enforce a 
curfew in this town whose name has become a battle cry in indias 
latest political and religious crisis 
about 100 people have been killed throughout india in the past 
week in riots caused by hindu plans to build a temple on a dusty 
hilltop where a moslem mosque now stands 
the latest death was reported today in lucknow capital of uttar 
pradesh state 75 miles west of ayodhya police officials said hindu 
crowds surged through a moslem neighborhood throwing bricks 
the religious feud has precipitated a political crisis that has 
brought prime minister vp singhs government to the brink of 
collapse 
but the firestorm raging elsewhere in the country is masked by 
inactivity and tight security in ayodhya where hindu 
fundamentalists vow they will get through roadblocks and start 
building their temple to the god rama on tuesday 
the fundamentalists said today in a handwritten communique that 
thousands of followers were hiding near ayodhya and were ready to 
start building 
communal tension will flare up all over the country but an 
ayodhya resident will not let a drop of blood be spilled because 
then ramas name will be sullied said mudit sharma who works 
for a hindu charity near the disputed site 
moslems of the area are not any diferent from hindus 
sharma said they participate in our festivals we go to their 
house during islamic festivals all these fights are because of 
political loafers 
the fundamentalist cause has been espoused by the hindu 
rightwing bharatiya janata party its top leaders are among the 
more about 80000 people arrested in the last week while trying to 
march to ayodhya 300 miles east of new delhi 
the arrests prompted the party to withdraw its support for 
singhs coalition government leaving him without the parliamentary 
majority needed to stay in office 
singh who plans to face parliament for a vote of confidence on 
nov 7 wants the templemosque dispute settled in court 
the fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot 
where lord rama was born and therefore is a religious matter not a 
legal one moslems a minority in officially secular but 
predominantly hindu india fear the displacement of one mosque 
could jeopardize hundreds of other islamic sites across the 
country 
the mosque called the babri masjid was constructed in the 16th 
century when mogul armies conquered northern india hindu 
fundamentalists claimed the moslem conquerors destroyed a rama 
temple on the spot where the mosque now stands 
the hindu world council backed by the bharatiya janata party 
has organized the campaign to build the temple by either moving or 
demolishing the little mosque 
on friday the government of uttar pradesh state imposed an 
aroundtheclock curfew in ayodhya to keep temple advocates from 
reaching the disputed hilltop trains to the area were halted and 
roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops 
they have made ayodhya into a cantonment for political gains 
let them arrest us but thousands of devotees will come to ayodhya 
tomorrow said tara kant jha secretary of the world hindu 
councils local office in ayodhya 
the council and the bharatiya janata party claim the 
governments tough stand on ayodhya is only a bid to win moslem 
votes 
moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people of 
whom 82 percent are hindu in uttar pradesh state where the 
government is allied with singh moslems account for about 30 
percent of the 120 million people 
hindumoslem clashes occur periodically in other parts of uttar 
pradesh but no one can remember trouble around ayodhya or its twin 
town of faizabad three miles down the road about a quarter of the 
areas population is moslem 
there never has been any communal tension in faizabad or 
ayodhya and i dont think there will be after oct 30 the date 
deemed auspicious by hindu astrologers to start building the rama 
temple said district commissioner madhukar gupta the top civil 
administrator of the area 
most residents agree they seem unconcerned about the curfew 
but business is suffering 
ayodhya is a major hindu pilgrimage site there are about 6000 
temples in the town of 45000 people on the banks of the river 
saryu 
most people live on the business generated by tens of thousands 
of hindu pilgrims who arrive every year in october for a hindu 
festival 
about 20000 security troops deployed around ayodhya have 
prevented pilgrims from entering ayodhya this week fearing hindu 
activists may infiltrate the town 
elaborate security arrangements include closedcircuit 
television cameras and iron gates every 20 yards on the lane 
leading to the disputed hilltop

airlines would be required to retire their 
noisiest jetliners by the end of the decade under legislation 
passed by congress just before it adjourned for the year 
under another provision of the legislation airline passengers 
could pay as much as 12 more for a roundtrip ticket 
both requirements were part of a budget package that was 
lawmakers last major act sunday before leaving washington 
the legislation requires that airlines replace about 2350 noisy 
aircraft or about half of the nations commercial jetliner fleet 
with quieter jetliners by the year 2000 in some cases planes may 
be equipped with hush kits that reduce engine noise to comply 
with the new requirements 
the transportation department estimated that as many as 3 
million people are subject to significant airport noise levels near 
the nations airports in some cases the number of people exposed 
to such noise could drop 80 percent to 90 percent the department 
said 
airport officials have long sought the authority to impose 
passenger fees saying they need the money for expansion projects 
and for noisereduction programs that include soundproofing nearby 
schools and other buildings 
the passenger departure fee of up to 3 at an airport could 
generate more than 1 billion annually on a connecting flight the 
fees could mean as much as 12 added to the roundtrip cost the tax 
comes along with an increase in the ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 
percent

the soviet media have shelved their previous 
unswerving support for cuba and are becoming downright irreverent 
in discussing the islands policies its marxist system and even 
fidel castro himself 
although relations remain cordial at the official level newly 
liberated soviet reporters are feeling no compunction about saying 
what they think 
the latest and perhaps most notorious example touched on an area 
that has been sacrosanct for 30 years castros personal life 
komsomolskaya pravda a new wave glasnostera daily said 
recently that castro has 32 houses a personal security contingent 
of 9700 and five children by his present wife so far as the 
cuban public knows there has been no change in castros marital 
status since he was divorced 35 years ago such subjects are taboo 
in cuba and during the heyday of sovietcuban relations the 
moscow press was respectful of cuban sensitivities on the subject 
but no longer 
other examples of soviet media deviationism 
disputing cuban claims of a 2millionton shortfall this year 
in soviet oil deliveries to cuba komsomoskaya pravda said in 
september the deficit was only 580000 tons the cuban daily granma 
called the allegation lies cuba has cited the fuel deficit in 
justifying severe austerity measures imposed in recent months 
a letter published in the same soviet publication also 
criticized the treatment given 250 soviet children who were sent to 
cuba after becoming ill from the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident 
no special medical treatment was offered to the children some of 
whom had to be hospitalized from the tropical heat the rest 
languished in their armystyle huts it said 
izvestia implying criticism of both moscow and havana has 
complained that soviet aid often is used inefficiently the large 
volume of unfinished construction projects the enormous heap of 
uninstalled equipment which becomes obsolete even before it is 
placed in operation the obsession with gargantuan projects that 
ignore the islands size and needs all this has existed and 
continues to exist it said 
izvestia also published a letter from a tashkent man who said 
of cuba pluralism is needed socialism has led to peoples not 
giving a damn about anything not even about trouble knocking on 
the door 
the cuban economy says the soviet magazine literaturnaya 
gazeta resembles someone crippled from childhood who is doomed 
to move about using the crutches of foreign aid 
the moscow news had kind words for the cuban exile community in 
miami who are perhaps the most outspoken critics of the cuban 
system although portrayed by cuban authorities as criminals 
bandits and paid agents of imperialism a moscow news correspondent 
who visited miami found the exiles to be people with a taste for 
enterprise the creative and technical intelligentsia 
gillian gunn a cuba expert at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said there seems to be competition now among 
soviet journalists to see who can outglasnost the other 
she said there is an element of genuine criticism of the 
situation in cuba and also an element of rebellion against the 
ideologically based reporting of the preglasnost years 
cuba considered moscow news and another soviet publication 
sputnik to be so distasteful that both were banned from the island 
last year they publish formulas that favor anarchy the 
communist party daily granma said 
the soviet media criticism of cuba reflects increasing doubt 
among many soviets about the propriety of continuing aid to cuba 
5 billion annually according to us estimates at a time of 
growing economic deprivation at home

prime minister jim bolgers 
national party swept to power by promising to cut unemployment in 
half keep inflation under 2 percent balance the budget and spur 
the economy 
but the new conservative prime minister is already seeking to 
diminish the expectations he raised during the campaign that led to 
his partys election saturday bolger now says new zealand voters 
should be happy if he fulfills three out of four of those campaign 
promises 
that still remains a tall order for bolger who also hopes to 
patch up ties with washington after six years of labor party 
government 
bolger was swept to power in the biggest election rout in new 
zealands 50 years of twoparty government but analysts said the 
size of the victory could hurt the traditionally divisive national 
party 
the national party expects 68 of parliaments 97 seats with 
labor falling to 28 seats and the new labor party holding the 
remaining seat 
former labor prime minister david lange said the national party 
will find it difficult to achieve party consensus with such a broad 
base of support 
you cannot satisfy the bulk of people with offers and this 
is a party with considerable inner divisions lange said 
critics said the national party vote came mostly from people 
disenchanted with labor and the nations difficult economic 
problems 
unemployment at 79 percent is at its highest level since 
world war ii the budget deficit is projected at up to 18 billion 
in the next fiscal year 
party pledges to cut unemployment in half keep inflation under 
2 percent balance the budget and spur a growth rate of 3 percent 
per year appear daunting he also says he would like some 
reconciliation with washington which would appear to be a major 
diplomatic task 
nine months ago the national party reversed itself and said it 
would maintain labors 1984 no nuclear policy of refusing to 
allow port calls by us warships because they would not say 
whether they were carrying nuclear weapons 
in response to the policy the united states in 1986 cut 
highlevel contacts with new zealand and dropped the country from 
the anzus military alliance which also includes australia 
bolger 55 earned a reputation as a tough negotiator while 
serving as labor minister for six years until 1984 when labor 
handed the national party a devastating election loss he took over 
the partys reins in 1986 and led it to a narrow loss in 1987 
bolger is the son of irish immigrants like the man he succeeds 
mike moore he left school at 15 to work the familys north island 
dairy farm 
a devout roman catholic he and his wife joan have nine 
children he has consistently opposed womens access to abortion

president bush is expected to sign an overhaul 
of the nations immigration laws that will substantially boost the 
number of immigrants allowed into the united states each year 
especially those with special job skills 
the first major rewrite of immigration law in a quartercentury 
was approved by congress late saturday as it rushed to adjournment 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the legislation had the 
presidents support 
the bill would boost the current limit of 490000 a year on 
legal immigrants to 645000 in each fiscal year through 1994 and 
675000 thereafter the measure keeps reuniting families as its 
primary test but also would open the door to foreigners with 
special skills those who are wealthy and even some shunned for 
years for political or medical reasons such as aids 
the measure assigns the first 465000 visas each year to the 
family preference category with an estimated 220000 of those 
going to immediate relatives of us citizens at the same time it 
earmarks 40000 visas for individuals from italy poland ireland 
and other traditional immigrant sources who have been virtually 
shut out for the past 20 years 
it also would remove bans on immigration for persons because of 
homosexuality 
in that period us immigration priority has been extended to 
those from asia and latin america with few coming from europe 
africa or other regions 
the bill also would relax political restrictions dating to the 
1950s when sen joe mccarthy rwis fought to ban many 
categories of immigrants as part of his crusade against communism 
the secretary of state still will be able to bar individuals for 
political reasons however 
the government also would be allowed to remove aids and other 
diseases from the medical list for which a person may be denied 
entry any decision on whether to do so is up to the bush 
administration

in a desperate effort to recoup from a big money 
scandal the former east german communist party says it will 
disclose details of its assets and turn some over to a national 
trustee 
party leader gregor gysi told a news conference in bonn today 
that the party has about 13 billion in assets 
the party now named the party of democratic socialism may be 
the richest in europe but its political punch has plummeted since 
it lost total control in east germany a year ago and tested itself 
in free elections 
two party members were arrested friday for allegedly funneling 
72 million in party funds to an account in moscow party leaders 
declared over the weekend that they would submit their assets to an 
independent review and relinquish all but what was needed to 
satisfy obligations and continue political activities 
its leaders concede the scandal is a serious crisis for the 
party as it approaches german elections dec 2 the first national 
vote since east and west germany united on oct 3 
party directors affirmed their support for gysi a 41yearold 
lawyer and communist reformer who took over after the hardline 
bosses were ousted by a peaceful democratic revolt 
but gysi was deeply embarrassed by the huge amount of money 
involved and by the fact that he went to moscow to look into the 
matter after police raided his party headquarters in berlin on oct 
19 looking for evidence that led to fridays arrests 
gysi was quoted today as telling the masscirculation bild 
zeitung that if he had known about the manipulation behind the 
money transfer he would not have flown to moscow and made myself 
look like an ape for a week 
other politicians derided the former communist party saying it 
had shown itself to be corrupt and a mere continuation of the old 
hardliners 
there is widespread belief that communist figures salted away 
huge amounts of property and other assets in the waning days of 
their rule in east germany 
gysi told a campaign rally sunday in alexanderplatz the main 
square in east berlin that there had to be a radical departure 
from the partys past 
a party statement admitted political mistakes and promised a 
wide debate on the partys future 
gysi had offered earlier to resign as leader but decided against 
it on the ground it would only damage the standing of the left in 
german politics 
german news commentators questioned whether the party would ever 
reform 
by remaining in his post the talented politician gysi just 
makes himself unworthy of belief the conservative frankfurter 
allgemeine said in a frontpage commentary 
die welt another conservative daily said the fragments that 
have come to light smell strongly like organized criminality 
gysi told reporters today in bonn where he is a member of the 
german parliament that the legislature needs a leftist opposition 
in march when east germany held its first free elections the 
former communists finished third 
after the two germanys united the renamed and supposedly 
reformed party won a number of seats in the oct 14 elections for 
state governments in the former east germany 
the state election results gave the party hope to win at least 
slender representation in parliament in the dec 2 election but 
the money scandal will make their campaign more difficult 
the former communists apparently are getting no help from their 
comrades in moscow german authorities praised soviet police for 
their cooperation in looking into the moscow end of the money 
transfer

event 
police constable bruno vaillancourt said three women and four 
men were shot early sunday but that none was critically injured 
the shootings occurred at st pascal baylon roman catholic church 
police did not identify the gunman or the victims 
constable charles morrisseau said the investigation is 
proceeding slowly because many witnesses will not talk to the 
police nobody wants to say anything he said 
vaillancourt said three people already had been taken to the 
hospital by the time police arrived at the church shortly after 
130 am sunday the most seriously injured person suffered a 
bullet wound behind the ear the others were wounded in the 
abdomen hands and feet 
while the police said they did not know the reason for the 
shootings the church pastor suggested rival gangs might be 
involved 
the rev louis levasseur said fighting among rival black groups 
has been a problem for the eight years he has been at the church 
the elderly priest also said the problems only occur when 
englishspeaking black groups rent the hall for special events 
we rent the hall to latinamericans asians and haitians and 
never have any problems levasseur said 
the race and language of the group that rented the hall at the 
time of the shootings were not immediately reported 
this is not the first time there have been gunshots and people 
hurt said levasseur shots were fired in the hall five or six 
months ago but no one has been injured in about a year and a half 
he said 
he suggested the church may have to stop renting the hall to 
englishspeaking black groups at the risk of being labeled 
racist

a group of 22 south koreans filed suit in tokyo 
district court today demanding a public apology and compensation 
from the japanese government for victims of world war ii the court 
said 
the koreans said they or their family members had been drafted 
by japan and forced to work as laborers or soldiers during the war 
tens of thousands of koreans were drafted into japanese service 
while korea was under japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945 
japan has recently expressed regrets for some of its actions during 
the colonial era 
a court official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
group did not specify the amount of compensation sought he did not 
say when the court would start hearing the case 
a foreign ministry official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said japans position is that all questions of 
compensation were resolved by agreements between japan and south 
korea in 1965 
the masscirculation newspaper asahi shimbun quoted the korean 
plaintiffs as saying the fates of many koreans drafted into the 
japanese army remain unknown and they want an investigation 
whatever talks were held at the governmental level a real 
settlement could not be made without the people concerned the 
koreans were quoted as saying

the supreme court today agreed to resolve a 
dispute over black lung benefits that may affect 650 million in 
claims by coal miners and their families 
the court said it will decide how difficult it should be for 
mining companies to challenge claims by as many as 3500 miners 
the court was asked to settle conflicting rulings from federal 
appeals courts that have studied the issue in cases from 
pennsylvania and west virginia 
the bush administration sided with the coal companies in seeking 
to limit the ability of some workers and their families to receive 
benefits 
justice department lawyers said coal mine operators should be 
allowed to show that disabled or deceased miners did not suffer 
from black lung disease or that work in the mines did not cause 
their disability 
the government also noted that black lung benefits may exceed 
185000 per miner or family 
the disease also called pneumoconiosis is a lung disorder 
caused by breathing coal dust over a long period of time 
the supreme court in a related 1988 ruling spared the coal 
mining industry from paying potentially billions of dollars in 
benefits to as many as 155000 miners the justices barred 
reopening claims that were denied in the late 1970s and early 
1980s 
but that ruling left open the issue raised in the dispute acted 
on today the validity of labor department regulations making it 
easier for mine operators to deny benefit claims 
the regulations give the companies the opportunity to dispute 
evidence that miners are suffering from black lung or that they 
were incapacitated by their work in the mines 
earlier regulations adopted by the department of health 
education and welfare said the only way the benefits could be 
denied is with proof a miner is still working is capable of 
working in the mines or is doing comparable work 
some federal appeals courts have upheld the labor department 
rules others have said they conflict with a 1977 federal law aimed 
at helping disabled miners 
congress created a special fund to pay off claims by miners with 
the disease and required mine operators to contribute to the fund

thousands of palestinians stayed home from 
their jobs in israel today during a general strike marking the 
anniversary of a 1956 massacre of arab villagers by israeli 
soldiers 
the strike came a day after israel lifted a fourday closure of 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and hundreds of arabs found 
they had been replaced in their jobs by israelis 
tensions were briefly raised among israelis today after an 
israeli arab soldier was found shot to death but police and army 
sources concluded the 19yearold druse soldier probably committed 
suicide 
last weeks attacks on israelis which included the fatal 
stabbing of a woman soldier and knifing of two other women soldiers 
led to the fourday closure of the occupied territories 
leaders of a 34monthold palestinian uprising have repeatedly 
urged slayings of israels as revenge for the temple mount shooting 
deaths of 20 arabs on oct 8 
the dead soldier was identified by a military spokesman as cpl 
hareb hatham 19 of beit jann village in northern israel which is 
predominantly druse the druse are a minority arab sect that is 
loyal to israel unlike most israeli arabs their men serve in the 
armed forces 
a police commander albert musafia said the shooting late 
sunday was probably a suicide 
army sources initially said there was evidence hatham could have 
been killed by guerrillas but later agreed with the suicide 
theory the body was found at the golani junction about 10 miles 
north of the occupied west bank 
todays strike in the west bank and gaza strip paralyzed 
commerce in the territories 
it was called by the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or 
zeal to mark 34 years since the killing of 49 israeli arabs by 
soldiers in kfar qassem 
the killings occurred during the 1956 suez war in which israel 
attacked egypt in an effort to break a twoyear egyptian blockade 
of its southern ports at the time curfews were imposed on most 
arab areas in israel troops opened fire on orders to shoot curfew 
violaters but their arab victims were mostly workers returning 
home from jobs unaware of the restrictions 
there were some vain attempts by palestinian activists to call 
off todays strike to avoid having more arabs fired because of 
prolonged absences from work but arab labor leaders claimed the 
strike hurt israel as well since its economy still depended on the 
work force of about 150000 palestinians 
hundreds of palestinians found sunday that they had been 
replaced during the fourday closure of the territories israel 
closed the lands because of attacks on israelis in revenge for the 
temple mount killings in which police opened fire on 
stonethrowing arabs

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that boosted a federal judges power to order predominantly white 
suburban schools to accept innercity black students 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by three 
kansas city mo suburban school districts facing such a 
desegregation order 
the case is an outgrowth of a longstanding court battle over 
desegregation of kansas citys public schools 
the fight led last april to an important supreme court ruling 
that federal judges may order local officials to raise property 
taxes to help desegregate public schools 
that 54 ruling upheld key features of a 1985 decision by us 
district judge russell clark in a 1977 lawsuit by black parents 
seeking to reverse the decline of the citys predominantly black 
schools 
the case acted on today grew out of clarks 1985 order that 
missouri officials pay for transportation and tuition of black 
students in kansas city who choose to transfer to predominantly 
white suburban schools 
clark described the plan as voluntary on the part of the 
suburban schools and the black students 
but school officials in the suburban districts of north kansas 
city lees summit and independence said they are being coerced 
into accepting the black transfers 
they asked the high court to overturn a may ruling by the 8th 
us circuit court of appeals that said clarks 1985 order is being 
ignored unlawfully 
since 1985 the appeals court said not a single suburban 
school district has admitted a single black student from kansas 
city pursuant to a plan negotiated by the state and the suburban 
school districts further delay cannot be countenanced 
the appeals court noted that 134 black students from kansas city 
applied for admission into the three suburban school districts in 
1988 the appeals court said the suburban districts did not admit 
the students apparently due to worries the state would not 
reimburse the costs 
after the black students were denied admission they filed a new 
lawsuit that was assigned to us district judge joseph e stevens 
jr 
stevens threw out the suit last year but the 8th circuit court 
in its may ruling reversed stevens and reassigned the case to 
clark with instructions to come up with a plan for transferring 
black students to the suburban schools 
the appeals court said the previous refusal of the suburban 
schools to admit the blacks raised questions about whether they 
were practicing unlawful racial bias 
in the appeal acted on today the suburban school officials said 
their districts have no history of racial bias and said it is 
unfair to use their refusal to admit students from another city as 
evidence of discrimination 
the appeals court is using sheer force to impose its values 
on public schools that have no record of racial bias the officials 
said 
the supreme court in 1974 struck down a detroitarea school 
desegregation plan that required students to be bused across ity 
boundaries the justices said such remedies are inappropriate 
unless all districts involved contributed to the segregation

the supreme court today refused to let any new 
york utility force customers through the rates they pay to 
subsidize its charitable contributions 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling by new yorks 
highest court that said allowing publicly regulated utilities to 
include such charitable giving in their rates violates customers 
rights 
lawyers for the new york telephone co and rochester gas and 
electric corp told the justices the state court ruling creates a 
revolutionary new federal right with alarming national 
implications 
about half the states and even some federal regulatory agencies 
deem reasonable levels of charitable contributions ordinary 
business expenses that may be built into a utility companys 
customer rates 
the new york public service commission which regulates utility 
rates in that state first allowed charitable giving to be included 
in the ratebase in 1970 
joseph cahill a resident of fishkill ny and a new york 
telephone customer challenged the commissions policy so did 
state attorney general robert abrams in a separate lawsuit against 
rochester gas and electric 
the suits were combined and a state trial judge ruled that 
policy allowing charitable contributions to be included in the 
ratebase violates cusomers freespeech rights 
the new york court of appeals upheld that ruling last may 
ratepayers are entitled to protection against forced financial 
support for causes and messages personally distasteful to them 
the state court said the utilities have not fulfilled their 
burden of justification for imposing on their ratepayers rather 
than on their shareholders the bill for their selected 
philanthropy 
the state court relied heavily on a 1977 supreme court ruling in 
which the justices barred unions from using mandatory fees 
collected from nonmembers they represent for anything unrelated to 
collective bargaining 
the 1977 ruling was one in a series of decisions in which the 
high court said the constitutions first amendment not only 
protects the right to speak and associate freely but also the right 
not to speak or associate 
documents submitted in the new york case appeared to disagree 
over just what charitable contributions were at issue 
lawyers for new york telephone said the company does not 
engage in political religious or ideological giving 
but the state courts ruling last may said new york telephone 
and rochester gas and electric had contributed to numerous 
charities including politically and religiously active 
organizations 
cahills lawyers said he is a lifelong roman catholic who 
objected among other things to charitable contributions made to 
organizations that advocate abortion rights 
in a friendofthecourt brief united ways of america urged 
the justices to reverse the state court ruling united ways said 
that 558 million of the 682 million in corporate contributions 
it received last year came from utility companies

the supreme court today refused to let new 
york prison authorities give short haircuts to newly arrived 
inmates belonging to a jamaicabased religion called rastafarians 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the 
haircut policy violates the inmates religious freedom 
rastafarians adherents of a jamaicabased religion founded on a 
belief that the late ethiopia emperor haile selassie is god have 
religious scruples against men cutting or combing their hair 
they wear their hair in ropelike strands known as dreadlocks 
at new york prisons all incoming inmates are required to get a 
short haircut and have an identification photograph made the 
photograph is to be used in the event of an escape 
after the photo is taken however inmates are free to grow 
their hair to whatever length they please 
rastafarian inmates challenged the haircut policy in 1979 and 
for nearly six years negotiated with prison officials in search of 
a settlement 
a federal judge in 1986 and in subsequent rulings barred 
prison authorities from enforcing the initial haircut policy the 
2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the haircut policy ban 
last may 
accepting the existence of reasonable security concerns we 
find there is an alternative that can accommodate both parties 
the appeals court said 
it noted that us district judge louis l stanton had found 
that pulling an inmates hair back in a ponytail while taking the 
identification photo would meet a prisons security needs 
prison officials had argued that stanton was wrong about that 
but the appeals court said the officials failed to establish that 
the accommodation here has more than a minimal effect on valid 
penological interests 
in the appeal acted on today new york prison authorities said 
the appeals court ruling conflicts with a pair of 1987 supreme 
court decisions on inmate rights 
in one the court gave states sweeping power to prevent inmates 
from corresponding with inmates in other prisons in the other the 
justices ruled that prison officials acted properly when forbidding 
some muslims from attending weekly prison worship services

an 11yearold boy who won and then lost a 
95 million award against the maker of an antinausea drug his 
mother took during pregnancy lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand a ruling that 
threw out sekou ealys legal victory over marion merrell dow inc 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
sekous mother sandra took the drug bendectin while pregnant 
and he was born with defects in his hands and arms 
sekou has three fingers on one hand and four on the other and 
no thumbs his arms are underdeveloped and locked at the elbows 
according to court papers sekou has undergone weekly 
psychiatric therapy to address his mental fixation that his parents 
cut off his fingers to punish him for being naughty 
bendectin was marketed between 1957 and 1983 by 
richardsonmerrell inc now marion merrell dow based in kansas 
city mo more than 30 million women used the drug 
the company stopped selling bendectin in 1983 although the 
federal drug administration never has rescinded approval of the 
drug 
after a federal court trial in the district of columbia where 
the ealys lived a jury awarded sekou 20 million in compensatory 
damages and 75 million in punitive damages 
us district judge june l green set aside the punitivedamages 
award but let stand the 20 million compensatorydamages award 
the us circuit court of appeals here overturned that award 
last march 
the appeals court ruled that the expert testimony used in an 
attempt to link bendectin to the birth defects was without 
scientific foundation 
it may well be that future scientific research will generate 
an adequate basis for an experts opinion that bendectin 
caused a plaintiffs birth defects the appeals court said 
until that day the existing body of published epidemiological 
studies all finding no significant statistical association between 
ingestion of bendectin and birth defects must be recognized as the 
measuring stick for the admissibility of expert testimony on this 
issue the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for sekou said the appeals 
courts treatment of testimony by expert witnesses conflicts with 
how nine other federal appeals courts have dealt with expert 
testimony 
the appeal argued that the appeals court at least should order a 
new trial rather than throw out the suit against the drug 
manufacturer

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its views of an appeal by black voters in a 
rural arkansas county who say the election system in party 
primaries and countywide general elections is racially biased 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before saying whether it will decide if the runoff election systems 
violates the voting rights act of 1965 lower courts said it does 
not 
the justice department response may take months 
under arkansas law a candidate for a political partys 
nomination or for a countywide office must receive a majority of 
the votes cast in a primary election to win a political partys 
nomination 
if no candidate wins an outright majority a runoff election is 
held two weeks later between the top two votegetters 
the justices were told that arkansas is one of 10 states 
employing such a system all of them in the south and all of them 
with a long history of purposeful racial vote dilution 
the other states were identified as alabama florida georgia 
louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina texas and 
oklahoma 
the runoff system as it operates in phillips county ark was 
challenged as illegal by black voters who say their voting power is 
being diluted 
their lawsuit also alleged that the runoff requirements were 
adopted and maintained for the purpose of blunting black voting 
power 
blacks comprise 52 percent of the population in phillips county 
located on the mississippi river but only 47 percent of the 
countys votingage residents are black 
no black candidate ever has received the democratic or 
republican nomination for or been elected to any countywide 
office in phillips county since the turn of the century 
in the two most recent election years four black candidates 
received the highest percentage of votes in their democratic 
primary races but were defeated in runoffs by white candidates who 
had trailed them in the first election 
by contrast no white candidate who has come out on top in a 
first primary without winning a majority of all votes has ever lost 
the ensuing runoff 
black voters who challenged the election system cited as major 
reasons for such results the lack of access to motor vehicles and 
telephones for many black residents 
only 9 percent of white households in phillips county have no 
vehicle available and 109 percent have no telephone the justices 
were told but 42 percent of black households have no vehicle and 
30 percent have no telephone 
a federal trial judge threw out the black voters suit ruling 
that they could not invoke the voting rights act because blacks 
comprise a majority of the countys population 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
reversed the trial judges ruling by a 21 vote and said the 
runoff system had violated the federal law in phillips county 
but the entire 8th circuit court last may voted 55 to uphold 
the trial judges ruling killing the suit

president felix houphouetboigny 
appeared bound for overwhelming victory today in the countrys 
first contested presidential election which the opposition said 
was stolen through massive fraud 
it was the first time a leader of one of africas oneparty 
states was being challenged at the polls since a wave of protests 
and rioting for democracy began sweeping subsaharan africa early 
this year 
with about onethird of the ballots counted by midday today 
interior ministry official claude regnier said houphouetboigny had 
captured about 85 percent of votes the count was being done at the 
ministry 
but the 85yearold presidents sole challenger 
socialistminded history professor laurent gbagbo said a computer 
count by his popular front gave gbagbo a lead of 51 percent to 
houphouetboignys 49 percent 
he called the election a masquerade of democracy and said 
his supporters were being rounded up and arrested 
the government denied the charges of fraud 
abidjan was tense but calm today with armed soldiers guarding 
the interior ministry gbagbos followers appeared to be awaiting 
the final results 
in the workingclass suburb of yopougon opposition militants 
reportedly barricaded a street in front of their party office and 
soldiers dismantled the barricade and broke down the office door 
but they went away without making any arrests 
gbagbo produced hundreds of ballots marked for houphouetboigny 
which he said had come from one of dozens of boxes stuffed to rig 
the elections 
his supporters said they had smashed ballot boxes to halt voting 
sunday at several polling stations they claimed boxes were stuffed 
with votes for houphouetboigny before the polling started 
in london prices of cocoa dropped as news spread that 
houphouetboigny would apparently retain power ivory coast is the 
worlds biggest cocoa producer and experts say its crop helps 
determine whether the world market remains in surplus 
gbagbo said the democratic party of houphouetboigny who has 
ruled since ivory coasts independence from france in 1960 also 
publicized voting stations that did not exist and set up balloting 
stations that were not advertised 
there were also reports of disorganization at several voting 
stations where ballot papers and electoral lists did not arrive or 
were delivered hours late 
interior minister leon konan koffi called the opposition 
accusations lies he told reporters gbagbos supporters destroyed 
ballot boxes to stop elections they knew they would lose 
konan koffi said the opposition forced nine voting stations in 
abidjan to shut gbagbo confirmed his party militants halted 
elections in 50 stations of one abidjan suburb alone and at 
numerous other places nationwide 
government officials first said preliminary results were 
expected sunday night but later said they were delayed by 
difficulties getting results from remote villages 
gbagbo said he would decide whether to accept the election 
results after they were announced but regardless he said the 
election was worth it 
nobody ever thought we would get multiparty democracy while 
houphouetboigny was in ivory coast he said it was time to 
put a stop to the system of there being just a single candidate 
legislative elections are scheduled next month some 26 
political parties have sprung up since houphouetboigny was forced 
to legalize political opposition after weeks of rioting led by 
students and joined by the urban poor

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
lawsuit against the medical director of a federal prison in indiana 
accused of deliberately neglecting the health needs of inmates 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the official 
may be sued by the heirs of a prisoner who died after an asthma 
attack 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that dr 
robert brutsche the medical director is not automatically immune 
from being sued over joseph jones death in 1975 
the appeals court said that by 1975 prison officials were on 
notice that depriving inmates of adequate health care was a 
violation of their rights even though there was no nationwide 
legal precedent on the issue then 
we believe that a failure to correct systemic deficiencies in 
the delivery of health care services at a prison violated clearly 
established law in 1975 the appeals court said a clear trend 
in the case law then showed a controlling precedent was merely 
a question of time the appeals court said 
jones died soon after he was admitted to the terre haute prison 
hospital with difficulty breathing robert degracias the prison 
doctor prescribed a drug over the telephone and ordered jones sent 
to a local civilian hospital 
jones was the fourth inmate at terre haute who died of medical 
causes during the first eight months of 1975 
after jones died brutsche ordered an investigation that led him 
to recommend improved medical care for inmates 
jones mother sued accusing brutsche and degracias of 
deliberate indifference to her sons health 
a federal judge refused to dismiss the suit ruling there were 
numerous questions to be answered about care of inmates in 
lifethreatening emergencies 
the 7th circuit court noted that in 1982 the supreme court held 
that public officials are shielded from suit unless they violate a 
clearly established right 
the appeals court said in brutsches case there were at least 
three federal appeals court rulings that indicated a clear 
consensus had been reached that a prison officials failure to 
remedy systemic deficiencies in medical services constituted 
deliberate indifference 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject 
brutsches appeal even though it said it disagrees with the 
appeals court ruling 
justice department lawyers said further examination of the case 
by lower courts could be helpful for example the government said 
brutsche should not be made a scapegoat if there is evidence the 
conditions at terre haute were caused by a scarcity of competent 
personnel 
the high court on oct 15 agreed to study a related issue 
surrounding immunity for public officials from such suits the 
issue in that case is whether the suits must be dismissed at the 
outset when the alleged official misconduct is based largely on a 
subjective interpretation of events by those doing the suing 
the case acted on today is brutsche vs clevelandperdue

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that the atlarge system used in norfolk va city council 
elections violates the rights of black voters 
a federal appeals court panel last aug 18 ordered the city to 
switch to a singledistrict election system that will remedy the 
vote dilution arising out of the atlarge election system 
the norfolk city council has seven members elected to staggered 
fouryear terms elections for three or four of the council seats 
are held every two years candidates with the most votes citywide 
win and do not need a majority of the votes cast 
a group of black voters and the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people sued in 1983 
contending that the atlarge system used since 1918 illegally 
blunted the political clout of black voters 
norfolk one of virginias largest cities is 35 percent black 
in population blacks also comprise 35 percent of the citys 
registered voters 
the city council did not have a black member until 1968 and 
since then has had one black member most years 
the naacp and black voters who sued said if city council members 
were elected from seven singlemember districts black voters would 
be in the majority in three of the seven districts 
the citys voting dispute reached the nations highest court 
once before and in 1986 was sent back to lower courts for more 
study 
us district judge j calvitt clarke jr in norfolk ruled in 
1988 that the atlarge election system did not violate the federal 
voting rights act but a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals reversed his ruling 
the panel by a 21 vote said the atlarge system gives black 
voters less opportunity than other members of the electorate to 
participate in the electoral process and to elect representatives 
of their choice 
the panel said those who sued do not seek proportional 
representation and the act does not require it 
but it said the lack of success blacks have had in winning more 
token representation on the city council show the existence of 
white bloc voting in norfolk 
the appeals court panel ordered clarke to block all future 
atlarge elections and to require the city to come up with a new 
election system in a reasonable specified time to be reviewed 
under voting rights act standards 
if the city fails to enact a legal plan clarke should 
prepare a singledistrict plan for the conduct of future 
elections the appeals court panel said 
the full 4th circuit court split 55 in refusing to review the 
threejudge panels decision 
the panels decision was held in abeyance pending todays action 
by the supreme court the panels ruling that the city elections 
system must change now will take effect 
in their appeal city officials said the august decision forcing 
a change is nothing more than a decision to require 
proportional representation 
if that ruling is correct the appeal said then all 
atlarge election systems are imperiled 
asked for its views the bush administration told the court to 
reject the citys appeal 
although the court of appeals analysis is not without flaws 
the courts errors either do not affect the outcome of the case 
orare too closely tied to its particular facts to be of general 
significance justice department lawyers said 
the case is norfolk vs collins 89989

a united nations conference on global warming 
opened today and a top un official warned that only radical 
changes can save the world from a climate disaster 
mostafa k tolba the head of the un environment program said 
the threat of global warming is potentially more catastrophic 
than any other threat in human history 
such warming could trigger famine by disrupting agriculture and 
coastal areas could be flooded if sea levels are raised by melting 
of glaciers and the greenland ice sheet 
scientists believe about half of global warming is caused by 
carbon dioxide gas from fossil fuel burning other greenhouse 
gases are methane nitrous oxide and chemicals called 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
the gases increase the atmospheres tendency to trap heat like 
a greenhouse 
nothing short of action which affects every individual can 
forestall global catastrophe tolba said nothing less than a 
complete change in attitudes and lifestyles will succeed 
the gathering brought together about 500 scientists from around 
the world who are to chart a comprehensive new program with 
proposals on how to counter global warming or the greenhouse 
effect 
the conference will wind up with a twoday meeting of about 80 
government ministers several heads of government including 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher and french prime 
minister michel rocard are to attend 
the united states still opposed to mandatory restrictions on 
emissions of the chemicals involved is represented by a 
lowerranking official john knauss head of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration 
the opening of the geneva conference coincided with a meeting of 
environment ministers of the 12nation european community to 
address carbon dioxide emission controls 
at the geneva session a final declaration on nov 7 will 
provide the basis for the first formal negotiations on an accord on 
fighting global warming the pact is to be ready for signing in 
mid1992 
tolba said the convention must spell out specific commitments to 
cut emissions but he said the industrialized nations which emit 
threefourths of all manmade greenhouse gases must act now and 
not wait for the agreement 
the longer we delay the worse the disaster will be for our 
children and for our childrens children he said 
curbing emissions will cost vast sums and will demand great 
changes in economic legal and institutional systems tolba said 
but he said the cost of inaction would be far greater 
developing nations he said would need more time funds and 
access to western technology to reduce emissions 
during the past two years more than 1000 scientists from 70 
countries have compiled a bulky report for the conference which 
list grim scenarios of what might happen unless action is taken to 
reduce global warming 
they predict that continuing on the current course would send 
global temperatures up 54 degrees fahrenheit by the end of the 
next century the fastest rise in 10000 years 
barring countermeasures global sea levels would rise by about 
two feet the report said in the next century rising sea levels 
could flood tens of thousands of miles of densely populated 
shorelines 
the warming trend would also disrupt agricultural production 
worldwide 
but the un food and agriculture administration in a position 
paper prepared for the geneva conference said the overall effect 
on global farming could actually be positive because of the opening 
up of arable lands toward the poles but in some vulnerable 
regions the effect may be very serious it added 
experts generally agree that the trend toward a warmer earth 
cannot be stopped but could be mitigated by a shifting to other 
forms of energy and stopping the destruction of forests around the 
world they agree much more research on the problem is needed

police fired warning shots over the 
heads of rioting students today the third day of violent protests 
against tighter state control over the countrys university 
teachers also angered that the university of zimbabwe has lost 
much of its autonomy under a 4dayold bill said they would mount 
their own peaceful demonstration on tuesday 
police said at least five students have been arrested including 
the president of the students representative council christopher 
giwa 
the students were taken in on friday after refusing to disperse 
in downtown harare they are to appear in court to face charges of 
breaching the peace 
since the latest round of antigovernment protests began 
thursday students have stormed the university smashed windows and 
set fire to gardens and trees classes have been boycotted and 
yearend examinations scheduled to begin this morning disrupted 
today riot police guarding university buildings fired warning 
shots to disperse students hurling bricks and stones elsewhere on 
campus police fired tear gas to breakup hostile student groups 
the students are protesting amendments to the university act 
passed by parliament on thursday the amendments give the 
stateappointed vice chancellor of the university sweeping 
disciplinary powers 
the bill also empowers the higher education minister to 
interfere in running the university 
it will become law if signed by president robert mugabe who is 
titular chancellor of the university and a critic of student 
demonstrators 
the amendments are clearly intended to bring the university 
under the direct political control of the government said tony 
reeler secretary of the 120member association of university 
teachers 
this current legislation will destroy the university he 
said 
in recent years the university has been a hub of government 
opposition 
while students supported mugabe at the time of independence 10 
years ago they have recently charged his leadership with 
corruption mismanagement and authoritarianism 
under stateofemergency regulations in october the government 
closed the university for six months following violent clashes with 
police 
more than 480 students in that antigovernment protest were 
arrested 
the emergency was lifted under extreme opposition pressure in 
july

the supreme court today refused to squelch the 
lawsuit of a tacoma wash woman who says she was raped after a 
policeman left her stranded in a highcrime area late at night 
the justices without comment left intact a ruling that will 
force a trial on the womans allegations against washington state 
trooper steven ostrander 
in a separate case the court refused to reinstate a 750000 
award won and then lost by a woman raped in a clevelandarea 
public transit system parking lot 
the tacoma womans 1985 civil rights suit contends ostrander 
violated her constitutional right by placing her in danger and 
failing to provide any protection 
in other action the court 
let stand a ruling that boosted a federal judges power to 
order predominantly white suburban schools to accept innercity 
black students 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by three 
kansas city mo suburban school districts facing such a 
desegregation order the case is an outgrowth of a longstanding 
court battle over desegregation of kansas citys public schools 
agreed to resolve a dispute over black lung benefits that may 
affect 650 million in claims by coal miners and their families 
the court said it will decide how difficult it should be for 
mining companies to challenge claims by as many as 3500 miners 
allowed a state to automatically impose longer sentences for 
criminals who used guns 
the court without comment let stand a montana law used to add 
10 years to the 30year prison sentence given a man who brandished 
a gun during a pizza shop robbery 
in a separate case the court refused to let police in 
massachusetts stop and search someone solely because that person 
reportedly was carrying a handgun in public 
let stand a ruling that the atlarge system used in norfolk 
va city council elections violates the rights of black voters 
a federal appeals court panel last aug 18 ordered the city to 
switch to a singledistrict election system that will remedy the 
vote dilution arising out of the atlarge election system 
refused to kill a civil rights lawsuit against a texas city 
that cracked down on cruising teenagers five years ago 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that forces 
desoto texas and nine members of its police department to defend 
themselves at trial against allegations of illegal arrests 
in the tacoma rape case at about 230 am on sept 23 1984 
ostrander stopped a car driven by robert bell because its 
headlights were on highbeam 
after speaking to bell ostrander arrested him on 
drunkendriving charges and called for a tow truck to impound the 
car 
the tacoma woman claims ostrander after ordering her out of the 
car simply got into his patrol car and drove away he claims he 
offered to call a friend or relative who could give her a ride 
home but that she declined his offer 
bells car had been stopped in the parkland area of pierce 
county south of tacoma and about five miles from the womans home 
court records indicate the area has the highest violentcrime rate 
in the county outside of tacoma 
the temperature was 50 degrees and the woman as wearing only a 
blouse and jeans she says that after walking a halfblock toward 
her home and having turned down several ride offers from strangers 
she accepted one from an unknown man 
the womans suit says the driver took her to a secluded area and 
raped her her lawyers said the rape impregnated her and resulted 
in the birth of a child 
a federal judge dismissed the suit but a threejudge panel of 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals voting 21 reinstated it 
the woman has raised a genuine issue of fact tending to show 
that trooper ostrander acted with deliberate indifference to her 
interest in personal security under the 14th amendment the 
appeals court panel said 
the appeals court panel discounted the fact that a 24hour gas 
station and a 24hour convenience store both welllighted were 
located within two blocks of where ostrander left the woman 
it is for the trier of fact to determine whether a reasonable 
person should have regarded a gas station or a convenience store 
located in a highcrime neighborhood as some kind of safe haven 
where she would have been given assistance or permitted to stay 
until daybreak before walking five miles home the appeals court 
said 
the womans suit said she could not call her parents for help 
because both are disabled 
in the cleveland case the court without comment let stand a 
ruling that overturned the award against the transit system 
the cleveland woman was attacked the evening of jan 15 1985 
after getting off a train at a station in east cleveland 
her assailant later confessed to raping her as well as another 
woman at the same station the previous night 
the woman sued the greater cleveland regional transit authority 
for negligence she said the public agency failed to provide 
adequate security for passengers particularly in light of the rape 
the previous night 
a state court jury awarded her 750000 after also hearing 
evidence that numerous violent crimes were committed at the station 
from 1975 to 1985 
a state appeals court threw out the award last year 
the appeals court relied on an ohio supreme court ruling that 
police may not be sued for failing to protect the public against 
crimes unless it can be shown they owed a special duty of 
care to a crime victim 
the appeals court said it saw no difference between a regional 
transit agency and a city police department 
 
the cases are ostrander vs wood 891409 and shelton vs 
greater cleveland regional transit authority 90430

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
said today the latest mission to baghdad by a soviet envoy 
indicated there were some shifts in the position of iraqs saddam 
hussein 
gorbachev at a news conference following talks with french 
president francois mitterrand said he had received a telegram from 
the envoy yevgeny primakov who met sunday with saddam but he did 
not elaborate 
primakov traveled on to saudi arabia for meetings today with 
king fahd 
at the news conference gorbachev said the time was right for 
arab nations to embark on a new initiative to resolve the crisis 
possibly under saudi arabian leadership 
it seems to me that the iraqis could be ready for this he 
said if we were to have an interarab meeting this would be the 
quickest way to a settlement 
gorbachev also urged tougher sanctions against iraq and 
suggested that saddam is beginning to yield to economic pressure 
under the pressure of sanctions which have to be stepped up 
of course some signs are emerging that iraqs leadership may be 
heeding the will of the united nations he said 
gorbachev stressed the importance of maintaining a united front 
against iraq if saddam is counting on a split in the alliance 
against him he is building his policy on a mistake the soviet 
president said 
we must not permit the iraqi regime to hope there will be a 
division a weakening of positions he said 
gorbachev said he hoped the crisis which was set off by iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait could be solved without war 
i think its unacceptable to have a military solution 
gorbachev said but he insisted that iraq comply with united 
nations calls to free foreign hostages and withdraw from kuwait 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who has accompanied 
gorbachev on the trip had said on sunday night that primakovs 
visit to baghdad did not appear to have been fruitful 
for the moment there are not many reasons for optimism 
regarding primakovs talks with saddam the soviet minister said 
but he added that moscow still held out hope for a negotiated 
settlement 
mitterrand also at the news conference said french and soviet 
positions on the gulf were in harmony 
we will defend the the same principles and the same positions 
in the framework of the security council he said 
frances foreign ministry said today that french diplomats would 
leave their besieged embassy in kuwait and return to paris along 
with about 300 freed french hostages 
after the invasion iraq ordered embassies in kuwait to close 
down and move their diplomats to baghdad a few foreign missions in 
kuwait including that of the united states are still holding out 
i express the joy of all the french people to those coming 
home mitterrand said but we will rejoice fully only when the 
other hostages can return to their own countries 
mitterrand and gorbachev spoke to reporters after signing a 
cooperation agreement pledging french assistance as the soviet 
union shifts to a market economy 
france also promised to help moscow arrange accords with the 
12nation european community as a step toward creation of a 
paneuropean confederation 
the presidents signed the accord at the chateau of rambouillet 
33 miles southwest of paris following private talks on the gulf 
and other issues 
gorbachev arrived sunday evening after a threeday visit to 
spain where he secured 15 billion in guaranteed loans to help 
ease the transition away from a centralized economy

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
civil rights lawsuit against a texas city that cracked down on 
cruising teenagers five years ago 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that forces 
desoto texas and nine members of its police department to defend 
themselves at trial against allegations of illegal arrests 
in the early 1980s desotos hampton road became a popular 
cruising spot on weekend and summer nights for teenagers from 
tarrant dallas and ellis counties on those nights hundreds of 
vehicles would drive up and down the road and hundreds of teens 
would congregate in business parking lots 
there was some vandalism but the biggest problem was litter 
evictions warnings by police distribution of leaflets and 
speeches about trespass laws had little effect 
on the night of may 3 1985 desoto police accompanied by dallas 
county sheriffs deputies and constables descended on several 
parking lots and arrested about 50 people 
six arrested teens sued the city and nine police department 
members in federal court the suit seeking monetary damages 
alleged the teens civil rights had been violated by illegal police 
arrests 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that the city and its 
police department were entitled to a qualified immunity from being 
sued but the 5th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the suit 
last may 
in a biting opinion the appeals court said the case should 
proceed to trial 
no doubt some of the arrestees had received prior warnings and 
deserved little sympathy for what happened to them that evening 
the appeals court said the same cannot be said for everyone 
take for example the girls on the grand prairie softball team 
the appeals court noted that four high school girls from grand 
prairie in desoto for the first time to play in a softball 
tournament had pulled into a parking lot two minutes before the 
police sweep began 
the girls who cooperated at all times with police and other 
authorities were arrested handcuffed and forced to spend the 
night in jail 
it did not stop there the 5th circuit court wrote the 
trespass charges were taken up by the criminal district attorney 
of dallas county to prove how resolute that office is against the 
forces of crime these girls were indicted and prosecuted 
vigorously in criminal court 
when matters finally reached the hands of sensible people the 
jurors the girls were acquitted the appeals court said after 
three trials ended in acquittals the remaining indictments were 
dismissed 
two of those girls kathy kuehler and lisa blair bishop are 
among the six who sued the others who sued are douglas morgan 
kerry curby troy hall and jeffrey escue 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for desoto argued that the 
city and police should be immune from being sued over events 
stemming from the cruising crackdown 
the case is desoto vs morgan 90393

few people face greater stigma than a pregnant 
woman burdened by drug addiction but as midwest regional reporter 
sharon cohen finds in the second of a threepart series 
surviving year one few drug addicts get less help in battling 
their habits 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wanda kaigler is having her seventh baby and this 
time she has a new goal in life to become a mother again and a 
drug addict no more 
she wants to start over to break free of the crack heroin 
pills and weed that consumed her for 21 years and robbed her of 
everything precious her health her pride even her six children 
all i ever wanted was to get married and have kids and take 
care of them she says quietly i got married i got kids he 
died the kids got taken and im a drug addict 
shes working to change that at the eleonore hutzel recovery 
center one of a few comprehensive programs in the nation providing 
medical care counseling and housing for pregnant and other 
addicted women 
i know that if i can keep drugs out of my system i can keep 
the baby she says theres still a chance i can get my kids 
back maybe 
i want to give up on myself but i know i cant she adds 
tearfully i want to be drug free and i know i can do it 
sometimes i dont know how to go about it 
for most pregnant addicts in america the problem isnt how but 
where public drug treatment programs in short supply nationwide 
are rarer still for these women experts say traditionally most 
are designed for men 
its three strikes against you said ruth hudicek head of 
chrysalis house a residential substance abuse program in maryland 
the first is youre an addict the second strike is youre a 
female if a female addict happens to be pregnant in the eyes of 
most of the country youre at the bottom of the heap 
in fact some proecutors citing concerns for the children 
have charged pregnant drug users with crimes sometimes jailing 
them 
since 1987 more than 50 criminal cases have been filed against 
women for drug abuse during pregnancy about 80 percent of them 
minorities the american civil liberties union says 
civil libertarians argue that this drives addicts away from 
prenatal care 
prosecutors are telling them to get clean or be arrested and 
theyll take away their kids said the aclus isabelle pinzler 
there arent the places for drug treatment and the places that 
exist frequently wont take them 
it forces them to make a sophies choice either getting 
healthy or abandoning the child in foster care or a dysfunctional 
family from which they themselves came said her colleague lynn 
paltrow 
more than 5 million women of childbearing age use illegal drugs 
including more than 1 million who take cocaine the national 
institute on drug abuse said in 1988 up to 375000 babies may be 
exposed to drugs annually according to the national association 
for perinatal addiction research and education 
while those numbers indicate the scope of a problem exacerbated 
by the crack epidemic others suggest glaring inadequacies in 
treatment consider 
some 280000 pregnant women nationwide needed drug treatment 
yet less than 30000 received care according to a 1990 survey by 
the national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors 
twothirds of 18 bigcity hospitals surveyed last year by a 
us house committee had no place to send pregnant women for drug 
treatment 
a new york study found 54 percent of treatment programs 
excluded expectant women 87 percent rejected pregnant medicaid 
recipients addicted to crack 
they think there will be a terrible malpractice problem 
because of potential pregnancy complications speculates dr wendy 
chavkin the author and an associate professor at the columbia 
school of public health 
all of this is especially frustrating experts say because 
pregnancy often motivates women to seek help 
if they dont find a program out there chances are weve lost 
them mrs hudicek said some die some end up in hospital 
emergency rooms giving birth to crackaddicted babies 
part of the american way is motherhood and apple pie she 
added the stigma that women face admitting theyre addicted 
to drugs is incredible 
cynthia a chrysalis house resident and new mother knows the 
feeling 
you already have low selfesteem said the recovering 
cocaineheroin addict who asked that her last name not be used 
finally you do humble yourself to say i have a problem and 
theres a bunch of excuses they say we cant help you now 
come back in 30 days you may die you may get incarcerated 
or you may get sick cocaine doctors say increases the risk of 
premature delivery and lifethreatening hemorrhages and can cause 
physical and neurological damage to babies 
pregnant addicts often ignore their health one michigan woman 
said it was easier to walk four houses to buy crack than take a bus 
four miles for prenatal care others sell furniture food stamps 
even themselves for drugs 
about 180 addicts are in hutzels 21yearold program about 
half are pregnant and 50 percent of those women take methadone to 
prevent miscarriages 
hutzel provides counseling child care lunch transportation 
and prenatal care the residential recovery program houses women 
and their young children in a former convent 
many have long histories of addiction wanda kaigler now 37 
says her drug use began at age 16 she nearly died six years ago 
from bad heroin and though she survived and even quit once her 
habit has stripped her bare 
it makes you lose your friends your family your furniture 
your home your respect for yourself she said you feel 
terrible afterwards as long as you do it you feel good 
a widow for three years miss kaigler also lost her six 
children ages 2 to 17 when they were removed by authorities she 
wants them back proudly noting two are honors students 
i love my kids she said they dont think so sometimes 
i dont think so 
kelly barringtons concern for her baby coupled with the threat 
of losing her 9yearold daughter led her to hutzel 
god knew the only way i was going to stop is if i got 
pregnant said miss barrington a drug abuser for 15 of her 31 
years who switched to crack from heroin after her veins collapsed 
i couldnt live with the fact that i hurt an innocent baby 
she too had hit bottom she was jailed briefly lost 
everything and was so desperate shed drag her daughter to dope 
houses explaining she was sick and that was the medicine i 
needed 
her daughter responded by repeatedly breaking her crack pipes 
i try to forgive myself and say i was a sick person said 
miss barrington her purse adorned with badges for every month she 
has been drugfree i feel great that god gave me another chance 
to turn things around

eighty percent to 85 percent of the women complete hutzels 
pregnancy program which serves about 250 females a year about a 
quarter continue in recovery but more than half of those who

a massachusetts judge this month threw out an indictment

if thats not child abuse i dont know what is said charles 
condon a south carolina solicitor who helps run a program in which 
pregnant users must enroll in treatment or risk arrest 
we dont want them to be prosecuted he said but you 
really have to give them consequences for their behavior

noncommunist parties won elections in 
georgia on a platform calling for independence from the soviet 
union private ownership of land and a capitalist economy 
officials said monday 
we are certainly going to have a majority in parliament 
said zviad gamsakhurdia leader of the victorious round tablefree 
georgia bloc of political parties 
with about 90 percent of the regions reporting gamsakhurdia 
claimed victory in about 70 percent 
he protested what he called gross violations of the election 
law and said communist authorities terrorized the nongeorgian 
population along the borders of the mountainous southern 
republic which is dotted with pockets of azerbaijani and other 
ethnic groups 
a member of the central election commission alexander kobalia 
said that preliminary results showed a slightly less sweeping 
victory for gamsakhurdias round table with the bloc winning about 
60 percent of the vote versus 30 percent for the communist party 
the final results will be ready on wednesday and a runoff will 
be held for close races on nov 11 he said 
no date has been set yet for convening the georgian supreme 
soviet legislature which is expected to declare independence from 
the soviet union 
among the 15 soviet republics all but kirgizia have declared 
some form of sovereignty or independence 
gamsakhurdia said he was unable to specify what his first 
proposal would be in parliament i cant decide that alone 
said gamsakhurdia an imposing 51yearold with a history of 
arrests and opposition to communist rule dating back to the 1950s 
another round table spokesman georgi makaridze said the 
victory would translate into about 120 seats in the 250member 
supreme soviet along with other noncommunist parties we will 
have a working majority in parliament makaridze said 
in a weekend interview gamsakhurdia predicted that georgias 
transition to independence would take about two years and that the 
republic would maintain extensive economic relations with the 
soviet union it also seemed likely that georgia would rely on the 
soviet union in national security matters 
about 35 parties most grouped by coalition took part in 
sundays election the first true multiparty vote in soviet 
history 
noncommunists have won elections in several cities and 
republics elsewhere in the soviet union but the georgian balloting 
was the first in which formal parties created under new soviet 
laws were listed on the ballot 
some politicians boycotted the election claiming it was not 
democratic one of them the leader of the national democratic 
party gia chanturia was shot in the arm friday as he left a 
political meeting 
two national democratic party members gia kobakhedze and irakli 
tsereteli spoke on georgian television and accused gamsakhurdia of 
organizing the shooting on orders from soviet authorities 
gamsakhurdia denied responsibility for the shooting and accused 
authorities in an interview sunday of trying to sabotage the 
election by not telling people where to vote 
under a complicated election system each voter was given two 
ballots one listing individual candidates and the other listing 
political parties and blocs 
half the members of the legislature were to be chosen from the 
lists of individual candidates to represent various districts the 
rest were to be chosen at large in proportion to the number of 
votes cast for each party or bloc throughout georgia 
under the republics election law a party must get at least 4 
percent of the republicwide vote to gain representation in the 
legislature that was a provision designed to encourage coalitions 
and large parties and to discourage splintering into small 
factions

the harsh cold of a chicago winter is bad enough 
but seeing the sun go down before you even get off work makes it 
worse the hour time zone lobby says its found a way to make 
winter a little brighter 
the solution is splitting the wide central standard time zone in 
half and moving up the clock effectively delaying sunset by 
half an hour in chicago and the rest of the zones eastern portion 
says ken peterson the groups leader 
chicago hasnt recognized that its at a severe 
disadvantage said peterson a 49yearold architect from the 
suburb of forest park 
the sun sets an hour earlier for chicagoans on the eastern edge 
of the zone than for residents of bismarck nd at the western 
edge 
combine that with the shorter days of winter and the end of 
daylightsavings time and chicagoans dont need sunglasses after 
work 
it all goes back to why do people hate chicago in the 
winter peterson said we hate it because its dark when we go 
home 
rush hour is bad enough but when its dark its really bad 
then when you add sleet snow and hail its a real downer 
under the lobbying groups plan when its 5 pm in bismarck 
it would already be 530 pm in chicago and workers would have had 
a chance to see the sun after leaving the office 
the group says that extra dose of sunlight might be enough to 
help cure winter doldrums 
the group placed an ad in a newspaper this week asking for 
public feedback on their proposal 
peterson who began organizing the group this month knows some 
might scoff at his solution but hes standing by his principles 
people can label me a loony and the idea may go nowhere he 
said but people have a right to know they can have more sunlight 
in the afternoon

the preacher wears jeans and a western 
shirt the worshipers sit on bar stools the offering plate is a 
cowboy hat 
its the nashville cowboy church which holds services in a 
hotel lounge 
harry yates 47 the ministerfounder of the church says 
cowboys attended church services in saloons so since late 
september hes been preaching every sunday in the hotel lounge 
weve been called a few names here and there about meeting in 
the bar and dressing the way we do yates said i seem to 
remember that jesus was called a wine bibber i think were in good 
company were supposed to preach the gospel everywhere 
yates clerical garb for the nondenominational service is 
jeans western shirt bolo tie and cowboy hat the collection 
plate 
were not doctrinal and i just preach a short message 15 or 
20 minutes he said 
yates ordained in the independent assemblies of god doesnt 
rail against drinking and carousing and the like 
we dont preach against things we just preach the gospel of 
jesus christ 
a couple of guitar players supply the music 
when services are over worshipers get 2 off the price of 
brunch at the hotel restaurant its an incentive yates said 
attendance has averaged more than 30 even though the church is 
just getting started roughly half are tourists many of whom spent 
the night before listening to cryinyourbeer country music at the 
grand ole opry three miles down the road 
tourists come to town and dont bring suits and ties yates 
said at our services you can dress any way you like were 
trying to take away excuses for not going to church 
bob darmos a manager for a nashville trash company has been 
attending the church regularly 
i was skeptical at first going to a saloon and being so 
casual but you can relax be yourself and worship it puts you in 
the right frame of mind 
i can go in a shirt and jeans and no one looks down his nose 
at me he said the pastor is dressed the same way i am there 
are no false airs

voters could turn this tranquil 
capital into the nations seventhlargest city if they approve a 
plan to merge with the county 
if approved nov 6 by county voters the proposal would create a 
sprawling 1000square mile city with a population estimated at 
104 million slightly more populous than dallas and a shade less 
than san diego 
the nations 10 largest cities would be new york los angeles 
chicago houston philadelphia san diego sacramento dallas 
detroit and san antonio sacramento county which includes the 
city has grown by 32 percent during the past decade from a 
population of 786000 in 1980 to 104 million this year the city 
alone has about 350000 residents 
but while many here relish the thought of putting this city once 
known largely for its politicians and hot summers on the map and 
in top10 lists they disagree sharply over the mergers economic 
merits 
consolidation has been rejected twice by sacramento county 
voters most recently in 1974 surveys this time show opinion 
closely divided 
several other cities have merged with counties including 
portland ore nashville tenn and minneapolis modernday san 
francisco is the product of merger accomplished in 1856 
proponents including environmental business and 
goodgovernment groups say the merger would allow the county to 
get a handle on runaway growth and development and make possible 
more efficient centralized decisionmaking 
the idea behind it is to create a more efficient provider of 
services said paul hahn deputy executive director of a local 
government commission appointed two years ago to study the issue 
right now there is a lot of duplication of effort two 
police departments two public works departments a police and 
sheriffs department they dont always coordinate with each 
other he said 
foes of the plan include independent developers and those who 
have led efforts in recent years to incorporate new cities in 
fastgrowing sacramento county 
sacramento city councilman tom chinn argues that the plan 
would add another 100 politicians to the county and probably 
would lead to higher taxes 
creating a new city would force the removal of about 125 
california highway patrol officers from area roads he said 
highway officers are charged by law with patrolling state and 
county highways but not city streets 
the merger would combine fire law enforcement and planning 
agencies and create a new 12member council of supervisors 11 
members elected by district plus the mayor 
twenty local town councils also would be created each with five 
elected members with landuse powers over local projects 
exempted from the new government would be three of the countys 
four current incorporated cities folsom with 26000 people galt 
with 7500 and isleton with 925 
a streamlined merger would save about 20 million annually the 
countys current budget is about 1 billion the citys is about a 
third of that 
hahn citing a hired consultants report said the merger could 
result in the loss of about 400 of 7000 fulltime citycounty 
positions but the losses would occur through attritionnot by 
layoffs during the first two to three years he said

the two islands

the only means off the two islands people have had to take one 
ferry for the mile trip to ocracoke island then another 30 miles 
to the mainland the complete trip takes about 3 hours 
some of those who rushed to the ocracokebound ferries did not 
realize they did not go straight to the mainland 
how can we get to the governor about this dorothy l salmon 
of greensboro they should have told us on hatteras we were going 
to be here all night theres diabetics out there with no sweets 
theres babies with no blankets 
robert ashwell a visitor from virginia was disgusted that so 
many cars were allowed onto ocracoke considering the limited 
capacity of the ferries 
it doesnt take upperlevel math to figure this out he 
said 
generators were hooked up sunday on hatteras providing limited 
electricity to three island towns the accident also knocked out 
telephone service 
officials encouraged those waiting in line to return to the 
hatteras shelter which has power from a generator hot food and 
red cross workers 
about 1000 hatteras residents held a meeting sunday one 
speaker was frustrated by vacationers wanting precious gasoline to 
run fourwheeldrive vehicles on the beach his request that 
tourists get off the island was met with applause 
ted s midgett coowner of the midgett bros service station in 
hatteras village said tourists were limited to 10 worth of 
gasoline at his pumps still he expected to run out shortly and 
did not know when or how his next shipment would arrive 
residents of the tourismdependent islands also worried about 
the exodus 
r stewart couch general manager of hatteras realty said 
residents really wanted the tourists gone only until things were 
back to normal we need to get our house in order he said 
then we will invite them back

the potatolike yucca that is a staple of cuban diets 
they often move in and out of mainstream american life and 
personal lives that emphasize their native culture they usually 
describe themselves as patriotic toward both cuba and the united 
states 
state sen lincoln diazbalart 36 spends much of his day

diazbalart says very few cubans would move back to cuba 
permanently after three decades here however many will be 
involved in a postcastro cuba 
theres going to be a lot of duality suarez says with cuba 
only 90 miles from floridas southern tip there will be people 
with homes in both places investments in both places trade 
tourism a lot of people are going to feel very comfortable here 
but also want to spend part of the time there 
castro has vowed to maintain his system in cuba but excitement 
over his potential downfall is as high here as perhaps anytime

president bush is expected in germany 
sometime before nov 19 but plans for a visit by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev are still up in the air the government said 
monday 
government spokesman norbert schaefer said it had originally 
been assumed that gorbachev would visit germany nov 46 
he said however there is still no confirmation by the soviet 
side 
carrying out complex plans for a gorbachev visit could be 
difficult at this late date but there were no indications the trip 
might be called off 
schaefer said bush is expected in germany sometime before the 
nov 1921 conference on security and cooperation in europe which 
is to be held in paris 
schaefer said it would be a short private visit and would 
likely take place at chancellor helmut kohls home in oggersheim 
and not in bonn

sailors aboard us ships and submarines in 
the persian gulf are shooting for college credits in the midst of 
the military standoff poring over textbooks and videotapes in the 
middle of the night while keeping an eye on iraq 
nearly 200 combatready officers and sailors aboard at least 
five surface ships and several submarines are enrolled in courses 
ranging from english and economics to physics and psychology 
for most its their first college experience 
sailors have special work areas aboard the ships where they 
operate computer videos they can use for course tutors for 
homework assignments with feedback and for quizzes to test 
comprehension 
textbooks and study guides are used too optional materials 
include audiocassettes and anthologies 
the key thing is that when there are fairly stressful 
operational kinds of requirements such as the gulf where the 
available free time is likely to be limited to bits and pieces 
throughout the day it works very well said bruce wilburn 
president of middlesex research center which developed the 
software for the program 
we find that the most popular time to study is from midnight 
to 4 am he said they all stand watches and that is the 
watch with the least going on 
college credits can be earned at george washington university in 
the nations capital and the university of oklahoma in norman 
okla which helped develop the curriculum along with coastline 
community college in california 
wilburn said the program has produced outstanding results in 
other ombatready situations and expectations are high for the 
sailors in the gulf 
george washington university professor michael bradley who 
helped develop the economics course said i think on the average 
these people are more motivated because they are self selected 
they only take this because they want to whereas a typical 
college freshman takes it because its required or parents told them 
they had to take economics 
bradley said the materials are similar to those used in regular 
classes with the exception that these are just a little bit more 
real world oriented 
for example bradley said an economics video on supply and 
demand may include interviews with farmers or others as 
illustrations 
classes aboard ship begin when the sailors leave port with most 
ships deployed for sixmonth intervals navy personnel are able to 
take classes for two semesters 
on submarines when the hatch closes the class starts and when 
they open the hatches the sailors should be done said wilburn 
fifty percent of those taking telecourses are sailors ages 19 to 
20 who have been in the navy for one to two years the other 50 
percent primarily are career navy officers and upperlevel enlisted 
men 
the annenbergcpb program created by the corporation for public 
broadcasting with a gift in 1981 from the annenberg school of 
communications has five telecourses used by the navy they are 
economics ua the new literacy the write course mechanical 
universe and planet earth 
other groups offer about 25 other college courses including 
english mathematics including trigonometry precalculus and 
calculus physics geography political science spanish 
economics business and history psychology is the most popular 
course said wilburn 
the sailors pay for the books while the navy provides the 
equipment and software and pays the school fees that range from 
under 200 per semester to as much as 500 
when the program first began wilburn said the completion rate 
was around 50 percent officials have since tightened eligibility 
requirements and now estimate the courses have an 81 percent 
completion rate 
the average grade is c plus he said 
these courses are not easy and require a lot of time and 
effort to complete the key to their success has been the 
commitment of each ships highest officers to the value of a 
college education for his personnel said annenberg director mara 
mayor 
since 1987 more than 4000 enlisted us naval personnel on as 
many as 70 surface ships aircraft carriers and submarines have 
enrolled in telecourses courses currently are available on more 
than 220 us navy ship deployments out of four atlantic coast 
ports including norfolk va charleston sc groton conn and 
kings bay ga

no ones betting the farm on 
republican rep arlan stangelands political career not after the 
budget problems in washington and the questions about his 
latenight phone calls to a virginia woman 
stangeland a burly 60yearold exfarmer is asking voters for 
a seventh full term against a backdrop of scandal antiincumbent 
fervor depressionera grain prices and shrinking federal farm 
subsidies 
but the gop congressman has been a study in resilience and his 
challenger accountant collin peterson is short on money disliked 
by many in his own democratic party and has lost to stangeland 
twice before 
this is a race that you wont know the outcome until the votes 
are counted stangeland said 
polls show the race is a dead heat even though stangeland won 
reelection two years ago by a reasonably comfortable majority 55 
percent 
that was before jokes about stangeland started making the rounds 
of 7th district coffee shops 
the st cloud times reported in january that stangeland used his 
congressional credit card to pay for 428 longdistance calls to and 
from a virginia womans home some of the calls were made early in 
the morning and late at night 
some people took to calling stangeland adam the virginia 
womans first name is eve 
stangeland a married father of seven who campaigns as a 
protector of family values denied any impropriety 
but democratic leaders filed a complaint with the house ethics 
committee and the issue dogs the campaign 
and now stangeland has an added worry voters turned off by the 
states gubernatorial campaign may stay away from the polls 
republican jon grunseth was running neck and neck with gov rudy 
perpich until allegations surfaced that he swam nude with some 
teenage girls nine years ago grunseth dropped out of the race on 
sunday and the state gop is in a tumult about picking a successor 
to challenge perpich 
a light voter turnout will hurt stangeland said 
peterson 46 says he has no plans to raise the issue of 
stangelands latenight phone calls he has problems of his own 
stemming from his previous races for stangelands seat 
peterson lost the 1986 election by 121 votes but proclaimed 
himself congressmanelect demanded a recount prepared to open a 
temporary office in washington and went through freshman 
orientation 
after the sixweek recount was completed stangelands victory 
stood 
peterson irked his party again in 1988 when he announced he 
would challenge the endorsed candidate 
you dont run three times without causing some problems 
peterson said somebodys always going to be unhappy with you 
for 13 years stangeland has had solid support from area 
farmers who have made the fertile red river valley into one of the 
most prosperous agricultural regions in the country 
but peterson has pounded away at stangelands poor environmental 
record and hopes to take advantage of farm angst over depressed 
wheat prices and the congressional budget cuts 
the deficitreduction package assembled by congress reduces farm 
spending by 25 percent over the next five years the price of wheat 
already is down a dollar a bushel this fall while the black red 
river valley soil is bone dry after three years of drought 
peterson favors a less markeoriented farm policy that would 
count on increased export subsidies and higher price supports 
stangeland has devoted much of his legislative energy to 
protecting the governments sugar and dairy programs and he hopes 
to retain strong support from farmers despite the coming cutbacks 
in the farm payments

democrat ron twilegar can thank his gop 
rival for helping reintroduce abortion as an issue in idahos 
sleepy us senate race 
twilegar the underdog in the race began running ads critical 
of rep larry craigs opposition to abortion after the congressman 
gave a puzzling response in a debate two weeks ago 
craig seemed to change his position when asked if he would ask 
his wife suzanne to carry a pregnancy to term if it resulted from 
rape or incest even if she wanted to have an abortion 
that would be a very very tough choice craig replied i 
have said this is a personal issue but i will tell you my wife 
is my wife but she is also an individual and i have never blocked 
her decisions or her right to make decisions i think that is very 
important for her and her ability to handle it 
twilegar who entered the race to give voters a prochoice 
option applauded craig for what he called a change of his mind 
for the better 
so how about it congressman craig twilegar asked is 
suzanne craig the only woman in america who gets a choice 
right to life leaders expressed immediate alarm at craigs 
comments wanting to know what in the world hes talking about 
and craig quickly initiated damage control 
three telephone conversations between washington and idaho 
convinced antiabortion leaders to issue a statement reaffirming 
their support for craig 
the congressman blamed headline writers for the controversy 
and refused to elaborate on a statement saying he had not changed 
his position 
craig and twilegar are vying for the senate seat being vacated 
by gop sen james mcclure who is retiring 
the debate flap prompted twilegar to start airing tv ads 
stressing the congressmans position on abortion 
we didnt put abortion back into the news and the voters 
minds said twilegar campaign manager richard callow 
congressman craig did he made them think and were reminding 
them that they do 
twilegars ad accuses craig of wanting to return american women 
to the days of illegal lifethreatening backalley abortions it 
shows a woman walking toward an alley door followed by a conveyor 
belt of coat hangers 
however it appears the ad may have generated more opposition 
than support for twilegar among idaho voters 
abortion put idaho in the national spotlight last march when 
state lawmakers approved what would have been the nations most 
restrictive state abortion law the measure was vetoed by 
democratic gov cecil andrus 
within a few weeks the issue had cooled and abortion became a 
relatively minor factor in the 1990 campaign 
twilegars abortion ad was among several his campaign had 
completed just prior to the debate but he hadnt decided which ones 
the cashshort campaign would put on the air 
congressman craigs debate performance made our decision very 
easy callow said what were concentrating on is the 
extremism well let the force of craigs denial that he has 
changed his mind serve as the power for our ad

a senior saudi envoys visit to iran 
indicates tehran and riyadh may be close to reestablishing ties 
cut when hundreds of iranian pilgrims were slain in mecca in 1988 
tehran sources said monday 
the saudi deputy foreign ministers arrival friday in the first 
saudi official visit since ties were severed caps weeks of efforts 
by riyad to narrow the rift with iran the sources said 
the saudis cut their ties with iran in the closing stages of the 
198088 iraniraq war in which they bankrolled baghdads war 
effort 
now they are in a confrontation with baghdad over iraqs 
invasion of kuwait the invasion aug 2 has accelerated efforts by 
both saudi and iranian moderates to end the rift 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani wants to end his countrys 
isolation by improving ties the west and his arab neighbors his 
hardline opponents oppose that but lately have been unable to 
change rafsanjanis policies 
riyadh seeking to cement the coalition against iraq has in 
recent weeks been wooing iran urging it to tone down its 
antisaudi rhetoric 
last month iran resumed ties with britain after an 18month 
break despite objections by the antiwestern hardliners 
irans state radio and television run by rafsanjanis brother 
mohammed hashemi have given the visit of the saudi envoy 
abdulrahman mansuri little coverage 
but the farsilanguage jomhuri islami daily close to the 
hardline opposition asked monday what is saudi arabias 
purpose in its recent move and what is it after 
jomhuri islamis commentary was carried by irans official 
islamic republic news agency and was monitored in nicosia 
the daily stressed riyadh would have to meet two conditions 
before a resumption of diplomatic relations remove the 
usdominated multinational force and allow iranian pilgrims to 
stage political rallies at moslem shrines in saudi arabia 
the saudis requested the multinational force to defend the 
kingdom after iraq invaded kuwait the presence of the western 
forces in saudi arabia the paper said is similar to the 
military occupation of kuwait by iraq and is even worse 
the daily also demanded that iranian moslems on the annual 
pilgrimage to the saudi cities of mecca and medina islams holiest 
shrines be allowed to stage political demonstrations 
the iranians have insisted that staging protests demonstrating 
antipathy towards pagans is a cornerstone of the hajj or 
pilgrimage the saudis who consider the pilgrimage a purely 
religious rite have banned political demonstrations 
riyadhs decision to sever ties with tehran came after more than 
400 pilgrims most of them iranians were killed in a clash in 1988 
with saudi security forces 
the saudis say the trouble was instigated by the iranians and 
cut off ties with tehran citing terrorism and subversion 
tehran accused the saudis of deliberately killing iranian 
pilgrims

moscow plans to begin the shift to private ownership by allowing 
its residents to own their own homes but the mayor said foreign 
loans would be used mostly to support parts of the economy 
directly governed by the moscow city government such as the 
retail distribution system 
only shops deemed healthy enough to succeed in repaying the 
loans would receive the aid said popov a radical economist who 
quit the communist party in july he spoke at the foreign 
correspondents club of japan 
popov said the economic reform plan adopted this month by the 
soviet legislature would fail threatening the future of democratic 
forces in the soviet union 
the plan calls for such steps as encouraging small private 
business and ending many state monopolies 
popov predicted the soviet leadership would adopt more radical 
free market measures if the plan does not take hold within a few 
months he said he might passively resist the conservative 
restructuring program and carry out a more radical economic program 
in his city 
he said he would not ask foreigners to extend loans directly to 
his city loans should go through the central government but with 
their recipients and use clearly specified he said 
popov joined others in the soviet union in calling for japan to 
extend economic aid before resolving the issue of several disputed 
islands 
the group of islands stretching north from hokkaido was seized 
by soviet troops in the final days of world war ii the dispute has 
kept tokyo and moscow from signing a peace treaty and has curtailed 
japanese investment in the soviet union 
as far as i know the russian federation is ready to begin 
negotiations he said 
earlier this month japanese media reported that a soviet 
official suggested to a senior japanese politician that moscow 
might return two islands moscow later denied the story 
popov said he is in japan on vacation but has met with tokyo 
government officials to discuss establishing a sister city 
relationship

keith thomlinson is used to getting 
pretty decent tips as a bartender at a restaurant near the newport 
beaches but it took a little luck to earn a 25000 gratuity 
russell clark a frequent patron at the greenhouse inn and

when thomlinson finally got around to scratching off the numbers 
on the instant baseball game he discovered he had won the 
25000 grand prize after about 5000 in federal taxes and 1200 
for the state he carried home nearly 19000

thomlinson said monday i was just shocked

shes going to pay bills thomlinson said of his mother

clark said he probably would use his 1800 to buy more lottery 
tickets he said he likes to leave more than just a cash tip at 
restuarants and often gives candy flowers or lottery tickets 
its just something i do he said 
but clark 60 does have some second thoughts 
if i figured i would be passing out 25000 i might d

an iraqi airways jetliner carrying more than 260 french citizens 
left baghdad for paris today on a flight that ended their grueling 
hostage ordeal 
at nearly the same time the un security council 
overwhelmingly approved a resolution demanding that iraq make 
reparations for the suffering that has occurred as a result of its 
invasion and occupation of kuwait 
the resolution holds iraq liable for human rights abuses war 
damages and economic losses caused by its military aggression 
the measure also demands that baghdad allow food water and 
other supplies to be sent into the western diplomatic missions in 
kuwait which are besieged by iraqi guards thirteen nations voted 
for the resolution in new york the 10th since the invasion on aug 
2 cuba and yemen abstained 
regarding the hostages the french foreign ministry said in 
paris that the boeing 747 departed baghdad at about 1230 pm est 
and would be in the french capital by midnight local time if all 
went smoothly 
the ministry also said french diplomats had been ordered to pull 
out of their embassy in kuwait where they had endured siegelike 
conditions for weeks the seven diplomats were aboard the jetliner 
when it flew into baghdad from kuwait with more than 50 freed 
hostages that group was joined by about 210 french citizens 
waiting at the baghdad airport 
the plane also carried nine greeks four britons two filipinos 
one german and one spanish citizen freed by iraq according to a 
witness at the airport 
more than 60 french citizens believed to be in iraq and kuwait 
were not aboard the plane western diplomats said some may have 
left on their own and others chose to stay behind 
i can say now that all french citizens who wanted to go home 
have gone home french charge daffaires andre janier said in 
baghdad 
daniel bernard the foreign ministry spokesman confirmed france 
will honor iraqs demand to fill the plane with a cargo of medicine 
for the return flight 
medicine is excluded from the un embargo of iraq and occupied 
kuwait 
president francois mitterrand of france cautioned against 
celebration as long as hundreds of westerners remain captive in 
iraq and kuwait 
i express the joy of all the french people to those coming 
home mitterrand said but we will rejoice fully only when the 
other hostages can return to their own countries 
mitterrand spoke at a news conference outside paris with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev after the signing of a francosoviet 
cooperation treaty 
gorbachev said iraqi president saddam hussein should not to 
expect a split in the international alliance opposed to iraqs aug 
2 seizure of kuwait 
we must not permit the iraqi regime to hope there will be a 
division a weakening of positions gorbachev said he called 
iraqs use of hostages amoral 
the soviet leader urged sanctions against iraq be stepped up and 
said the time was right for arab nations to embark on a new 
initiative to resolve the crisis possibly under saudi leadership 
it seems to me that the iraqis could be ready for this 
gorbachev said if we were to have an interarab meeting this 
would be the quickest way to a settlement 
gorbachev said he had received a telegram from his envoy 
yevgeny primakov indicating after a visit to baghdad and a meeting 
with saddam that there were some shifts in saddams positions the 
soviet leader did not elaborate earlier the soviet foreign 
minister said primakovs talks were cause for little reason for 
optimism 
saddam told cable news network today that he had a 
wideranging deep and very useful dialogue with primakov the 
iraqi president said it would be incorrect to assume nothing was 
accomplished in his talks with primakov 
oil prices shot up more than 1 per barrel in new york today 
because of traders concern that primakov had made little progress 
some traders said however that they were waiting to hear saddams 
remarks on cnn 
saddam is holding hundreds of foreigners as human shields at 
strategic sites in iraq to deter possible attack although he has 
allowed selected groups of the thousands of foreigners to leave 
many others are being held 
european community leaders meeting in rome pledged not to send 
representatives to try to win freedom for hostages held in iraq and 
occupied kuwait reasoning that to do so would only support 
saddams efforts to try to divide the alliance arrayed against him 
the decision followed a trip to baghdad by former british prime 
minister edward heath who helped secure the release of more than 
30 british hostages 
france the united states and britain have been the only western 
countries to maintain embassies in kuwait since iraq overran the 
emirate in august iraq cut off water and electricity to all 
embassies that defied its orders to close 
france had been considering withdrawing its diplomats from 
kuwait for several weeks because of the extremely arduous living 
conditions under iraqi occupation it had refrained from doing so 
to allow the diplomats to support the french hostages in kuwait

twentysix blacks were killed 
in weekend factional fighting that erupted after a month of 
relative calm in black areas police said monday 
also nine african national congress members were charged with 
terrorism and the illegal possession of weapons in a case that 
could further strain relations between the government and the black 
opposition movement 
one of the nine mac maharaj is on the ancs national executive 
committee and also is a top official in the closely allied south 
african communist party 
the nine all in detention since july were not asked to plead 
at the durban regional court they have accused police of torture 
and threatening them with death 
the worst weekend violence was in the soweto township outside 
johannesburg where 16 people were killed and 33 wounded in a spate 
of attacks sunday night said police col tienie halgryn 
police said the violence may have been in revenge for attacks 
saturday in soweto on supporters of the inkatha freedom party one 
man was killed and two were injured 
fighting between zulu supporters of inkatha other blacks tied to 
the anc has claimed almost 800 lives in the johannesburg area 
during august and september there have been only sporadic 
incidents this month 
police said they did not know if any of the dead and wounded 
were connected to the anc halgryn said it appeared gunmen had gone 
on a random revenge spree after the inkatha supporters were 
attacked 
police said monday an unidentified man allegedly a member of 
the anc youth wing had been arrested in the killing of the inkatha 
supporter 
the killings came after thousands of inkatha supporters many 
carrying spears clubs and shields paraded through central 
johannesburg on saturday the marchers presented a petition to 
police accusing security forces of working against inkatha the anc 
has accused police of assisting inkatha 
the anc and inkatha both oppose the apartheid system of racial 
segregation but are divided over tactics and plans for a future 
south africa 
the whiteled government and the anc have been holding periodic 
peace talks since may but both sides have been accusing one other 
of acting in bad faith 
many of the charges and countercharges have focused on the 
township violence and the detention of anc members such as maharaj 
police also said monday that weekend faction fighting between 
rival xhosas and sothos at a gold mine in the orange free state 
left nine workers dead and 42 injured 
the fighting broke out at a workers hostel saturday night at 
rand mines harmony gold mine in virginia 160 miles southwest of 
johannesburg and continued into sunday the company said 
the mine was reported quiet monday as management officials 
talked to the rival groups police said mine officials did not know 
what sparked the fighting

delegates from more than 60 nations met monday to 
debate a proposed global ban on the ocean dumping of toxic 
industrial waste but the united states intends to seek further 
study before agreeing to a ban 
the proposal from denmark iceland finland norway and sweden 
calls for industrial dumping at sea to be phased by out 1995 
it will be debated tuesday by the nations at the meeting 
signatories to the london dumping convention or ldc the 
20yearold convention regulates the hauling of industrial waste to 
sea on ships 
the socalled nordic proposal calls for such dumping to be 
stopped and to do so without increasing pollution to other parts of 
the environment and without exporting waste to other countries that 
have not signed the treaty 
the proposal asks signatory nations to encourage and promote 
cleaner industrial processes recycling the treatment of waste on 
land and more research and development on alternative and 
environmentally sound means of waste disposal 
the fiveday london meeting will be closely watched by 
governments industry and environmentalists because the group is 
the only international body dealing with marine pollution 
if it can reach consensus on the current agenda it will bode 
well for future negotations on broader more complex marine issues 
such as landbased pollution of the sea 
most regulation of ocean pollution is carried out by individual 
nations or by regional groups 
as the problem of seaborne pollution has increased so have 
calls for a coordinated global response delegates will consider 
whether to expand the scope of the current treaty by beginning work 
on a new global convention on marine pollution 
about 80 percent of ocean pollution is generated on land with 
10 percent coming from industrial waste disposal and the rest 
thrown or discharged from ships 
the leader of the us delegation robert reinstein said more 
study was needed before the united states could support the ban 
reinstein is deputy assistant secretary of state for environment 
health and natural resources 
we just want to look at all the options and assess them on 
their merits he said 
britain ireland canada japan france and switzerland also 
have expressed reservations about the ban 
environmentalists accuse the united states of foot dragging and 
of taking a position in international negotiations contrary to us 
domestic law 
in 1988 congress passed the ocean dumping ban act prohibiting 
the ocean disposal of any industrial or municipal waste the 
legislation also forbade oceanbased incineration and set deadlines 
for a number of east coast cities to stop dumping municipal sewage 
the us law is one of strictest in the world on ocean dumping 
of toxic waste 
the state department idea seems to be to keep the options open 
for future dumping in case domestic law can one day be changed 
said clifton curtis an observer at the meeting from the glands 
switzerlandbased international union for the conservation of 
nature he spoke before the conference opened 
reinstein defended the decision to call for more study 
our general postion on several aspects of waste disposal is 
that we want a good scientific basis for the decisions we take 
not as a way of delaying decisions on an environmental threat but 
just as a general principle

23 million and forbade abortions and birth control tens of 
thousands of mostly unwanted babies were left at state 
institutions where some contracted aids through blood 
transfusions 
newborns were often given blood transfusions in romania in the 
belief it would make them stronger needles were in short supply 
and routinely used hundreds of times 
some of the mothers whose babies were undergoing the experiments 
said monday they opposed stopping them 
i want the experiments to continue daniela dumitrescu said 
in an interview my child is feeling well he has stopped 
vomiting and has gained weight 
doctors at the hospital said that none of the babies had died 
since the beginning of the injections while several died before 
british embassy sources said the british foreign office sent 
romanian authorities a telex last month warning them against 
hughes 
the sources said hughes who arrived in romania some five months 
ago was ordered by the malawi authorities to leave that country 
after conducting similar experiments there 
they suggested that hughes who is not a medical doctor had 
been seeking romanian approval for his drug which would have made 
it easier to sell internationally 
after suspending the treatment in september the romanian drug 
commission decided to approve it again earlier this month despite 
the warnings

the top un environment official on monday urged 
immediate steps by industrialized countries to curb global warming 
saying delay will only worsen a disaster looming over future 
generations 
mostafa k tolba head of the un environment program said a 
complete change in attitudes and lifestyles is needed to avert 
a danger potentially more catastrophic than any other threat in 
human history 
a decade of research has made clear that only drastic reductions 
in emissions of carbon dioxide and other heattrapping greenhouse 
gases will stop warming of the planet tolba told the opening of 
a un climate conference 
he said large gaps in our knowledge about the phenomenon 
should not be an excuse for inaction 
about 500 scientists attending the 10day conference are 
expected to draft a new program proposing ways to fight the 
socalled greenhouse effect 
a final meeting of about 80 ministers is expected to draw 
several heads of government including margaret thatcher of britain 
and frances michel rocard the united states still opposed to 
binding emission cuts has sent a lowerlevel delegation 
the conference is supposed to launch formal negotiations on an 
international convention against global warming to be ready for 
signing by mid1992 ministers are expected to provide the basis 
for the talks in a final declaration nov 7 
but tolba said industrialized nations which contribute 
threequarters of all manmade greenhouse gases must cut emissions 
even before a convention is in place 
the longer we delay the worse the disaster will be for our 
children and for our childrens children he said 
he said curbing emissions will be costly and require great 
changes in economic legal and institutional systems 
developing countries would need more time and western help 
a conference report by more than 1000 scientists from 70 
countries outlines the climate upheaval likely if nothing is done 
global temperatures could rise up to 54 degrees fahrenheit by 
the end of the next century the fastest rise in 10000 years 
sea levels may rise far enough to flood tens of thousands of 
miles of shoreline sending millions of people fleeing inland 
the un food and agriculture administration in a position 
paper prepared for the conference said the overall effect on 
global farming could be positive because arable lands may open 
up toward the poles 
but the impact on some of todays vulnerable regions like the 
sahel may be very serious it added

gov michael s dukakis said monday the media 
exaggerated the popularity of the man he ran against for president 
in 1988 but now may be too hard on president bush as his 
popularity drops in the polls 
dukakis whose own popularity in his home state is at a historic 
low made it clear his sympathy for bush didnt indicate a change 
of heart about the republican presidents domestic policies 
i think part of the problem is that george bush doesnt 
believe in much domestically dukakis told reporters hes much 
more comfortable in foreign policy 
but dukakis said the media have made too much of bushs 
popularity on both ends of the scale 
you guys exaggerated his popularity on the way up and youre 
now beating him over the head on the way down dukakis said 
dukakis said presidents and governors must be prepared sometimes 
to take actions that are unpopular 
the sense i have these days is the white house takes a poll 
every night before they do anything you just cant do that 
dukakis said 
his popularity will probably drop some more so what so what 
the question is are we doing the right thing are we biting the 
bullet are we dealing with these very difficult fiscal problems 
that have been in the making for the last 10 years 
newsweek magazine recently released the results of a poll by the 
gallup organization showing bush had slipped to the lowest approval 
rating of his presidency the poll showed 48 percent approved of 
bushs handling of his job down from 57 percent on oct 19

vandals slashed two recent pop art works by roy 
lichtenstein and james rosenquist on display at the international 
contemporary art fair organizers of the exhibition said monday 
the vandals shouting antiimperialist slogans mutilated the 
paintings saturday with knives and dropped pamphlets before they 
were arrested 
lichtensteins reflections on senorita 1990 estimated at 
1 million and rosenquists venturi correction 1990 
estimated at 350000 were on show at the booth of the leo 
castelli gallery in new york 
castelli 83 was shaken by the incident but said he did not 
hold anyone responsible 
these are unpredictable things that happen and cant be 
prevented for me the affair is closed he was quoted as saying 
in le figaro 
one of castellis employees said that following the incident a 
security guard had been posted inside the stand at the gallerys 
request 
the fair considered the first major commercial art event of the 
season is expected to draw some 140000 visitors to 155 stands 
displaying the worlds best contemporary paintings drawings and 
sculpture 
some gallery owners have complained of a lack of security last 
week a small painting by philippe favier was stolen 
there are no barriers between the art and the visitors which 
means that in this enormous department store of art and sculpture 
you can caress a work with the palm of your hand said nathalie

the surgeon general on monday issued a 
prehalloween warning to the beer industry saying it should avoid 
advertising practices that encourage drinking among minors 
the beer industry should not capitalize on a season that 
youngsters look forward to with great anticipation to push their 
products dr antonia novello said 
halloween and hops do not mix 
dr novello said breweries and their advertising agencies were 
sending the wrong message to minors that alcohol consumption was 
acceptable for children under the legal drinking age she said they 
should put larger warning labels on containers and revise 
advertising practices 
we would like the industry to share in the responsibility 
she said children can either consciously or unconsciously be 
affected by both print and electronic ads that for the most part 
never show the harmful effects of alcohol consumption 
alcohol abuse was the number one substance abuse problem among 
american youth and indications were that the situation was 
getting worse children were being enticed by advertisements for 
socalled soft liquors including beer wine and wine coolers 
she added 
the alcohol industry annually conducts its most intensive 
advertising campaign between october and january the national 
coalition on television violence estimated that before the average 
american child turns 16 he would see 75000 television scenes 
where alcohol is consumed or its use encouraged 
on radio and television and even at supermarket checkout 
counters we are being bombarded with exhortations this may be 
the year that witches meet the wine cooler dr novello said 
but james c sanders president of the beer institute said that 
the surgeon generals attack had become an annual harbinger of the 
halloween season and that there was no indication that more minors 
were consuming alcoholic spirits 
no amount of false accusations or shoddy unverified research 
can disprove the fact that all alcohol advertising including 
halloween advertising is carefully produced and placed to reach 
adult audiences as mandated by the industrys stringent 
guidelines he said in a statement 
dr novello said there were indications that more children some 
as young as age 13 were illegally purchasing alcoholic beverages 
especially wine coolers that are frequently available at 
convenience stores 
according to the national high school senior survey conducted by 
the national institute on alcohol abuse more than 45 million 
school aged teenagers had a drinking problem 
the survey added that 43 percent of college students 35 percent 
of high school seniors and 26 percent of 8th grade students take as 
many as five drinks a week 
dr novello said her office was working with educators 
nationwide to steer teenagers and preteens away from consuming 
liquor

the centerright government resigned monday 
after the junior member of the yearold coalition refused to 
support increased ties to the european economic community 
i think it is deeply regrettable for the country 
conservative prime minister jan p syse told national television 
moments after the small center party quit his threeparty alliance 
syse had hoped to form a minority government after his coalition 
split over norways position in talks between the community and the 
sixnation european free trade association of which norway is a 
member 
the talks are to center on the creation of a joint economic 
region 
the center party backed by farmers who fear a cut in subsidies 
with freer trade policies opposed the issue it quit the coalition 
and refused to back a singleparty conservative minority 
government 
centers leader anne enger lahnstein said the dispute had 
moved beyond the trade issue and involved eec membership itself 
syse who supports eventually joining the eec said the issue 
was fundamental to his government 
a government must stand united in such a case especially when 
it concerns protecting norways interests in international 
negotiations syse told parliament as he announced the 
coalitions resignation 
syse had hoped to form a new government because there is a slim 
rightist majority among the six major parties in parliament and no 
elections are legally possible for three more years 
public disenchantment has increased due to tough austerity 
programs intended to pull norways oil dependent economy out of a 
fouryear slump that has brought record unemployment 
former prime minister gro harlem brundtland was expected to form 
her third labor party administration norways sixth government 
since 1980 but no party holds a majority in the 165seat 
parliament 
the labor party controls 81 votes 63 of its own 17 from the 
socialist left and one independent 
center did not indicate it would give its 11 votes to labor on 
all issues but center leaders indicated they would agree on the 
issue of the eec 
centers 11 votes in parliament are usually counted in the 
nonsocialist blocs 84 votes the conservatives have 37 seats the 
christian democrats 14 and the party of progress has 22 
the party of progress was excluded from syses coalition with 
center and others viewing it as too extremist 
the conflict between the conservatives and center may have been 
aggravated last week when neighboring sweden strongly hinted that 
it would seek eec membership prompting calls in norway for both 
countries to join the community 
the eec considers some of norways protectionist laws 
discriminatory towards foreigners

the supreme court on monday allowed a state to 
impose longer sentences automatically for criminals who used guns 
the court without comment let stand a montana law used to add 
10 years to the 30year prison sentence given a man who brandished 
a gun during a pizza shop robbery 
in a separate case the court refused to let police in 
massachusetts stop and search someone solely because that person 
reportedly was carrying a handgun in public 
over a dissenting vote by justice harry a blackmun the court 
let stand a ruling by massachusetts highest court that 
investigatory stops by police are unlawful if sparked by nothing 
more than the mere possession of a handgun 
the montana law was attacked as unconstitutional because thomas 
krantz never faced any gunpossession charges state courts did not 
consider his use of the gun as a separate crime but merely as a 
sentencing factor 
the montana supreme court upheld the state law last march by a 
52 vote 
krantz was convicted of holding up a missoula pizza shop and of 
driving the getaway car for a holdup at a missoula motel a week 
later 
prosecutors said krantz was the masked gunman who staged the 
first robbery 
convicted he was sentenced to 30 years on the robbery charges 
but the presiding judge added 10 years to the sentence because 
krantz had used a gun 
in its ruling last march the state supreme court rejected 
krantzs arguments that prosecutors never presented such a charge 
to a jury or proved it beyond a reasonable doubt 
in the massachusetts case two lowell police officers gary 
richardson and steven morril received a radio report that a 
convenience store clerk had seen a man with the handle of a pistol 
protruding from his pocket 
the clerk had given police a description and license number of 
the pickup truck the man had left in and the two officers stopped 
the vehicle 
richardson ordered the man paul couture out of the truck and 
then searched the drivers compartment while morril detained

the us militarys top expert on 
the medical effects of chemical warfare said monday that history 
shows over 95 percent of those hit by nerve and mustard gas have 
survived 
i think the threat of chemical warfare is very real but 
youre not talking about some devastatingly effective weapon 
said col michael dunn commander of the us army medical research 
institute of chemical defense 
his message to 95 doctors nurses and medics finishing a 
threeday course on treating victims of chemical warfare attacks 
was simple there are very effective things you can do to deal 
with chemical casualties 
for the 350000strong multinational force gathered in the 
persian gulf region following the iraqi invasion of kuwait the 
biggest fear is the possibility that saddam hussein will use 
chemical weapons if war breaks out 
we hope it doesnt happen but if it does well be ready 
said spec 4 robert staklinski 22 of darlington sc a medical 
corpsman he had just played the victim of a simulated chemical 
attack twitching and moaning on a stretcher as halfdozen doctors 
and medics hovered over him with a fiveminute deadline to make a 
diagnosis and initiate treatment 
dr mark lawson a 36yearold navy gastroenterologist from st 
petersburg fla said he knew next to nothing about chemical 
warfare victims when he came to the gulf but now feels confident he 
can treat them and protect himself 
this course has taken away a lot of the fear of the unknown 
especially when you realize that less than 5 percent die he 
said 
dunn the senior us member of a nato panel on medicalchemical 
defense said his greatest concern is for troops within 25 miles of 
the front who are within range of iraqi artillery and shortrange 
rockets used in the past to launch chemical weapons 
during the eightyear persian gulf war when iraq regularly used 
chemical weapons against iran more than 45000 people were 
attacked by mustard gas he said only about 3 percent died mainly 
from obstruction of the respiratory system 
to a lesser degree the iraqis also used nerve agents mainly 
tabun and sarin with about a one in 20 fatality rate 
ever since world war i right up until the end of the persian 
gulf war in 1988 chemical warfare agents which have a reputation 
of being lethal are really a greater cause of nonfatal injuries 
than they are of fatal injuries dunn of clarksville md said 
over 95 percent of chemical casualties are living chemical 
casualties who arent going to die but who stand a chance of being 
disabled or having a prolonged recovery he said 
the aim of the 15 threeday courses being held in the desert 
shield area for american saudi arabian and other allied medical 
personnel is to ensure that they have the best equipment and 
information to maximize recovery dunn said 
the last american soldier to be attacked by chemical weapons was 
in world war i 
ironically the iraqis along with the iranians have provided 
the americans with much of their insight into the modern treatment 
of chemical warfare victims 
last december dunn said he attended an international 
conference in kuwait city and discussed chemical casualty care with 
iranian and iraqi doctors there was a very free exchange of 
information so there are no secrets he said 
they have a very effective chemical casualty care system that 
they learned at high human cost and our objective here is to get 
better than they are without having to pay that human cost dunn 
said 
the iraqis were most effective using chemical weapons against 
civilians and the iranian revolutionary guards whose beards worn 
for religious reasons prevented a tight seal on their gas masks 
he said 
all us combat forces in the gulf are drilled repeatedly in 
quickly donning protective masks and in injecting themselves with 
antidotes in case of attack 
the course for medical personnel being given at a us marine 
corps hospital is a compressed version of a fiveday course given 
in the united states which about 80 percent of physicians pass 
dunn said over 98 percent of the doctors here pass the final 
what youre looking at here is a sense of immediacy and 
urgency of purpose he said 
back in the states you take this stuff for granted said 
medical corpsman joe campbell 26 of pensacola fla but here 
your life depends on it so you take it alittle more seriously

the soviet unions environment minister 
on monday appealed for international pressure on moscow to stop 
nuclear explosions in the arctic 
if it was up to me i would stop the tests immediately what we 
need is an international moratorium nikolai voronchov said at 
the start of an international environment conference 
we have appealed to the highest authorities in the soviet 
union but what we need is international pressure to stop the 
tests from the public and the press the soviet official said 
the soviet union exploded a nuclear device on wednesday in the 
island group of novaya zemlya less than 500 miles from finland and 
norway the explosion came after a twoyear break in soviet nuclear 
tests on the islands 
voronchov said he had not been informed of the test beforehand 
and that he could not guarantee that no others would take place 
but i dont think it is the start of a new series he said 
the nordic countries formally protested the test to soviet 
deputy foreign minister viktor karpov in moscow on monday finnish 
national radio reported 
in the protest note finland sweden norway denmark and 
iceland urged the soviet union to allow nordic experts to view 
conditions at the test site the report said 
voronchov said he would do his utmost to help win permission for 
finnish experts to visit the island 
he also gave his backing to the idea of an international nuclear 
testmonitoring group 
if finland as a neutral country proposed such a group i am 
sure the nuclear powers would take note voronchov said 
the twoday ministerial meeting on technology and financing for 
the environment was attended by more than 120 representatives from 
nine countries in the nordic region and eastern europe

lawrence eddingfield said at an news conference aboard the uss 
antietam in the persian gulf 
the antietam a ticonderogaclass guidedmissile cruiser is in 
charge of antiair warfare in the gulf he said 
as such we keep track of everything thats flying in the 
central and northern persian gulf including military and 
civilian aircraft said eddingfield 
the antietam is the highest stateoftheart ship the navy 
has said lt mark wenzel 30 of fort walton beach fla its 
radar and sonar electronics are integrated with a sophisticated 
missile system he said 
the cruiser is equpped with the aegis radar and weapons system

567foot vessel the ship carries a crew of more than 370 men 
in 1988 during the iraniraq war the vincennes another 
aegisequipped cruiser on patrol in the persian gulf accidentally 
shot down an iranian civilian aircraft killing all 290 people 
aboard 
us investigators concluded that the pressure of firsttime 
combat caused vincennes radar operators to misinterpret crucial 
computer data and recommended stress and the human factor be 
studied for future training purposes 
everybody learned a few lessons including people flying 
commercial airliners said eddingfield he dismissed any danger 
of a potential repeat incident 
the antietam is the only ship of its class deployed to support 
operation desert shield the united states has a naval armada and 
more than 220000 troops amassed in the region in the standoff with 
saddam hussein over his aug 2 takeover of kuwait

here at a glance are mondays developments in the persian gulf 
crisis 
 
hundreds of french citizens left baghdad on a flight to freedom 
after three months as hostages of saddam hussein among the 
frenchmen were the last seven diplomats who endured an arduous 
siege of their embassy in occupied kuwait 
 
freed hostage patrick moniodde said he met at least a dozen 
american and british hostages and noted they were very 
depressed 
the iraqis constantly move hostages from one site to 
another said moniodde there was no hygiene he said 
toilets were very dirty but we always got medical care sure 
iraqis do not want to lose any hostages we are free today but it 
is terrible for others 
 
the un security council voted to hold iraq liable for damages 
caused by its seizure of kuwait the resolution the 10th since 
iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 was approved by 13 nations cuba and 
yemen abstained the new resolution also demands that baghdad allow 
food water and other supplies to be sent to western diplomatic 
missions in kuwait 
 
campaigning in san francisco president bush said he would not 
hesitate to use force in the persian gulf if provoked history is 
replete with examples when the president had to take action 
without consulting congress he added bush said he would meet 
tuesday with congressional leaders about the us military buildup 
in the persian gulf a deployment that could expand while congress 
is adjourned 
 
the european community nations said that the gulf crisis has not 
caused a decline in oil supplies and that their strategic stocks 
exceed three months of normal consumption the ec energy ministers 
said oil prices remain high basically for emotive or speculative 
reasons 
 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said that if iraqs saddam 
hussein thinks he can divide the international alliance opposing 
him he is wrong the soviet leader also said the latest mission to 
baghdad by his envoy yevgeny primakov indicated there were some 
shifts in saddams positions he did not elaborate primakov met 
sunday with saddam 
 
saddam told the cable news network it would be wrong to say 
nothing was accomplished by primakovs visit he said he told 
primakov how the solutions could be reached to many of the issues 
in the region

presidents mikhail gorbachev of the 
soviet union and francois mitterrand of france signed a friendship 
pact monday providing for immediate consultations if either country 
feels threatened by conflict 
the two leaders signed the treaty of friendship and cooperation 
after an overnight visit to paris by the soviet leader 
in the case of situations which in the view of one of the 
parties create a threat to peace a breach of peace or provoke 
international tension the governments of france and the soviet 
union will enter into contact without delay to coordinate all 
aspects of such situations the treaty said 
the treaty fell short of a nonaggression pact similar to the 
treaty moscow concluded recently with germany french officials say 
france will adhere to its commitments to nato and the european 
community making a nonaggression clause unnecessary 
the treaty was the first between the countries since a 
friendship pact in 1944 and frances first bilateral treaty in 27 
years it was signed at the chateau of rambouillet 33 miles 
southwest of paris 
we have done a great deal of work in a short time gorbachev 
said at a joint news conference with mitterrand this reflects 
the new level of cooperation and understanding between the 
leadership of our two countries which enables us to obtain 
results 
the broad agreement calls for regular political consultations 
it also provides for cooperation in energy nonmilitary nuclear 
science transportation highdefinition television and 
telecommunications 
france and the soviet union pledge to reinforce european 
solidarity and seek the creation of a european confederation 
the treaty promised french assistance as the soviet union shifts 
to a market economy and french help in arranging accords between 
moscow and the 12nation european community 
the treaty also provides for reimbursement by the soviets to 
holders ofbonds issued by the czarist governments of russia from 
18221917 said alexei glukhov a member of the soviet delegation 
more than 250000 people and institutions in france including 
the government hold such bonds theoretically worth billions of 
dollars glukhov said details of the repayment plan remained to be 
worked out 
the two leaders said at a joint news conference that their views 
were in harmony including on the persian gulf crisis gorbachev 
suggested tightening of un economic sanctions against iraq for 
its invasion of kuwait but said he saw indications the sanctions 
were beginning to take effect 
he also said an interarab conference would be the quickest and 
most appropriate solution to the crisis 
gorbachev arrived sunday evening after a threeday visit to 
spain where he obtained 15 billion in guaranteed loans to help 
ease the transition away from a centralized economy 
the trip was gorbachevs first abroad since winning the nobel 
peace prize earlier this month

harvard university said monday it will 
sponsor the annual international aids conference in 1992 four 
months after threatening to cancel the forum unless the united 
states removed travel restrictions on people infected with aids 
the conference the principle forum for presenting scientific 
information on the fight against the disease will go ahead in the 
last week of may 1992 school officials said 
in june the harvard aids institute threatened to withdraw as 
sponsor and cancel the conference to protest a us policy that 
made aids infection one of several contagious diseases for which 
foreigners could be barred from the country 
but under an immigration bill passed over the weekend the us 
government would be allowed to remove aids and other diseases from 
the medical list for which a person may be denied entry

moslem extremists assassinated egypts 
parliamentary speaker in a botched attempt to kill the interior 
minister who they blamed for the deaths of 14 fundamentalists a 
presidential source said monday 
preliminary police reports based on the confessions of 10 
suspects who have admitted involvement in the oct 12 slaying came 
to the same conclusion according to sources in the interior 
ministry 
according to their confessions they said they wanted to kill 
the interior minister said the presidential source who spoke on 
condition he not be identified further 
rifaat elmahgoub speaker of the peoples assembly his driver 
and four security men were killed when assailants opened fired as 
they drove in two cars by a luxury hotel on a corniche by the nile 
the source in president hosni mubaraks office said he is 
convinced interior minister abdelhalim moussa was the target 
because moussa usually followed the same route to his office that 
elmahgoub took that day 
shortly after the assassination moussa told reporters his car 
had been a few hundred yards behind the limousine carrying 
elmahgoub 
moussa at the time dismissed speculation the assassins bullets 
were meant for him islamic fundamentalists twice in 1987 attempted 
to assassinate egyptian interior ministers one of the ministers 
was badly wounded 
the presidential source said monday that moussas car had 
actually passed the site of the assassination a few minutes before 
the gunmen struck elmahgoubs mercedes 
the two factors that saved moussa said the source were that he 
chose not to ride in his black mercedes that day and that his car 
was not accompanied by a motorcycle policeman because it was 
friday the moslem sabbath and traffic was light 
the ambush was waiting for a motorcycle followed by a black 
mercedes he moussa went unnoticed the presidential source 
said then came the unfortunate elmahgoub its sure that he was 
mistaken for moussa 
elmahgoub was technically the secondranking official in egypt 
after president mubarak but there was no particular reason he 
would have been targeted either by moslem extremists or by foreign 
terrorists 
the interior minister on the other hand is in charge of most 
security functions in egypt 
early speculation focused on iraqi or palestinian agents 
possibly in league with egyptian religious zealots in a conspiracy 
developed in baghdad to punish egypt for its antiiraq stand in the 
persian gulf crisis 
police still are not ruling out a possible iraqi or palestinian 
connection the interior ministry sources said they said large 
amounts of money were found with the recently arrested suspects 
there have been no ontherecord pronouncements on the 
investigation into the slaying but as pieced together so far the 
interior ministry sources said the attack appears to have been 
meant as revenge for police actions 
in april police killed 13 islamic fundamentalists and wounded 
six in clashes in fayoum province 60 miles southwest of cairo 
last month unidentified gunmen killed physician alaa mohi eldin 
spokesman of the islamic gamaa an umbrella organization for the 
militant moslems no one has been arrested in connection with the 
shooting but the gamaa blame the police 
the moslem extremists had threatened to take their revenge 
one police officer said the first suspect who was arrested last 
wednesday and identified the others said their aim was to 
kill the interior minister 
police on saturday killed two suspects alleged to have been 
triggermen in elmahgoubs death a police report said fingerprints 
in a car commandeered briefly by an escaping assassin matched those 
of a man wounded in saturdays clash 
one police officer said some suspects in the case are claiming 
they gave false confessions under torture the prisoners are 
demanding medical examinations to confirm their torture the 
officer said 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group and 
other rights organizations claim egyptian interrogators use 
beatings and other torture against political detainees

filmmaker ken burns creator of the widely 
praised the civil war public television series says television 
is mostly to blame for a decline in high school students knowledge 
of history 
in a luncheon speech monday at the national press club burns 
said television is substituting a distracting cultural monarchy 
for the cultural democracy and diversity that was promised when 
television was introduced 
television has equipped us as citizens to live only in an 
allconsuming and thereby forgettable and disposable present 
blissfully unaware of the historical tides and movements that speak 
not only to this moment but to our vast future as well he said 
this environment ensures that we have no history burns 
said and by so doing ensures that we have no future 
burns blasted television for offering americans nearly the 
same thing everywhere on dozens of clonelike channels and 
for conferring a kind of cultural peerage on a small group of 
tv commentators 
issues and ideas are merely pushed around the plate never 
digested by the same people engaged more with a subtle 
oneupmanship among themselves and their tv alter egos than with 
the advancement of our understanding burns said 
in the worst of our television we are addicted to 
personality to the breathless embrace of celebrity ensuring as we 
go a tyranny of the televised over the great mass of the 
untelevised he said

congress refusal to provide more money for 
savings and loan bailouts will delay the closing of failed 
institutions for months and add millions or even billions of 
dollars to taxpayers costs analysts said monday 
legislators electionyear squeeze left the resolution trust 
corp the bailout agency created last year without the funds 
needed to close more than 300 insolvent or nearinsolvent thrift 
associations 
that means the institutions will continue to run losses funding 
themselves with highinterest deposits that in turn weakens 
healthy competitors by forcing them to raise their deposit rates 
raising the specter of additional failures 
its going to cost us additional money were going to have to 
slow up the resolution of failed thrifts l william seidman 
chairman of the trust corporation said in a telephone interview 
he estimated the cost of a threemonth delay at 250 million to 
300 million the congressional budget office put it at 300 
million to 400 million while bert ely a private analyst in 
alexandria va estimated it at 2 billion to 25 billion 
the added costs although spread over the life of the bailout 
program will make it even harder for the government to meet the 
500 billion deficitreduction goal in the fiveyear program 
adopted over the weekend 
the trust corporation which had handled 287 failed thrifts 
through the end of september has enough money left to pay 
acquirers to take over an additional 65 to 75 small institutions by 
the end of this year according to spokesman steven katsanos 
but that would still leave it with more than 100 sampls to handle 
on top of several hundred others judged to be near failure 
also financing disruptions tend to discourage potential bidders 
and make it more difficult for the agency to hire the outside 
experts it needs he said 
the private sector doesnt adapt well to uncertainty about 
whether the bill is going to be paid he said 
the agency has already been forced to delay seeking acquirers 
for 18 large institutions until its funding is secure katsanos 
said 
congress sunday morning revolt against further spending left 
bush administration officials and democrats blaming each other for 
the expected consequences 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said treasury secretary nicholas f bradys refusal to 
testify in support of the administrations request created an 
unfortunate atmosphere for approval of more money 
theyve got to get out of that bunker over there in the 
treasury and come over here and join the people gonzalez said in 
a telephone interview 
however desiree tuckersorini deputy assistant secretary of 
the treasury said the need for action and the consequences for 
failing to act were spelled out in great detail over a period of 
months by the treasury secretary and others 
private analysts were unimpressed by both sides arguments and 
likened the situation to 1988 and 1986 when political wrangling 
left the rtcs predecessor the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp short of money 
its a very sad comment on politics its a very lame 
excuse said ohio state university professor edward j kane 
they were playing a game of chicken to see who blinks at the 
last minute ely said the house wanted brady to come up and 
bow and scrape and he refused nobody blinked so we ended up 
with a delay a costly one 
brady told congress by letter that the administration needed 40 
billion to cover sampl losses through september 1991 in addition to 
the 50 billion provided by last years sampl law 
the senate early sunday had adopted a measure that would have 
provided 10 billion to the trust corporation enough to keep it 
going until after congress scheduled return in january 
however the house adjourned without acting on a similar bill 
after rep frank annunzio dill raised procedural objections 
that would have required adoption by a twothirds vote 
he just felt that bringing it up after midnight on the final 
night of the session was not the time to sneak new funding 
through said curtis prins staff director of annunzios house 
banking financial institutions subcommittee 
gonzalez pledged speedy action by his committee when congress 
returns until then he said the administration could take 
advantage of a drafting error in last years law which would permit 
it to borrow shortterm an additional 188 billion treasury 
officials earlier hinted that they would borrow the additional 
money and were meeting monday to discuss the option 
economist george kaufman of loyola university of chicago said 
the financing delay while unfortunate may have the beneficial 
side effect of encouraging the trust corporation to more quickly 
sell the 160 billion in loans real estate and other assets it has 
inherited from failed thrifts

protesters against us involvement in the 
middle east burned flags and trashed a fastfood restaurant monday 
and police arrested more than 60 demonstrators 
at least 200 protesters had gathered outside the pacific stock 
exchange by 6 am said police sgt bob crosat they were met by 
between 100 and 200 officers he said 
the protesters chanted and carried signs but when the crowd 
headed for market street the mood changed he said when 
demonstrators arrived at a mcdonalds restaurant the violence 
began crosat said 
they broke tables and windows and scattered food around 
said crosat a couple of american flags also were burned during the 
2hour protest 
sixtyone demonstrators were arrested for investigation of 
misdemeanor charges that included failure to disperse at an 
unlawful assembly vandalism and trespassing said officer dave 
ambrose 
the protest was sponsored by the earth action network which 
publicized the event as a legal nonviolent proenvironment and 
anticorporate demonstration and blockade of the pacific stock 
exchange 
the demonstration did not appear to be timed to coincide with 
president bushs visit monday to san francisco there was no 
mention of the president in organizers news releases and little

millions of gallons of a dilute cyanide 
solution spilled from a gold refinery and biologists monday 
searched along the lynches river to see if it had harmed livestock 
or wildlife 
elsewhere oil from a coke plants discharge pipe spilled into 
the monongahela river monday at pittsburgh creating a shimmering 
4milelong slick authorities said 
health and wildlife officials in south carolina reported no fish 
kills or problems with animals that might drink from the river 
the spill posed little threat to drinking water supplies but 
officials warned residents to keep animals from tainted water 
about 11 million gallons of the solution of sodium cyanide had 
spilled by midday monday into the little fork creek after an 
earthen dam broke sunday at the brewer gold mining co the 
reservoir held about 13 million to 14 million gallons 
the liquid contained only 50 parts of sodium cyanide per 
million said richard carnes director of the chesterfield county 
emergency preparedness division 
undiluted sodium cyanide would be fatal but the spill created 
only a minimal health risk to people and animals because it would 
be significantly diluted after mixing with river water said thom 
berry a spokesman for the department of health and environmental 
however the cyanide wasnt the only threat from the spill 
our concern right now is not so much the cyanide but levels of 
copper were seeing in the discharge berry said some copper 
compounds also can kill aquatic life he said 
the sodium cyanide solution began spilling sunday afternoon from 
a holding pond at brewer officials said brewer uses sodium 
cyanide to separate gold from ore 
the holding pond is about 2000 feet from the little fork creek 
and two miles from lynches 
carnes said recent heavy rain in the area might have weakened 
the dam 
crews worked to diverted remaining chemical in the reservoir 
into brewers discharge treatment system to be neutralized with 
chlorine and hydrogen peroxide berry said 
brewer officials did not return telephone calls monday 
wildlife and health officials took water samples from the river 
along a series of stations along the river said berry 
marine biologists in three boats covered the lynches creeks and 
tributaries in search of dead fish said john evans of the state 
department of wildlife and marine resources game biologists 
searched the banks for deer fox racoon and waterfowl he said 
the nearest municipality that draws from the water for its 
drinking supply is the city of georgetown along the coast about 
110 miles from jefferson berry said 
the mine began operation in 1987 and was fined by the 
environmental protection agency in march for failure to promptly 
report a spill of up to 1800 gallons of liquid containing sodium 
cyanide authorities said that stemmed from a march 1988 spill in 
which a 2inch line carrying sodium cyanide solution ruptured 
in pittsburgh the slowmoving oil spill stretched 4 miles from 
the ltv steel co plant to the downtown point state park where the 
monongahela and allegheny rivers join to form the ohio river said 
betsy mallison a spokeswoman for the state department of 
environmental resources 
as a precaution water plants serving about 38000 customers in 
west view and robinsontownship were advised to test their water 
for fuel said gina pferdehirt a spokesman for the allegheny 
county health department 
its beginning to break up we dont feel the water supplies 
are threatened ms mallison said 
ltv spokesman mark tomasch said the company was unable to 
determine whether the fuel came from its coke plant or from another 
company that uses the pipe

president bush said monday wed 
have no hesitancy at all to use military force in the persian 
gulf if provoked by iraq and indicated he feels no obligation to 
get congress approval 
history is replete with examples where the president has had 
to take action bush said apparently referring to the us 
invasion of panama bush said ive done this in the past and 
certainly somebody mentioned provocation wed have no hesitancy 
at all 
bush said he was not trying to prepare the country for war 
im just doing my job as president of the united states he 
said im not preparing anybody for anything im as determined 
as ive ever been that this aggression will not stand 
bush spoke at an airport news conference in san francisco after 
campaigning for republican sen pete wilson in his race for 
governor later he flew to oklahoma city to appear at the cowboy 
hall of fame with bill price the gop candidate for governor in 
oklahoma 
shrugging off his slump in the polls he accused democrats of 
trying to win elections through tax the rich class warfare kind 
of garbage 
i think people know that this congress is controlled by the 
taxers by the liberal democrats bush said in a sharply 
political attack eight days before election day 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii was echoing 
bushs tough gulf statements in a speech in los angeles 
we are exhausting every diplomatic avenue to achieve a 
peaceful solution without further bloodshed baker said but he 
added let no one doubt we will not rule out a possible use of 
force if iraq continues to occupy kuwait 
the white house policy in the persian gulf has won strong 
bipartisan support in congress although there is a growing feeling 
that bush should consult lawmakers before sending troops into any 
combat more than 200000 american forces have been deployed to the 
gulf after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
defense secretary dick cheney said last week that as many as 
100000 more troops may be dispatched 
the gulf crisis will be at the top of the agenda when bush meets 
with congressional leaders at the white house on tuesday the 
president also is to consult with cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who just returned from the 
middle east 
bush appeared unmoved by demands that congress should be asked 
in advance before he sends troops into action 
i know the authorities that a president has bush said 
im working to try to get this matter resolved peacefully we 
have a lot of force there and theyre well trained theyre highly 
motivated and that alone is sending an enormously strong signal to 
saddam hussein 
bush also said the soviet union remains aligned with the united 
states against iraq he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
is holding just as firm as he can and thats good you see 
because that sends a strong signal that the free world is united 
against this dictator 
the oklahoma stop concluded a fiveday campaign trip that took 
bush as far west as hawaii while congress was wrapping up a 490 
billion deficitreduction agreement bush said he had felt 
politically restrained while the agreement was being put together 
but now is taking off the gloves 
i dont like being on the defense he said i like being 
on the offense 
the president will hit democrats again in a speech in washington 
on tuesday and then hit the road thursday for nonstop campaigning 
until the election 
bush has paid a big political price because of his changes on 
taxes and because of democrats efforts to portray him and other 
republicans as defenders of the rich 
im used to that kind of demagoguery and so im out here now 
on the campaign trail laying it to rest bush said ive got to 
get that in focus because theyve been getting away with this tax 
the rich class warfare kind of garbage that they always resurrect 
at election time 
amid sharp republican divisions on taxes and the budget bushs 
popularity has dropped below 50 percent in the polls the lowest of 
his presidency 
these polls dont mean anything to me bush said 
the american people are fair he added they know im 
against taxes 
in the budget negotiations bush resisted increasing the tax 
load on the rich but in the end finally agreed to raise the tax 
rate on the highest income brackets to 31 percent from 28 percent 
now the package also chips away at highincome taxpayers itemized 
deductions

a popular toy known as the slapwrist 
bracelet may cause hand and wrist injuries to children the 
consumer product safety commission said monday 
the wrist bracelet is a thin strip of metal covered by woven 
fabric or paper the toy wraps into the bracelet when the wrist is 
struck with the bracelet 
the commission said the toys have passed tests given to items 
with sharp edges 
but the panel said it is concerned that over time the fabric 
or paper covering the thin metal may tear exposing the user to a 
sharp metal edge as a result lacerations may occur 
the panel said parents should alert children to the potential 
danger and should examine the toys frequently in the event a tear 
occurs the toy should be discarded 
the commission said it is continuing its investigation into the 
toy to see if further action is warranted the commission is 
responsible for product safety

the campaign manager for republican senate 
candidate hal daub raised more questions about democratic sen jim 
exons drinking habits and daubs wife denied allegations that her 
husband had abused her 
jim putnam said sunday that daubs campaign has been receiving 
reports from people who have seen exon appear intoxicated putnam 
said exons explanantion that medication he had taken years ago for 
gallbladder problems may have made him appear tipsy was 
insufficient 
now perhaps there is a medical explanation for this but it 
certainly cannot all be written off to a gall bladder condition 
putnam said in a statement 
in response exon campaign chairman charles pallesen called the 
news release a disgusting collection of falsehoods 
these actions are unfortunately becoming commonplace from a 
campaign that is broke in debt and floundering in the polls 
pallesen said 
exons lead has increased to 26 percentage points according to 
a poll taken last week by the omaha worldherald according to the 
poll exon was the choice of 55 percent twentynine percent said 
they would vote for daub in an aug 2830 survey this year exon 
was ahead by 16 points 
cindy daub meanwhile released a letter saying there is no 
truth to stories that her husband has abused her she said exon 
should apologize for remarks that she said gave the issue national 
prominence 
the spark that enlivened nebraskas senate campaign with issues 
of alcohol and spouse abuse came from former sen john tower of 
texas during an oct 11 visit on behalf of daub tower told 
reporters that exon had a reputation as one of the two or three 
biggest boozers in the senate 
putnam said exon should give the daub campaign and the news 
media authorization to check the senators hospital records 
insurance carrier and medicare 
only through a careful examination of insurance records will 
the extent of the senators true medical condition be known to the 
public putnam said 
pallesen said exon released information about his health in an 
oct 17 letter from his physician in washington dc dr robert 
krasner krasner wrote that exon underwent gallbladder surgery in 
1985 and took prescription painkillers for the condition 
once the rumors about exon had been raised daubs personal life 
also came under scrutiny 
daub who served four terms in the us house and and ran 
unsuccessfully for the senate in 1988 was asked about a 1978 
incident in which he suffered a stab wound in his home daub had 
said he fell and stabbed himself in the arm but rumors of a 
domestic incident persisted 
after daub called on exon to release his medical records exon 
suggested that daub release his family records a veiled 
reference to the domestic rumors 
in a letter to exon dated saturday and addressed to exons 
washington office mrs daub told exon when you held a news 
conference and implied that my husband beat me up which resulted in 
me going to socalled shelters that was the most heinous personal 
attack possible and unbecoming of a united states senator 
exon denied attacking the daubs 
i have made no accusations and spread no rumors about her or 
her husband exon said in a statement

tax initiatives in six states could result in 
reduced bond ratings at state and local level if passed by voters 
in the nov 6 election a wall street bond rating agency warned 
moodys investors service said tax initiatives in colorado 
massachusetts montana nebraska oregon and utah could if 
approved lower the confidence financial advisers have in those 
states 
they do introduce uncertainty said george leung a moodys 
analyst this year i think certainly its reflective of the mood 
the discontent amongst voters and also reflective of economic 
conditions 
moodys said in a report released last week that the initiatives 
could have serious consequences for state and local governments 
and result in reduced bond ratings 
in all of these states with the possible exception of utah 
many questions remain about how the proposals would be 
implemented moodys said in a report last week it said courts 
and state legislatures would probably have to resolve the 
ambiguities 
bond ratings are used as a guide for investors lowered bond 
ratings can result in higher interest payments for borrowing 
most states back their bonds with the full faith and credit of 
the state making payment of debt the highest spending priority 
financially ailing massachusetts already has the lowest bond 
rating in the country bond rating agencies have warned that 
passage of a proposal to roll back certain taxes and fees there to 
1988 levels could drop the states rating from its current level of 
baa to junk bond status 
in colorado and oregon the tax initiatives set more restrictive 
limits on property taxes other revenue sources and municipal debt 
in montana the initiative would replace all sales income and 
property taxes with a trade charge on business and financial 
transactions 
one nebraska initiative would impose a cap on annual expenditure 
growth while another would change the manner in which schools are 
funded the utah initiative would remove some items from the sales 
tax base 
moodys warned that municipal bond ratings also could also 
suffer if the initiatives pass 
if montanas initiative succeeds all ratings in the state 
would immediately be placed under review because the measure calls 
for a massive restructuring of state and local revenues for both 
operations and debt service moodys said 
montana and oregon currently have ratings of aa and utah has a 
rating of aaa on general obligation bonds which are backed by the 
states full faith and credit moodys does not have a general 
obligation bond rating for either colorado and nebraska because 
the states do not issues such bonds leung said 
the massachusetts initiative would reduce the personal income 
tax rate eliminating a surcharge collected in fiscal 1990 and 
1991 and would roll back other state taxes to their august 1989 
levels 
if it passes the initiative will cost the state an estimated 
128 billion in 1991 and 255 billion the following year 
opponents of the citizens for limited taxation proposal in 
massachusetts have argued the measure would gut state government 
programs 
howard foley president of the massachusetts high tech council 
a 200company business association that cosponsored the clt 
petition said the warning should have come two years ago when the 
states bond rating was still high 
i think the biggest problem is the continuing overspending of 
what we dont have foley said when asked about the prospect of a 
bond rating reduction perhaps if that option wasnt available 
wed pay more attention to balancing our books

the supreme court on monday let stand a ruling 
involving black voters rights that forces norfolk va to change 
the way city council members are elected 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by city officials 
on a ruling that the atlarge system used since 1918 in city 
council elections violates black voters rights 
at the same time the justices left intact the way sagauche 
county colo elects its governing board despite claims by hispanic 
residents who say their political clout is being blunted illegally 
the court also asked the bush administration for its views of an 
appeal by a rural arkansas countys black voters who say the 
election system used in party primaries and countywide general 
elections is racially biased 
in the norfolk case a federal appeals court panel ordered the 
city to switch to a singledistrict election system that will 
remedy the vote dilution arising out of the atlarge election 
system 
the norfolk city council has seven members elected to staggered 
fouryear terms elections for three or four of the council seats 
are held every two years candidates with the most votes citywide 
win and do not need a majority of the votes cast 
a group of black voters and the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people sued in 1983 
contending that the atlarge system illegally blunted the political 
clout of black voters 
norfolk one of virginias largest cities is 35 percent black 
in population blacks also comprise 35 percent of the citys 
registered voters 
the city council did not have a black member until 1968 and 
since then has had one black member most years 
the naacp and black voters who sued said if city council members 
were elected from seven singlemember districts black voters would 
be in the majority in three of the seven districts 
the colorado case centered on how saguache countys three 
commissioners are elected no hispanic has ever won a contested 
election in the county even though hispanics comprise 41 percent of 
the population 
the three commissioners must reside in different districts but 
elections are countywide and not confined to the district in which 
a candidate resides 
the stillpending arkansas case involves a law under which a 
candidate for a political partys nomination or for a countywide 
office must get a majority of the votes cast 
if no candidate wins an outright majority a runoff election is 
held two weeks later between the top two votegetters 
the justices were told that arkansas is one of 10 states 
employing such a system all of them in the south and all of them 
with a long history of purposeful racial vote dilution 
the other states were identified as alabama florida georgia 
louisiana mississippi north carolina south carolina texas and 
oklahoma 
the runoff system as it operates in phillips county ark was 
challenged as illegal by black voters who say their voting power is 
being diluted 
blacks comprise 47 percent of the votingage population in 
phillips county but no black candidate in modern times has 
received the democratic or republican nomination for or been 
elected to any countywide office 
the justice department in august sued to overturn georgias 
majority vote runoff system saying it has a chilling effect on 
black political participation 
some political observers say eliminating runoffs could help 
republicans in the south and southwest blacks and hispanics would 
win more democratic primaries they say only to lose general 
elections to gop candidates backed by white voters who had 
supported white democratic primary candidates

a top educator on monday said the country 
needs a national education index to serve as a benchmark for 
tates to measure student achievement and pinpoint failing schools 
or ineffective local leaders 
ernest boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching insisted during a fortune magazine 
seminar of businessmen educators and governors that the nation is 
more than ready for a national policy in education 
the message it seems to me is absolutely clear after 
years of vigorously defending local school control the nation is 
now supporting indeed almost demanding national leadership in 
education while still maintaining vitality at the local level 
its time to go beyond goals important as they are and 
begin to talk more precisely about education standards and how 
progress toward national objectives can be measured 
state must have clearly defined goals an assessment procedure 
requiring annual progress reports from schools and clearly defined 
methods of intervention in case a school is failing he said 
as part of intervention boyer said a state might put a school 
on probation or assign a senior adviser to the school who would 
spend time working with teachers counselors and administrators 
the state also should be given the authority to remove a principal 
superintendent or even a local school board 
a state might even close a school a strategy of last 
resort he said 
local school control is crucial but its insufficient in the 
end students must be served and if a school for whatever reason 
does not provide an effective education state officials have both 
a legal and moral obligation to intervene said boyer 
the index also should include 
school completion rates of students in every state this 
category would include a look at each students proficiency in 
english and mathematics performance on general knowledge tests and 
whether a state gives priority to writing 
the condition of teaching states would be judged on whether 
they have a plan for attracting outstanding students into teaching 
special strategies to attract teachers in math and science and 
requirements for training that include sabbaticals fellowships and 
teacher institutes teacher salaries also would be considered 
the schools climate as it relates to the quality of buildings 
classrooms and laboratories as well as class size 
financial support of schools states perstudent expenditures 
and other costs would be compared regionally so that costofliving 
can be considered equity in school finance would be a key 
consideration 
how schools are governed states must have clearly defined 
goals as well as intervention methods in case of a failing school 
boyer sidestepped the issue of who should be in charge of the 
national evaluation of school performance noting that both 
congress and the national governors association have been haggling 
over the issue the nga has set up a special board to handle the 
task and congress has passed two bills creating panels

less than one in 10 soviet respondents in a new 
poll expressed full support for their leaders and half said they 
had no confidence at all 
the poll by the independent allunion center for public opinion 
indicated that support for president mikhail s gorbachev and his 
government headed by prime minister nikolai ryzhkov has hit the 
lowest point since gorbachev took power in 1985 
the poll released by the independent news service interfax 
found only 6 percent of respondents gave full support when asked 
how much do you trust the national leadership now 
thirtytwo percent expressed qualified support and 50 percent 
had no confidence at all the rest had no opinion interfax 
reported 
the results were based on answers by 1356 people in 11 regions 
across the country interfax said however it gave no margin of 
error and didnt say when the survey was done there was no answer 
to phone queries at the center late monday 
a pol conducted last summer by the liberal weekly ogonyok put 
support for gorbachevs communist party at 30 percent below the 
red army the russian orthodox church and the national supreme 
soviet legislature 
the latest poll was released two weeks after gorbachev was 
awarded the nobel peace prize for helping end the cold war in 
contrast to his worldwide popularity gorbachevs domestic standing 
has been sliding for years even more severely the last year as 
shortages have worsened and nearly all the 15 republics have 
declared some form of sovereignty 
the poll also asked whether the emergency powers given to 
gorbachev by the supreme soviet last month will help stabilize 
the countrys economy 
more than half 54 percent said they doubted the presidential 
decrees would have a significant effect nearly onefifth said they 
thought the powers would help and the remainder had no comment 
gorbachev has issued about a halfdozen decrees so far 
including ordering a crackdown on black marketeers and demanding 
that staterun manufacturers and suppliers fulfill their contracts 
with staterun businesses officials have accused speculators 
of siphoning off the supplies for resale at high prices on the 
black market 
a majority of respondents also said they expected open 
hostilities to break out in the gulf although only 2 percent 
thought fighting would escalate into a third world war with the 
united states interfax reported 
fifteen percent were optimistic that a peaceful settlement could 
be reached and 23 percent expressed no opinion it said

a prison escapee charged with raping and murdering 
a little girl found dying in a laundry bag under his bed is a 
clear and present danger a judge said monday in ordering him 
held without bond 
alcides quiles 27 faces charges of firstdegree murder 
kidnapping and sexual assault in the apparent strangling sunday of 
joanna noda who would have turned 2 years old wednesday 
the victim was found the second time police searched quiles 
quarters 
he took the police into his apartment not once but twice 
marveled detective ronnie ilhardt and he sat right there while 
they were looking but when the body was found he ran out the 
door 
three years ago in hartford conn quiles was charged with 
raping a 6yearold friend of his son leaving the boy beaten 
bloody and unconscious in the snow the resulting publicity led two 
women one of whom was stabbed in a robbery the same day to 
identify him as their assailant as well 
quiles was sentenced to 18 years in those cases but escaped in 
august by climbing over a fence topped with razor wire at a 
minimumsecurity prison in enfield conn he had been transferred 
to the prison in june two years after he was sentenced 
he made his way to miami and rented a room under an assumed 
name police said 
he appeared monday before dade county judge murray meyerson and 
was quickly denied bond on the murder charge 
this court finds you are a clear and present danger the 
judge said to protect the community you will remain in custody 
no bond for you mr quiles 
joanna disappeared sunday morning triggering a frantic search 
by neighbors and police in her familys workingclass neighborhood 
quiles watched the search from his doorway across a fence from 
the noda home and told her family that joanna was bound to turn 
up said her cousin tanya lopez 
he said shes not in here you can check if you want 
said tanya who helped in the search and she was under the bed 
she was dead under the bed 
police were approached during the search by a woman who said she 
had seen a man running down the street after the little girl 
joannas father had apparently left a yard gate open when he 
rushed into his house to answer the telephone joanna then left the 
house and slipped through the gate to chase a chicken down the 
street 
the woman witness told police that quiles chased joanna in what 
appeared to be an attempt to keep her from running into the street 
but then took the little girls hand according to the police 
report after talking to the woman investigators returned to 
interview quiles again 
quiles told police a bag they spotted under his bed contained 
dirty laundry but the officers decided to check it

negotiators were communicating with him over the schools intercom

the rest of the 643student school was evacuated onto the school 
football field 
hostage negotiators were at the school and two state police 
chaplains were flown in members of deans family also were 
present including his father robin a civilian employee of the

anything jenkins said

the cuban government monday released a 
document on the 1962 missile crisis and reiterated its bitterness 
over the soviet decision 28 years ago to remove the missiles 
without consulting with cuba 
the government news agency prensa latina in a dispatch 
monitored in mexico city ran a description of the events it said 
was culled from a 200page secret document that fidel castros 
government just released 
twentyeight years after the october crisis that pushed the 
world to the brink of nuclear war the cubans maintain their claims 
from the era and reproach nikita khrushchev for having exluded them 
from secret conversations the article begins 
there appeared to be little new in the document and its release 
seemed to be in the nature of nursing an old grudge at a time when 
relations between the soviet union and cuba have hit a 
postrevolutionary low 
although the soviet union is still providing aid to cuba the 
soviet press recently has published a series of revealing 
unflattering reports including a rare portrait of castros 
personal life that said he has 32 houses a security contingent of 
9700 and five children by his present wife 
cuba has dedicated a new monument on the launch site for the 
rocket that shot down an american spy plane during the crisis 
prensa latina reported in a separate dispatch monday 
the monument contains a rock wall surrounded by palm trees 
symbolizing the decision of cubans to defend their territory it 
said 
in the summer of 1962 the soviet union began installing 42 
mediumrange nuclear missiles in cuba us spy planes detected the 
missiles and the united states began a naval blockade of cuba 
tensions peaked when cuba shot down a u2 spy plane on oct 27 
khrushchev submitted to president kennedys demand the missiles be 
withdrawn 
in newly released excerpts of his memoirs khrushchev called 
castro a hothead who wanted the soviet union to attack the 
united states during the crisis castro denied that story 
the document released monday said the soviet union had sent a 
delegation to havana in may 1962 to discuss installing the weapons 
as a means of discouraging the united states from attacking the 
island 
cuba accepted the plan in june after a meeting of the political 
leadership including castro his brother raul castro ernesto 
che guevara osvaldo dorticos blas roca and emilio aaragones 
it said 
the weapons mediumrange r12 missiles began arriving after 
raul castro visited moscow in july and signed a secret agreement 
according to the report 
about 43000 soviet soldiers officers and specialists were sent 
to cuba in connection with the deployment it said 
the soviet general in charge and his secondincommand had 
orders to use the missiles only in case of aggression by the 
united states and only under orders from moscow the report said 
the document whose origins and author werent specified 
expressed bitterness at khrushchevs neglecting to warn castro of 
his decision to pull back the missiles 
since the missiles had been installed under a military 
agreement between the soviet union and cuba it is totally normal 
that if something changed both sides be consulted the report 
said 
even if the hypothesis of lack of time is accepted as the 
cause for cuba not having been consulted khrushchevs answer to 
kennedy could have been we are in agreement with removing the 
rockets if the cubans demands for security are satisfied and of 
course if they participate in the negotiations it added 
kennedy pledged in a secret agreement that the united states 
would not attack cuba but castro said the guarantee was 
insufficient unless accompanied by withdrawal of naval and economic 
blockades an end to ciafunded harassment and closure of the us 
navy base at guantanamo 
today 28 years after the crisis the points expressed by 
fidel castro still apply the cubanus conflict is not 
resolved prensa latina said

the national endowment for the arts has 
quietly dropped a controversial requirement that grant recipients 
sign a nonobscenity pledge now that congress has voted to scrap 
explicit restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal 
subsidies 
the pledge instituted by endowment chairman john e frohnmayer 
late last year has spawned three federal lawsuits charging that it 
violated the constitutions freespeech guarantees 
at last count 16 artists and arts institutions refused to sign 
the pledge and forfeited more than 318000 in endowment grants 
last year 
the endowment made no formal announcement of mondays action 
but agency officials confirmed that the pledge had been withdrawn 
and would not be required as a condition of receiving grants for 
the 1991 fiscal year which began oct 1 
these officials would not permit use of their names 
last year frohnmayer ordered all grant recipients to promise in 
writing they would not violate a congressional ban against 
endowment support for works that may be considered obscene 
including depictions of homosexual or sadomasochistic activities 
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex 
acts 
endowment officials said they did not know if the pledge 
covering last years grant recipients would be repealed 
retroactively 
if last years grant recipients are still bound by the pledge 
said constitutional lawyer floyd abrams he will continue to press 
his lawsuit against the endowment on behalf of the new school for 
social research which is challenging the nonobscenity pledge in 
us district court in new york city 
it is hard to believe the nea would persist in a policy so 
plainly rejected by congress for the future abrams said in a 
telephone interview from new york 
if they insist on requiring this oath for fiscal 1990 
grants an ultimate judicial resolution will be required 
abrams said 
shortly before it adjourned last weekend congress junked the 
obscenity ban it imposed on the arts endowment a year ago and voted 
instead to leave judgments of obscenity to the courts 
the proposed new law awaiting president bushs signature would 
require the endowment to recoup its grant money from any recipient 
who is later convicted of violating obscenity laws 
the bill omits any explicit obscenity restrictions saying only 
that obscenity lacks artistic merit is not protected speech under 
the constitution and shall not be funded by the endowment 
the measure does require that grant awards take into 
consideration general standards of decency and respect for the 
diverse beliefs and values of the american public 
the bill also extends the endowments statutory authority for 
three years with a firstyear budget of 175 million a 4 million 
increase over last years current spending it approves a 
republicanbacked request that the state share of endowment grant 
money be increased from 20 percent to 35 percent over three years 
the national campaign for freedom of expression a nonprofit 
lobbying organization representing artists and arts supporters 
denounced the new proposed law as a more insidious form of 
censorship than the old obscenity ban 
joy silverman acting director of the group said the bill would 
transform the endowment chairman into the federal governments 
primary arts censor stifle artistic creativity and foster 
official art 
the new mandate of this nea will be not to support art but 
rather to ensure no one is offended by art she said

the soviet union has settled an american 
businessmans lawsuit with an undisclosed sum and acknowledgement 
that an allegation he was a spy was based on past 
misunderstandings 
an attorney for palo alto businessman raphael gregorian said 
monday the atmosphere of perestroika or openness in the soviet 
union helped resolve the bitter international dispute 
attorney jerry kroll said both sides agreed to keep their 
financial agreement confidential 
a settlement agreement approved by us district judge david 
kenyon last week and delivered to atorneys monday said the 
parties wish amicably to put an end to the disputes between them 
arisen from past misunderstandings 
kroll said that language was critical to gregorian who believes 
it absolves him of soviet accusations that he was a spy 
gregorian ran a 10millionayear business selling medical 
equipment in the soviet union until he was ousted from the country 
in 1984 amid allegations printed in the newspaper izvestia that he 
was a spy the soviets refused to return or pay for medical 
equipment gregorian left behind when he was forced out 
in a unique legal move he sued izvestia for libel and the 
soviet government for breach of contract he contended the timing 
of his ouster indicated it was retaliation for the us arrests of 
svetlana and nikolay ogorodnikov in a spy case involving former fbi 
agent richard w miller 
the lawsuit took a colorful path through the courts with 
gregorian first winning by default when the soviets failed to 
respond when kroll began seizing soviet assets in the united 
states to satisfy a 463000 judgment in gregorians behalf the 
soviets hired attorneys to fight back 
the soviets were backed by the us state department which said 
gregorian couldnt sue the soviet union because of the foreign 
sovereign immunities act 
eventually kenyon dismissed libel portions of the case but 
ruled the soviets owed gregorian 163165 for the medical equipment 
left in moscow an appeals court reversed that decision and sent 
the case back to kenyon in 1989 for a new trial 
the settlement precludes any new trial 
im very pleased about the outcome kroll said just the 
fact that they admit it was a misunderstanding clears my clients 
good name 
he said the seeds of the settlement were planted when he met 
last year with gennady gerasimov spokesman for soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
he subsequently met with soviet vice consul oleg tischenko in 
san francisco taking with him a copy of gorbachevs book 
perestroika 
i pulled out the book and said i read your boss book and i 
think what were doing in this case is inconsistent with 
perestroika kroll said he seemed to agree 
he said gregorian had put his life on hold while the lawsuits 
were pending 
hes glad that his name has been cleared kroll said hes 
now working on other business opportunities

prime minister margaret thatcher whose 
parliamentary majority is usually as faithful as lassie herself 
srvived a dogfight monday night in the house of commons to defeat 
a measure for stray canines 
legislators voted 274 to 271 to reject a compulsory dog 
registration plan aimed at dealing with an estimated halfmillion 
abandoned dogs who roam and foul the streets 
the compulsory plan by the opposition labor party and animal 
welfare groups was aimed at registering britains 7 million dog 
owners and tagging the animals 
the vote drew intense interest in britain a nation of animal 
lovers 
government ministers bitterly opposed the plan proposing 
instead to raise fines and give more powers to local authorities to 
pursue offenders but large numbers of lawmakers from mrs 
thatchers conservative party supported the measure mrs thatcher 
usually enjoys a 100vote margin in commons 
traditional british reserve went to the dogs as the two sides 
duked it out 
the debate could have taken place only in this country and in 
a nation reared on greyfriars bobby and thomas hardys dog 
wessex the times wrote in an editorial 
on monday the royal society for the protection of animals 
placed a graphic fullpage ad in the daily telegraph it showed a 
mountain of dead dogs over the message registration is better 
than extermination 
in april the proregistration forces narrowly lost a commons 
vote in favor of compulsory registration in the biggest revolt of 
this parliament by conservative lawmakers 50 of them defied their 
leaders to vote with the opposition and 46 abstained 
the governments hundredvote majority shrank that night to 12 
then on oct 23 the unelected house of lords voted to 
incorporate a national registration plan into the environment 
protection bill after mondays vote the bill will go back to the 
house of lords for a final vote 
the dogregistration crusade was led by one of mrs thatchers 
own partisans dame janet fookes who has championed it for 15 
years 
an estimated halfmillion abandoned dogs roam and foul the 
streets of britain the dogregistration campaign gained urgency 
from several wellpublicized incidents in which children were 
mauled 
according to recent polls by the royal society for the 
protection of animals 94 percent of people who are aware of the 
dog registration issue support it and 84 percent of local 
authorities favor some form of compulsory registration 
police farmers vets and other major organizations directly 
with dog welfare and control have also backed registration 
i think the government is in danger of losing it dame janet 
said of mondays vote 
in 1988 the government abolished dog licenses costing less than 
a dollar arguing that the fees cost more to collect than they 
raised in revenue 
dame janet said that program was ineffective anyway she 
advocates the registration of both dog and owner for an initial fee 
of around 38 
the funds raised would finance a national warden system dogs 
would be marked with tattoos or microchip implants for easy 
identification 
government ministers say registration would be ignored by the 
dog owners who now cause the problems and the fee would be just 
another burden on the poor 
government proposals include transferring responsibility for 
rounding up strays from police to local councils fining owners for 
dogs without collars and identity tags and creating a specific 
offense of letting a dog stray

the city police chief says an internal 
investigation will precede any request to involve state law 
enforcement officers in the case of three female dancers who 
wrestled nude in gelatin at a police night spot 
the dancers entertained saturday at the police club which was 
being used by a separate unrelated organization 
police chief charles austin said the outcome of the internal 
investigation will determine whether he will ask state law 
enforcement division to decide if any obscenity laws were violated 
austin said he also will conduct an internal investigation to 
see if any police had prior knowledge that nudity would be part of 
the entertainment when the police club was rented by an 
organization called the mens luncheon society 
if anyone on the force had prior knowledge then i have a 
serious problem with that austin said 
a member of the society who attended the party hayne hasell 
said about 200 men watched the gelatin wrestling 
the police club is operated by a private organization of the 
same name made up of columbia police personnel 
austin said an organization with as much visibility as the 
police club ought to have guidelines to make sure its facilities 
are used properly 
he said he never has been a member of the police club but does 
approve of the group 
thats the sad part about this austin said its a very 
legitimate group those guys have done a lot of good such as 
having christmas parties for kids 
the mens luncheon society is not connected with the police 
club city manager miles hadley said he said a police officers 
brother reserved the facility for the group

the security council voted monday to hold 
saddam husseins regime liable for human rights abuses and war 
damages during its 3monthold occupation of kuwait 
the vote was 130 with abstentions by cuba and yemen it was 
the 10th resolution condemning iraq since saddams troops overran 
kuwait on aug 2 and it warned of unspecified further action if 
iraq does not obey the council 
senior military officers from the five permanent security 
council members met to discuss implementation of the sanctions but 
the meeting ended early in the evening and no statement was issued 
us ambassador thomas r pickering delivered a warning of 
possible independent us action 
it is the solemn duty of every state to protect its citizens 
my government takes this responsibility most seriously pickering 
said in his council speech we join the council in this demand 
and we urge the government of iraq to comply but i want to 
underscore one point the united states will do that which is 
necessary to meet its obligation to its own citizens 
abdul amir alanbari iraqs ambassador to the united nations 
rejected the resolution he said the security council was applying 
a double standard in dealing more harshly with iraqs invasion of 
kuwait than with israels occupation of arab territories 
pickering said the iraqi speech was the greatest pack of 
distortions lies and bizarre tales that i have ever seen it was 
like bringing the fox in to advise on how to guard the henhouse 
the resolution also demands that iraq allow foreign governments 
to send supplies to their diplomats in occupied kuwait city the 
united states and britain are the only western nations with 
embassies still operating in kuwait 
the resolution which cites violations of the fourth geneva 
convention also hints at a future war crimes inquiry there was no 
specific mention of a tribunal or reparations 
the resolution did not establish a mechanism for collecting 
compensation but said all states should assemble information about 
losses of life injury and torture loss of revenue damage and 
loss of property 
the military meeting the highestlevel in many years at the 
united nations included lt gen michael carns director of the 
joint staff of the united states and colgen bronislav a 
omelichev first deputy chief of the soviet army 
the soviet union consistently has sought revival of the security 
councils military staffcommittee and has said it only would join 
an international military action in the gulf under a un umbrella 
during the security council meeting monday ethiopias envoy 
declared iraq shall be held accountable and indeed responsible 
for the lawlessness of its occupation forces and face the attendant 
consequences 
ambassador tesfaye tadesse told the council on behalf of the 
nonaligned movement and the organization of african unity that 
iraq has refused to comply with the will of the international 
community there is not the slightest indication from baghdad of 
any change of heart he said 
the council is left with no choice he said but to send a 
message that the unity and resolve of the council to end the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait is as strong as ever 
the resolution demands that iraqi forces stop mistreating and 
oppressing kuwaiti and other nationals 
it demands that iraq ensure immediate access to food water and 
basic services for kuwaiti nationals and foreigners in kuwait and 
iraq including diplomatic missions in kuwait 
western diplomats said privately that this could be the last 
resolution exhorting iraq to obey its resolutions and indicated the 
council would adopt a more actionoriented posture 
the council has been acting under chapter 7 which provides for 
security council sanctions and even collective military action 
against member states which threaten international peace and 
security 
the council already has invoked article 41 but has not exhausted 
its nonmilitary provisions which include interruption of economic 
relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and 
other means of communication 
article 42 the next step envisoned by some members calls for 
such action by air sea or land forces as may be necessary to 
maintain or restore international peace and security including 
demonstrations blockade and other operations by air sea or land 
forces of members of the united nations

a returning french captive on monday urged the 
united states and britain to do something for their hostages in 
iraq and kuwait because they are in very bad shape 
please take them away they cannot carry on much longer 
said the woman one of 263 french hostages and 19 other westerners 
who flew to freedom on an iraqi airways jet 
also on board were the last seven diplomats from the besieged 
french embassy in kuwait 
we want to tell the united states and britain to do something 
for their hostages they are in very bad shape the french woman 
said she spoke on condition of anonymity at baghdad airport 
the chartered boeing 747 arrived at midnight at charles de 
gaulleroissy airport most of those aboard were males clad in 
tshirts and business suits 
a former hostage in kuwait who identified himself as father 
sanchez said conditions were especially difficult for western 
captives held at strategic sites to ward off military attack 
they are never free never able to walk around he said 
there are ready to crack 
of his own captivity he said three years like that and i 
would die 
other hostages said iraqi troops in kuwait were gradually 
crushing the kuwaiti resistance and that sounds of gunfire 
indicating clashes have grown less and less frequent 
about 60 french citizens also believed to have been in iraq and 
kuwait were not on board a foreign ministry spokesman said some 
chose to stay behind and others may have managed to leave on their 
own 
isabelle renior the foreign ministry officer in charge of the 
hostage case said that one french citizen of italian oriigin was 
prevented from leaving iraq but had no further details 
i can say now that all french citizens who wanted to go home 
have gone home said andre janier the french charge daffaires 
in iraq 
baghdad announced last week that it would allow all french 
hostages to leave the move was widely interpreted as an effort to 
split the international alliance against saddam hussein 
france has stressed that it did not negotiate for the freedom of 
its citizens and has demanded that all foreign hostages be freed 
i express the joy of all the french people to those coming 
home president francois mitterrand said but we will rejoice 
fully only when the other hostages can return to their own 
countries 
the iraqi airways plane picked up evacuees in kuwait city in the 
early afternoon before flying to baghdad where hundreds of 
hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane landed 
nine greeks four britons two filipinos one german and one 
spaniard were also on board officials at the baghdad airport said 
about 2000 journalists and relatives cheered the aircrafts 
arrival in paris authorities closed one of the two main terminals 
forcing dozens of scheduled flights to reroute 
mitterrand spoke at a joint news conference with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev after signing a cooperation 
agreement between the two countries 
gorbachev said un sanctions against iraq should be 
intensified and suggested that saddam is beginning to yield to 
economic pressure he also said saddam would be making a mistake if 
he expected a split in the international alliance against him 
i think its unacceptable to have a military solution but 
president hussein should not indulge in speculation gorbachev 
said 
we want to do step by step everything that ensures that sound 
logic prevails and you cant call what they iraq have done 
anything other than adventurism 
gorbachev said saddams position may have shifted and suggested 
he might be receptive to a new interarab initiative possibly led 
by saudi arabia

harvard university said monday it will 
sponsor the annual international aids conference in 1992 four 
months after threatening to cancel the forum unless the united 
states removed travel restrictions on people infected with aids 
the conference the principal forum for presenting scientific 
information on the fight against the disease will go ahead in the 
last week of may 1992 school officials said 
in june the harvard aids institute threatened to withdraw as 
sponsor and cancel the conference to protest a us policy making 
aids infection one of several contagious diseases for which 
foreigners could be barred from the country 
but under a revised immigration bill passed by congress over the 
weekend health secretary louis sullivan would have the authority 
to remove aids and other diseases from the medical list for which a 
person may be denied entry 
sullivan has repeatedly said there is no reason to exclude 
people with aids because the disease is not passed casually but 
only by exchanes of blood or body fluids or by sexual contact 
the measure went to president bush who has indicated he will 
sign it as early as this week 
the conference is expected to attract about 15000 researchers 
policy makers community organizers and aids patients harvard

a sharply divided state republican party 
scrambled monday to pick a new gubernatorial candidate after jon 
grunseth stepped down because of allegations of sexual misconduct 
with just eight days before the election sept 11 primary 
runnerup arne carlsn hopes to parlay his weekold writein 
campaign into the gop ballot spot leaders of the partys ruling 
conservative faction balk at that believing that carlson is too 
liberal 
but with time so short some in the anticarlson camp agree 
their options are limited in their effort to unseat democratic gov 
rudy perpich 
pressure is really mounting to go with arne said frank 
graves a member of the republican national committee and one of 
carlsons biggest critics 
the thing that really worries me the most is with two liberals 
on the ticket perpich and carlson im afraid a lot of 
conservatives are going to stay home graves said if they stay 
home it hurts our candidates for constitutional offices and our 
legislative candidates 
grunseth withdrew sunday night citing enormous pressure 
from allegations that he encouraged teenage girls to swim nude 
with him nine years ago and had an affair during both of his 
marriages he has denied the poolparty claims and said the affair 
ended before he married his second wife in 1984 
an oct 1921 poll conducted after the poolparty allegations 
showed carlson leading perpich 51 percent to 41 percent but graves 
said monday its far from a sure thing that carlson could win a 
headon race against perpich on nov 6 
neither perpich nor his spokesman ray bohn returned a call 
seeking comment monday perpich declined to comment sunday about 
grunseths withdrawal 
a leader of the republican partys conservative faction 3rd 
congressional district chairman jim mullin said a certain 
number of antiabortion republicans will vote for perpich because 
carlson supports legalized abortions and perpich does not 
further complicating the question is the fact that party 
officials themselves arent sure what procedure to use in naming a 
replacement for grunseth the partys 14member executive committee 
is to meet tuesday evening to decide whether it has the power to 
name a successor 
later monday grunseth campaign official elam baer said 
grunseths running mate sharon clark has decided not to withdraw 
and as far as were concerned she is the republican candidate 
for lieutenant governor 
but secretary of state joan growe the states chief election 
officer said her office has concluded that clark is no longer a 
candidate 
our position is if one person on the team withdraws then the 
team no longer exists growe said 
growe said that if the party concludes there is no legal 
machinery to pick a new candidate so soon before the election 
state law calls for the primary runnerup carlson to go on the 
ballot 
graves said he wants the executive committee to name a 
candidate regardless of what legal advice party leaders receive 
i would recommend that we reject any notion of not doing 
anything of not taking any action he said my position is 
that the state executive committee should name someone even if 
its carlson 
but graves said he will push to have a conservative candidate 
named 
in august graves termed carlson not a republican but rather 
an opportunist who changes his views to fit the latest public 
opinion polls 
what i said then was the truth and it remains the truth 
graves said monday probably the only thing that has changed is 
that i probably would prefer to have arne carlson in there than 
than rudy perpich 
state gop chairwoman barb sykora said shes concluded that the 
only sensible option is the option that looks like we are legally 
bound to support arne carlson to the best of our ability and beat 
rudy perpich 
carlson said hes confident that party leaders will conclude 
that he should be on the ballot he also said hes trying to reach 
out to conservatives to bring them into this campaign however he 
said hes continuing his writein effort until the ballot spot is 
decided 
us sen rudy boschwitz the partys titular leader has called 
for republicans to unite behind carlson 
we cant bring a new candidate on at this point said 
boschwitz who had encouraged grunseth to step aside and who is 
also seeking reelection 
growe said republicans have until 5 pm friday to get a new 
candidate on the ballot

the chief government economist on monday 
angrily denied reports that millions of the african countrys 
citizens face starvation and said sudan would refuse relief even 
if there was famine 
col salah aldeen karar chief of the ruling juntas economic 
affairs committee told the official sudan news agency we will 
never accept any food assistance even if famine is declared in 
sudan 
on sunday the military junta leader lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir charged that foreigners were spreading false warnings of 
famine to make the government look bad 
sudan is not suffering from any famine in whatever form 
elbashir said those who speak of famine in sudan are only 
seeking to tarnish and create difficulty for the government 
karar charged that international relief agencies were 
responsible to a great extent for sudans current shortfall in 
grain supplies because they have bought large quantities of 
sudans staple sorghum on the open market to feed refugees he 
said 
this resulted in price increases for sorghum that put it beyond 
the means of many sudanese who otherwise would have been able to 
buy food karrar said 
karar said that if relief organizations want to help the country 
and feed people displaced by hunger they should bring their food 
from outside sudan 
witnesses testified in congress last week that a horrendous 
drought is coming to sudan and urged the junta to announce a 
famine emergency so an international relief operation can proceed 
roger winter director of the us committee for refugees a 
private group said famine of biblical dimensions threatens as 
many as 11 million sudanese 
andrew natsios the us governments top relief official 
accused elbashirs government of being increasingly indifferent 
if not overtly hostile to the relief efforts 
us officials have long accused the government which seized 
power in a military coup 16 months ago of preventing food from 
reaching the south where rebels have been fighting for autonomy 
since 1983 
karar said sudan no longer depends solely on rainfed projects 
but also is banking to a greater extent on lands in central sudan 
irrigated by nile river water 
a million feddans acres of sorghum have been cultivated this 
year in the irrigated areas he said this is expected to yield 
700000 tons in addition to the harvest of central sudans rainfed 
areas 
the foreign press is reporting untrue famine stories to 
demoralize the sudanese and ridicule the governments slogan we 
eat from what we cultivate karar said 
junta leader elbashir acknowledged that africas largest 
country has food shortages caused by late and insufficient summer 
rains but he claimed the shortfalls will last only until december 
when the winter harvest comes in 
one has to confess about the food gap of which some regions 
suffer mainly north kordofan and darfur in the west elbashir 
said in the last two months more than 10000 people in those 
sprawling regions of western sudan have migrated in search of food 
to makeshift camps near khartoum 
relief works here say it is early to speak of devastating 
famine but without a massive relief effort they say millions 
will be at risk by next spring or summer as this falls harvest 
becomes depleted before the next one is ready 
the strongmans comments did not quantify the extent of the 
current food gap speaking to visiting journalists last week 
agriculture minister ahmed ali genaif put the grain shortage at a 
million tons 
on sunday sudan news agency quoted droughtstricken darfurs 
deputy governor as saying the situation is reassuring and no 
famine is imminent as reported by the western media 
the agency also reported that col faisal medani mukhtar 
governor of neighboring kordofan had disclosed arrangements to 
meet an estimated grain shortage of 300000 tons in his region 
mukhtar told the agency that 200000 tons of sorghum and wheat 
already were shipped to kordofan this month from other parts of 
sudan

the youths stepfather rocky williams of charlestown said he 
believed dean had taken his 44calibre pistol to the school state 
police said they did not know what type of weapon the boy had 
williams said his stepson was suspended about two weeks ago 
after he accidentally set off a fire alarm he was suspended again 
last week for breaking a window williams said 
he was falling behind in his school work and was upset his 
stepfather said 
police refused to speculate on deans motives 
maybe the fact that hes 17 years old is as much reason as 
anything jenkins said

a jury was seated monday in a trial to decide who 
is the rightful owner of a 38caliber colt cobra revolver jack 
ruby used to kill presidential assassin lee harvey oswald 
the case before dallas county probate judge robert e price 
could end 23 years of legal wrangling between rubys heirs and 
jules mayer a lawyer who knew ruby and was named executor of the 
dallas nightclub owners estate 
but with the twists and turns the case has taken through the 
judicial system since ruby died jan 3 1967 nothing is certain 
the sixperson jury selected monday was expected to hear opening 
statements tuesday 
the court is dealing with the questions of how to distribute 
rubys assets and whether to remove mayer as executor mayer still 
practices law at age 82 
attorneys for rubys brother earl were expected to question 
mayers ability to handle the estate in light of his advanced age 
potential jurors were questioned about their views on mandatory 
retirement and a persons professional effectiveness beyond a 
certain age 
the most valuable asset in the estate is the 38caliber colt 
cobra ruby used to kill oswald in the basement of the dallas city 
jail two days after president kennedys assassination here in 1963 
ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to die in the 
electric chair a texas appeals court overturned the conviction in 
1966 citing reasons that included failure to move the trial from 
dallas ruby died at age 55 before a new trial could be held 
for years since then mayer and earl ruby have been fighting 
over ownership of the gun jack ruby bought for 6250 in a dallas 
gun shop 
the gun is stowed in a bank safe deposit box mayer estimates it 
could bring 125000 on the collectors market 
whatever its value mayer contends money from sale of the gun 
should go to pay off rubys debts he says they include the 65000 
it has cost him to handle the estate including the expense of 
fighting earl rubys lawsuits 
earl ruby of boca raton fla who is also acting on behalf of 
his sister and a nephew counters that mayer is trying to profit 
from the estate he wants the estate liquidated to pay off his 
brothers debts and wipe the slate clean 
he also claims that jack ruby gave him deathbed instructions to 
tear up the will in which he had named mayer executor 
apart from the coveted gun the estate consists largely of the 
clothes and jewelry ruby wore when he shot oswald and some 
personal papers 
earl ruby said monday that if he loses he will go home and 
cry a little bit but will not appeal 
regardless of the trials outcome its unlikely to be the last 
word on the gun matter 
last year the internal revenue service stepped into the case 
claiming that ruby owed 17000 when he died that amount the irs 
said has grown to 86010 with interest and penalties the state 
of texas also claims the estate owes it 1227 in back taxes 
earl ruby says the irs sacrificed any claim by waiting 22 years 
to act on it price has set a trial for february to hear the irs 
claim

thousands of illegal irish immigrants in new 
england new york and other places will have the chance to become 
legal citizens under provisions of an immigration bill awaiting 
president bushs signature 
in all the bill could provide more than 80000 permanent 
residency visas to irish immigrants by the turn of the century 
thats roughly double the number of irish visas granted throughout 
the 1980s the visas would be available to those living in ireland 
or illegal aliens living in the united states 
our offices in new york have been pretty well inundated over 
the last couple of weeks from prospective applicants sean 
minihane a lobbyist for the irish immigration reform movement 
said monday in boston particularly there will be a collective 
sigh of relief 
irish illegal aliens are concentrated in the boston and new york 
metropolitan areas new york city northeastern new jersey and 
southwestern connecticut account for roughly 70000 illegal or 
undocumented irish residents according to minihane the boston 
area has an estimated 25000 other pockets of irish residents 
include chicago hartford conn philadelphia and san francisco 
existing immigration law has cut off the supply of visas granted 
to ireland at well below the actual demand the current immigration 
formulas favor visa applicants who have recentimmigrant relatives 
already living in the united states countries such as cambodia 
vietnam and mexico 
the new bill would substantially boost the number of immigrants 
allowed into the united states each year especially those with job 
skills president bush has said he supports the legislation white 
house spokeswoman alixe glen said the bill could be signed into law 
as early as this week 
the bill would boost the current limit of 490000 immigrants a 
year to 645000 through the 1994 fiscal year after that the limit 
would be 675000 per year 
irish advocates told of illegal aliens unable to travel to 
ireland to attend a family funeral for fear they would not be 
allowed to return to the united states they told of skilled 
professionals and artisans forced to tend bar or mind children 
because they could not enter the job market 
you had young women forced to work as nannies or as waitresses 
because they couldnt teach here although they were teachers in 
ireland said frank costello who works on irish and immigrant 
issues for boston mayor ray flynn that was a waste of a 
tremendous amount of talent and education that could be put to our 
use 
in ireland there remains the problem of a flourishing education 
system turning out skilled graduates to an economy with 17 percent 
unemployment 
the irish government is delighted with this legislation 
said an official with the irish embassy in washington who asked 
not to be named by most economic forecasts we will be stuck 
with the problem of emigration until the next decade we are 
providing new jobs but not at a fast enough rate 
immigrants from italy and poland are among the other countries 
expected to benefit from the legislation but for the next three 
years ireland would be the only country with a guaranteed number 
of visas 16000 per year for a total of 48000 
after 1994 up to 7700 irish would receive visas annually under 
a diversity provision of the bill designed to offset the 
unfairness of past immigration formulas in addition irish could 
apply under the traditional categories of family ties and 
employment for the latter half of the decade ireland could reach 
the maximum allowable total for any country in a year 20000 
those numbers compare to the roughly 3000 to 5000 irish visas 
issued per year in the early 1980s and about 7500 in the latter 
part of the decade

hundreds of french citizens arrived in paris late monday after 
leaving baghdad on a flight to freedom following a threemonth 
ordeal in which they had been held hostage in iraq and occupied 
kuwait on the orders of saddam hussein 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii warned 
the united states would be quick to attack iraq if provoked 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said iraq would pay a 
terrible price if it lay a finger on israel 
there was no indication whether the unusually hawkish remarks 
in separate speeches monday were made in coordination or meant to 
respond to any specific threat from iraq 
the un security council voted to hold iraq liable for damages 
caused by its takeover of kuwait later officers from the five 
permanent council members met to discuss the sanctions in one of 
the highestlevel military meetings at the united nations but the 
session ended without a statement 
in paris throngs of family members and journalists cheered as 
the chartered iraqi airways boeing 747 carrying 263 french citizens 
and 19 other westerners touched down at paris charles de 
gaulleroissy airport at midnight 
among the frenchmen were the last seven diplomats who endured an 
arduous siege of their embassy in kuwait 
the iraqi jetliner picked up more than 50 french evacuees in 
kuwait city in the afternoon before flying to baghdad where 
hundreds of hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane 
landed 
about 60 french citizens believed to have been in iraq and 
kuwait did not leave a french spokesman said some opted to stay 
behind and others may have managed to leave on their own 
isabelle renoir the foreign ministry officer in charge of the 
hostage case said one french citizen of italian origin was 
prevented from leaving iraq she did not provide other details 
i can say now that all french citizens who wanted to go home 
have gone home french charge daffaires andre janier said 
hundreds of westerners remain in iraq and kuwait some detained 
at strategic sites as part of saddams human shield against 
attack by the usled multinational force some of the french 
citizens freed monday had been part of the shield 
the iraqis constantly move hostages from one site to 
another said freed hostage patrick moniodde a director of the 
french perfume company caron 
there was no hygiene he said toilets were very dirty 
but we always got medical care sure iraqis do not want to lose 
any hostages we are free today but it was terrible for others 
baker also offered new insights on the treatment of americans 
being held in iraq and kuwait 
these americans are forced to live on verminridden concrete 
floors they are kept in the dark during the day and move only at 
night they have had their meals cut to two a day many are 
becoming sick as they endure a terrible ordeal baker said 
baker is to travel to saudi arabia on friday 
moniodde said he met at least a dozen american and british 
hostages and noted they were very depressed 
the foreign ministry confirmed france will honor iraqs demand 
to fill the jetliner with medicine for the return flight medicine 
is excluded from the un embargo of iraq and kuwait 
president bush said the united states would have no hesitancy 
at all to use military force if provoked by iraq and indicated he 
feels no obligation to get congress approval 
but bush said at a news conference in san francisco he was not 
preparing anybody for anything im as determined as ive ever been 
that this aggression will not stand more than 200000 us 
troops have been sent to the gulf 
baker in a speech released in washington said iraq would 
suffer the most severe consequences if saddam decides to use 
chemical or biological weapons 
let no one doubt we will not rule out a possible use of force 
if iraq continues to occupy kuwait he said 
the un resolution the 10th since iraq overran kuwait on aug 
2 was approved by 13 nations cuba and yemen abstained 
abdul amir alanbari iraqs ambassador to the united nations 
said the resolution will make it possible for those who advocate 
war combat and aggression to explicitly say that they have 
exhausted all attempts to achieve peace and that they have failed 
and that the war option is the only option left 
in previous resolutions the security council has isolated iraq 
with an economic embargo and permitted un member countries to use 
warships to enforce it the council also has demanded iraq withdraw 
from kuwait and release all hostages 
the new resolution demands that baghdad allow food water and 
other supplies to be sent to western diplomatic missions in kuwait 
the united states and britain are the only western nations with 
embassies still open in kuwait in august iraq cut off water and 
electricity to all embassies that refused to close and relocate in 
baghdad 
french president francois mitterrand welcomed the release of the 
hostages saying i express the joy of all the french people to 
those coming home but we will rejoice fully only when the other 
hostages can return to their own countries 
mitterrand spoke at a news conference outside paris with 
visiting soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev said saddam should not expect to split the 
international alliance opposed to his seizure of kuwait 
we must not permit the iraqi regime to hope there will be a 
division a weakening of positions gorbachev said calling 
iraqs use of hostages amoral 
he said arab nations might now be able to resolve the persian 
gulf crisis 
it seems to me that the iraqis could be ready for this 
gorbachev said if we were to have an interarab meeting this 
would be the quickest way to a settlement 
gorbachevs middle east troubleshooter yevgeny primakov met 
with saddam on sunday and there was confusion about the success of 
his mission initial reports said primakov made little progress 
but on monday gorbachev said there were indications the iraqi 
president was being more flexible 
later monday however in a cnn interview saddam said that 
while the meeting was useful he repeated he had no intention 
of ordering his forces to leave kuwait 
saddam also said he hoped war would not break out but that iran 
and iraq which fought from 198088 were the only armies with 
wide experience in fighting wars in the region 
crude oil rose 167 to 3468 per barrel for december delivery 
on the new york mercantile exchange amid concerns that primakovs 
mission had failed 
saddam also told the cable news network it would be wrong to say 
nothing was accomplished by primakovs visit he said he told 
primakov how the solutions could be reached to many of the issues 
in the region

congress has left the future of aid to the 
philippines in the hands of the bush administration directing the 
transfer to that country of only about one fourth of the 681 
million that could go there 
the foreign aid bill sent to president bush during the weekend 
gives him broad discretion in how to allocate billions of dollars 
in military and economic assistance to several countries for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 
the president is expected to sign the 155 billion bill within 
the next few days and decide within a month how to dole out 
portions which congress has not set aside for specific countries 
congress required that certain amounts be given to some 
countries including egypt and israel but allowed the president 
more discretion than in the past for others 
the final version restores 60 million of aid that had been cut 
out of the bill for the usled multilateral assistance initiative 
for the philippines that brought the total for the program to 160 
million the same as last year the initiative is aimed at 
providing up to 10 billion in aid and loans to the philippines 
from several countries over five years 
bush also has the authority to allocate an additional 40 
million for the program as well as all or part of the 456 million 
he pledged in military and economic aid tied to the presence of 
us military bases in the philippines 
last year the amount bush pledged was cut by 96 million 
bringing complaints from president corazon aquino and clouding 
current talks over the future of the bases 
an additional 25 million each year is tied to the bases 
agreement but it is provided under separate legislation in the 
form of housing investment guarantees 
altogether congress gave bush authority to disperse more than 
2 billion in aid that it did not designate for specific countries 
but it cut about 700 million from his overall foreign aid request 
leaving it to the administration which programs to reduce

congress has cut off all military aid to the 
central african country of zaire and required that any other 
assistance go only to nongovernment groups because of alleged 
corruption and human rights abuses 
the restriction in the foreign aid bill that passed both houses 
of congress during the weekend includes a provision that will allow 
aid to groups that work with the zaire government on humanitarian 
programs 
the bill also allows funds for an ongoing child survival program 
which the us agency for international development is operating 
with the zaire government 
us aid to zaire last fiscal year totalled close to 54 
million including 4 million in military help the bulk went to 
food and development programs 
the bill for the fiscal year that began oct 1 does not 
designate specific amounts for programs in zaire but leaves it up 
to the administration to decide how much to designate 
president bush is expected to sign the foreign aid bill within 
the next few days 
a congressional report accompanying the legislation cited 
numerous reports from reputable human rights organizations 
detailing a continuous pattern of human rights abuses by zairian 
security forces 
amnesty international accused zaire in a report last month of 
continued violations by government security forces including 
violent repression of government opponents 
the report said that although abuses have diminished in recent 
years incidents of banishment torture and detention without 
charge or trial are being uncovered 
president mobutu sese seko who has ruled the country for 25 
years has promised political reforms in april he gave citizens 
the power to form political parties and trade unions 
but the report by the senate appropriations committee said 
optimism about reform in zaire was fleeting and has been followed 
by delays and brutal attacks by mobutus security forces against 
prodemocracy youths 
the zaire government said that a may 11 incident involving 
lubumbashi university students left one dead and 13 injured but 
news reports in europe said the death toll was between 50 and 150 
the committee does not believe it is in the interest of the 
united states to provide financial support to a corrupt government 
that continues to flagrantly violate fundamental human rights 
the congressional report said 
while the committee recognizes the dire needs of the zairian 
people who are among the poorest in the world it cannot support 
aid that legitimizes or supports the mobutu regime it said

nelson mandela said he was disappointed at prime 
minister toshiki kaifus rejection monday of a request for 25 
million in aid to the african national congress 
kaifu told the anc deputy president that japan cannot grant the 
aid because it does not give assistance to political parties 
instead he offered money to south african groups working to 
improve living conditions in south africa news reports said in 
addition blacks would be eligible to come to japan for 
occupational training under un auspices 
mandela who was freed in february after more than 27 years in 
prison is to make a rare speech by a nonhead of state in 
parliament on tuesday he arrived saturday for a sixday visit 
in his 50minute meeting with kaifu mandela said the anc wanted 
the money to help 20000 political prisoners due to be released 
soon by the south african government the news reports said 
mandela said other countries have pledged money to the anc and 
he hoped japan would make an exception in its funding rules the 
kyodo news service reported the report quoted an unidentified 
foreign ministry official 
kaifu told mandela that japan has given 14 million worth of 
assistance this year to black south africans kyodo reported 
mandela was asked in a television interview to comment on the 
controversy over a slur against blacks last month by japans 
justice minister seiroku kajiyama 
mandela said this is a matter which i would like to leave in 
the hands of the leaders of this country 
kajiyama provoked protests in japan and in the united states 
when he compared prostitutes in tokyo to blacks in america who 
ruin the atmosphere of neighborhoods they move into 
he later apologized and was reprimanded by kaifu but was allowed 
to keep his job despite calls for his resignation 
japan has banned direct private investment in south africa since 
the 1960s and does not have an ambassador in pretoria although it 
maintains diplomatic relations with south africa

japans ambassador to washington said monday 
he would welcome more teaching in japanese schools about the 
concerns of such us minorities as blacks and jews 
i can say categorically that antisemitism has no roots in 
japan ambassador ryohei murata told a gathering of the american 
jewish committee in what was described as the first speech by a 
japanese envoy in washington to a jewish group 
many japanese are really ashamed of the recent slur against 
africanamericans by their countrys justice minister he added 
later in answer to a question 
both murata and his hosts agreed that all concerned have 
recognized and are addressing the problem of a knowledge gap about 
each other on the part of the japanese and the israelis and the 
japanese and american jews africanamericans and other us 
minorities 
meanwhile japaneseisraeli relations are expanding said 
murata 
we know quite a lot about the holocaust in which millions 
of jews were killed in world war ii but there is no systematic 
teaching or education about it the ambassador said i would 
welcome more efforts be made to enhance understanding and knowledge 
about how the jewish people suffered 
we have been discussing with africanamericans increasing 
awareness of minority issues in the united states he added 
murata said that as ambassador i worked rather hard dealing 
with the uproar in the united states stirred by japanese justice 
minister seiroku kajiyamas remark in september comparing american 
blacks to prostitutes moving into and spoiling residential 
neighborhoods 
he said he had met with leaders of the congressional black 
caucus and the national association for advancement of colored 
people who have threatened a consumer boycott of japanese imports 
kajiyama apologized for his words and was publicly reprimanded by 
prime minister toshiki kaifu 
we should take steps so we can have more constructive 
relations with minority people in the united states said the 
ambassador one reason many of his countrymen are insensitive to 
their concerns he said is because japan itself is such a 
homogenous society with only very small minority groups 
as for antisemitism he said the problem was almost total 
lack of knowledge in japan about jews providing unwarranted 
prominence three years ago for several books with inaccurate 
portrayals of jews and judaism some of those books sold well at 
one time but that phenomenon does not exist any longer

swooped down and stole it 
he just snatched that thing and didnt even pause gunstrom 
said the one dog couldnt believe it 
it was the only duck gunstrom saw all day but he doesnt 
begrudge the eagle an easy meal 
no he can have it said gunstrom a biologist with the 
state department of fish and game it was worth the trip just

william french smith one of ronald reagans 
kitchen cabinet confidants who helped make the former president a 
millionaire and served as his first attorney general died monday 
of cancer he was 73 
smith led the reagan administrations conservative shift on a 
number of issues affecting domestic policy notably civil rights 
under his influence the administration took a more 
laissezfaire attitude toward antitrust law even though it 
presided over the breakup of the american telephone and telegraph 
co 
a navy officer during world war ii smith later became reagans 
personal attorney helping guide the investments that made the 
former actor a millionaire 
smith served as the informal chairman of the presidents kitchen 
cabinet a group of california millionaires who saw reagan socially 
and helped pick his first cabinet others in the group included 
justin dart walter annenberg verne orr william clark alfred 
bloomingdale and holmes tuttle 
smith was surrounded by his family when he died at the 
university of southern californias kenneth norris jr cancer 
hospital where he was admitted oct 2 said spokeswoman betsy 
bates 
ms bates said that at the request of the family the hospital 
withheld details on smiths cancer 
william french smith served his country with the greatest 
dedication and distinction reagan said in a statement as 
attorney general he brought talent wisdom and the highest 
integrity to the department of justice 
nancy and i are deeply saddened today he said we have 
lost a dear friend who we will always remember with the greatest 
respect and affection 
norman barker managing partner of gibson dunn amp crutcher the 
prestigious los angeles law firm smith joined after leaving the 
navy in 1946 said smiths list of accomplishments go on and on 
and on smith was the firms specialist in corporate relations 
with labor 
a member of an old new england family smith was born aug 26 
1917 in wilton nh and raised in boston he graduated from the 
university of california at berkeley in 1939 and received his law 
degree from harvard in 1942 
smith was appointed the 74th attorney general of the united 
states in 1981 and served until 1985 he was followed by edwin 
meese iii 
at his confirmation hearings the publicityshy smith responded 
to virtually every question by saying he would have to study the 
matter 
early in his tenure a magazine story quoted an administration 
official as calling him a somnambulist or sleepwalker a 
description that rankled him 
but if he started slower than his predecessors smith altered 
more department policies more sharply than any attorney general in 
a generation 
among the changes in which he played a key role were the 
appointment of the first woman sandra day oconnor to the supreme 
court legislation overturning a 100yearold ban on military aid 
to civilian law enforcement relaxation of rules against corporate 
mergers which had not been changed in 15 years and halting the 
justice departments advocacy of mandatory busing to desegregate 
schools and of hiring and promotion goals to remedy job 
discrimination 
solicitor general kenneth starr who served as a partner in 
smiths law firm and later as his chief of staff in the justice 
department called his former law partner and mentor an immensely 
gifted lawyer with marvelous sound and wise judgement and 
unfailingly kind and thoughtful 
it was one of the ironies of his tenure that it was a tenure 
characterized by such farreaching and profound change in the 
direction of the federal legal system that it was done in a 
quintessentially quiet prudent and lawyerlike fashion starr 
said 
terry h eastland a former aide to smith and later the justice 
departments chief spokesman under meese said smith was someone 
who was concerned about getting the law right about doing the 
right thing in a particular instance 
eastland now a conservative commentator and legal affairs 
writer and starr credited smith with formulating the reagan 
administrations response to the growing drug problem the regional 
task forces for the drug enforcement administration were set up 
under smiths leadership 
he was one of the early proponents of the proposition that 
drugs are causing crime starr said he felt strongly about 
that 
former appellate judge robert h bork whose supreme court 
nomination was defeated by the senate in 1988 called smith a 
very thoughtful man who played a lowkey but important role in 
picking judges for the federal bench 
since he was the one who talked me into becoming a judge i 
happened to think he is a good judge of judges said bork who 
was appointed to the us circuit court of appeals for the district 
of columbia by reagan 
smith was one of 60 patients being treated at the kenneth norris 
jr hospital which specializes in experimental treatment ms 
bates said she did not know if smith was undergoing experimental 
treatment 
the hospital is associated with the university of southern 
california and is one of 24 comprehensive cancer centers in the 
nation designated by the national institutes of health

state attorney general steve clark 
proposed marriage and got his engagement ring returned to him over 
dinners paid for by the state his former fiancee testified monday 
carrie christie an atlanta lawyer testified about more than a 
dozen meals and trips she took with clark in 1986 and 1987 
the trial of clark 43 on a charge of theft by deception 
entered its second week monday three of his former girlfriends 
including a former fiance testified about hotel bills and lavish 
meals that clark paid for using a stateissued credit card 
the prosecution rested its case monday 
defense attorney bill bristow said he would ask the judge to 
dismiss the case tuesday failing that he planned to call clark to 
the stand he said 
ms christie said she traveled to washington dc twice to 
meet clark while he prepared to argue on the states behalf before 
the us supreme court she said she also traveled to san francisco 
and new orleans with clark 
she said he arranged dates with her in atlanta while he was on a 
stopover to catch another flight to attend to state business 
elsewhere 
ms christie also told the jury that clark routinely jotted 
notes on the back of his visa receipts after dinner that testimony 
could be key because clark has claimed he made mistakes in his 
record keeping while trying to update his expense claims 60 to 90 
days after the fact 
the prosecution says clark used a stateissued visa card to wine 
and dine family friends girlfriends and political supporters he 
could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined 15000 if 
convicted 
the defense argues that the seven elected officials whose titles 
are in the state constitution including clark are exempt from 
state spending laws and regulations 
a state auditor testified monday that clark received 14000 
over two years from lawyer ed miller to pay his rent and a utility 
bill miller listed clark as a guest at seven statepaid meals 
worth 1414 
prosecutors are attempting to show clark used state money to woo 
political and personal contributors 
cheryl pruett of germantown tenn who works in a bank said 
she spent the night with clark at a memphis hotel and the defense 
said records show the state paid for the room and food service ms 
pruett also said she was in hawaii with clark in december 1986 when 
he used a state credit card to pay 571 for a lunch after a 
wedding 
karen aufdenberg of little rock who recently left a job at the 
little rock chamber of commerce testified that clark paid for at 
least eight meals with her that he billed to the state 
among the statepaid meals ms christie testified about was an 
august 1986 dinner at an atlanta restaurant clark wrote on his 
expense forms that georgia attorney general michael bowers attended 
the meal to discuss medical fraud investigations 
ms christie said bowers was not at the meal and state business 
was not discussed she said it was her first date with clark 
during a march 1987 weekend in washington where clark and 
several staff members went to prepare for the supreme court 
appearance ms christie said he proposed to her over a statepaid 
meal 
in august 1987 clark and ms christie had dinner in atlanta 
the meal was written off to the state but ms christie said the 
main thing that was discussed was her decision to break off the 
engagement 
they dated occasionally after that she said 
clarks attorney bill bristow got ms christie to acknowledge 
that state business or law was discussed at some of the meals she 
was a law student at the time she said the main topic at any meal 
with clark was his ambition to be governor 
dozens of people clark listed as guests at statepaid meals say 
they didnt eat with him some say they picked up the tab clark 
bought fancy food expensive wine and courted women with the credit 
card according to some of the 126 witnesses who testified last 
week 
bristow has said none of that is against the law for a man who 
is on the job 24 hours a day

the widow of a brewery worker who became 
an alcoholic taking advantage of free beer at work is entitled to 
workers compensation benefits an appeals court said in a ruling 
issued monday 
ruling on the case of casimer a gacioch who worked at the 
stroh brewery co the state court of appeals said alcoholism is 
like any disease and workers are entitled to compensation if the 
work environment aggravates their condition 
while gacioch was predisposed to alcoholism before the brewery 
hired him he was not an alcoholic when he got the job the court 
said 
the circumstances of the job shaped the course of gaciochs 
disease the court said aggravating and accelerating the 
underlying alcoholic predisposition to the point of uncontrolled 
addiction thus constituting a personal injury under worker 
compensation laws 
gacioch drank only three or four beers on weekends when he began 
working on the assembly line at strohs in 1947 said norton cohen 
an attorney for gaciochs widow wanda 
strohs policy following a 300yearold european tradition 
permitted workers to drink all the beer they wanted during breaks 
and that contributed to gaciochs alcoholism cohen said 
by the time he was fired in 1974 gacioch was drinking 12 
bottles of beer a day cohen said 
gacioch died in 1977 when his hospital bed caught fire while he 
was smoking at the time he was being treated for severe liver 
problems caused by his drinking his widow could receive 106 a 
week in workers compensation benefits 
an attorney for the brewery failed to return a telephone call 
seeking comment

the cost of americas failure to ensure that 
pregnant women receive proper care can be calculated in the 
millions of dollars but it also can be measured in the tortured 
body of an infant born too soon and too small as mitchell 
landsberg finds in the last of a threepart series surviving 
year one

eric could almost fit in his fathers hand 
if his father were there to hold him he is so small so weak so 
sick a little boy pushed into the world far before his time 
he is kept alive by machines machines make eric breathe and 
machines keep eric warm machines feed him and machines record his 
heartbeat his pulse rate his temperature 
he lives in a sterile glass crib surrounded by banks of 
blinking lights tangled in a webbing of tubes and splints and 
bandages his eyes and his mouth open and shut and he writhes 
gently for all the machinery it is human suffering that contorts 
his face and a human will that keeps his tiny heart beating 
it shouldnt have been this way eric was born six months into 
his mothers pregnancy without benefit of meaningful prenatal care 
or decent nutrition and most likely with the damaging effects of 
drugs 
now eric like his sister before him is in the neonatal 
intensive care unit at the childrens hospital of new jersey here 
in the corroded core of one of americas poorest cities doctors 
and nurses struggle daily to save babies who enter life too soon 
too sick and too small 
this is so typical says social worker debbie beacher who 
has just finished listening to erics mother recite her story of 
drug abuse and homelessness an unwed mother young a drug 
abuser has a baby born prematurely that ends up in this unit 
it is like this around the nation in cities big and small in 
places like the hospital for sick children in washington dc and 
valley childrens hospital in fresno calif 
were seeing a growing need for our kind of hospital in just 
the past few years said dr edna leung a pediatrician at the 
hospital for sick children its sad we enjoy what we do but 
we just wish we could make some of these problems go away 
the problems wont go away and their legacy is children like 
eric society pays and the costs are enormous 
it costs about 600 to administer prenatal care to a woman 
during the nine months of a normal pregnancy drug treatment for a 
crack addict costs about 5000 
without prenatal care without drug treatment the risks of a 
woman delivering a premature low birthweight child increase 
dramatically and so do the costs 
it costs an average of about 25000 to treat a low birthweight 
infant one under 55 pounds for extremely low birthweight 
babies under 165 pounds the average is more than 100000 
thats an average some cost far more 
once the point would have been moot such tiny babies would 
have died at birth but medicine has made tremendous strides in 
saving them 
between 1980 and 1987 the infant mortality rate in the united 
states dropped by about 20 percent during the same period the 
percentage of infants born to mothers who had no erly prenatal 
care scarcely changed and the percentage of low birthweight 
infants actually increased 
since birthweight is the single most important indicator of 
infant health the meaning is clear children are being born sicker 
than ever and medicine is using superior technology to keep them 
alive 
in fresno dr nadarasa visveshwara has been treating a baby 
that weighed exactly 1 pound at birth the childs mother who is 
on medicaid had received very little prenatal care 
the baby is now six months old the medical bills have topped 
750000 and probably will be around 1 million by the time the 
child is released from the hospital 
the prospects for the child ever enjoying a productive life 
visveshwara said are very poor 
does he ever ask is it wise to save such children 
almost all the time he said because we hesitate to 
produce an infant who will be a burden to the parents and to 
society and who wont be able to lead a productive life but 
the baby always gets the benefit of the doubt 
eric whose real name is being kept confidential weighed 
slightly more than 2 pounds at birth in 1960 his odds of 
surviving infancy would have been about one in 10 today they are 
better than 5050 
his medical bills are around 100000 and climbing and his 
parents have no ability to pay his birth was costly but not in 
financial terms alone there is an incalculable cost in pain and 
suffering in emotional distress and social disruption 
these are statistics for extremely low birthweight infants 
those somewhat smaller than eric 
90 percent will suffer respiratory problems 
70 percent will have brain hemorrhages 
80 percent will have heart problems 
50 percent will have liver problems 
5 percent to 10 percent will be blind 
2 percent to 3 percent will die of sudden infant death 
syndrome 
of those who survive 40 percent will be mildly handicapped 40 
percent will be severely handicapped and 20 percent will be normal 
theres more premature infants are much more likely than other 
children to have cerebral palsy they are much more likely to have 
learning disabilities later in life and children who spend their 
infancy in a hospital will have difficulty bonding with their 
families a trait also widely attributed to children exposed to 
drugs in the womb the longterm emotional costs are yet unknown 
theres just not that closeness and these kids have more 
difficulty when we get them home said dr john h niles jr 
president of the medical society of the district of columbia 
theyre just not the joy that a baby should be 
its like a vietnam kind of thing niles added these kids 
have been in a battle and there are going to be some scars and 
society is going to pay for those scars 
the easiest way to avoid the scars most people believe is to 
make prenatal care widely available and do whatever it takes to get 
women to take advantage of it 
the most commonly repeated statistic about prenatal care is that 
every 1 spent on it will save 330 in future medical costs 
dr shyan sun director of neonatology at the childrens 
hospital of new jersey is a skeptic he shuffles through a file 
drawer to pull out a list of everything his patients have going 
against them they are poor they are young they are unmarried 
uneducated they abuse drugs they drink they smoke 
one cannot naively believe that prenatal care alone will solve 
the problem sun insisted i am not optimistic that we will 
make a difference in the near future we still have to take care of 
all these social problems

and sisters all were born prematurely too she is a small woman 
with sharp features and a dull stare eric is her fifth child all 
have been born prematurely and small 
my 2yearold he came home on a heart monitor so i dealt

biggest of everybody he was 4 pounds 13 ounces 
jane was living in a homeless shelter during her pregnancy with 
eric she says she tried to get prenatal care but the doctor had 
an attitude and lectured her about eating corn chips she didnt 
go back 
she insists she stopped doing drugs before her pregnancy her 
social worker says thats a lie since eric was born the hospital 
has had to ask the police to pick up jane every time it needs her 
consent to perform surgery 
i hate to come here jane says it gets depressing seeing 
all those babies like that god forbid i get attached to him and he 
dies then ive got a real emotional problem there im not saying 
i dont love him but i just dont like seeing him like that

joseph kelly crockett snuggled next to his 
mother too young to do much of anything except eat sleep and cry 
too young to know that he is starting life a step behind most other 
babies 
despite citywide efforts to improve health care services and 
lower indianapolis skyhigh infant mortality rate josephs mother 
struggled to get caseworkers at the marion county welfare 
department to extend medicaid to her fourth child 
they dont care or they dont want to care said lisa 
carter 24 its too much of a headache for them its almost as 
if youre asking them for 20 out of their pocket 
joseph was born prematurely he was delivered at 36 weeks by 
emergency caesarian and weighed 5 pounds and it took seven weeks 
before joseph was added to the welfare rolls before he could 
receive medicaid aid to families with dependent children food 
stamps 
in the interim the pediatrician and hospital didnt press for 
payment but miss carter had to pay for his food and transportation 
to the doctor herself 
josephs father tried to help but judging from the support he 
gave lisa during her pregnancy she knows she couldnt count on 
him 
nor could she count on the welfare department the conscientious 
caseworker who handled her file for two years recently quit with 
her departure returned the threats that the familys medicaid and 
aid to families with dependent children would be cut off because of 
improper paperwork 
but then miss carter says her medicaid coverage has been taken 
away twice both times unjustly she believes 
miss carter was 5 when her mother was murdered but she overcame 
that to become an a student in school 
at 16 her first child taron smith was born but she overcame 
that to graduate from high school 
two years later she was working toward an associates degree in 
secretarial sciences when her grandmother became ill she quit 
school to care for her and never returned 
at 19 her daughter shenika was born weighing just 4 pounds 12 
ounces miss carter had become a single teenage mother with two 
young children and she couldnt find a way out 
im not stupid but i have had plenty of tragic situations in 
my life she said but i cant use that as a crutch 
in indiana a family of four must be living below 327 percent 
of the federal poverty level bringing in less than 385 a month 
to be eligible for medicaid and afdc only alabama arkansas 
louisiana new mexico north carolina texas and west virginia have 
stricter standards 
for pregnant women and children under 6 years old the picture 
is brighter because of federal mandates 
in april congress required all states to provide medicaid 
coverage to pregnant women and young children with family incomes 
below 133 percent of the federal poverty level 1972 per month 
for a family of four 
miss carter feeds clothes and shelters her family on child 
support she receives from the childrens fathers and on her 405 in 
monthly afdc payments the states maximum payment for a family of 
five thirtysix states have higher payments 
even a parttime job at minumum wage would boost her income 
above the states limits she and her oldest child would be 
ineligible for medicaid and the whole family would lose its afdc 
and food stamps 
still miss carter has goals shes looking for a job that pays 
enough to take care of her four children she wants to return to 
school 
my situation is not something thats good for my baby or my 
other three babies she said i want to help myself but i need 
support and i dont have any

the international monetary fund which pumps 
billions of dollars into debtplagued economies around the world 
is taking on a project closer to home building a new church for a 
small congregation thats been its neighbor since 1973 
some time in the next few weeks the imf expects to close a deal 
to acquire the quarteracre property of the western presbyterian 
church bringing to a close negotiations that began in the 1960s 
in return the fund is buying a new site a few blocks away 
where it will build western presbyterian a new slightly larger 
home with a kitchen for feeding the homeless 
it will move the churchs english gothic sanctuary fieldstone 
by fieldstone and stained glass window by stained glass window and 
rebuild it as part of the new structure 
not only that it will provide western presbyterian with an 
endowment reported to be 4 million to do such things as 
construct housing for the homeless and help two congregations in 
ghana build churches 
all in all counting acquisition costs and an 85 million 
construction budget the deal totals around 225 million 
so how did a church with about 135 worshipers on a good sunday 
come into such a bonanza 
one might say by being in the right place at the right tim 
in the 1960s the imf a specialized agency of the united 
nations with the mission of stabilizing currency exchange found 
itself short of space and in need of a new home 
it found the location it wanted three blocks from the white 
house and next door to the world bank 
since the block was residentially zoned at the time the only 
way the imf could get the bulk and density it wanted for an office 
building was to offer forth a plan that contemplated developing the 
entire block said james b kaiser imf projects manager 
there was just one problem the western presbyterian 
congregation didnt want to move from the block 
the church started in 1855 was already in its third home its 
first was a warehouse not far from the new site after a few years 
there the congregation built a new church across the street from 
its present structure it moved to its current location in 1935 
the sanctuary is gorgeous and they didnt want to lose 
that said the rev john w wimberly jr pastor of western 
presbyterian 
also they might have had to move out into the suburbs where 
land prices are somewhat cheaper 
there was considerable sentiment about the symbolic value of 
having the building located here in the middle of what people call 
the wall street of the world wimberly said 
so the imf proceeded to develop the rest of the block finishing 
one phase in 1973 and the second 10 years later with the church 
nestled into a ushaped green space 
meanwhile the funds staff continued to grow it now numbers 
about 2000 from 100 countries since only 1700 could be squeezed 
into the building the agency paid an estimated 3 million a year 
to lease office space for the other 300 
it came to our attention a couple of years ago that there had 
been some changes that would make it more favorable for us to 
reopen negotiations said kaiser 
the church was growing too when wimberly became its pastor in 
1983 he said there had been about 90 people in the congregation 
and most of them were over 65 now about half of the 135 worshipers 
are 45 or younger 
western presbyterian began feeding the homeless and now feeds 
about 200 using a kitchen designed for potluck suppers it threw 
open its doors for noontime meetings of alcoholics anonymous and 
groups grappling with drug problems 
the church was still reluctant to move and the imf asked if 
there were any conditions under which the congregation might 
consider it 
western presbyterian listed some 
they wouldnt leave the neighborhood 
imf would have to rebuild the sanctuary as it was 
they would need a commercial kitchen to feed the homeless 
they wanted air conditioning and underground parking neither 
of which the present church has 
imf would pay the lawyers and the architects 
the job would be done in phases so the congregation would not 
miss a day of worship or the homeless miss a meal 
imf would create an endowment to enable the church to expand 
its mission 
we debated it at great length and finally took a vote and the 
vote was 21 in favor of making the move wimberly said 
the executive board of the imf also approved 
architect david cox said it is hoped that construction can start 
in the spring and be completed in about two years kaiser said imf 
hopes to start work on its expansion at that time 
the fact the imf was willing to take the sanctuary with us i 
think was at the crux of it said wimberly we could say 
when you go down there youre not going to be worshiping in some 
glass palace or something people become very very involved with 
the place where they worship it is a beautiful sanctuary there is 
something very humble in its beauty that kind of matches a lot of

king county superior court is no longer hooked on 
drug cases thanks partly to private lawyers who served as 
prosecutors without cost to the taxpayers 
about a dozen exprosecutors and 30 relatively new lawyers 
helped clear a backlog of 512 felony cases most involving 
possession of illegal drugs or intent to sell court officials 
said 
it was a signal success no question about it prosecuting 
attorney norm maleng said were going to continue to have the 
private bar involved on a pro bono basis 
precise statistics have not been compiled but maleng said the 
conviction rate appeared to be just slightly less than the 80 
percent for cases handled by staff prosecutors 
pro bono work in which private lawyers are paid by their firms 
or simply agree to handle cases without a fee has long been common 
in criminal law 
only recently however has the practice emerged as a potential 
panacea to the volume of drug cases that plague prosecutors 
nationwide said richard l wintory director of the national drug 
prosecution center for the national district attorneys association 
in alexandria va 
san diego has a wellestablished pro bono prosecutor program 
and for nearly two years the delaware state attorney generals 
office has had a lendaprosecutor agreement with a new york 
law firm across washington state a similar effort has been 
mounted in spokane the delaware program is being challenged in the 
appeal of a drunkendriving conviction in court of common pleas in 
wilmington 
wintory said publicity on seattles crash program this summer 
drew so much interest that he has begun a survey of prosecutors in 
115 jurisdictions nationwide to identify other helpful programs 
drug case filings have more than doubled in many of the nations 
4000 prosecutors offices but we havent had anywhere near this 
increase in prosecutor resources he said of seattles program 
the attraction for most participants and their employers to the 
volunteer prosecutor program is accelerated trial experience in 
addition some former prosecutors who left for higher pay in the 
private sector miss their old work 
jesse franklin two years into private practice after five years 
in malengs office returned parttime for his first experience in 
directing other lawyers he supervised about 10 cases 
i love doing the supervising i get a kick out of it partly 
because i enjoy being a prosecutor so much he said you kind 
of relive some of your old war stories 
reaction from defense lawyers has ranged from muted demurrals to 
the legal challenge in delaware 
its sort of a novelty to be doing it for the prosecution 
said bob boruchowitz director of the nonprofit seattleking 
county defender association 
the defense side is much more in need of resources than the 
prosecution boruchowitz said the pressure it put on our 
lawyers the strain on our lawyers was significant many of our 
lawyers were on backtoback trials 
presiding judge charles v johnson said he was more concerned 
about overloading the 15 regular judges during the program which 
ran from july 25 to aug 31 
parttime service on the bench was enlisted from 22 superior 
court judges from other counties three lawyers who served as pro 
tem judges and 14 court commissioners judges from appellate and 
other courts and retired jurists 
we effectively had 12 additional judges maleng said 
from our standpoint the program was a success an outstanding 
success johnson said 
boruchowitz contended the seattle program resulted in trials by 
volunteer prosecutors hungry for litigation in cases that usually 
would have been settled with plea bargains 
wintory however said temporary prosecutors could ease 
pressures to allow guilty pleas on reduced charges as an 
alternative to dismissal for lack of preparation or failure to meet 
speedy trial requirements 
kathryn mauk hired fresh out of law school by a firm that 
handles mostly insurance cases said she changed her career focus 
after spending about a quarter to a third of her time as a 
temporary prosecutor this summer 
she won a conviction in her first case a fiveday trial on a 
charge of possession of drugs with intent to deliver charges were 
dismissed in another case because of an improper arrest and three 
others ended in guilty pleas 
its exhilarating its challenging she said it moves 
quickly you have to think on your feet you have to be on its 
a different kind of high

but then decided oct 28 to remain on strike rather than take up an 
offer to cross picket lines and reclaim their jobs

larosa said theres no point in going back now 
the news hit by a walkout oct 25 by nine of its 10 unions had 
said striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs at 
any time as long as permanent replacements had not been hired 
a group of about 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the 
750member newspaper guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter 
with guild president barry lipton 
some complained the guilds strike was called on the basis of a 
false report that replacements had already been hired to fill 
reporting slots 
theres a lot of anger at the guild leadership said 
striking reporter joanne wasserman 
but after the meeting the group decided to stay on strike 
no new talks were scheduled the news said it planned to replace 
the strikers permanently 
the daily news the nations secondlargest metropolitan daily 
has published a paper each day since the strike began but conceded 
it is having trouble delivering the paper 
home delivery was spotty and many newsstands were not getting 
the newspaper we have not been hitting all distribution points 
as of yet john t sloan the newspapers chief spokesman said 
oct 28 we will soon 
he also accused strikers of intimidating dealers and removing 
papers from newsstands 
strikers have burned several delivery trucks and vandalized 
others about 20 strikers have been arrested since the strike 
began most on disorderly conduct charges 
workers at the a amp s stationery store in brooklyn said 
clubwielding men had seized all 300 copies of the sunday edition 
of the news and scattered them in the gutter i cant take the 
paper or they will kill me said one of the stores owners ali 
najeli

saying many drivers had become lost 
the news said in a statement that it published and distributed 
more than 12 million sunday papers in the city and surrounding 
suburbs exceeding the previous days press run by 500000 the 
news normally prints 146 million sunday papers 
the 71yearold daily has been in a financial tailspin for a 
decade the news has lost about 115 million and seen daily 
circulation slip by about 700000 since 1980 it recently lost its 
standing as the nations largest metropolitan daily to the los 
angeles times 
the strike began when 60 drivers at the news were replaced in a 
dispute over whether a driver would be allowed to monitor a 
conveyor belt while sitting down the other unions followed suit 
the unions claimed management provoked the crisis which 
followed 10 months of often stormy talks on contracts to replace 
those that expired in march

dow jones amp co inc said oct 25 it will raise 
the newsstand price of the wall street journal to 75 cents a copy 
from 50 cents on dec 3 giving it the highest cover price for a 
leading national daily newspaper 
the move comes at a time when newspaper company profits are 
slumping but opinions were mixed on whether the journals move 
would prompt other papers to risk circulation losses by raising 
prices 
at usa today one of the journals chief competitors larry 
lindquist senior vice president for circulation said the paper 
had no plans to increase its cover price of 50 cents in 1991 
dow jones also is boosting the annual subscription price for the 
journal by 78 percent to 139 from 129 effective jan 2 
it said the price increases reflect higher transportation and 
other publishing costs and rising newsprint and postage rates 
earlier this month the company announced a 175 percent drop in 
its thirdquarter earnings due in part to a decline in ad revenue 
it later disclosed a costcutting plan that included a freeze on 
capital spending and total salaries postponement of a new 
magazine and a reduction in the number of special reports in the 
journal 
while several specialinterest daily newspapers sell for more 
than 50 cents a copy the american newspaper publishers association 
said the journal would be the first generalinterest daily paper 
with a newsstand price of 75 cents 
the newsstand price of the journal has been 50 cents since april 
1984 when it was raised from 40 cents a copy subscription rates 
were last raised two years ago 
the journal has the largest daily circulation of any us 
newspaper averaging nearly 186 million copies in the six months 
ended sept 30 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones said newsstand purchases 
account for less than 300000 in sales or less than 20 percent of 
the total 
he said newsstand sales fell slightly after the 1984 price 
increase but circulation eventually recovered all lost ground 
we cant predict what the impact of this increase will be but 
the outlook for the long term is that we will gain back whatever we 
lose he said 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies at columbia university characterized the journal as 
a special case with a relatively affluent audience that could well 
afford to pay the extra quarter for the daily paper 
but others said that with a weak advertising market putting a 
drag on newspaper revenues throughout the country more increases 
could be on the way 
joseph lorfano of the american newspaper publishers association 
said the singlecopy price of newspapers has been rising steadily 
reaching an average of 30 cents per copy last year up from 25 
cents in 1987 
may said 64 newspapers including the journal have cover prices 
of 50 cents a copy up from only four at that figure in 1985 
dow jones also said it was raising the newsstand price of 
barrons national business and financial weekly to 250 a copy 
from 2 effective with the dec 3 issue the annual subscription 
price will rise to 109 from 99 effective with the jan 7 issue 
barrons last raised its newsstand price in january 1989 and its 
yearly rate in january 1990

mohammed triggered dozens of angry phone calls and a protest 
outside its offices 
protesters called the sketch sacrilegious because no authentic 
portraits of the prophet exist 
the sentinel regrets running the picture we meant no offense 
to the islamic community editor robert h wills said in a 
frontpage story oct 23 
the picture was used with a wire service report that iraqi 
president saddam hussein supposedly claimed to have received a 
message from the prophet in a dream 
the newspaper said the picture was taken from a file incorrectly 
labeled mohammed the sentinel did not say who the sketch 
actually depicted 
ma cheema former president of the islamic center of milwaukee 
and a member of the islamic society of north america said pictures 
and statues of historic religious figures are prohibited in islam

letter from the islamic society of milwaukee 
the letter signed by society president muhammad y khan and 
bassam sayad chairman of community outreach said the group was 
outraged

gov guy hunt is airing a television 
commercial that features a fake newspaper headline mentioning 
democrat paul hubbert but a hunt aide said oct 24 the ad was not 
meant to be deceptive 
the commercial begins with a photograph of hubbert former head 
of the alabama education association an announcer says governor 
guy hunts efforts to improve education have been opposed time and 
again by this man paul hubbert 
a newspaper story is then briefly superimposed over hubberts 
face with the headline hubbert kills hunts education reform 
package 
a freezeframe look at the newspaper story shows it really is 
about budget problems at the us postal service the bogus 
headline was electronically pasted on top of the story 
a hunt spokesman terry abbott said the commercial is not meant 
to deceive people into believing a newspaper actually printed the 
headline shown on the tv screen abbott said the headline is only a 
dramatization of hunts claims about hubbert 
karen cartee an advertising professor at the university of 
alabama said the fake headline tactic could be a serious blunder 
given reporters increased scrutiny of political ads 
thats like handing the newspapers and hubbert a loaded 
cannon ms cartee said im shocked because its very 
rare for political ads to be outright deceptive they just dont 
do it because its stupid politics 
if youre called on it and made to look like a liar youre 
going to lose she said negative ads have to be truthful to 
work

state tax commissioner john boehm said he 
erred in staking out a newspaper building to see who among his 
employees had gone there to complain that he was stifling their 
free speech at work 
in retrospect i made a mistake boehm said oct 25 it 
was an error in judgment 
earlier this month a dozen department of revenue employees went 
to the journalstar printing co building to talk to a reporter 
boehm acknowledged that he and his deputy commissioner drove around 
the building which houses the lincoln journal the lincoln star 
and lincoln office of the associated press 
a day later boehm distributed a memo to department 
administrators it dealt with whether employees could be 
disciplined for insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about 
the governor a department head or other supervisors 
three of the employees who went to the newspaper building said 
oct 25 that they felt department employees put their careers in 
jeopardy if they disagreed with boehm or criticized the 
administration of gov kay orr 
they said boehms surveillance increased their worries 
their fears are unfounded boehm said i went there 
because i had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were 
going to be there and i was curious i wasnt taking names 
boehm said none of the employees who talked to reporters would 
be subject to disciplinary action for speaking out

lawyers for joseph lomax who is charged 
in the slaying of newspaper reporter kara laczynski three years 
ago urged a superior court judge to make sure blacks and 
minorities are well represented on the jury in lomaxs third trial 
race has evolved into a central issue in the case lomax is 
black and laczynski was white 
during lomaxs second trial defense lawyer joseph moniz 
compared the laczynski slaying to the wellknown stuart case in 
boston where police were criticized for seeking a black suspect in 
the killing of a white woman numerous blacks were questioned in 
that case and one black man became a suspect before the womans 
husband was implicated 
supporters of lomax characterize him as a black victim of white 
justice 
in a motion filed in hartford superior court on oct 22 moniz 
urged judge maxwell heiman to take appropriate steps to assure a 
sufficient number of blacks and minorities to reflect a fair 
crosssection of the community 
the names of potential jurors are culled only from voter 
registration lists and motor vehicles department records moniz 
wrote 
the jury pool thus fails to include city residents who dont 
need or cant afford a car and who have been alienated from 
participation in the political process moniz said

with voters angry and their party plummeting

from now are running hard away from their president 
i dont like to go against what the president is saying 
said rep tom tauke a republican who is running for the senate in 
iowa but my judgment is that in this case the president has a 
different job than i have 
gop candidates who share taukes task getting elected are 
trying to put as much daylight as possible between themselves and 
the republican occupant of the white house 
the focal point for conflict is the 496 billion budget package 
congress approved this weekend before adjourning to the campaign

has said he will sign includes 137 billion in new taxes and the 
rest in spending cuts and reduced interest payments on the debt

discussing the islands policies its marxist system and even fidel 
castro himself 
although relations remain cordial at the official level newly 
liberated soviet reporters are feeling no compunction about saying 
what they think 
the latest and perhaps most notorious example touched on an area 
that has been sacrosanct for 30 years castros personal life 
komsomolskaya pravda a new wave glasnostera daily said 
recently that castro has 32 houses a personal security contingent 
of 9700 and five children by his present wife so far as the 
cuban public knows there has been no change in castros marital 
status since he was divorced 35 years ago such subjects are taboo

this is the last divided city now that 
the berlin wall has fallen and the lebanese are dismantling the 
line between beiruts moslems and christians 
its not an enviable status and there is no sign it will change 
soon despite renewed efforts by the united nations to reconcile 
ethnic greeks and turks 
changing world conditions have raised hopes among the majority 
greek cypriots on this eastern mediterranean island who number 
about 500000 that nicosias green line will be demolished 
the continuing enforced division of nicosia is an anachronism 
after the collapse of the berlin wall and the new spirit of 
cooperation prevailing in the world president george vassiliou 
the greek cypriot leader said in a speech 
nicosia was divided in 1964 after hundreds of people were killed 
in three months of fighting between the moslem ethnic turks and 
christian greeks the green line that snakes through the old city 
got its name because a un officer drew it on a map with green 
ink 
what was to be a temporary ceasefire line has lasted 26 years 
the green line was lengthened into an unofficial border across the 
island after a greeksponsored coup in july 1974 briefly ousted the 
late president makarios and turkey invaded occupying the northern 
third of the island 
about 120000 turkish cypriots live in the occupied zone and 
proclaimed the region an independent turkish cypriot republic in 
1983 only turkey recognizes it 
the green line is a maze of narrow alleyways and streets 
overgrown with weeds running through what used to be nicosias 
main shopping area 
bluebereted troopers of the 2100man un peacekeeping force 
patrol the no mans land between decaying bulletpocked buildings 
greek and turkish cypriot forces in sandbagged pillboxes are only a 
few yards apart at some points 
a dozen people have been killed along the green line since 1974 
but there have been no serious encounters 
greek cypriots hope un pressure on iraq to withdraw from 
conquered kuwait will force turkey eventually to implement security 
council resolutions on cyprus 
these demand the withdrawal of the 35000 turkish soldiers and 
50000 settlers from the north and the return to the region of 
200000 greek cypriots who fled in 1974 or were evicted 
diplomatic sources say pressure on turkey is unlikely now 
because of its growing importance in the un trade embargo against 
iraq 
leaders of the greek cypriots note that turkey is getting aid 
from washington and the united nations for its stand against iraqs 
invasion of kuwait while refusing to implement security council 
resolutions on cyprus 
such contradictions cannot be maintained under the new spirit 
of international unanimity government spokesman akis fantis 
said thats why were hopeful that nicosias green line will 
soon be dismantled 
fantis may be overly optimistic 
unsponsored reunification talks between vassiliou and rauf 
denktash president the turkish cypriots have been deadlocked 
since june 1989 
the turkish cypriots and turkey have shown no recent signs of 
willingness to accept a twozone federation proposed by the united 
nations their position hardened after the greek cypriots applied 
for membership in the european community a few months ago without 
consulting the ethnic turks 
glafcos clerides leader of the democratic rally the main 
rightwing group among greek cypriots said separation on the 
basis of different political beliefs or communal differences 
belongs in the past the new idea is to do away with 
artificial divisions like the one splitting nicosia 
the main obstacles to a settlement are the demand by denktash 
for recognition of selfdetermination for the turkish cypriots and 
his refusal to implement un resolutions 
vassiliou rejects selfdetermination as tantamount to 
recognizing the separate republic 
to bolster his demands denktash forbids movement by cypriots 
across the green line a foreigner may cross only after signing a 
form recognizing the turkish cypriot state 
the right of selfdetermination is not something were 
requesting from the greeks denktash said this right has been 
exercised it exists and we wont argue about it 
he and other turkish cypriot leaders say cyprus cannot be 
compared to iraqs seizure of kuwait 
they say turkey invaded to protect turkish cypriots and exercise 
its rights as a guarantor of the constitution under treaties that 
made cyprus independent of britain in 1960

tenor luis lima wishes opera fans 
paid as much attention to how he acts as how he sings 
most opera lovers come for the voices i never accepted 
that said lima who has performed at the metropolitan opera in 
new york and is booked at la scala in milan 
i enjoy being able to meld my voice into the music but most 
of all i like the theatrical performance the roles the way you 
interact with your partners the study of the psychological 
situations of the characters 
lima 42 considers himself an actor who sings rather than the 
other way around he gets irritated when a love scene or fantasy 
role is judged only by what comes out of his mouth 
when a fan told him his execution was fuzzy after one 
performance lima responded were you listening with your head 
down 
he was and so he couldnt see that i was turned away from the 
audience watching my lover leave the tenor recalled 
early in his career limas acting ability covered deficiencies 
in his voice i was a very slow pupil he said in an interview 
i couldnt really adapt my voice and my nerves onstage to the 
technical control now i think i can control my voice 
for lima the role of don jose in carmen is one of the best 
in all opera partly because a relatively ordinary person is 
transformed into a passionate assassin 
in three hours you go through the whole spectrum of emotions 
you destroy what you love which you let destroy yourself first 
he said 
rodolfo of la boheme also fascinates lima because he is 
desperately hopelessly in love 
every day something like this happens in the world and i 
think thats something important for us to play and for people to 
see because its a normal human situation he said 
as hoffman in the tales of hoffman lima both tells the 
story and is part of it this is like being a puppet and the man 
pulling the strings at the same time this i love 
lima seriously decided to study opera after hearing richard 
tucker at the colon opera house in buenos aires he made his debut 
in 1973 in lisbon portugal in cavaliera risticana 
he was raised in a small city in argentina and lives part of the 
year on a horse ranch in cordoba 
offstage the father of four and son of a military pilot doesnt 
act the role of the typical opera star he skips parties avoids 
the glitz and complains about the falseness of show business and 
lifelessness of most opera movies 
a few hours before curtain call lima is more likely to be 
romping with his kids than fretting over the high notes 
its more important that i take care of my children than go to 
the theater and sing perfectly he said and if by changing 
diapers or talking to my children im going to lose a little 
bit of energy or quality in my voice it doesnt really matter to 
me 
not that he isnt serious about singing 
when i go to the theater i try to sing as accurately as 
possible he said even when hes required to do alfredo in la 
traviata a role he thinks is paced too fast 
but before i think my life belongs to the place i am in 
otherwise you contaminate with your profession every aspect of 
your life 
lima has about 40 roles in his repertoire later this year 
hell appear in vienna productions of carmen and don 
carlos next year or the year after hes booked for carmen 
and lucia di lammermoor in san francisco 
in 1993 he is scheduled to appear in manon lescaut at la 
scala 
recording projects include verdis requiem with seiji ozawa 
and an album of arias recorded at the colon where he appeared last 
month in faust

maxi priest recently was out shopping in london 
and decided to buy some clothes he found a nice store selected a 
pair of trousers and went into the dressing room 
when he came out a line had formed for autographs 
obviously the attention is there a lot more than it was 
before said priest whose sunny smile and sunny no 1 single 
close to you have made him a man worth waiting for 
when i go to a club i like to find my little corner and dance 
and see whats going on trying to enjoy myself the way i used to 
enjoy myself 
he insists that success wont change him and even if youve 
heard that a million times before this time it might be true 
priest has always been the center of attention aunts and uncles 
fussed over him girls followed him in high school party guests 
gave him money 
i was brought up in a family of nine kids and i was the second 
youngest said priest 27 who grew up in southeast london 
when you grow up in a big family theres so many personalities 
that you learn to deal with all different kinds of people that 
also helped me develop my personality 
priest speaking at the manhattan offices of charisma records 
considers himself an international artist and his songs have popped 
up all over the world his debut release the 1984 single hey 
little girl became the first british reggae song to top the 
charts in jamaica in 1988 he had an unlikely hit with a cover of 
cat stevens wild world a no 1 single for four weeks in 
england 
but close to you his breakthrough american single was the 
most satisfying achievement for priest he only recorded wild 
world at the request of the record company and criticized the 
song even after it became successful close to you with its 
funky track and breezy hook was his idea 
i was on my way to my writing suite in england and i was 
singing the hook i just want to be close to you priest 
recalled when i got to the studio i started to sing and the 
other writers kind of dropped everything else it just fell into 
place 
priest cowrote seven of the 12 songs on his new album 
bonafide a mix of pop reggae and gospel included are love 
songs such as just a little bit longer and temptress and 
the more messageoriented prayer for the world and peace 
throughout the world 
he wanted diversity bringing in 15 other songwriters and using 
four sets of producers including grammy awardwinners jazzie b and 
nellee hooper of soul ii soul 
the album is almost the closest ive been to the ultimate 
album i want to make with all different styles of music for all 
different types of people priest said 
there are party songs there are message songs love songs 
its almost like a personal cassette a compilation of songs with 
different tempos and different feelings 
priest created his own studio at age 14 and soon joined saxon 
international as a deejay for sound system in 1985 he signed 
with 10 records in england and released his debut album youre 
safe 
influences include dennis brown bob marley motown the beatles 
and louis armstrong he listened to them all as a kid but not just 
for entertainment priest was already checking them out looking 
for tips on phrasing and songwriting 
he thinks hes close to becoming a major star just a little 
bit longer is the next single off bonafide and priest 
predicts if that becomes a hit all doors are open 
its a reggae track he explained close to you is more 
pop theyre very different songs if that makes it there are a 
lot of other songs that could make it 
his shopping days would then be over but priest accepts that as 
destiny i know ive been gifted by god he said i think 
theres a light shining on me 
even if he decides to stay on the normal side of life his 
prayers are for peace love and more hit singles a humble way of 
slipping payola to the lord

cruising toward town on a highway cleared for his 
motorcade vice president dan quayle broadcast a rush hour traffic 
report my lanes clear it was of course but there are 
potholes along his political route to rival the traffic jams that 
piled up at all the turnpike entrances 
quayle is trying to steer around them as he campaigns for 
republicans in the offyear elections a week away he did his 
tongueincheek traffic item on a radio callin program using his 
limousine telephone to keep campaigning between stops 
when he goes home to indiana to vote and to take in an 
electioneve pro football game in indianapolis quayle will have 
covered at least 44 of the 50 states he will have appeared at 
about 120 fundraising affairs that drew more than 16 million 
campaign dollars hell have an address book full of gop contacts 
and some political chits that prove important to him in 1992 
and hell still be laboring to dispel the negative image and 
adverse poll ratings that have plagued him since president bush put 
him on the 1988 ticket and the national stage 
the only thing i can tell you is that were doing the 
job the vice president said when the image issue was raised 
been doing the job now for well 18 19 months ive been 
campaigning now in this election cycle in 44 different states and 
i feel that ive been very well received been very well treated 
i love the job quayle said 
bush already has said that quayle will be his running mate again 
in 1992 but there will inevitably be pressure for a ticket change 
especially if bush and his ticket look vulnerable heading into the 
next presidential campaign 
thats a republican habit in varied circumstances there was 
midadministration pressure against bushs own vice presidential 
renomination spiro t agnews in 1972 richard m nixons in 1956 
gerald r ford switched running mates from nelson a rockefeller 
to sen robert dole in his losing 1976 bid to win the white house 
he held by appointment 
so when quayle wheeled into a vegetable stand in lexington 
mass last week to appear amid the pumpkins with the republican 
candidate for governor he was asked whether he was campaigning to 
hold his own place on the ticket two years hence 
im campaigning for bill weld he retorted 
nevertheless the long intensive campaign he has waged fits the 
personal political agenda too cementing his party ties with 
republicans seeking everything from senate seats to lowprofile 
state offices it puts him on campaign display without the gaffes 
that made him the butt of latenight television comedy there have 
been slips but not many and not major 
his campaign delivery is smoother more relaxed than two years 
ago it is the predictable set speech of a vice president hailing 
the chief denouncing the democrats for tax increases even though 
bush endorsed them the crowds react just as predictably 
applauding at appropriate points 
but the volume goes up when quayle tackles congress 
the house of representatives has been controlled by the 
democrats since i was seven years old says quayle 43 pause for 
effect murmurs then laughter rippled through the crowd at the 
courthouse in suburban philadelphia 
i tell you theres an idea that is sweeping this country 
and that is the idea that it is time to limit the terms he says 
voice rising over the cheers it plays as well at every stop 
and it certainly plays better than his repeated defense of white 
house acquiescence to tax increases quayle is said to have urged 
privately that budget negotiations be scrapped earlier this month 
in favor of a headon challenge to congress he wont discuss his 
advice to bush he says the decision was a close call politically 
but without a budget deal there could have been chaos 
now he tells the campaign crowds that the democrats are 
responsible for tax increases assures the voters that the rich 
will foot most of the bill insists that millionaires will be taxed 
more efficiently and surely than would have been the case with a 
simple surtax 
we have seen people say that its going to be disastrous for 
the republican party but i dont believe that quayle said on 
the boston radio talk show he said the voters should take out 
their frustration on incumbents meaning democrats giving them 
the hook and the heaveho from the congress and elsewhere he 
said its time for a change the american people want a 
change 
but when quayle made a final campaign swing to the northeast 
the candidate competition to stay at his side was less than 
intense that led to a suggestion that appearing with him might not 
be helpful just now given a public perception that republicans are 
protecting the rich 
if thats the perception its an erroneous perception he 
said 
i can do three things for candidates raise money raise 
the profile of individuals and i can energize the troops but as 
far as getting people to vote for or against candidates they have 
to present themselves to the voters 
still quayle wasnt denying gop pain over the budget battle 
you know how this thing goes in cycles he said flying back 
to washington up one week down the next weve had a couple 
rough weeks 
i think well start to turn it around

bart simpson is no longer just a pintsized 
cartoon character with yellow skin spiked hair and a big attitude 
now depending on the venue he is black hispanic jewish 
homophobic sexually deviant or an outspoken foe of california 
democratic gubernatorial candidate dianne feinstein 
bootleg tshirts of televisions animated bad boy have been 
cropping up across the country for months but illegal simpsons 
euphoria now has seemingly gotten out of hand 
at the university of iowa the rightwing campus review recently 
published a drawing of bart warning off homosexuals while holding a 
loaded slingshot 
a few weeks back a republican news release was issued in barts 
name berating feinstein for using crib notes written on her hand 
during a televised debate with us sen pete wilson the gop 
nominee for governor 
shirts depicting bart in a sexual act with his infant sister are 
among the obscene simpsons items that are being sold 
the ugly turn of such ripoffs distresses simpsons creator 
matt groening and parent fox broadcasting co home of primetimes 
biggest cartoon hit the simpsons 
but illegal reproductions of tvs most popular dysfunctional 
family cover a confounding spectrum distasteful depictions occupy 
the most extreme end at the other are an amazing variety of 
cultural reproductions 
the simpsons in all their yellow bugeyed glory have been 
adopted and adapted by diverse minority groups with little in 
common except their hunger for public heroes 
from the black community comes air bart and magic bart 
takeoffs on popular professional basketball players michael air 
jordan of the chicago bulls and magic johnson of the los angeles 
lakers 
in mexicos border town of tijuana you can buy bart sanchez 
tshirts and bart pinatas in israel there are simpsons 
yarmulkes 
recast simpsons paraphernalia also has been sighted in 
nicaragua and the cayman islands 
the whole thing leaves groening baffled and amazed 
some of it amuses him some of it is just plain annoying 
twentieth century fox owners of the fox network and the 
simpsons copyright is not amused by my amusement groening 
said recently 
theyve done a whole bunch of raids and confiscated 
tshirts groening said fox takes this as seriously as disney 
does 
maybe the walt disney co wastes little time in protecting its 
copyrighted characters in 1989 it sued the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences the day after actor rob lowe and an 
unauthorized snow white sang and danced during the internationally 
televised oscar ceremonies 
fox is vague however about what action it has taken against 
simpsons wannabes 
we go after it through proper legal means we dont go after 
it in the press said fox spokesman brad turell were going 
after it as aggressively as we can we are definitely prosecuting 
people but we dont comment pending litigation 
as for barts illegal political use by california republicans 
turell said the simpsons creators were very upset and 
considering their options 
as for the inflammatory term for gays used by the iowa college 
publication turell said it really hasnt come to our attention 
legally 
the fledgling network is upset by any offensive use of its 
characters turell said its really unfortunate that people who 
have no rights to these characters defile them and do things that 
are really unfair to them 
not to mention the lost revenues from copyright infringement 
but to groening that is not really the issue 
somebodys making a lot of money off this he said but 
money has never been my first concern 
why have his cartoon characters become such a model for minority 
groups 
bart looks cool no matter what skin color groening said 
he lends himself to any color treatment 
or as mr x puts it most people just got tired of seeing 
white cartoons 
mr x who says that is his real name fashions a host of black 
animated characters ranging from the jetsons to bart simpson 
onto embroidered shirts hats and gloves 
an artist and dancer mr x says he creates the articles in his 
van nuys office and gives them as gifts 
black people have nothing to look up to except bill cosby and 
his kids mr x said in a phone interview bart is down to 
earth he knows whats happening hes got the language down when 
he says hey dude thats radical people listen 
groening said the preponderance of uncopyrighted simpsons 
gear also is caused by the seemingly simple outlines of the family 
members unmistakable profiles 
the characters look like theyre easy to draw so it invites 
doodlers everywhere to get into the act groening said 
just like the popularity of the tv show theres this 
explosion on the street the ones i get mad at are the bigoted 
racist ones 
 
elsewhere in television 
i dont know cnn but i know what i like cnn viewers this week 
will tune into the world of art a special fivepart series 
airing in threeminute segments with each segment airing five 
times throughout the day 
the series segments also will air nov 3 as a halfhour special 
with host bill tush himself a collector who opened the series 
with a segment titled what is art 
other segments include how to buy art celluloid art 
celebrity art and art theft and fraud

compact car away from suburbia and into the commuter traffic 
surging toward downtown boston no time for tears 
its marthas first day back 
she is just one of about 19 million women who return to jobs 
each year after having a child some mothers prefer to work others 
have no choice 
regardless of financial circumstances fewer than 10 percent of 
americans live in what once was the traditional family headed by a 
male breadwinner sixteen percent of women with infants worked in 
the early 1960s compared with more than 50 percent today 
women are still asking themselves am i doing the right 
thing said barbara reisman executive director of the national 
child care action campaign our mothers led a different life and 
theirs is the only model we have 
but that nuclear 1950s model is for many mothers far out of 
date the rules have changed the days grown longer and more 
complicated 
martha a boston postal supervisor fears her sons caregiver 
seems more a mother to him than she does 
pam salazar a television reporter in dayton ohio wonders 
whether continuing to breastfeed after returning to work seems 
unprofessional 
vicki sugarman who shares a job managing promotions for a 
stoughton massbased company frets over finding convenient and 
reputable day care 
her partner janet aikens worries that their jobsharing 
experiment at reebok international ltd may be tokenism rather than 
the start of a common option for working mothers 
sheila michelli an army captain in fort lee va struggles to 
negotiate shared parenting responsibilities with her 
semiworkaholic husband 
cynthia sartin a nurse in downtown new orleans feels guilts 
stab each time she tucks her sadeyed baby girl into bed and slips 
out the door 
amanda wallis a san francisco bank executive realizes time 
for herself has disappeared amid the crazy scramble that is modern 
motherhood 
these and millions of other moms are exhausted yet despite 
their daily race having it all still too often means living 
with the uncomfortable sense that everything is only halfdone 
no simple how to manual exists to ease the dueling pressures 
or explain away irrational guilt working parents still are 
experimenting making errors and veering offtrack 
if i were giving the nation a report card i would have to 
give us a c said joseph pleck a family issues researcher at 
wheaton college in norton mass you can expect a little more 
help from your husband but dont expect much from your employer 
one in five men now pitch in at home and pleck said their 
increased participation in flexible hours paternity leave and 
other child care progams has helped debunk employers perception 
that these are special womens benefits 
still less than half of working women receive paid maternity 
leave and only 11 percent of companies with more than 10 employees 
offer onsite day care subsidies counseling or referrals 
according to the us census bureau 
the united states is the only industrialized nation besides 
south africa that has no family leave policy the 1990 federal 
budget of 7 billion for child care subsidies and tax credits 
meanwhile lags far behind most other developed countries according 
to the childrens defense fund 
our expectations arent realistic because the career system 
hasnt been modified women are always doing two things at once 
said sociologist arlie hochschild whose the second shift 
examines twocareer families 
thats not liberation she said thats just bad for our 
kids

stresses and joys they found in their first days back on the job 
</TEXT>

i find myself holding onto him more as he drops off to sleep 
and not wanting to put him down martha duffley writes on her 
first day back there are fewer hours that i am with him and i 
hoard them 
by 9 am marthas pals down at the post office are saying 
gee its great to see you back on the job they ask after her 
5monthold son chat about motherhood coo at the new mothers 
battery of baby photos 
by 10 am things have quieted down people drift back to their 
work and martha a boston post office supervisor tucks the 
pictures away in her wallet no point in displaying them on her 
desk 
they only remind her of brians sparkling eyes and the way her 
own eyes swell when she cries like she did last night at the 
thought of leaving her son in someone elses care 
i feel guilty martha writes he is still so young i 
dont know if he is cognizant of what my role is in his life i 
rush home to remind him who i am 
the guilt lingers the morning goodbyes grow no easier 
martha 33 doesnt choose to work between her husbands job as 
caretaker at the cemetery in their hometown of milton mass and 
her work at the post office the couple make 42000 a year 
i always thought i would be able to emulate my mother when 
and if i had children martha wrote after going back to work this 
summer she was at home for us when we were young 
but mortgage payments and upkeep on the duffleys home run 
8000 a year add car payments and utilities 11400 food and 
gas cost about 7500 day care is 9300 a year the budget is 
tight 
im frustrated because i always wanted to stay home with my 
children and i always knew i wouldnt be able to she says im 
supposed to be the main person in his life the one he loves 
instead martha wonders whether her son knows that mary his day 
care provider is not his mother she tries not to miss brian too 
much at the same time secretly hoping he misses her just a little 
somewhere deep inside i keep wanting to hear he misses me he 
feels a void in his life he is not chuckling all the time 
martha writes just so i know i mean something in his life

shes asleep when i leave no regrets about leaving excited 
at the prospect of being back again amanda wallis writes 
a lot of my friends cried the first day they left their babies i 
feel badly that i didnt 
the new mother is glad to be behind a desk after 13 weeks away 
from her job directing bank of americas private banking office in 
san francisco 
the routine helps amanda is up at 430 am to feed and play 
with katie who is fast asleep again by 545 am this gives me 
time to exercise shower and dress and be out of the house by 700 
am she writes 
amandas parents and livein nanny make the days a lot more 
manageable while her husband is wonderful with katie and 
has made juggling motherhood and career possible 
but its easy to drop a ball lose the balance 
katie was up and playing when i left this morning which made 
it harder to leave amanda writes on tuesday by friday she 
writes as time progresses i miss katie more 
amandas eyes drift more and more frequently to the newly framed 
photograph of katie she wonders whether to check on things at her 
ranchstyle home in suburban burlingame where her daughter might 
be crying or sleeping or smiling at 37 amanda was ready for 
motherhood she and richard blue her husband of nine years had 
discussed the decision theyd pondered the inevitable and 
substantial changes a baby would bring 
its the smaller daily changes that sneak up amandas heated 
rollers have been cold for months because coiling her blonde hair 
into a bun saves at least 10 minutes in the morning an evening out 
with her husband is rare evenings out with friends rarer still 
what i realize has now disappeared from my life is any free 
time for myself writes amanda whose staff of 24 caters to bank 
clients with account balances of more than 5 million 
i go to work come home play with the baby put her to bed 
put myself to bed and then i wake up and do it all over again

arianna wakes up during the night but thats ok i can give 
a few more hours of sleep writes cynthia sartin whose focus day 
and night is on others 
time with her 3monthold daughter arianna is wedged between 
erratic shifts at new orleans charity hospital where cynthia 
nurses aids patients and other strangers 
her first day back on the job begins when the baby wakes at 3 
am on july 2 and ends around midnight tired scratchy throat 
sleepy 
chronicling her life in a childs miniature diary cynthia fills 
the pages with sentence fragments and thirdperson observations 
arrives at work butterflies in stomach calls home dad 
reading newspaper to baby wishes to be home continually shows 
pictures to friends arrives home kisses baby over and over 
again 
arianna is everything to cynthia a stern cajun woman determined 
to be the mother she wasnt able to be as an unwed 20yearold 
when she gave birth to her now teenage son cynthias eight 
siblings and parents had to help out while she finished up nursing 
school 
today she says its a whole different ballgame its 
overwhelming but im more mature i can perceive so much more 
about what her needs are 
though shed like to take care of arianna all on her own 
cynthia still relies on her husband and 16yearold son the two 
men whom cynthia refers to as her other babies have overcome 
their fear of crushing the tiny girl while cradling her to sleep 
cynthia feels fortunate she knows many mothers dont have such 
support still she writes my feelings are those of inadequacy 
my only hope is that things will get better with time and maybe i 
will not miss arianna so much

i called mom to ask how the kids are doing capt sheila 
michelli writes after rejoining her army unit for military 
exercises its a relief to know that they miss me less than i 
miss them 
an army logistics officer at fort lee va sheila is a woman 
who knows how to take control and get things done but saying 
goodbye to 6weekold connor is a tough order he is the michellis 
second son the last child the couple plan 
the most wrenching part about returning to work is giving up 
breastfeeding she writes at 553 pm after dropping the kids 
off with her parents and heading for nine days of crisis combat 
preparedness training 
connor ill see in 11 days but im done breastfeeding for 
good she writes its so final 
still letting go of her newborn is easier the second time 
around sheila 27 has finally decided to commit to a career with 
the army where she believes working mothers have it pretty good 
she received 28 days paid maternity leave with her first child 
and 42 days with connor less than half of us working women have 
access to such maternity benefits according to the census bureau 
shortly after returning to work last spring sheila was placed 
in command of a 300member unit the persian gulf crisis has since 
put pressure on the entire military though the michellis have not 
been directly affected 
sheila is proud of herself but the work is demanding and her 
husband tom is a semiworkaholic who works as a computer 
programmer for virginias national guard 
because both are so committed to their careers tensions arise 
sometimes the couple ends up locking horns but sheila knows she 
can count on tom to help warm a bottle wash a load of diapers or 
be there when its time to drive the babysitter home 
it takes a lot of coordination and teamwork says sheila 
we argue but he supports me 
and that all the mothers agreed is key

the first day back at work was nothing short of traumatic 
pam salazar writes after going back to her job reporting for 
television station wkef in dayton ohio the thought of leaving 
my baby brought me to tears 
although willing to cut back on hours at the office and forgo 
her morning anchor position pam wasnt prepared to quit 
broadcasting altogether 
i guess i thought somehow the situation would magically work 
itself out she writes after finding out how it feels to be 
caught between news deadlines and her 5monthold daughter chase 
there are no magic wands when it comes to racing the clock pam 
may roar home to relieve the babysitter after a latebreaking news 
story or reel into work after prolonged morning goodbyes 
but breastfeeding is another story mother nature wont be 
rushed 
i was extremely nervous pam 28 wrote after her first 
disastrous attempt at expressing milk in an office bathroom 
would i be able to master the art would i manage to pump 
enough milk to feed my baby 
it was only after several attempts and with a lot of coaching by 
telephone from her husband kyle hickok that pam was able to get 
the gadget to draw milk the new mother felt like she was hogging 
the bathroom and perhaps embarrassing her colleagues and herself 
but my coworkers are very supportive of my breastfeeding 
she writes the news director bends over backwards to accommodate 
mother natures schedule allowing me to only go out on short 
stories so that i dont miss a pumping session 
the majority of employers are not as supportive of 6 million 
us companies only a slim minority offer subsidies referrals or 
onsite day care for working mothers 
some working mothers read a message in the writing on the wall 
they feel they are not valued members of the labor force down at 
the tv station pam found the kind of support many women crave 
and still there were tensions 
nursing is something i felt very strongly about but i had my 
doubts about how professional it would be she reflects im 
pulled both ways feeling guilty that im not doing either of 
my jobs very well

my name is vicki sugarman and my game is the mommy track 
the new mother writes 
i would be very upset if we were just a token writes janet 
aikens who with vicki shares a job managing promotions at reebok 
international ltd in stoughton mass 
vicki and janet each work three days a week overlapping on 
wednesdays the coworkers hit on the increasingly popular 
alternative to fulltime work and motherhood after each became 
pregnant around the same time last year 
jobsharing has required some adjustments to ensure both women 
are working on projects suited to their skills all concerned 
eventually decided it would be easier for janet and vicki to split 
their hours but work independently 
i now have the best of both worlds writes vicki 31 i 
can maintain my professional status and still be with my daughter 
four days a week 
but read between the lines it wasnt quite that simple 
the night before her first day back vicki lay in bed staring at 
the clock and wondering how being both a mother and a manager would 
work out 
it is 3 am in the morning and i am still wide awake just 
wondering will the baby think that i have deserted her will the 
nanny take good care of her what will it be like to be back in the 
office have i forgotten everything ive ever learned when will i 
ever fall asleep 
janet too has known fitful nights 
before the birth of her son she was working 10 hours a day and 
traveling at least a week out of every month her husband andy 
was matching her hourforhour at his job as an engineer for 
raytheon co 
i was determined not to let my pregnancy change anything so i 
continued to work work work janet 30 wrote after her 
first day back i wanted to be promoted to associate brand 
manager by years end as scheduled 
but things changed priorities shifted 
the decision not to return to my career full time was a very 
difficult one for me i had worked hard and long to get where i was 
but there was skyler janet writes 
i can get my career back on track but i can never recapture 
skylers childhood

editors note the kibitzers this night include a playwright 
from spain a drug dealer a queens housewife a master chess 
player from harlem a biker and assorted yuppies they are in a 
hotel next door to the old theater where garry kasparov and anatoly 
karpov sit hunched over their chessboard they watch the action on 
closedcircuit tv and debate the players every move their 
politics their diet their very nose scratchings

chess notes from a witness who doesnt know a 
nimzoindian opening from a hole in his sock 
in worldtitle chess the kibitzer not a piece of carved wood 
is king 
garry kasparov is defending his world title against anatoly 
karpov in the absolute silence of the old hudson theater lately 
sunk from the grandeur of the opening of eugene oneills strange 
interlude to times square porno flicks but now resurrected for 
kings pawn openings 
the only infrequent sound is shshshsh an observer 
corks off into snores he is immediately poked awake from three 
directions an elderly spectator noisily unbrownbags a sandwich 
an usher ushers him out 
but next door in the hotel macklowe which owns the hudson and 
is chess headquarters hundreds thousands debate the players 
every move their politics their diet their very nose 
scratchings 
the macklowe is a tower of babble from the lowest patzer 
german to make a mess of things to the highest grandmasters 
many tongues all at once 
some 150 chess fans are crowded in a windowless lecture room of 
the macklowe to hear roman dzindzichashvili luckily he answers to 
either roman or dzindzi pronounced gingi analyze the 
contest from closedcircuit tv 
kasparov will never make that move never says gingi 
wielding his pointer at the tv screen he will never do it 
without first visiting bar 
gingi a rumpled russian emigre with the hairdo of an astrakhan 
sheep once no 6 in the chess world and twice us champion 
speaks english with no thes 
kasparov after deliberating longer than the average ice age 
makes that move the kibitzers genially boo gingi 
i boo you back 
gingi survives the storm bets a lollipop on karpovs next move 
with mark rubinstein of brooklyn gingis gambit declined mark is 
up beyond his bedtime he is 11 
karpov after another ice age moves a bishop 
anybody can kibitz which may be the allure of this sport if it 
is a sport walter mittys can fantasize they aced ivan lendl at 
wimbledon or faked a free safety out of his jock to catch one from 
joe montana in the end zone but these are only the fields of 
dreams 
in gingis lecture room many fans ponder on their pocket 
chessboards the same imponderable kasparovkarpov ponder they are 
in the game 
tonights kibitzers games start at 530 pm and run five 
hours in gingis room include a playwright from spain a drug 
dealer who shall be nameless a queens housewife a motorcycle type 
in leather jacket with a pile of bud cans growing at his feet 
jerald times 27 a master from harlem assorted briefcased 
yuppies one other woman rafael knopler who told them back home 
in israel he had to go to new york on business and ben heller 
also from queens torn between the game and the latest train he can 
catch before manhattans streets turn mean he keeps glancing 
nervously at his watch 
do these guys ever cheat asks the only other woman present 
im hired by international chess federation not national 
enquirer gingi answers 
kasparovs knight to square c4 
kasparov in the finest tradition of chess hates karpov thinks 
hes evil a creature of darkness karpov 37 was a favorite 
of the pregorby kremlin kasparov 27 half jewish and all 
armenian was not in fact hes red hot for democracy he pasted a 
prerevolution russian flag on his side of the table karpov 
protested kasparov counterprotested karpovs hammer and sickle 
flag both flags went a draw 
the two have played 120 games before this 24game world 
championship garry has won 17 anatoly 16 the other 87 were 
draws there is a partition under the table separating their feet 
kicking is out 
karpov bishop to a6 
other than bushgorbachev and perhaps some hostile wall street 
takeovers this match is the only summit encounter conducted in 
business suits this is misleading chess takes no prisoners 
ben franklin said of chess etiquette you should not sing nor 
whistle nor look at your watch nor make a tapping with your feet 
wilhelm steinitz an austrian world champ 188694 once spat at his 
opponent 
a perfect porcupine said a contemporary of steinitz known 
as a poor loser and worse winner wherever you touched him was a 
sharp point 
aran nimzovich deviser of the nimzoindian once swept the 
pieces off the board crying why must i lose to this idiot 
he also did knee bends and stood on his head while his rival was 
trying to concentrate 
emanuel lasker german world champ 18941921 would exhale a 
virtual gas attack of cigar smoke across the table one 
tournament organizer protested that lasker smoked the finest 
havanas away from the chessboard but switched to stinking nickel 
rockets in competition the russian world title holder michael 
botvinnik 194657 used to train by having a sparring partner blow 
smoke in his face during practice 
when siegbert tarrasch challenged lasker in 1908 he began and 
concluded his dialogue with the champion thusly i have only 
three words to say to you in this match check and mate 
in keeping with the lowest level of sportsmanship at the highest 
level of chess tarrasch as have many others blamed his defeat on 
poor health the match held in dusseldorf was too close to 
debilitating sea air he complained dusseldorf was and presumably 
still is 170 miles from the nearest coast 
kasparov puts a rook in play 
are both sides still equal a kibitzer asks gingi 
one side is equal other has advantage the grandmaster 
hedges without elaboration

oneupmanship is an essential part of the kibitzers arsenal a 
heavy european accent delivering profundities that mean nothing 
helps if you say kusparoff correct and he says kasparoff 
hes obviously a patzer he says aleckein alexander alekhine was 
a universally despised world champion drunk lecher and 
antisemite between the world wars and an immortal who fidgeted 
like a dog on an ant hill pronouncing it something like the name 
of the tigers hall of fame rightfielder al kaline if you say it 
right alyekchin you are a grandmaster and he is a nikulturny 
kasparov makes a move to no discernible pattern 
there may be something sneaky in kasparovs mind says the 
lady from queens 
this absolutely sneakless move says gingi sipping a soda 
kasparov is known for a relentless attacking style karpov for 
defense in depth like the russians defending moscow from napoleon 
one columnist has said garry has been all but berserk in 
earlier matches even though to the untrained eye he has been as 
immobile as rodins thinker except for minor league twitchings 
and ear pulls 
karpovs men are in a gligoric variation kasparovs with a 
knight split wide 
kasparov who has the highest number of rating points in the 
history of chess has the type of mind that could do a sunday 
crossword puzzle in his head 
he holds that head in his hands fingers splayed around his 
ears hand then adjusts a sleeve of his black suit recrosses legs 
pinches nose cups chin in hand makes bipod of forearms resting 
nose on clasped fingers glares down athis men only inches away 
like drill inspector at parris island reviewing recruits after 23 
minutes 
kasparov knight to f4 
queens housewife why do they take so long 
gingi they dont want to play nearly best move they want to 
play best move they take time because they have time 
in a 41move game it would take 1000 billion generations to 
play every possible combination at a fraction of a second per move 
were getting there 
chess is a game of memory technique imagination and intuition 
the top grandmasters know an infinitude of moves from the maroozy 
bind variation of the sicilian defense to queens gambit declined 
the french poisoned pawn the velimirovic attack 
they constantly study past games of their opponent and 
masterpiece games of the ages anderssens immortal in london 
1851 the pearl of zandvoort max euwe versus alekhine in 1935 
frank marshalls 23rd move at breslau in 1912 
all the while said saviely tartakower an austrian grandmaster 
earlier in this century the blunders are there all waiting to 
be made 
the queens of both kasparov and karpov are dead 
chess kept me out of trouble says jerald times the young 
harlem master i was a good kid but it gave me pride in 
intellect a ballerina has to stretch her body same thing in 
chess it stretches your mind 
times has survived a broken ghetto home got to college now 
teaches poetry to the homeless dropouts kids in the violent 
classrooms of the city 
chess he says takes more exertion than fullcourt basketball 
in summers he plays chess in harlem parks until early morning his 
rapid articulation pauses when he considers what other harlem kids 
have done in parks in new york 
chess 
the freewheeling end game has begun 
why does kasparov always use the kings indian defense asks 
ben heller 
because he knows it it works for him says gingi you 
have job you go to it every day why dont you change 
heller leaves for his train 
gingi says it looks like a draw no draw says the queens 
housewife i want my 25 bucks worth 
in 1924 the soviet unions third allunion congress decided 
chess was a weapon in the struggle for a higher cultural level 
and made the game a vehicle to show the world the superiority of 
communism the soviet union has held the world title since 1946 
with but one exception that was the american bobby fischer who 
brought rudeness neurosis brilliance and prize money to an 
alltime high in winning the title from boris spassky in iceland in 
1972 
fischer thereupon turned his back on multimilliondollar gates 
to lead a demonic reclusive life among the derelict hotels in the 
los angeles area half jewish he has reportedly become an ardent 
admirer of adolf hitler but kasparovkarpov can thank fischers 
histrionics for making the 3 million prize money for their match 
possible 
eccentricity if not madness is a not uncommon end game for chess 
players paul morphy of new orleans blazed briefly in the 1850s and 
is considered one of the best ever later he took to wandering the 
streets claiming his friends turned enemies and were trying to 
steal his clothes a polish grandmaster named frydman stripped 
during a tournament and ran through the hotel crying fire 
steinitz went mad

editors note three hundred years after it was founded as a 
trading post by the british east india company calcutta is a city 
of appalling filth and poverty 12 million people struggling just 
to survive despite all as one indian journalist once wrote 
calcuttans love their wretched city with the same passion as a 
mother loves her sick child

its already hot and steamy at 6 am as 
calcutta goes through its morning rituals 
joggers trot past the marble victoria monument and the 
membersonly mohammadan sports club the trimmed grass of the 
nearby calcutta race course is wet from the overnight monsoon 
rains 
sheltered under the hooghly bridge a mile away women cook a 
meager breakfast over a fire of dried cow dung for a gaggle of 
children some naked some in rags 
hundreds of people bathe in the sluggish brown water of the 
hooghly river devout hindus blessed by a nearly naked priest 
stand waistdeep in the river dipping copper bowls of spices and 
flower petals into the water later their women will return to the 
river steps with the laundry to slap the clothes clean on the 
stone 
fifty yards upriver near the flower market where servants of 
the rich buy garlands of fresh marigolds and hibiscus street 
dwellers defecate into the water but the river is holy an arm of 
the mother ganges and therefore cannot be unclean 
across the river in a sprawling conglomerate of slums called 
howrah city children splash under the hand pumps which supply 
water for drinking and washing people politely avert their eyes 
from others using the open sewage canals between the shacks 
in an hour the roads will be choked with traffic and the air 
will begin to thicken with a blue haze of exhaust fumes 
for a few calcutta residents today may be a relaxed day at the 
club for millions of others the day will bring another test of 
survival 
everyone in the city will go without citysupplied electricity 
for at least two hours the hitandmiss telephones will create 
hours of frustration roads pitted and impassable after a heavy 
monsoon will trap tens of thousands of cars like flies in a spider 
web 
calcutta is 300 years old this year job charnock an agent of 
the east india company founded the trading post on the hooghly on 
aug 24 1690 near the village of kalikata named for kali the 
feared goddess of power and destruction 
it was until 1912 the capital of british india the second 
city of the british empire after london a city that pandered to 
the pleasures of the great men of the anglosaxon world 
today calcutta is in decay its gothic victorianage buildings 
are crumbling and blackened with grime and mold shanties sprout 
like weeds in the sidewalk cracks 
even calcuttas stately clubs look shabby walls are peeling at 
the saturday club where wealthy indians sip gin and tonic on the 
veranda overlooking grass tennis courts the oncewhite uniforms of 
the bearers as the waiters are called are stained and gray with 
age 
decades of migration from impoverished villages and from 
neighboring bangladesh have swollen calcuttas population to 12 
million 
city services are collapsing concedes hassia abdul habib the 
speaker of the west bengal state legislature 
the roads are mindboggling communications are horrible you 
can phone london directly but you cant phone your nextdoor 
neighbor he says 
calcutta he adds is coming to a boiling point 
at the same time calcutta throbs with life it is the home of a 
vibrant bengal culture poetry and experimental theater 
bengalis are not business people says ajay chatterjee of 
the calcutta municipal development authority they love 
literature songs drama they are not pragmatic or practical 
calcutta fostered all three of indias nobel prize laureates 
poet rabindranath tagore in 1913 physics researcher chandrasekhara 
v raman in 1930 and mother teresa a naturalized indian citizen 
who won the 1979 peace prize for her work with the destitute 
perhaps only calcutta with its appalling poverty and capacity 
for survival could have given rise to the phenomenon of mother 
teresa 
forty years ago the yugoslavborn catholic nun began to scoop up 
the dying homeless from the gutters and rescue them from an 
anonymous death her mission for the poor has spread to 92 
countries 
from the start wealth and deprivation have coexisted in these 
inhospitable surroundings 
built on mosquitoinfested delta land 80 miles above the bay of 
bengal calcutta suffers temperatures above 100 day after day in 
summer the drenching rains of the monsoon season from july to 
september bring only humidity not relief

british author geoffrey moorhouse called it an act of lunacy to 
build a city here everything in nature was against it 
robert clive who turned the east india company into an empire 
for england in the 1750s called calcutta the most wicked place 
in the universe 
mark twain who visited in 1896 said the weather was enough 
to make a brass doorknob mushy 
calcuttas reputation also is stained by corruption and unending 
political intrigue that too is nothing new 
lord cornwallis who was made governor of india after his 
surrender at yorktown in the american war of independence wrote 
from his headquarters in calcutta every native of india i 
verily believe is corrupt 
with all its faults most calcuttans are intensely loyal 
bengalis love their wretched city with the same passion as a 
mother loves her sick child wrote khushwant singh a leading 
indian author and journalist 
we know all about our problems but i love calcutta said 
yvonne de silva who runs a private bus service it bugs me that 
people come to calcutta and take pictures of our garbage and our 
streets why dont they take pictures of their own garbage 
thousands of people live from the refuse which the city cant 
collect fast enough some sift through it for peelings or chicken 
skins for soup competing with crows cattle and pariah dogs 
ragpickers search it for anything to sell 
women collect dry and shape the droppings from the brahman 
cattle which roam freely others sweep up coal dust wet it and 
roll it into balls of black mud called gril that also can fuel a 
cooking fire 
looking down from her secondstory veranda sheila lahiri 
pointed to a shantytown that had sprung up opposite her apartment 
on ballygunge road a street of elegant residences 
could you believe this was possible 15 or even 10 years ago 
said mrs lahiri whose father lord sinha was given a hereditary 
seat in the british house of lords 
authorities long ago gave up the idea of tearing down the slums 
and focused instead on alleviating the misery 
calcutta used to have 1000 deaths a year from cholera but the 
disease was brought under control by water filtering and installing 
20000 public hand pumps in the slums 
calcutta has always been the refuge for the poor and displaced 
of eastern india waves of immigrants came with every ethnic 
upheaval famine or war 
the population more than doubled from 44 million in 1950 to 
92 million in 1975 
while the city grew its resources shrank a silting of the 
hooghly virtually killed the port which just 40 years ago received 
nearly half of indias imports 
recession labor strife and political terrorism in the 1960s 
persuaded many businesses to leave fifty years after the 
government shifted to new delhi the economic center of india has 
gravitated to bombay 
the communists now 13 years in power blame the policies of the 
federal government in new delhi for giving the state less than what 
they say is its share of national funds 
about 300000 people have no home other than the pavement 
according to some estimates stretched out on dirty rags or on the 
hard stone they sleep undisturbed by the trucks and cars roaring 
past 
they have an average weekly income of less than 555 said a 
study by the institute of local government and urban studies 
thirteen percent of the street dwellers work as rickshaw 
pullers earning an average 66 cents a day its the last major 
city on earth where men pull passenger carriages like human horses 
the study estimated that 43 percent of the citys residents live 
in huts in squatter settlements refugee colonies or slum 
neighborhoods known here as a bustees 
but an outsider walking through even the deepest slums of howrah 
senses no anger nor danger 
life is hard here these people have nothing to look forward 
to said bettina borgmann a german doctor who volunteered to 
spend her summer vacation in a slum clinic 
but the people surprise me most seem quite happy they are 
content with what they have just look at the children playing 
outside with whatever they can find i have never felt 
uncomfortable here

england makes its own contribution to the 
gangster movie cycle with the krays about the twins who ruled 
the london underworld during the 1960s 
the stars are gary and martin kemp known to the music world as 
leaders of the pop group spandau ballet the kemp brothers were 
recently in los angeles to promote the movie they are obviously 
not criminal types nor are they twins having been born two years 
apart yet in the krays they provide a scary portrait of evil 
and they could easily pass for twins 
offscreen you can tell the difference gary 30 is the older 
brother the major force behind the spandau ballet guitar player 
and writer of the groups hit songs he plays ronald kray the 
vicious twin martin just turned 29 is the handsomer brother and 
bass player hes reggie kray 
while the kemps have shared the bandstand since the founding of 
the spandau ballet they havent acted together since childhood 
the first time we ever worked together was when i was 8 and 
gary was 10 said martin we played in a bbc television 
production as brothers from there we did a bit on television not 
always together we were child actors for 10 years then we started 
the ballet 
the krays seemed like a wonderful opportunity to work 
together again as actors added gary it was something very 
special to work on the idea of becoming twins even though were 
only two years about we have our differences i do think that 
brothers dont have the same kind of telepathic connection with the 
subconscious that twins have 
it was a unique thing to work on the same that an actor would 
go through selfanalysis to become a character we had to analyze 
our own relationship to become twins its very cheap 
psychotherapy 
ronnie and reggie kray began their professional careers as 
boxers drifted into the protection racket in the east end then 
moved into the club world like new york gangsters in the 1930s 
they operated a series of nightclubs and hobnobbed with such 
luminaries as frank sinatra judy garland and tony bennett 
the kemps and their gang continued their grip on the london 
underworld until both were convicted of murder in 1969 they are 
serving 30year prison terms 
it was the closest england ever came to having organized 
crime said martin the mafia never really infiltrated britain 
ronnie and reggie actually controlled the biggest part of london 
that has ever been controlled by individuals 
the nicest thing about the movie is that we were asked to play 
a lot more than just twodimensional gangsters we were asked to 
actually get under their skins to show those guys when they were 
home relaxed and not just outdoors with their pals and putting on a 
show as gangsters 
we certainly dont have the sibling rivalry that the krays 
had remarked gary im always pleased to see martin do well i 
dont feel any competition between us and vice versa we found 
within the twin relationship and im not condemning all twins 
theres always one who really could not exist without the other 
partner 
in the case of the krays it was ronnie ronnie couldnt 
handle any real relationship outside the one he had with his 
brother one of the worst things for ronnie came when his brother 
gets married and starts another relationship his bitterness toward 
that woman drove him more toward violence 
gary and martin kemp have been performing most of their lives 
first as actors then musicians gary appeared in the film hide 
and seek and in bbcs plaything martin played in series such 
as rumpole of the bailey and dixon of dock green 
the kemps made their debut with the spandau ballet on nov 17 
1979 and a year later issued their first recording for 10 years 
their soft rock has been one of britains bestknown exports the 
brothers often go their separate ways martin is on his way to a 
movie in australia the girl who came late but they always 
return to their music 
there are five people in the world who can make that 
particular sound which millions of people enjoy commented gary 
so it should always be there to come back to

fiddler mark oconnor has played on 
grammywinning albums and become one of the most soughtafter 
instrumentalists in the music business but the master musician 
doesnt think hes mastered anything 
what im doing is the best i can at this time the day when i 
get something mastered would be the day id have to quit doing 
it he says 
the 29yearold oconnor describes an intimate almost poetic 
relationship with his fiddle it is a pairing that has made him 
virtually peerless for his versatility 
you establish this relationship as a duo you work together 
handinhand and try to make it come alive he says if you 
respect your instrument it can give a lot back to you music is an 
inner thing you try to achieve the relationship becomes intense 
oconnor can be heard playing as a sessions musician on 
countless albums recorded in nashville he has released nine albums 
of his own first for rounder records and more recently for mca 
records 
the country music foundation has just issued the lp mark 
oconnor the championship years the cuts include his winning 
performances between 1975 and 1984 at the national old time 
fiddlers contest in weiser idaho 
hes even given a command performance of sorts about 10 years 
ago he was a guest at former president ronald reagans ranch in 
california where he performed as one of the countrys top young 
musicians he played sweet georgia brown during an appearance 
that became part of a special on public television 
i was about as nervous as ive ever been the softspoken 
oconnor recalled in an interview i was almost white as a ghost 
but as an american musician it was one of the most rewarding 
things you could do 
oconnor a native of seattle taught himself to play fiddle at 
age 11 by watching others naturally gifted he was also proficient 
on the guitar banjo mandolin and dobro but the fiddle became his 
instrument of choice 
it seems like im a little bit more naturally expressive on 
it he said 
he has made concert tours with the rockfusion band dixie dregs 
and with jazz master stephane grappelli he played on michael 
breckers grammywinning jazz lp in 1989 dont try this at 
home and collaborated with james taylor on taylors album 
never die young he has won frets magazines best 
instrumentalist award six times 
oconnor has played on just about every style of record 
possible 
the variety of it is amazing he said the bulk of it is 
country and theres a lot of alternative things jazz folky pop 
contemporary christian 
music is so much a part of my being that i just walk around 
with melodies in my head all day long 
oconnor who does not sing says he loves all musical styles if 
they are played well i try to play these different styles and i 
learn a lot from every style it almost helps me play the opposing 
style better i dont get so wrapped up in the style or the idiom 
that i reject others i adapt 
even though he plays almost every day he said hes still 
learning and searching for perfection 
i feel like my mind is divided onehalf of it teaches the 
other half so onehalf of it is constantly looking for new ideas 
and new things to pick up then i train and teach myself those 
things 
the most rewarding part is improvisation playing from the 
inspiration of the moment and not knowing what youre going to do 
its a little bit mysterious and magical what it really is is 
onthespot composition youre letting it all out on the line 
oconnor doesnt think hell ever get tired of playing 
sometimes i do get tired of playing in the situations im playing 
in this happens more than tiring of the music itself i dont want 
to do one type of thing too many times im always looking for the 
ne approach

john oates of hall and oates and bob weir of the 
grateful dead took a 200mile trip in august riding mountain 
bicycles through national forests in montana oates says it changed 
his ideas about national forests 
i thought you set up a camp and smokey the bear keeps you from 
setting forest fires he said through a friend in montana i 
heard about massive clear cutting going on in national forests 
what we found was depressing and enlightening a lot of forest 
is being cut at a rate that cannot sustain continued growth a lot 
is exported to foreign countries we went through a borderline 
area not devastated completely it borders a wilderness area the 
delicate balance of the wildlife habitat is completely altered 
oates said he planned to take his information to washington and 
seek a citizens bill to protect national forests 
oates and weir were accompanied on their bike trip by friends 
and some members of the alliance for the wild rockies who want to 
designate part of the rocky mountain chain as a wilderness area

robert bensing doesnt feel cheated by his 
brief flirtation with an agereversing hormone that some fancy may 
be the doorway to a futuristic fountain of youth 
in fact the 72yearold retired chemist has found his joints no 
longer ache constantly with arthritis and his skin is firmer 
giving him the appearance and vitality of a man much his junior 
i feel a little more energetic said bensing who relishes 
being called son by a friend about his age and now can spend 
more time gardening 
he stopped taking the hormone more than 1 years ago and 
doctors predicted the agereversing symptoms of his therapy would 
fade within a few months 
theoretically i lost all that but i dont feel that i did 
bensing said recently his rural waukegan home since the benefits 
didnt go away i dont feel cheated it was worth it if it 
contributes to the advancement of medical knowledge we dont feel 
cheated 
for a year bensing injected himself three times weekly with the 
human growth hormone within six months of the first treatment he 
could unscrew bottle caps with ease mow the law without tiring 
easily and sit through lengthy car trips all of which would have 
been difficult months earlier 
tests revealed the hormone treatments helped shrink body fat 
restore lean body mass lost through aging and increase the 
thickness of bensings skin 
i noticed right off he was doing things much faster said 
bensings wife alice 57 he was more willing to go places and 
do things than before 
the growth hormone taken by bensing and 19 other older male 
volunteers is a synthetic version of one produced naturally in 
humans as one ages the natural production of the hormone fades 
and eventually stops researchers have learned 
daniel rudman an endocrinologist at the medical college of 
wisconsin in suburban milwaukee and director of the experiment 
said researchers have determined the hormone injections reversed 
aging in the body composition of elderly men by as much as 20 
years 
rudman and his fellow researchers reported this summer in the 
new england journal of medicine that the hormone increased lean 
body mass in patients by 9 percent decreased fat tissue by 14 
percent and thickened skin by 7 percent 
it does not however affect failing eyesight hearing loss or 
degeneration of brain cells the improvements strictly involved the 
patients body mass 
rudman 62 was among a group of physicians in the 1960s who 
used human growth hormone to treat abnormally short children he 
decided to experiment with the hormone on the elderly after 
watching his parents grow old and frail in a nursing home 
the hormone once only available by extraction from human 
corpses now is produced through genetic engineering but regular 
treatment costs 14000 a year for adults 
experts warn it is too soon to determine the severity of 
sideeffects or whether the hormone could be produced cheaper and 
more readily 
most of the men in the experiment have declined to talk publicly 
since the study was published some at the advice of the medical 
college of wisconsin 
bensing one of the first volunteers for the study said the 
hormone lessened the crippling effects of arthritis prompted a 
quicker recovery from a cataract operation and appeared to make a 
crushed spinal disk a bit sturdier 
theres a guy my age starting to call me son bensing 
said they said you look great 
when he began treatment bensing was told the possible side 
effects included an increase in blood pressure or blood sugar but 
his only complaint was a numbness in his wrists which he 
attributed to pressure from skin and muscle growth it stopped once 
the therapy ceased he said 
but bensing who lost hearing in one ear while an air force 
engineer in world war ii said he was disappointed the hormone 
didnt help that 
mrs bensing who was born with cerebral palsy said she too 
would like to one day receive the hormone 
ive had limitations all my life she said i can see so 
many benefits for women osteoporosis and other problems in the 
aging process 
rudman whose research was carried out at veterans hospitals in 
north chicago and milwaukee said the hormone didnt appear to 
significantly improve bone density reverse brain cell loss cure 
failing vision or affect life span 
its value may lie in helping the chronically ill or older people 
prepare for or recover from major medical operations or illnesses 
he said 
dr axel g feller who helped in the experiments at the 
veterans administration medical center in north chicago said 
researchers are not prepared to recommend groth hormones for the 
aged 
we dont have the whole picture feller said 
results of the experiments on the elderly which began in 1980 
and are continuing may make therapeutic applications of the 
hormone available within five years rudman said

age rarely stands in the way of success at 
the ballot box in michigan despite gov james blanchards highly 
publicized decision to dump his 78yearold running mate 
statewide elected officials include not only martha griffiths 
who was 70 when she was elected to her first term as lieutenant 
governor but democrats secretary of state richard austin 77 and 
attorney general frank kelley 65 both are running for new 
fouryear terms 
no one has suggested to me that i should not run again for 
any reason said austin seeking his sixth term my personal 
view is that voters generally do not regard my age in any way 
theyre concerned about how well i perform in the office 
austins republican opponent state rep judith miller 54 of 
birmingham said she has no plans to question his fitness for 
office at 77 
from my perspective whether you are young or old should not 
be the determining factor in how you function its the kind of 
thing i dont believe is a legitimate issue 
the fact that the issue of fitness was raised with griffiths 
but not with austin irked her the longtime champion of womens 
rights complained the governor never would have booted her if shed 
been a 78yearold man 
blanchard removed griffiths from the democratic ticket aug 24 
after two terms saying he no longer considers her ready to step in 
and assume the governors duties at a moments notice 
age was not a factor he said but he declined to elaborate on 
his reasons griffiths who feuded publicly with blanchard for 
weeks about the breakup of their political partnership said he 
told her she could be on the ticket if she released her medical 
records and tax returns she refused but told reporters her health 
is good 
griffiths only obvious problem is her hearing at a news 
conference responding to blanchards removal of her from the 
ticket she lost her hearing aid she and her husband searched for 
it on the floor behind the podium retrieved it and put it back in 
her ear but she still had difficulty hearing questions 
the former congresswoman keeps a busy schedule speaking to 
womens groups and presiding over the michigan senate but senators 
complained she was cranky and lectured them like schoolchildren 
under michigans constitution the lieutenant governor acts as 
governor whenever the chief executive is out of state that has 
happened 18 days so far this year 
the secretary of state is next in line austin was acting 
governor for a week in 1988 when blanchard and griffiths were at 
the democratic national convention 
austin oversees 185 offices around michigan whose 2000 
employees issue drivers licenses sell license plates and register 
voters his schedule runs 12 to 15 hours a day with no annual 
vacations said his scheduler ann johnson 
he looks lean and fit and credits that to habits developed as an 
athlete which included time as high school track team captain 
hurdles were my favorite event he said somehow i can 
still visualize myself skimming over those hurdles i wouldnt try 
it today 
austin walks six to eight miles every sunday to keep his legs in 
shape thats half the battle he said 
age is less of a hurdle for incumbents like austin than 
challengers said david rohde professor of political science at 
michigan state university 
its much easier for the electorate to be convinced the person 
is qualified to serve regardless of age if the person already is 
serving he said 
but the fitness of an elderly person for office is an individual 
matter just as it is for younger candidates he said partly it 
depends on how visibly capable and vigorous the candidate is 
in floridas democratic primary for governor bill nelson 48 
tried to make age an issue calling for a new generation of 
leadership his opponent lawton chiles 61 won the primary and 
age has not been an issue in the general election 
austin declined to comment on the blanchardgriffiths fuss 
which seems to have faded as a political issue as the governor 
nears the end of his campaign for a third term 
blanchard 48 replaced griffiths with olivia maynard 54 
director of the state office of services to the aging 
republican challenger john engler 42 sought to capitalize on 
the booting of griffiths by adding gray hair to his ticket 
66yearold sen connie binsfeld

at 73 helen menz thought she had scaled 
her last mountain 
after all shed climbed the 46 highest peaks of the 
adirondacks she decided a climb up 4159foot phelps mountain last 
summer would be her farewell to highpeaks hiking age had finally 
caught up with her she thought 
then a weekend hike on wright mountain proved her wrong after 
letting her son and grandchildren hike up the trail ahead of her 
she hit upon her own pace by walking then resting walking and 
resting 
first thing i knew i was on top said menz who lives in 
the albany suburb of loudonville i finally owned up to the fact 
that you have to go at your own pace 
menz is not unique older climbers are common in the adirondacks 
all the way up to the high peaks dozens past their supposed prime 
are proving that regularly scrambling up rocky crags and thwacking 
through prickly brush is not exclusively for the young 
you can do it until youre fairly old menz said if you 
sit down and say im finished well then you are finished 
menz said she likes to hike with all three generations of her 
family at least twice a year the only other nod to age is a 
walking stick she carries to absorb some of the shock her knees no 
longer can 
age is no limiting factor said ed hixson a surgeon from 
saranac lake its an extremely good thing for older people 
hixson who has done a bit of climbing himself from the 
adirondacks to the peak of mount everest said hiking is a healthy 
alternative for people who can no longer handle jogging or team 
sports 
he warns though that prospective hikers should get a complete 
checkup before putting the extra stress on the cardiovascular 
system 
hixson by the way said most people would be amazed by the 
number of older people climbing the adirondacks 
older hikers run into the least trouble on the trails because 
they generally bring a lifetime of experience with them most 
older people who hike have hiked all their lives he said 
at 66 chuck bennett has been hiking in the mountains only six 
years but he has packed in a lifetime of climbing making about 
300 ascents 
bennett a retired general electric worker figures he goes 
highpeak hiking two or three times a week thursdays are given 
over to the crooked caners a loosely knit group of hikers who 
regularly hit the trails of the adirondacks and nearby areas the 
only membership rule is that there are no rules 
named after the crooked cane each member is presented with 
caners are mostly in their 60s theyve been hiking weekly the 
past six years rain or shine or even snow 
no matter what the weather is we go out said priscilla 
hayes who at age 46 is the youngest of the group 
a recent hike to the hudson gorge brought out 15 of the 50 or so 
caners an offandon drizzle made the trail mucky and clouds of 
flies clustered around the hikers heads hikers broke their brisk 
pace only to spy a deer that crossed the path or check spores on 
the back of fern fronds 
its nice to have a space where you can revive your spirit 
said pat collier 61 who has been climbing the range almost all 
her life and seems to know the mountains personally 
six of her seven children have followed her footsteps 
literally and made it to the top of each adirondack peak 
i never knew why i climbed theres something alluring about 
the peaks theres something spiritual said grace hudowalski 
who at 84 has stopped climbing but remains the grand old lady of 
adirondack hikers and the first woman to scale all 46 of the 
highest peaks 
hudowalski said she writes more than 500 letters a year 
congratulating and advising hikers and climbers of all ages 
when you talk about mountains you get very personal with 
people she said

older people are being warned against 
companies that offer worthless protection for their social 
security benefits and promote other schemes that essentially 
provide nothing for something 
a senior consumer alert issued by the american association of 
retired persons in cooperation with the national association of 
attorneys general says the results promised in mailings that often 
resemble government communications are anything but guaranteed 
instead they are schemes that provide the consumer with 
nothing for something the consumer advisory said it says the 
misleading advertising in the mailings generally falls into one of 
the following categories 
misrepresenting the company as a us government agency 
charging for services the social security administration 
provides for free 
selling socalled required items such as laminated social 
security cards 
using scare tactics to spur fundraising efforts suggesting 
for example that failure to donate will prevent the group from 
lobbying to save social security benefits 
conducting highly suspicious sweepstakes contests to lure 
older consumers into buying other services 
the consumer alert noted that legislation under consideration in 
congress would permit postal authorities to declare unmailable 
letters that could reasonably be seen as implying a government 
connection which does not exist 
this would supplement regulations issued by the department of 
health and human services authorizing civil monetary penalties 
against companies sending such mailings 
the advisory also noted that there are companies operating 
nationwide that offer protection for federal benefits 
without commenting further on the quality or honesty of their 
services it is important to note that none of these companies is 
affiliated with a government agency and that most are private 
profitmaking companies the alert said 
the social security system provides free to anyone on request a 
personalized statement of earnings and provides a method for 
correcting errors 
but the consumer advisory said companies use the form requesting 
this service as a marketing tool and for a fee collect it from 
older citizens and mail it to the social security administration 
for processing 
some of these companies even employ outrageous scare tactics 
in soliciting business such as warning that an illegal alien may 
be using your social security number to work illegally in this 
country or that someone may be fraudulently collecting benefits 
meant for you 
another approach offers to help a senior citizen apply for 
social security benefits for an unnecessary 15 fee 
still another offers a goldembossed plasticlaminated 
lifetime social security card claiming it can be used for 
check cashing 
the consumer advisory noted that the paper social security card 
is good for a lifetime and can easily and cheaply be laminated 
the substitute card provided by the protection service 
cannot be used for any official purpose such as check cashing 
thus making it an expensive and useless purchase the advisory 
said

celebrity its been a remarkable journey for art linkletter who 
says he never intended to get into show business in the first 
place 
i was studying to be an english professor said linkletter 
78 but as they say life is what happens to you while youre 
making other plans 
adults remember linkletter as the practical joker on nbcs 
people are funny 
his house party also known as the linkletter show ran 
24 years on radio and tv until 1969 linkletter often made kids 
the centerpiece of his routines keeping a straight face while they 
made embarrassing revelations about their parents 
family is the key we had a traditional family he said 
my wife was a private person taking care of the children family 
and house i was the breadwinner i had the fortress of my home so 
i could go out and battle the demons 
and who were these demons linkletter says everyone from 
unscrupulous competitors to thieves drugpushers and other threats 
to family health and happiness 
hoping to shield his loved ones linkletter said he developed a 
career that would enable his wife to stay at home but he found 
there are no guarantees in life 
linkletters 20yearold daughter diane jumped to her death 
from her sixthfloor hollywood apartment in 1969 while under the 
influence of lsd three months earlier the husband of his oldest 
daughter shot and killed himself in 1980 his 35yearold son 
robert was killed in a car accident 
life is not fair not easy he said outside peer 
pressure can wreak havoc with the nicest families so thats the 
part thats a gamble 
but im an optimist even though ive had tragedies in my 
life and ive seen a lot of difficult things i still am an 
optimist 
linkletters own childhood had its share of struggles 
born arthur gordon kelley linkletters preacherfather 
drenched me in religion and forced him to take odd jobs during 
the depression he said so at 16 linkletter left and became a 
hobo hopping trains across the west working where he could 
several years later linkletter returned home and entered san 
diego state college where he got his first taste of broadcasting 
he went on to national radio and finally television 
today he is recognized as the dapper silverhaired man who sells 
therapeutic contour chairs one of which he owns and occasionally 
uses 
the little kids dont know me generally linkletter said 
mothers come up to me in airports with children and say jimmy 
this is art linkletter and the poor kid looks up and says whos 
he 
of course there was a time when every kid in america knew 
me 
linkletter doesnt seem to mind that his star has faded a bit 
he owns a home in plush belair the view from his wilshire 
district office takes in the skyscrapers of downtown los angeles 
he spoke with a visitor at a big desk topped with family photos and 
a statue of an american bald eagle 
he gives 75 to 80 lectures around the country each year his 
name appears on 23 books including the bestsellers kids say the 
darndest things and old age is not for sissies his next book 
is tentatively titled how to make your child into a human 
being 
following his daughters death linkletter began a nationwide 
campaign against drug abuse he continues to speak out against 
drugs and said his faith in christianity has grown 
lois his wife of 54 years continues to live the traditional 
lifestyle spending time with her children and grandchildren she 
said the key to their long marriage and prosperity was the absence 
of competition 
what hes good at im not she said as she wallpapered her 
home with her daughter sharon his rise to the top was gradual 
for us it was a part of our lives 
sharon 44 said growing up as a linkletter was at times 
perplexing she recalled feeling awkward at a public school because 
she was a famous child she later transferred to a private school 
i think as an adult unfortunately a lot of the years growing 
up were taken for granted she said it didnt seem odd to me 
to be on tv christmas shows but as an adult i saw what an 
incredible life we had 
she now looks at her father as a man who made a whole rainbow 
out of his life he turned lemons into lemonade and rain into 
rainbows

xu xuejing looks much like other plump chinese 
grandmothers in gray cotton slacks and buttonup sleeveless blouse 
her steelgray hair pulled severely back in a knot at the nape of 
her neck 
and thats just the idea for chinas oldest fashion model 
due to convention and lack of choice older chinese women tend 
to favor almost identical outfits white tunics or blouses black 
or gray baggy pants earrings and severe haircuts or buns 
they are often elegant in their simplicity but rarely 
fashionable 
beijings debut into world fashion as a major textile exporter 
however has brought with it a growing sense of style for chinese 
women 
designer lu shiying established the beijing fashion model team 
for middleaged and elderly people in 1987 after noticing during a 
visit to japan that older japanese women continued to care about 
fashion long past 40 
older people here tend to wear black white gray and blue we 
look like old feudal grandmothers said mrs xu 73 its not 
that we dont love beauty but we just dont dare to make ourselves 
beautiful 
mrs xu the daughter of a wealthy shanghai industrialist has 
survived world war civil war and revolution during the 196676 
cultural revolution she and her husband who comes from a similar 
family background were branded enemies of society 
through it all she retained the refinement of her upbringing 
an asset that helped make her a fashion model at 70 which she 
decided to try after a daughter saw an ad in a newspaper she said 
after she retired from teaching music at 55 mrs xu said i 
would just lay on the bed day after day and i suffered so many 
illnesses that my husband prepared my grave and was just waiting 
for me to die 
getting out and making new friends has given her a new lease on 
life she said 
these experiences have given me an emotional backbone mrs 
xu said i havent been really sick for three years 
a pioneer for her age group mrs xu said her modeling skills 
are selftaught i cant move like a young person so i had to 
figure out for myself how to walk to suit my image and 
appearance 
and her husband for the first time has learned to cook for 
her 
she models at least once a week often for highlevel groups 
including the national peoples congress the countrys 
legislature the styles are designed for her age group belowknee 
aline coats and dresses with high collars feature heavily in lu 
shiyings designs 
sharing the catwalk with young models less than half her age can 
be a real trial 
but what do you know we older models get the most 
applause she said people tell us that our beauty is 
different we represent chinas elderly 
my legs and eyes are bad she said im old and ugly but 
my heart is young

most leftover flower or vegetable seeds are quite 
useable for another season in the home garden saving seeds from 
your own plants can be a different ball game but either way a few 
rules point the way to success or indicate why its not worth the 
effort 
vegetable seeds that are fairly simple to store at home for 
three to five years include tomato pea bean lettuce beet 
cabbage cauliflower radish carrot cucumber watermelon squash 
spinach and eggplant 
long storage also is possible for flower seeds such as marigold 
zinnia pansy petunia verbena and alyssum 
onion sweet corn parsley strawflower and candytuft are among 
those with the shortest shelflives 
the technical details of seed saving fill countless books and 
as in all human endeavors there can be varying degrees of success 
in general the fresher the seed the better the germination 
however home gardeners are not likely to notice much difference 
from heldover seeds and probably will need to thin excess 
seedlings as always if they follow the seedpackets planting 
instructions 
a simple test of seed viability is to put a pinch of seeds from 
a packet on a moist paper towel fold the seeds inside and keep the 
towel moist for fiitethru 1029 0313

<TEXT>
a gunman opened fire in a crowded church 
basement wounding seven of the 300 people gathered for a social 
event detectives questioned the victims today to try to determine 
the motive 
police constable bruno vaillancourt said three women and four 
men were shot and wounded but none critically the shootings 
occurred early sunday at a jamaicancanadian gathering at st 
pascal baylon roman catholic church 
police did not identify the gunman or the victims but said the 
suspect was a man in his mid20s 
constable charles morrisseau said the investigation is 
proceeding slowly because many witnesses were reluctant to talk to 
the police nobody wants to say anything he said 
vaillancourt said three people already had been taken to the 
hospital by the time police arrived at the church shortly after 
130 am sunday the most seriously injured person suffered a 
bullet wound behind the ear the others were wounded in the 
abdomen hands and feet 
while the police said they did not know the reason for the 
shootings the church pastor suggested rival gangs might be 
involved 
the rev louis levasseur said fighting among rival black groups 
has been a problem for the eight years he has been at the church 
the elderly priest also said the problems only occur when 
englishspeaking black groups rent the hall for special events 
we rent the hall to latinamericans asians and haitians and 
never have any problems levasseur said 
the race and language of the group that rented the hall at the 
time of the shootings were not immediately reported 
this is not the first time there have been gunshots and people 
hurt said levasseur shots were fired in the hall five or six 
months ago but no one has been injured in about a year and a half 
he said 
he suggested the church may have to stop renting the hall to 
englishspeaking black groups at the risk of being labeled 
racist

delivery than alternative systems such as publishers express for 
which time warner is the managing partner eight other equity 
partners are involved in the project 
begun in atlanta last year on a trial basis publishers express 
now is delivering more than 100000 magazines catalogs and 
advertisement packages a month to more than 80000 households 
within five zip codes the company has set a goal of 200000 pieces 
a month to 100000 households by the end of the year 
from a suburban atlanta facility delivery crews sort 24 titles 
including time sports illustrated tv guide the atlantic 
monthly and playboy and deliver them in sealed packages before 
dawn each day 
publishers express cannot use mailboxes under federal law the 
magazines and catalogs are delivered to doorsteps or left at the 
base of a mailbox 
if you look at the magazine business distribution is the only 
cost we dont have control over said howard rosen president of 
publishers express but its very tough to tell the post office 
you dont like their pricing structure theyd say fine but 
youve got nowhere else to go 
since 1970 rosen said the cost for second class postage 
which is the rate for newspapers and magazines has risen 811 
percent compared to a general inflation rate of 209 percent over 
that time third class postage the rate for most catalogs has 
gone up 364 percent he said 
the postal service puts the figures a bit lower 767 percent for 
second class and 247 percent for third class 
nonetheless rosen said its too cost prohibitive to 
distribute our products through the post office 
in addition to titles published by time warner the distribution 
service has contracted with other magazines and catalogs to deliver 
their products rosen said the titles in the designated zip code 
areas are automatically distributed through publishers express 
though consumers may request that the postal service take over 
their service 
postal service spokesman bob hoobing said costs may be higher 
but service is reliable 
the fact of the matter is we have people who are career 
workers delivering the mail we think were more reliable he 
said 
hoobing declined to speculate on the impact of such alternative 
delivery services he said about 65 percent of the 1616 billion 
pieces of mail handled last year by the postal service was second 
class 
if future postal rate increases continue to pinch there will 
be more magazines saying to time we want to join you said 
gross of the magazine publishers of america 
kofie q dadzie an assistant marketing professor at georgia 
state university who specializes in distribution systems said an 
operation such as times would have to handle an enormous amount of 
material to make its costs competitive with the post office 
id be interested in finding the cost analysis that said it 
would be cheaper dadzie said im surprised 
rosen declined to disclose publishers express income but he 
acknowledged the distribution system must expand if it is to do the 
job of the post office at a lower cost 
clearly at the scale were at we are not in a competitive 
price situation with the post office he said we need to 
double our volume it can be reached within the next year or 
two

despite a slowing economy and talk of a 
recession consumers havent been spooked out of spending money for 
halloween 
all hallows eve the largest money grossing holiday behind 
christmas is a recessionproof business say costume 
manufacturers and retailers 
halloween remains good during all times whether theres an 
economic slowdown or not said howard beige vice president of 
sales at rubies costume company inc in new york 
during an economic slowdown people may purchase fewer major 
appliances and take fewer trips but when it comes to spending 
money on themselves or for a party they do halloween survives 
recessions very well 
fifty million americans are expected to celebrate halloween this 
year estimates hallmark the holiday and greeting card giant in 
kansas city mo 
theyll spend 400 million for costumes and accessories and up 
to 2 billion once candy pumpkins and other items are included 
hallmark said the company said thats slightly more than what was 
spent last year 
adults are one reason for the financial success of halloween 
which dates back to 700 bc and the druids who believed the souls 
of the dead returned to mingle with the living on this one night of 
the year 
halloween is the second most popular adult party occasion behind 
new years eve and adults account for 25 percent of all costume 
sales hallmark said 
halloween is a party occasion thats continuing to grow 
said hallmark spokeswoman sherry timbrook a recession or slow 
economy wont interfere people will still seek out fun and 
fantasy 
its so darn important to have a good time especially during 
bad times said jack sheehan owner of the costumer a 
73yearold costume shop in schenectady ny 
my mother used to tell me that during the depression theyd go 
without meat for a week to be able to go to a movie on saturday 
night sheehan said 
glenn sanders a psychology professor at the state university of 
new york at albany said hard times do make the idea of fun more 
important he also said having a good time on halloween doesnt 
involve spending a lot of money 
its not just that people want to have fun theres not much 
cost associated with halloween sanders said people want to 
have fun with expensive cars but thats something thats very much 
tied to the economy and whether theres a recession halloween 
involves a small amount of money relative to christmas or other 
entertainment decisions people will make 
manufacturers and retailers seem to have no apprehensions about 
business rubies which manufactures costumes and other halloween 
merchandise introduced 250 new products this year 
weve seen a moderate increase over last years sales 
halloween seems to be selling well said beige although he 
declined to release sales figures 
hallmark said its stores are devoting the same amount of space 
to halloween merchandise this year as they did last year 
people put an emphasis on entertainment theyre not willing 
to sacrifice entertainment for themselves said philip morris 
president of morris costumes in charlotte nc which distributes 
costumes and halloween wares across the country 
but just in case some producers are offering an economy line of 
merchandise 
we are offering a lowerprice range of costume accessories to 
capture more of the market at the lower end beige said 
sheehan whose store carries many of rubies products said he 
has noticed some prudence among consumers this year he said hell 
sell more teenage mutant ninja turtle costumes at 1498 than he 
will at 27 
these lowerpriced options exist because of the hard economic 
times he said but the volume of business we have makes up for 
the fact that were selling less expensive costumes 
sheehan who also rents costumes for theatrical productions 
said most of his costumes sell for 25 to 35 rented costumes for 
adults fetch 40 
latex masks for 2995 are another big chunk of halloween sales 
this year saddam hussein ayatollah khomeini fidel castro and 
gorbachev masks are selling well outselling all these however is 
the everpopular richard m nixon mask 
its that shyster image thats made it popular morris said 
halloween producers and retailers insist they arent likely to 
suffer this year but admit things arent as they used to be 
the crazy spending of the 1980s is gone when the dust 
settles not all of us will be here said sheehan whose annual 
sales total about 1 million 
sheehan believes the slowing economy will force many of the 
nations leading chain stores to cut back on the amount of 
halloween merchandise they sell he said that will allow specialty 
stores to recoup business they lost when chains jumped on the 
halloween band wagon in the last decade 
halloween is over retailed maybe a recession will be a 
correcting factor sheehan said 
regardless he said sales at halloween will always be strong 
because consumers are spending money on themselves 
morris agreed 
with christmas consumers may cut back on things theyre going 
to buy or the amount theyll spend the expenditure is not for 
themselves he said halloween is its escapism and its 
fun

you can fly but you cant hide 
business people who think the best part of air travel is that 
their office cant find them are in for a disappointment the 
technology is here to track you down 
applications were due last week to the federal communications 
commission for new systems to provide telephone service to 
commercial aircraft 
within the next two years telecommunications companies say not 
only will air passengers be able to place phone calls theyll be 
able to receive them alng with facsimile messages and data from 
portable computers some companies describe it as the office in 
the sky 
mccaw cellular communications inc and hughes network systems on 
tuesday said they had formed a limited partnership to build and 
operate a nationwide phone and data system for commercial aircraft 
the new service called clairtel would involve 80 ground 
stations located around the united states to provide radio links 
with aircraft mccaw spokesman bob ratliffe said 
clairtel and gte airfone inc were among companies that filed 
for permanent licenses for the aircraft systems by the oct 22 
deadline said jay jackson engineering assistant to the fccs 
chief of mobile services 
jackson said he did not know all the companies that applied and 
would not have a count on the applicants for several days but he 
expected applications from five to 10 companies all are expected 
to get licenses if their paperwork is in order he said 
gte airfone a subsidiary of stamford connbased gte is the 
largest operator of airborne pay phones with 1300 installed on 
planes owned by 17 us and canadian airlines it was the first to 
enter the market on oct 15 1984 under an experimental license 
from the fcc spokesman kevin petschow said 
airfone uses a portable phone based on an aircraft bulkhead or 
in newer versions at passenger seats each plane has a radio 
transmitterreceiver and a computer that handles billing and 
selects one of 90 gte ground stations in north america and hawaii 
to establish a radio link outside the united states the phones 
work off comsats satellite service 
its not cheap calls anywhere in the united states or canada 
are 2 a minute plus a 2 setup charge per use 
so far calls can only be placed from the aircraft to the 
ground the licenses applied for last week initially will only 
permit airtoground service jackson said 
but both gte airfone and clairtel have loftier ideas 
petschow said airfone plans to have a secondgeneration 
system in operation by 1992 that will allow calls from the ground 
to the aircraft from one plane to another and personal computer 
hookups fax transmissions and message services he said 
information hotlines stock information services and other features 
also might be added he said 
imagine all the things you do in your office you can do in an 
aircraft petschow said 
gte airfone also plans to offer cabin management services 
for air carriers allowing them to monitor inventory and bill 
credit cards over phone links he said 
ratliffe said clairtel at first would install a system similar 
to gte airfones but eventually wants it to be more a part of 
mccaws cellular system mccaw based in the seattle suburb of 
kirkland operates one of the nations largest cellular networks 
with ownership positions in more than 100 markets across the 
country 
the ultrahighfrequency radio bands for cellular phones are 
near those assigned to the aircraft phones so it may be possible 
to have a cellular phone that can receive both he said 
mccaw is working with other cellular companies to develop a 
north american network with a nationwide switching system it will 
be possible to dial a cellular phone number in seattle for 
instance yet find that phone wherever it might be in the nation 
ratliffe said eventually he added that could include aircraft 
lets say im on the plane to miami ratliffe said it 
would ring on the plane thats what were trying to get to 
clairtel also envisions computer data transmissions pager 
messages faxes and other advanced services ratliffe said theres 
the potential to deliver video entertainment to passengers seats 
and for phonetoting passengers to dial up drinks or food from the 
aircraft galley 
jackson however has his doubts about how far the skyhigh 
office might fly especially if all that highlevel talk means more 
work for the cabin crew 
i dont think airlines want their attendants becoming a 
secretarial service for passengers on the aircraft he said

louisiana has been giving sales tax back to 
foreign shoppers for a year now but while state officials are 
thrilled to see more tourists some of the visitors are frustrated 
with red tape 
the experimental taxfree shopping program has returned 1 
million in taxes to foreign tourists who spent 13 million at the 
1000 participating stores officials said the state figures the 
vistors money has brought in 2 to 4 million in tax revenue from 
increased economic activity since the program started last nov 1 
hotel restaurant and transportation taxes are not refunded 
officials had expected each foreign shopper to spend about 300 
on taxexempt purchases however its turned out to be almost 
triple that and six times what the average us tourist spends 
said jerry merlino head of the program 
for every 1 percent we increase international visitation to 
louisiana the state would gain 35 million in taxes on money 
spent on goods and services not eligible for tax refunds 
said karen kelly marketing and sales director of the program 
the weakened dollar which gives foreign tourists more spending 
power in this country has helped bring shoppers officials 
acknowledge but the sales tax rebate which in new orleans amounts 
to 9 percent has given louisiana an edge they say 
while the tourists are spending money some are leaving angry 
i need my refund now one man argued during 20 minutes of 
haggling with the refund clerk at the airport redemption center 
it wasnt explained to me before i began shopping that i 
wouldnt be able to get my money immediately said the man who 
would not give his name to a reporter i wanted the cash for when 
i traveled instead i have to wait for them to mail it to me 
officials said it could take 4 to 6 weeks for mailed refunds to 
reach their destinations 
jessica nguyen an employee at the refund center said such 
complaints are common 
tourists read the information booklet wrong or misinterpret 
the way the tax is calculated she said thats when they leave 
dissatisfied 
at least one traveler found problems in the stores too 
linda white an american citizen living in germany said getting 
a refund didnt seem to be worth the effort for a german companion 
of hers 
at one store everything went smoothly but to fill out the 
vouchers we needed to go to the fourth floor of the store and our 
purchase was so small that we decided not to expend the energy 
in another store one person told us all you have to do is 
show your receipts to get your refund another said the same thing 
but when we get to the refund center were met with an entirely 
different set of rules she added 
but for all the gripes merlino has success stories the central 
american man who spent 10000 on shoes the colombian sea captain 
and three sailors who spent 40000 on electrical equipment two 
paraguayan women spent 11000 on stock for their boutique and a 
group of canadians abandoned their florida vacation to go shopping 
in louisiana 
early estimates showed 462 percent of the participating 
tourists were from mexico france and canada ranked second at 19 
percent and japan third at 14 percent 
merlino said growing numbers are coming from central and south 
america england australia and west germany 
the word is spreading like wildfire he said

kansas gas and electric co has agreed to a 
1 billion merger with kansas power and light co in a move that 
could frustrate a hostile takeover effort by another regional 
utility company 
by becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of kansas power and light 
kgampe would escape being acquired by kansas city power and light 
co which had been offering 27 a share in an 875 million tender 
offer 
the merger agreement was unanimously approved by directors of 
both companies according to a joint statement released sunday by 
the utilities 
after carefully reviewing all options management has 
concluded that this merger serves the best interest of the 
companys shareholders its customers and employees said wilson 
cadman chief executive officer of kgampe 
in reaching its decision the board determined that the 
friendly combination with the kansas power and light company was 
not only attractive to our owners but the two companys people and 
assets fit together well permitting us to better serve our 
customers cadman said 
in the consolidation each share of kgampe common stock will be 
converted into a total of 32 in cash or kansas power and light 
stock the utilities said 
if kgampe stockholders wish all cash we can accommodate that up 
to 432 million cadman said if they want all stock we can 
accommodate that or a combination of each 
john e hayes jr chairman of kansas power and light said the 
utility started to look at the consequences of company ownership 
as soon as kcpl announced the hostile bid in july 
on sept 11 kgampe announced that it was negotiating with a third 
party as a means of rebuffing the takeover attempt it had been 
widely believed that kgampe was looking for a white knight as 
kcpl persisted 
in response to the merger announcement kcpl spokesman turner 
white said this is the thing thats been anticipated for a long 
time we need to evaluate exactly what the transaction is with 
respect to ours 
excess generating capacity of kgampe had been thought to be the 
main reason for kcpls interest in the takeover kcpl has a rapidly 
growing customer base and kgampe has enough excess capacity that 
could serve as many as 100000 additional residential customers 
hayes said the merged utilities would make available to kcpl 
enough generating capacity to fulfill their customer needs into 
the late 1990s at market rates 
hayes also said customers of kgampe would benefit from a 15 
million rate reduction to be sought once the merger is final 
we believe that the combined companies will provide even more 
efficient and higher quality service not only to our current 
customers but also to new business attracted to the area by the 
availability of abundant energy at reasonable costs hayes said 
kgampe has characterized kcpls tender offer as illegal and 
inadequate 
kcpl has extended its tender offer three times reporting 
earlier this month that about 44 percent of the kgampe shares had 
been tendered 
if the deal with kanas power and light is completed kgampe would 
continue to maintain its headquarters in wichita hayes said no 
layoffs for either company were expected 
the merger was subject to approval from state and federal 
regulatory authorities 
kansas power and light is based in topeka and does business as 
kpl gas service co it has about 1 million customers in kansas 
western missouri and northeastern oklahoma and had revenues of 11 
billion in 1989 
kgampe of wichita has about 250000 customers in southcentral and 
southeast kansas it had revenues of 5334 million last year

chrysler corp today reported it 
lost 214 million in the third quarter nearly offsetting the 251 
million it earned in the first six months of 1990 
the loss which amounts to 95 cents a share was a little less 
than expected by wall street analysts and stemmed mainly from 
incentive costs and lower production caused when minivan plants 
were retooled 
the earnings report came as chrysler faced a midnight expiration 
of a contract it negotiated with the united auto workers union in 
1988 
during the third quarter of last year chrysler earned 331 
million or 142 a share the 1989 results were boosted by a 
onetime credit of 309 million from the sale of a stake in 
mitsubishi motors corp of japan 
chrysler said the thirdquarter 1990 loss came on revenues of 
65 billion down 145 percent from 76 billion during the 
julyseptember period last year 
the companys thirdquarter losses were softened by 83 million 
in earnings for chrysler financial corp that profit a record for 
any third quarter in chryslers history compares with 
thirdquarter earnings last year of 76 million 
for the first nine months of the year chrysler earned 37 
million or 17 cents a share compared with 983 million or 421 
a share during the same time last year revenue fell 154 percent 
to 23 billion from 272 billion 
we anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for chrysler and for 
the industry so we launched a major costcutting program over a 
year ago company chairman lee iacocca said today we didnt 
anticipate the gulf crisis the federal budget fiasco or the 
continued escalation in the incentive wars so weve increased our 
costreduction goals to 25 billion over two years 
iacocca has set the target for june 1991 
chrysler took its minivan plants in st louis and in windsor 
ontario out of service for a month to retool for 1991 models 
damaging profits by reducing wholesale sales to dealers minivans 
and to a lesser extent jeeps are the bases for chryslers 
profits 
the company also is being hit by high incentive costs the big 
three would like to end the cash rebates and lowinterest 
financing but each is waiting for another to take the first step 
ford motor co reports its earnings tuesday the same day 
general motors corp releases its thirdquarter profit figures for 
its major subsidiaries and the day before it reports corporate 
earnings 
analysts have speculated fords earnings will be about 47 
percent below the 255 million it earned during the quarter last 
year and gms will be half of the 248 million it made during the 
period last year 
collectively thirdquarter earnings for the big three were 
expected to be about 80 percent lower than last year 
fords and gms overseas earnings continue to sag analysts have 
said hurting their corporate profits nearly all of chryslers 
operations are in the united states

chrysler corp today reported a 214 million 
quarterly loss as contract talks with the united auto workers 
neared a midnight deadline 
the thirdquarter loss nearly wiped out the 251 million the 
automaker earned in the first six months of 1990 chrysler 
reported 
the loss which works out to 95 cents a share was a little less 
than expected by wall street analysts and stemmed mainly from 
incentive costs and lower production when minivan plants were 
closed for retooling for 1991 models 
bargaining was said to be going slowly for the contract that 
covers 63000 employees among the major issues were pensions and 
health care 
the tone at the talks reportedly turned nasty sunday the 
detroit news in todays editions quoted an unidentified bargainer 
as saying uaw president owen bieber confronted chryslers anthony 
st john vice president for employee relations 
if you want a strike youll get it bieber told st john 
chryslers chief bargainer 
chrysler the nations no 3 automaker has been under pressure 
since the union on friday gave notice that the contract extension 
under which it has been working since midseptember would expire 
tonight 
the union has scheduled a meeting of its 200member chrysler 
bargaining council for thursday during which the local presidents 
and bargaining committee chairmen could get an update on the talks 
review a tentative agreement or discuss strike strategy 
chrysler made 331 million or 142 a share during the third 
quarter of last year those profits were boosted by a onetime 
credit of 309 million from the sale of a stake in mitsubishi 
motors corp of japan

increased our costreduction goals to 25 billion over two 
years iacocca said 
iacocca has set the target for june 1991 
the uaw has reached threeyear contracts with general motors 
corp and ford motor co and has said it wants chrysler to sign the 
same pattern agreement with minor alterations but the autmaker 
has said it may not be able to afford such a contract 
the pattern agreement calls for among other things lumpsum 
payments to current retirees and surviving spouses a method for 
increasing pension payments for workers who retired before oct 1 
1979 and increases in the amount future retirees will get 
of the big three automakers chrysler has the highest proportion 
of retiree costs it has nearly one retiree for every active 
worker there are about 14 active workers for each retiree at gm 
and about 15 for every ford retiree 
when bargaining began in midjuly chrysler also said it needed 
help from the uaw to cut healthcare expenses which cost the 
company about 684 million last year the pattern agreement has no 
change in healthcare provisions

the tax bill that congress passed over the 
weekend will touch nearly every segment of the american public 
most americans will pay higher taxes but on their purchases 
rather than on their earnings the bite will be relatively light 
for all but the welltodo those with incomes over 200000 a year 
will see their federal tax liabilities rise by an average of 63 
percent 
many of the 70 million couples and individuals with incomes 
under 20000 will get a slight tax cut thanks to expansion of the 
earnedincome credit for poorer working families with children 
the national taxpayers union a nonpartisan organization that 
campaigns for lower taxes estimated the bill will boost the taxes 
of a 30000 household by an average of 109 the union which 
figured all households in a certain income bracket regardless of 
size said a 40000 household will pay 166 more at 50000 it 
will pay an extra 214 70000 277 more 100000 542 more 
and households at the 225000 level will face an average tax 
increase of 3572 
here are major provisions most of which will take effect jan

gasoline raise the 9cent gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon and 
the 15cent diesel tax to 20 cents on dec 1 a motorist driving 
10000 miles a year in a car that gets 22 miles per gallon will pay

year and couples with incomes above the 200000 range 
cut to 31 percent the 33 percent rate that as many as 4 million 
uppermiddleincome people pay on part of their earnings this will 
reduce taxes for single people with incomes between about 60000 
and 125000 and couples between about 100000 and 200000 
however other parts of the bill will take back that tax cut in 
most cases 
raise from 21 percent to 24 percent the alternative minimum tax 
which is paid by fewer than 100000 highincome people with large 
amounts of deductions that otherwise could reduce tax liability to 
near zero 
capital gains tax profits from the sale of investments at a 
maximum rate of 28 percent this will provide a break for those 
investors who now pay a maximum rate of 33 percent there is no

averting a split among the daily news newsroom 
employees a group of reporters and photographers decided to remain 
on strike today rather than take up an offer to cross picket lines 
and reclaim their jobs 
were willing to give the strike more time reporter paul 
larosa said sunday theres no point in going back now 
the news hit by a walkout last week by nine of its 10 unions 
had said striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobs 
at any time as long as permanent replacements had not been hired 
a group of 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the 
750member newspaper guild sent a delegation to discuss the matter 
sunday with guild president barry lipton 
some complained that the strike was called on the basis of a 
false report that replacements had already been hired to fill 
reporting slots 
theres a lot of anger at the guild leadership said 
striking reporter joanne wasserman 
but after the meeting the group decided to stay on strike the 
guild represents reporters photographers and office workers it 
could not be immediately determined how many guild members are 
honoring the strike 
no new talks are scheduled the news has said it plans to 
replace the strikers permanently 
the daily news the nations secondlargest metropolitan daily 
has published a paper each day since the strike began thursday 
night but conceded it is having trouble delivering the paper 
home delivery was spotty and many newsstands were not getting 
the newspaper we have not been hitting all distribution points 
as of yet john t sloan the newspapers chief spokesman said 
sunday we will soon 
he also accused strikers of intimidating dealers and removing 
papers from newsstands 
strikers have torched delivery trucks and vandalized others 
about 20 strikers have been arrested since the strike began most 
on disorderly conduct charges 
workers at the a amp s stationery store in brooklyn said 
clubwielding men had seized all 300 copies of sundays news and 
scattered them in the gutter i cant take the paper or they will 
kill me said one of the stores owners ali najeli 
the new york times quoted an unidentified management source as 
saying many drivers had become lost 
the news said in a statement sunday that it published and 
distributed more than 12 million papers in the city and 
surrounding suburbs exceeding saturdays press run by 500000 the 
news normally prints 146 million sunday papers 
the 71yearold daily has been in a financial tailspin for the 
past decade the news has lost about 115 million and seen daily 
circulation slip by about 700000 since 1980 it recently lost its 
standing as the nations largest metropolitan daily to the los 
angeles times 
the strike began thursday night when 60 drivers at the news were 
replaced in a dispute over whether a driver would be allowed to 
monitor a conveyor belt while sitting down all but one union 
followed suit members of the typographical union have continued 
working because they have guaranteed lifetime jobs 
the unions claimed management provoked the crisis which 
followed 10 months of often stormy talks on contracts to replace 
those that expired in march

merrill lynch amp co today announced a 
broadbased management shakeup that should help the nations 
largest securities firm rein in costs but may result in the loss of 
several hundred jobs 
the move includes establishing six core business divisions that 
will replace the twosector structure that has been in place since 
1984 the new divisions each with a new executive vice president 
are private client asset management insurance investment 
banking debt markets and equity markets 
while a merrill spokesman said the restructuring is not a 
layoffdriven process he added that the firm is committed to 
reducing our cost base wherever possible the move is expected to 
save the firm tens of millions of dollars over an unspecified 
period of time he added 
the spokesman said that the new vice presidents are going to 
go forward to see where they can consolidate support operations 
while there are no specific layoffs targeted he did say that some 
jobs could be eliminated where there are redundancies 
its possible over the next several months that they will 
reduce the work force by several hundred he said 
earlier this year a top merrill executive told analysts that 
under a worstcase scenario that is if business conditions 
continue to deteriorate the firm would consider furloughing 10 
percent of its staff at the peak in 1987 merrills payroll 
totaled 50000 the firm currently employs 39000 
the spokesman noted that over the past year merrill has been 
resizing our businesses as market conditions required that 
process will continue and we expect to be even more focused under 
the new structure 
the six new divisions will not operate autonomously under the 
twosector structure merrills individualinvestor operations were 
separate from its capital markets group which failed to foster 
cooperation between the two groups reports said 
the newly elected executive vice presidents are barry friedberg 
49 who will head investment banking david komansky 51 equity 
markets roger vasey 54 debt markets and arthur zeikel 58 
asset management 
two current executive vice presidents will head the other core 
business divisions john steffens 49 private client and thomas 
patrick 47 insurance 
separately two current executive vice presidents will head new 
support divisions they are jerome kenney 49 corporate strategy 
and research and herbert allison jr 47 finance and 
administration 
all will also serve on the firms executive management 
committee 
the new structure elevates key strategic ares of opportunity 
further streamlines the organization and elevates the role of our 
core line managers in directing business strategies and contolling 
costs said merrill chairman and chief executive william schreyer 
and president daniel tully in a statement

opponents of a philadelphia hotel room tax 
lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment rejected arguments the tax 
unlawfully interferes with interstate commerce and unfairly 
discriminates against those who live outside the city 
among those challenging the tax were members of a libertarian 
group called liberty forum a wall street journal editor and a 
business consultant 
they said the tax violates their rights by forcing them to 
contribute to the construction of a proposed 523 million 
philadelphia convention center 
the philadelphia city council authorized by a state law raised 
the tax in 1986 on hotel room rentals from 3 percent to 5 percent 
the rate is to go to 6 percent after substantial completion of the 
convention center 
the higher taxes are to help finance the centers construction 
although most of the money for the project is to come from other 
sources 
challenging the tax were liberty forum members john famularo and 
linda morrison of philadelphia wall street journal editor john 
fund who lives in jersey city nj richard broglino a business 
consultant from lexington mass and stuart kessler a new york 
city architect 
they said the tax is unconstitutional because it applies only to 
those who stay at a hotel 30 days or less the great majority of 
hotel patrons subject to the tax are outofstate residents they 
said 
a pennsylvania state court upheld the tax last year the state 
court said the higher taxes paid by those challenging the levy are 
minimal when compared to the prospective good to be achieved by 
both city residents and visitors alike 
the case is morrison vs pennsylvania convention center

trading division of dean witter reynolds inc said farmer sales of 
corn and soybeans increased slightly over the weekend which 
prompted further selling of futures contracts this morning

louisiana led the way this week as the number of 
working oil and gas rigs in the united states rose 18 to 1107 an 
industry report said monday 
the toolmaker baker hughes inc reported the latest count was up 
from 1010 a year ago last week the count improved by 33 to 
1089 
louisiana added nine rigs for the week while oklahoma wyoming 
california north dakota pennsylvania and texas also added rigs 
counts in other major producing states remained unchanged 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count since 1940 it is a 
widely watched index of drilling activity and represents the number 
of rigs actively exploring for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986

oil prices shot up more than 1 per barrel today 
as traders expressed concern over the apparent failure of soviet 
diplomatic efforts in the persian gulf 
in early trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude oil was up 149 to 3450 per barrel on contracts for 
december delivery later delivery contracts were all trading higher 
in light volume 
there was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there 
could be some progress made said peter beutel an oil analyst 
with pegasus econometric group inc whether its true or not 
people are saying this may be the last chance before some military 
action is necessary the thinking is if the soviets cant get iraq 
to change who can 
the soviet union and iraq had once had close ties but the 
soviets nonetheless lined up with the rest of the global community 
in condemning iraq for its invasion and occupation of neighboring 
kuwait in august 
soviet middle east troubleshooter yevgeny primakov met with 
iraqi president saddam hussein in baghdad on sunday and was said to 
have made little progress in resolving the crisis 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze had suggested a day earlier that iraq may have 
softened its stand but after sundays talks between primakov and 
saddam shevardnadze said he saw no reason for optimism 
some traders were taking things easy today as they waited to see 
an interview with saddam that cable news network was to air this 
evening according to brendan dolan a broker with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
even though oil was higher this morning traders said the market 
did not seem to have the strong momentum that has at times sent it 
surging early in todays session crude was up as much as 184 
per barrel but it began losing some of that ground late in the 
morning 
as crude moved up so did futures contracts for refined 
petroleum products 
home heating oil was up 430 cents to 9255 cents a gallon for 
november contracts with all later delivery months trading higher 
unleaded gasoline contracts were higher for all delivery months 
with november delivery contracts rising 423 cents to 9570 cents 
per gallon 
natural gas was down 03 cent to 2445 per 1000 cubic feet on

credit terms while the company struggles to emerge from

southland if they refuse to offer customary 
from the bench for the first time today about half an hour into 
the ninth oral argument of his new tenure

decide whether federal officials should have additional authority 
to deny temporary legal status to immigrant farmworkers

rights have been violated must wait for administrative hearings 
and souter asked a few other questions in the following case 
one in which the court must decide whether passengers on 
international flights may sue airlines for the emotional distress 
they allegedly suffer in nearcrashes that cause them no physical 
harm

bench through eight hours of argument sessions

nickels and dimes add up to real money as 
taxwriters know and taxpayers soon will learn its a big country 
and every penny counts when multiplied by millions of people 
if youre a beer drinker for example youll be taxed 16 cents 
more for every sixpack you buy not too bad you say until you 
get around to the multiplication 
that additional 16 cents doubles the total federal tax on the 
sixpack bringing the tab on a twopackaweek drinker to more 
than 33 in a year to which you might have to add a sales tax and 
a bottle or can deposit 
you probably drive a car as well and it isnt at all unusual 
that you might average 250 miles a week or 13000 miles a year and 
that your vehicle gets about 25 miles to a gallon 
that means your buggy consumes 10 gallons a week or 250 gallons 
a year on which youll be paying a 14centagallon tax of 140 a 
week or nearly 73 a year not counting what your state might add 
to the bill 
in an effort to avoid such tabs you might think of leaving the 
car behind and traveling by air on your vacation but you still 
will take along uncle sam effective dec 1 the ticket tax goes to 
10 percent from 8 percent 
you might say this nibbling at your wallet could drive you to 
drink but even then you wont escape the tax on a bottle of table 
wine rises to 21 cents from 3 cents and for a fifth of whiskey to 
nearly 215 
cigarettes offer no relief either because youll be paying an 
additional 4 cents a pack after january 1 which would add nearly 
15 a year to your bill if youre a packaday user 
taxes such as these slip up on you deceptively the units are in 
pennies but the multiples are in dollars and when applied so many 
times to so many things in life they tend to mount into the 
hundreds of dollars 
for uncle sam who multiplies the tax on each individual by 
millions of individuals the total tab is in the multibillions of 
dollars 
by such means does tax freedom day get pushed back back in 
1945 says the tax foundation you finished paying your obligations 
to uncle sam by april 1 from new years until that date in 
theory you were working for sam 
by 1965 freedom day was delayed until april 28 and this year 
it occurs around may 5 meaning the average taxpayer labored 125 
days to finance his indigent uncle a gentleman attuned more to 
spending than restraint 
that might be irritating you might say but at least you have 
some of the years paycheck left for yourself yes but the trend 
is ominous and budget summitry isnt likely to change that trend 
for the sixth time in nine years the white house and congress 
used summitry in an attempt to reduce the federal deficit to date 
says the foundation a summitarranged budget has never even 
reduced the deficit below the level of the summit year 
in short dont expect freedom day to occur much earlier next 
year the 1990 cost of running congress itself rose 106 percent 
over 1989 bringing the price tax to 23 billion thats the 
trend 
you might need no reminder of it than the hole in your pocket 
and the extra days you spend working for uncle sam

corn futures prices rose slightly monday on the 
chicago board of trade amid rumors of soviet buying interest but 
other grain and soybean futures finished modestly lower 
the weak corn rally marked a renewal of speculation that the 
soviet union is in the market for us corn to complete its 
commitment to buy 1 million metric tons by the end of the year 
the soviets bought 350000 metric tons of us corn earlier this 
fall they are required to buy another 650000 metric tons this 
year to honor their longterm grain agreement 
the market talk on monday was that the soviets might have bought 
500000 metric tons said victor lespinasse an assistant vice 
president in the grain trading division of dean witter reynolds 
inc 
the other markets were pressured by perceptions that dry mild 
weather would allow soybean harvesting to advance in the midwest 
and benefit newly planted winter wheat in the great plains 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 261 a 
bushel corn was unchanged to 1 cent higher with december at 228 
a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with december at 
118 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 4 cents lower with 
november at 590 a bushel

oil prices moved above 34 per barrel in light 
trading on the futures market monday amid concerns that a soviet 
peace effort in the persian gulf had failed 
it was perhaps one of the lastditch efforts to get a peaceful 
resolution said christian gohler a vice president with merrill 
lynch energy futures as a result the market moved higher 
light sweet crude oil rose 167 to 3468 per barrel for 
december delivery on the new york mercantile exchange contracts 
for later months also settled higher 
traders said mondays session was one of the quietest they could 
remember in the volatile weeks that followed iraqs invasion and 
occupation of kuwait in august 
although there was no strong news to move the market prices 
opened higher and held their ground on reports of the unsuccessful 
soviet efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis 
there was a lot of speculation over the weekend that there 
could be some progress made said peter beutel an oil analyst 
with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj whether its 
true or not people are saying this may be the last chance before 
some military action is necessary the thinking is if the soviets 
cant get iraq to change who can 
the soviet union and iraq once had close ties but the soviets 
nonetheless lined up with the rest of the global community in 
condemning iraq for its attack on kuwait 
soviet middle east envoy yevgeny primakov met with iraqi 
president saddam hussein in baghdad on sunday following those 
talks soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said he saw no 
reason for optimism in the gulf 
some traders stayed on the sidelines monday as they waited to 
see an interview with saddam that cable news network was to air 
monday evening oil prices hit their lows for the day on the merc 
when players learned from an excerpt of the interview that saddam 
was apparently refusing to rule out the idea of a diplomatic 
resolution to the crisis 
he was saying peace was still possible said ed kevelson a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
crudes increase early in the day was mirrored in the futures 
prices for refined petroleum products home heating oil settled

at midday the federal reserve bought 1 billion in treasury 
bills while the federal funds rate the interest rate charged on 
overnight loans was at 7 percent the move signaled to the 
financial markets that the fed had eased by point 
though lower interest rates usually are bearish for the dollar 
because they diminish the value of dollardenominated securities 
traders discounted the feds action 
the market had been anticipating an easing and the dollar had 
been falling on that said earl johnson a vice president at 
harris trust and savings bank in chicago noting that any easing 
already had been discounted in the currency markets

merrill lynch amp co announced a sweeping 
management overhaul monday that could lead to several hundred job 
cuts at the nations biggest securities firm 
the reorganization replaces merrills separate consumer and 
capital markets groups with six business divisions eliminating a 
structure in place since 1984 
it also creates a mechanism for merrill to replace company 
chairman and chief executive william a schreyer who is to retire 
in 1993 at age 65 schreyer took over merrill in 1985 
analysts said the move reflects a renewed emphasis on individual 
investors and other clients over the creation of new products 
investment banking fields such as junk bonds and merchant banking 
created large profits in the mid1980s but have slumped in the 
last three years 
everybody has next to nothing or negative profits on the 
institutional side said perrin long an industry analyst with 
lipper analytical securities corp 
schreyer and merrill president daniel tully said in a statement 
that the new structure will focus management as closely as 
possible on meeting the needs and exceeding the expectations of the 
key client groups we serve 
merrills stock fell 87 cents monday to close at 1675 on the 
new york stock exchange after dropping 175 on friday the stock 
closed on oct 16 at 1612 its lowest level since the first 
quarter of 1980 
the six new business divisions each run by an executive vice 
president are private client asset management insurance 
investment banking debt markets and equity markets each will 
operate under the full merrill name 
merrill spokesman fred yager said the reorganization was not 
designed to reduce staff but that several hundred jobs may be 
reduced in the next several months as support staff operations are 
consolidated merrill has 39000 employees down from a peak of 
50000 in 1987 
a top merrill executive told analysts earlier this year that if 
business conditions continued to deteriorate the firm would 
consider furloughing 10 percent of its staff 
the restructuring was the second at merrill this year the firm 
in january took a 470 million charge against earnings to pay for 
an overhaul that included about 3000 layoffs and the shutdown of 
several business lines 
merrill earlier this month reported thirdquarter earnings of 
461 million or 38 cents a share that was down 38 percent from 
the second quarter but 6 percent higher than an especially weak 
1989 third quarter 
yager said the latest restructuring is expected to save merrill 
tens of millions of dollars over an unspecified period of time 
the firm will continue to evaluate its businesses under the january 
restructuring he said 
the six new divisions will operate within the overall management 
of the firm under the twosector structure merrills 
individualinvestor operations and capital markets group operated 
autonomously 
john steffens 49 an executive vice president in charge of 
merrills consumer markets operation will run the privateclient 
division which deals with individual investors and small and 
mediumsized business 
one other executive vice president thomas patrick 47 
currently chief financial officer will head the insurance 
division 
the newly elected executive vice presidents are barry friedberg 
49 who will head investment banking david komansky 51 equity 
markets roger vasey 54 debt markets and arthur zeikel 58 
asset management 
the apparent loser in the shuffle is jerome kenney 49 who 
headed the capital markets division since 1984 and will run a new 
support division in corporate strategy and research another 
executive vice president herbert allison jr 47 will head a 
support division on finance and administration 
all will serve on the firms executive management committee 
which will assist in the search for a successor to schreyer

chrysler corp reported a 214 
million thirdquarter loss monday a performance that would have 
been worse without record earnings at the companys financial 
subsidiary 
the earnings report which showed chrysler did better by loaning 
money than by building and selling cars underscored its 
difficulties as the no 3 detroit automaker negotiates with the 
united auto workers to reach a new contract 
chrysler is the last and weakest of the big three to negotiate 
with the uaw and has said it cant be as generous as rivals general 
motors corp and ford motor co 
chrysler reported a thirdquarter loss of 95 cents a share 
compared to 331 million or 142 a share in the 1989 quarter 
that period included a onetime 309 million credit from the sale 
of some stock in mitsubishi motors corp chrysler now holds an 11 
percent share of the japanese automaker 
the company said the loss stemmed partly from the cost of cash 
rebates and other incentivies aimed at selling cars as well as the 
costs of a onemonth shutdown for retooling of chryslers two 
minivan plants which make some of the companys bestselling 
vehicles 
by contrast chrysler financial corp which handles consumer 
car loans earned 83 million in the quarter ended sept 30 its 
best performance ever 
the thirdquarter loss came on revenues of 65 billion down 
145 percent from 76 billion recorded in july through september 
last year 
for the first nine months of 1990 chrysler earned 37 million 
or 17 cents a share compared with 983 million or 421 a share 
last year revenue fell 154 percent to 23 billion from 272 
billion 
chrysler lost a little less in the third quarter than i 
expected said auto analyst david healy of the investment bank 
barclays de zoete wedd noting that chrysler financial did a good 
deal better than i expected 
healy also noted that chrysler does not plan to close its st 
louis i assembly plant as soon as expected last year chrysler 
targeted a september 1990 shutdown but since pushed the closing 
back to may 1991 the end of production for the chrysler lebaron 
coupe and convertible and the dodge daytona 
healy said chrysler treasurer jerry york told wall street 
analysts monday that the companys costcutting pace has 
accelerated now that 1991 models are in production much of the 
saving is tied to more efficient manufacturing operations for the 
1991 models which officially debuted oct 1 
york also said incentive costs for the automaker should begin to 
ease 
it was about 1200 per vehicle for the second quarter and 
1250 for the third quarter healy said it will be maybe a 
little less than that in the fourth quarter 
chairman lee iacocca blamed a variety of events for the 
thirdquarter loss 
we anticipated 1990 would be a tough year for chrysler and for 
the industry so we launched a major costcutting program over a 
year ago he said in a statement we didnt anticipate the gulf 
crisis the federal budget fiasco or the continued escalation in 
the incentive wars so weve increased our costreduction goals to 
25 billion over two years 
iacocca has set the costcutting target for june 1991 
chrysler stock rose on the earnings report but fell back to 
close at 11 down 12 cents on the new york stock exchange 
ford was expected to announce thirdquarter earnings tuesday 
they were projected to be slightly more than half of the 4771 
million the company earned during the period last year 
general motors corp reports major subsidiaries earnings 
tuesday and corporate earnings wednesday the no 1 automaker is 
expected to show a 50 percent drop in thirdquarter earnings from 
the 1989 level of 5169 million

manville corp said monday its thirdquarter 
profits tumbled 39 percent in part because of a decline in the 
domestic construction market 
manville a building products and natural resources company 
reported net income of 245 million or 17 cents per share 
compared with 404 million or 30 cents per share in the same 
1989 period 
for the three months ended sept 30 manville said net sales 
rose 47 percent to 576 million from 550 million a year ago 
manville chairman and chief executive tom stephens said the 
companys domestic paper business remained steady but were 
feeling the effects of softening in the domestic construction 
markets 
manville said the startup of new operations hurt earnings 
manville in the third quarter acquired visypack pty ltd an 
australian folding cartons maker earlier this year manville 
acquired drg cartons ltd a british cartons maker and fiskeby 
board ab of sweden a supplier of boxboard products 
the company charged 48 million in legal and other professional 
fees for restructuring a trust fund formed as part of manvilles 
1988 bankruptcy court reorganization to compensate asbestos disease 
victims 
under the resturcturing announced in september manville agreed 
to inject up to 520 million over seven years to help the 
autonomous manville personal injury settlement trust meet more 
claims the trust has run out of cash and all payments to victims 
have been frozen 
manville once the nations largest asbestos maker filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 because of mounting 
lawsuits by victims of lung cancer and other respiratory disease 
manville no longer makes asbestos 
in the first nine months of 1990 manville reported earnings of 
102 million or 75 cents per share down 15 percent from 120 
million or 91 cents per share in the same 1989 period 
net sales in the ninemonth period were 166 billion up from 
162 billion in the yearago period 
manville manufactures building products fiberglass and 
industrial insulation products paper and wood products packaging

murdoch magazines has blamed a weak economy for 
its decision to suspend publication of mens life magazine after 
one issue 
some magazine industry analysts suspect the heavy debt load 
carried by the magazine companys parent news corp ltd also 
played a big role in the decision to halt publication of the 
magazine 
executives at several magazines aimed at segments of the mens 
market meanwhile said monday they are staying the course despite 
what they concede is a tough advertising climate 
mens life was launched in september targeted at men aged 
between 40 and 50 years old with moderate incomes the first issue 
carried a cover photo of a woman in a baseball catchers gear to 
illustrate a story safe at home that said most men would 
remarry their wives if given a second chance 
other stories asked do we all become our fathers and what 
is it about blondes 
murdoch magazines president leslie hinton said in annoucing the 
suspension last friday that reader response to the first issue was 
encouraging but added it was too costly to go ahead in the 
present economic environment 
he said the magazine would be back when the economy 
improves 
mens life was one of several general interest mens magazines 
that were either started or repositioned in recent months 
the magazines manhattan inc and m were merged into m inc and 
the nightlife magazine details was overhauled to appeal to young 
men 
a proposed magazine called men was sold to the company that 
publishes the 2yearold title smart which becomes smart 
for men in january 
mitchell fox publisher of details said the conde nast 
publications inc magazine has sold 250 pages of ads for the first 
five issues since its september relaunch as a mens magazine and 
that circulation has exceeded its 100000 guarantee 
we are certainly not going to pull the plug he said 
susan lodge publisher of m inc aimed at affluent middleaged 
men said she sympathized with the backers of mens life its a 
terrible time to be starting a magazine she said 
she said her capital citiesabc inc publication benefited from 
having two subscriber lists and advertiser lists to use for the 
repositioned magazine 
we have every positive sign going for us in a very difficult 
business climate she said 
john reidy media analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co 
said the tough advertising environment was mainly responsible for 
the suspension of mens life 
publishers information bureau recently reported that advertising 
volume was down 33 percent for the first nine months of the year 
at the 172 magazines it tracks ad pages were down 45 percent in 
september alone 
reidy doubted the decision had much to do with the 8 billion 
debt at news corp the australianbased parent of murdoch 
magazines 
he said the 10 million or so that it would cost to make a 
success of mens life would not mean much in the context of that 
debt burden 
but martin s walker an analyst for periodical studies service 
inc said the suspension does reflect the corporate financial 
position of news corp sure its a drop in the bucket but it is 
one more drop they just dont want to start investing in new 
things right now walker said 
murdochs hinton was unavailable monday for elaboration on 
fridays suspension of mens life but he denied through a 
spokesman published reports that the magazines seventeen or 
premiere were up for sale 
none of the murdoch magazines are for sale he said

the food and drug administration wants to ban 
the use of 111 ingredients in nonprescription diet drug products 
including one it says presents a safety hazard 
that ingredient is guar gum which is extracted from plant 
matter three months ago fda told the distributor of one brand of 
diet table cal ban 3000 that contains guar gum to stop 
distributing the tablets because it had received 17 reports of 
users suffering from obstruction of the esophagus 
aside from those tablets the agency did not give brand names of 
products affected 
the action does affect guar gum use in small amounts in foods 
where it poses no health hazard foods such as cheese salad 
dressings and ice cream the agency said 
the agency said the 111 ingredients had not been proven 
effective in diet products the ban includes alcohol corn syrup 
dextrose kelp pineapple enzymes rice polishings saccharin 
salt sodium bicarbonate vitamin c and wheat germ 
fda said it had given manufacturers opportunities to prove the 
ingredients were effective but that it had received no significant 
information 
the proposed ban will be published in tuesdays federal register 
along with another proposed ruling that calls for a warning on 
general overthecounter drugs containing water soluble gums like 
guar gum 
that said fda is also a result of reports of esophageal 
obstruction following ingestion of diet and laxative products 
containing these ingredients 
products containing such substances including guar gum 
psyllium and the like would have to carry labels warning users to 
take them with adequate fluid and to avoid them totally if the user 
had ever had difficulty swallowing 
the agency said it would receive comment on its proposals for 60 
days and any action would not be effective until six months after 
its eventual decision

hog and pork belly futures prices plunged their daily limits 
monday on the chicago mercantile exchange reflecting a sharp 
downturn in pork demand and expectations for higher hog production 
in the fourth quarter 
on other commodity markets cattle futures also fell oil 
futures rose precious metals rose copper retreated and grains 
and soybeans were mixed 
hog futures settled 18 cent to the limit 15 cents lower in 
chicago with the contract for delivery in december at 5145 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 195 cents to the limit 2 cents 
lower with february at 6095 cents a pound 
cash hog prices dropped about 15 cents a pound as packer buying 
interest slackened amid perceptions that retailers plan fewer pork 
specials in the coming month analysts said 
the selloff also corresponded to a seasonal decline in consumer 
demand for bacon bacon demand typically peaks in the warmweather 
months a phenomenon that some analysts link to increased 
consumption of baconlettuceandtomato sandwiches 
phil stanley an independent trader and market consultant for 
dec futures inc of lincoln neb said expectations for larger hog 
production in the fourth quarter also weighed on the market 
he said the selloff was exaggerated by speculators 
further profittaking may have reflected endofthemonth 
selling by players who needed cash to pay commission fees said 
dale durchholz livestock analyst with agrivisor services inc of 
bloomington ill 
cattle futures also retreated on the chicago merc in line with 
lower cash cattle prices

minnesota insurance companies would face 
some of the strictest financial requirements in the country under 
industrysupported recommendations announced monday by the state 
commerce commissioner 
there isnt a crisis out there now but there are troubled 
companies commissioner thomas borman said in releasing a report 
from the minnesota insurance solvency task force 
the regulations are intended to boost consumer confidence in 
minnesota insurance companies and prevent insolvencies which cost 
the industry millions of dollars in payments to state guaranty 
funds 
the chief change would limit junk bond holdings to 15 percent of 
a companys assets the countrys most stringent restriction on 
low or unrated debt securities borman said new yorks 20 percent 
limit is currently the most restrictive he said 
another proposal would require insurers to mark down the value 
of distressed real estate and real estate loans to market 
values those reports would be filed with the commissioners 
office forming the basis for possible targeted examinations 
borman said he knows of no other state requiring such reports 
a third recommendation is for companies to follow a new formula 
in reporting their capital structures requiring them to account 
for risks related to underwritings and investments generally the 
formula would require additions to capital as a company invests 
in riskier assets borman said utah has a riskbased capital 
formula and new york is studying one 
to enforce the proposed changes borman said he would like at 
least 30 more insurance regulators on his staff more than tripling 
its size at an annual cost of roughly 15 million minnesota 
insurance executives on the task force said the industry would be 
willing to pay for the added expense in the form of increased fees 
but borman will first seek an appropriation from the legislature 
he said 
the changes could be enforced against the 104 insurance 
companies based in minnesota and outofstate companies applying to 
do business here borman said outofstate companies already doing 
business in the state wouldnt be held to the new regulations but 
they may be targeted for review if they are not meeting revised 
standards borman said 
i am certain that poorly managed companies will feel pain 
based on the recommendations of the task force borman said 
he said the changes are proposed as a way to target 
highflying insurance companies who invested heavily in the 
1980s in junk bonds and commercial real estate such early 
government intervention could avert the kind of trouble suffered in 
the savings and loan industry borman said 
were dealing with this in a forwardlooking way borman 
said what you had in the savings and loan industry was after the 
fact they really reacted under a crisis mentality 
more than 30 percent of junk bonds issued in the 1980s were 
purchased by us life insurance companies many of whom also are 
longterm lenders in commercial real estate borman said 
the proposed changes should not lead to higher premiums said 
task force member robert p gandrud president and chief executive 
officer of lutheran brotherhood a minneapolisbased life and 
health insurance company 
we either pay now in improved regulation or we can pay later 
we see it as an investment in insolvency prevention gandrud 
said 
borman said the state has the authority to suspend insurance 
licenses and halt sales of a company until problems are cleared up 
he said he did not know how many companies in the state would 
have to sell junk bonds or make other changes in capital structure 
to conform with proposed changes 
susan mead a spokeswoman for minneapolisbased northwestern 
national life said the law should put minnesotabased insurers at 
a competitive advantage 
the consumers can feel that if they have policies from a 
minnesota company they are pretty safe she said 
borman said he may immediately adopt some of the regulatory 
guidelines proposed by the task force but he said there would be a 
public hearing on the limits regarding junk bonds because it would 
require legislative action 
the task force was made up of four commerce department officials 
and top executives from 10 minnesotabased insurance companies

a widely followed index of construction activity 
remained stagnant in september another piece of evidence that the 
broader economy is heading into a recession the company that 
compiles the index said monday 
the dodge index of construction contracting stood at 147 in 
september basically unchanged from the 1990 low of 146 reached in 
august by contrast at this time last year contracting for new 
construction was at an alltime peak 25 percent stronger than the 
latest rate 
the dodge index is a seasonally adjusted indicator of future 
construction activity published by the fw dodge division of 
mcgrawhill the nations leading source of construction 
information the index uses 1982 as its 100 base and represents the 
value of all newly started construction 
george a christie vice president and chief economist for fw 
dodge said the index shows the construction sector which has 
often served as a leading indicator of general business activity 
seems to be supporting the growing belief that the economy is 
heading into recession or may already be there 
the trend shows starts of new construction projects have fallen 
for four consecutive quarters leaving most parts of the country 
far behind last years pace he said 
as work in progress is brought to completion spending and 
employment in this key industry is drying up christie said 
the value of new nonresidential building contracts totaled 836 
billion in september up 8 percent from 775 billion in august 
residential building contracts totaled 1047 billion up 1 percent 
from a month earlier and the value of nonbuilding construction 
such as public works projects fell 10 percent from a month earlier 
to 432 billion fw dodge said

the boeing cos thirdquarter profits rose 562 
percent on strong sales and high margins for commercial aircraft 
the aerospace company said monday 
boeing posted profits of 378 million or 110 a share on 
record sales of 7176 billion in the same period last year the 
company had profits of 242 million or 70 cents a share on sales 
of 6356 
boeing said it was still losing a substantial amount of money on 
its defense and space work but the losses are projected to be less 
than 1989s loss of 474 million 
two weeks agounited airlines placed the first 34 firm orders 
for the allnew widebody 777 jetliner it took options for another 
34 it also ordered 30 747400 jumbo jets and took options for a 
like number if all 128 planes are delivered the deal would be 
worth more than 22 billion the largest commercial jet buy in 
history 
despite the nod from one of its longest and best customers 
boeings board of directors had to give its formal approval to 
build the new twinjet it did so monday even as busloads of 
employees were being brought to an enormous hanger at boeings 
flight center for the allteam meeting of boeing commercial 
airplane groups new airplane division 
the meeting was more of a pep rally with marching bands 
cheerleaders and cowbells 
frank shrontz boeing chairman and chief executive officer was 
greeted with a standing ovation when he announced the boards 
decision 
we clearly have the right product at the right time whats 
important is to develop it in the right way shrontz said 
boeing officials refuse to say how much they are spending on the 
777 but industry analysts have estimated anywhere from 2 billion 
to 5 billion 
shrontz said boeing eventually plans to have 8000 to 10000 
people working on the jet but he said overall company employment 
of about 102000 in the seattle area may not increase because of 
cutbacks on defense programs this year alone shrontz said boeing 
has transferred about 2200 workers from its defense segments to 
commercial aircraft 
shrontz said 1990 sales are projected to be about 275 billion 
compared with 206 billion in 1989 
boeing has had problems on several defense programs including 
the secondgeneration short range attack missile the avionics for 
the navys new p3 patrol plane and saudi arabias peace shield 
air defense program shrontz said progress has been made in 
resolving cost and schedule problems on government programs and the 
recent reorganization of boeings defense and space segments should 
improve results in the future 
boeing had a total firm order backlog of 863 billion on sept 
30 compared with 806 billion a year before 
for the first nine months of 1990 boeing had net earnings of 
107 billion or 309 a share on sales of 2058 billion up from 
earnings of 598 million or 173 a share on sales of 15429 
billion including a onetime restatement for income tax purposes 
the 1989 net earnings would be 896 million or 259 a share

monday the nations economy has expanded at a 15 percent annual 
rate during the first nine months of the year

economy was still expanding 
brady said some parts of the economy are in bad shape 
were in a period of slower growth but not a recession he 
said in an appearance in easton md to friends of washington 
college in nearby chestertown 
but fundamentally our economy is strong he said and in 
the first nine months of this year it grew 15 percent that 
means very simply that the gross national product of the united 
states was 15 percent greater in 1990 than it was in 1989 
a tape recording of his remarks was made available here 
the gnp expanded at a 17 percent annual rate in the first 
quarter and initial estimates of second quarter growth were 12 
percent which amounted to a 15 percent rate for the first six 
months the commerce department later revised secondquarter growth 
to just a 04 percent rate for a sixmonth annual rate of 10 
percent 
assistant secretary roger bolton asked about bradys remarks 
said the secretary meant that the economy had been growing at a 15 
percent rate and was not in a recession

pennzoil cos 1990 third quarter earnings 
dropped 25 percent partly because higher crude oil prices cut into 
refining revenue the oil company said monday 
third quarter net income this year totaled 264 million or 66 
cents per share compared to 354 million or 87 cents per share 
posted a year ago pennzoil said 
the earnings decline came despite a 135 percent increase in 
third quarter revenues which were 6154 million compared to 
5423 million for the same period last year 
james l pate pennzoil president and chief executive said 
higher crude oil costs caused by the persian gulf crisis reduced 
operating income for the companys refinery division 
pennzoils motor oil sales in the third quarter were at an 
alltime high but we were unable to adjust product prices to fully 
recover the surge in crude costs he said 
in the oil and gas segment improved oil revenues were offset by 
reduced gas revenues reflecting lower prices and sales volumes 
pennzoil said 
in contrast to higher crude prices natural gas prices and 
demand were down in the third quarter since pennzoil is a major 
producer of natural gas our earnings were negatively impacted by 
this situation pate said 
he said colder weather should improve gas prices and demand 
for the ninemonth period ending sept 30 pennzoils net income 
was 638 million or 162 per share 
net income for the same period in 1989 was 206 million or 
536 per share the yeartodate earnings include an aftertax 
gain of 868 million on the sale of burlington resources inc 
common stock 
revenues for the ninemonth period were 17 billion this year 
and 18 billion in 1989
