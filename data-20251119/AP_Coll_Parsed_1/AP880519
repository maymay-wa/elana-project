the owners of a car dealership that 
sells expensive sports cars are teed off about their neighbors a 
miniature golf course where they say some players take toohefty 
swings 
golf balls have been clearing a 30foothigh net between 
golfland usa and porsche motorsport for years said ken boswell 
the car dealerships general manager 
but the last straw he said was when a brass putter also flew 
over the fence and smashed the windshield of a porsche 911 
convertible the putter which also scratched a porsche 928 on the 
rebound caused 3000 in damage boswell said 
as a result the dealership filed a lawsuit tuesday against 
golfland in santa clara county superior court it asks for 
unspecified damages contending porsche motorsport has suffered 
thousands of dollars in losses because of the errant golfers 
the manager on duty at golfland on wednesday referred phone 
calls to owner robert kenney who could not be reached for comment 
kenneys wife geri said wednesday the couple had not seen the 
lawsuit but added that they had done everything possible to 
prevent balls from going onto adjacent property 
boswell believes most of the wayward balls come from a hole 
where golfers must hit up a ramp to reach the cup 
they must treat the hole like theyre on a driving range he 
said

strong gains by radicals in irans 
parliamentary elections signal even greater militancy against the 
west and more state control of the economy 
results from the second round of voting friday confirmed the 
advantage radicals gained in the first round five weeks earlier 
there were reports of violence in some cities during the 
bitterly contested election the breakdown of the new 270seat 
parliament between the power blocs is not yet known but announced 
results show radicals clearly in the ascendancy after a prolonged 
struggle with conservatives in the leadership 
parliament has had little say in foreign policy but western 
analysts believe the new radical strength will affect foreign 
relations conduct of the war with iraq and the course of irans 
fundamentalist shiite moslem revolution 
they feel the radical gains at a time of increasing political 
uncertainty and military setbacks herald a tougher stand against 
the united states iran accuse washington of aiding iraq in the 
war which began in september 1980 
the iranians will likely prosecute the war more vigorously 
theyre already rethinking their strategy which was based on 
attrition hansheino kopietz said in an interview from the 
international institute for strategic studies in london 
but much will depend on how quickly they can improve the 
economy kopietz said this is their first priority if they 
can get credit abroad to get more military hardware as well as 
alleviate domestic hardship they will be more aggressive 
new alliances that have emerged in the tehran hierarchy are sure 
to affect the struggle over who will run the country after the 
death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 87yearold revolutionary 
patriarch 
he has named ayatollah husseinali montazeri 66 as his 
successor montazeri has no significant power base however and is 
opposed by such key figures as hashemi rafsanjani the parliament 
speaker who regularly leads friday prayers at tehran university 
montazeri is expected to become a figurehead with real power 
held by rafsanjani and two or three others 
rafsanjani who is allied with the radicals on several issues 
scored a personal triumph in the election by winning 13 million 
votes 
other radical winners include mohammad salamati former 
agriculture minister hojatoleslam mehdi kharroubi who heads the 
pilgrimage bureau and is believed to have directed riots last year 
in the holy city of mecca saudi arabia and ateqe sediqi rajai 
widow of president mohammad ali rajai leftist opponents of the 
khomeini regime assassinated rajai in 1981 
of 208 incumbents who ran only about 100 were reelected to the 
new majlis as irans parliament is known its term is four years 
the main group of conservative clerics the militant clergy 
society was weakened just before the elections when a radical 
faction led by kharroubi of the pilgrimage bureau broke away over 
political and economic issues 
diplomatic sources with contacts in tehran said the split was 
encouraged by khomeini and the prosecutorgeneral mohammed 
khoeiniha a leader of the followers of the imams line who 
stormed the us embassy in november 1979 and held 52 americans 
hostage for 444 days 
serajeddin mousavi a cleric who heads the security apparatus 
said in the tehran daily kayhan being in a state of war and at 
this sensitive juncture we must not allow a bunch of 
obstructionists to waste parliaments time 
khomeini spent years playing referee between the rival factions 
but moved clearly to the radical side before the elections 
he decreed wider state powers opening the way for economic 
reforms that were blocked by the conservativedominated council of 
guardians the council can veto legislation it decides is a 
violation of islamic tenets 
since the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi was overthrown in 
february 1979 the radicals have sought to nationalize industry and 
trade distribute land held by wealthy families and liberalize 
social laws conservatives supported by the merchant class 
advocate a more capitalist economy 
the radicals success is significant because it gives impetus 
to their efforts to achieve state control not just of the economy 
but the whole revolutionary apparatus kopietz said 
a major radical figure to emerge recently is interior minister 
aliakbar mohtashemi former ambassador to syria western 
intelligence agencies have linked him closely to shiite extremists 
in lebanon who kidnapped westerners and carried out suicide bomb 
attacks 
syria told mohtashemi from damascus in june 1985 after two 
americans were kidnapped in beirut 
shortly before that mohtashemi lost his right eye and two 
fingers of his right hand when he opened a boobytrapped parcel in 
damascus syria claimed the cia sent it 
as interior minister mohtashemi was in charge of the elections 
several months ago he replaced 20 provincial governors who are 
responsible for screening candidates 
he became interior minister in august replacing aliakbar 
nateghnouri conservative head of the hojati islamic faction 
nateghnouri did not win a majority in his tehran district in the 
first election round april 8 but made it may 13

pines dot snowy peaks outside as tom 
pinard sits in his rustic office in a peach cowboy shirt crusading 
to carve away 90 percent of the nations largest county to create 
mojave county 
at 18160 square miles of mostly desert north of the san gabriel 
and san bernardino mountains the new county would still be the 
nations largest bigger than massachusetts connecticut rhode 
island and delaware combined 
both it and what remained of san bernardino county would have 
betterfocused government if voters agree to a divorce by 
passing measure a said pinard who publishes a local newspaper 
from this 6000foothigh ski resort town 
his allies gathered 15000 signatures to get the issue on the 
june 7 ballot if approved by a majority vote mojave county would 
begin operating after a board of supervisors is elected in november 
fourfifths of san bernardino countys 11 million residents are 
jammed into the far eastern edge of the los angeles megalopolis 
and pinard says they deserve a county government that concentrates 
on urban woes air and water pollution gangs gridlock 
but the 205000 people in the proposed new county confront other 
problems the area encompasses military and indian preserves 
mining regions wilderness a slice of death valley colorado river 
resorts and the mountains near wrightwood 
you come up over the mountains and you have people with an 
entirely different set of problems said pinard who would like 
to be elected a mojave county supervisor weve got snow theyve 
got gutters and curbs 
residents of such los angeles basin cities as ontario fontana 
and san bernardino are just not conscious of our concerns he 
said 
but opponents of the divorce contend a new 
2000squaremile san bernardino county would really be podunk 
county the secondsmallest in southern california stripped of 
money and influence 
they belittle promises by pinards new county steering committee 
of more efficient and responsive government better roads and law 
enforcement 
opponents say it instead would skirt bankruptcy from the outset 
with too little industry for its size its farflung voters would 
be unlikely to approve bonds to fund a jail hospitals or other 
public works and services would suffer they contend 
they say san bernardino county government is too fat and 
unresponsive and maybe thats true said nelda smith of 
wrightwood coordinator of the no on mojave committee but i 
think we should work at changing it before jumping off a cliff 
a key point of contention is a report by a special governors 
commission that found mojave county to be economically feasible 
with an 88000 surplus on a yearly budget of more than 137 
million assuming current service levels the commission mandated 
by law after measure a qualified sketched a division of assets and 
liabilities and organization of the new county 
it said current san bernardino county employees would be able to 
work for mojave with no cuts in pay or benefits as part of the 
settlement it said the old county would owe the new 118 
million to be paid in three yearly payments 
but late last month the san bernardino county supervisors sued 
contending the study failed to account for unfunded pension 
liabilities that would mean the new smaller san bernardino county 
would be owed as much as 336 million by mojave county 
san diego superior court judge james r milliken ruled may 11 
that he had no authority to invalidate the proposal the 
supervisors appeal will not be heard until after the election 
most of the proposed county now is represented by supervisor 
john joyner who cast the sole vote against filing the suit 
joyner who is running for reelection against a former aide has 
not said how he will vote on the measure 
if mojave county is created joyners district would be reduced 
to most of the san bernardino mountains including the big bear and 
lake arrowhead resorts and the morongo basin desert area 
pinard said he had believed odds for passage of measure a were 
slightly better than 5050 but with the supervisors suit he 
said i just dont know the chances have to be revised 
downward

in his lifetime john cameron young 
had a secret wish an unusual fantasy he wondered what an airborne 
piano would sound like crashing to earth now a bit late his 
friends will find out 
the marin county man was 44 when he died three years ago 
leaving an 800000 estate in his will young whose life was full 
of adventure and funloving behavior left 15000 to three buddies 
who were instructed to toss one last party for their departed 
friend 
the professional guitar player told his friends to give a 
party for themselves and as many of my friends as they can find 
that desire to attend 
as told by youngs friends the mississippi native moved to the 
san francisco bay area in 1972 he sang delta blues and found time 
to be a parachutist pilot storyteller and business success with 
six furniture stores 
it took three years to straighten out youngs will and on may 
28 hundreds of folks are expected to gather for the memorial 
celebration 
they will indulge youngs strange fantasy listening to a 
300pound piano crash to the ground from a hovering helicopter 
he talked about that all the time said harry murphy 53 a 
fairfax graphic designer who met young in a san anselmo saloon 10 
years ago hed sit here and say harry weve got to have a 
piano drop can you hear it you take an old upright piano 
about 1000 feet in the sky 
murphy mused over that and added fondly i think hell be 
able to hear it 
murphy said a helicopter will drop an inlaid walnut upright from 
50 to 100 feet near sonoma county airport 
its an arrogant outrageous playful childish thing to do 
said murphy that embodies jc 
about four hours after the smash the celebration will turn to a 
more sedate mood with food drink and music in marin 
friends said the sendoff fits in with youngs life he once 
drove a motorcycle into a bar and ordered a beer with an olive 
however young was far from a clown he had a masters degree in 
mathematics and often dragged bar patrons into conversations about 
negative numbers and mindtwisting theorems 
his death was as unusual as his life his body was discovered in 
his black cadillac in a ravine below a steep highway near stinson 
beach authorities said he may have been beaten to death 
he was full of life and i miss him said real estate broker 
richard catlett who met young in a bar in spain in 1972

the big three automakers are replacing their 
crash diets of the early 80s with more lasting changes to prepare 
for challenge of the next decade overproduction 
by 1990 there could be 56 million more new cars and trucks than 
buyers worldwide according to industry estimates 
first obviously costcutting was the major concern but 
in the long term its the products theyre coming out with that 
will determine who survives said kathleen heaney an analyst with 
nikko securities in new york 
having modernized their factories and corporate structures the 
big three are marshaling their resources with the aim of making 
american cars that are better engineered and sell like japanese 
cars 
the dollars slide against the japanese yen and european 
currencies two years ago has made some imports more expensive and 
temporarily helped level the playing field for general motors 
corp ford motor co and chrysler corp 
so has a new united auto workers pattern contract that stresses 
job security over wage increases and gives the companies needed 
flexibility 
the auto industry tumult of the past 15 years fuel crises a 
recession and the shock of japanese entry has given way to a more 
stable market where winners and losers no longer are determined by 
national origin 
ford losing 1 million a day at the beginning of the decade 
has made big adjustments already closing excess plants and running 
the rest on overtime while grabbing styling leadership from gm with 
a sleek aerodynamic new lineup 
people who go into a ford dealership have a car in mind they 
say i want that thunderbird taurus continental heaney said 
people are not doing that for gm theyre going to a gm 
dealer and saying ive got 13000 what can i get 
ford led us automakers in earnings in 1986 and went on to set 
the world auto industry record with 46 billion in 1987 profits 
and again with 16 billion in earnings in the first quarter of 
1988 it also has a comfortable 10 billion cash cushion it is 
saving for a major electronics acquisition 
at its annual meeting last week ford chairman donald petersen 
said the second largest us automaker has no intention of giving 
up its edge and will substantially increase spending on new product 
development over the next few years 
chrysler under chairman lee iacocca also has switched its 
focus from trimming costs to investing in new products 
chrysler had been shedding weight gained in its august 
acquisition of ailing american motors corp after squeezing more 
jeeps out of a former amc assembly plant in toledo ohio chrysler 
decided to close amcs other us assembly plant in kenosha wis 
by years end 
it also settled its uaw contract five months early eliminating 
the chance of a costly strike in september when its factories will 
be pushing out 1989 models 
chryslers strategy of aggressive pricing to gain market share 
at the expense of immediate profits has boosted sales during 1988 
including a 72 percent jump for jeeps and a 55 percent increase for 
minivans 
iacocca who faces his shareholders thursday in new york 
already has injected extra money into research and development for 
new models and advanced engineering this year and plans more 
gm which spent 50 billion since the early 1980s to modernize 
or replace its factories is also channeling resources into new 
product development but analysts say it has more problems to solve 
the worlds largest automaker is barely breaking even on its 
us car and truck business despite costcutting which may make 
additional plant closings necessary 
analysts also question chairman roger smiths pledge to regain 
lost market share to move eight points to 45 percent of the 
market gm would have to increase sales by at least 12 million 
cars and trucks a year gm lost market share in 1986 to ford and 
chrysler as well as to foreign makers 
and the field of competitors only grows thicker 
mazda which joined the ranks of japanese makers with us 
plants has sold out its michigan plants production through 
october toyotas huge kentucky plant will begin making camry 
sedans this summer and a chryslermitsubishi plant in illinois soon 
will be churning out sporty 1989 models

when the us trade deficit for march improved 
beyond all expectations many economists and big investors 
responded with a chorus of bah humbug 
funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news but 
theyve done it before and most likely theyll do it again 
they responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate to 
increases in factory use even to the dollars new stability 
it is a strange discomfiting world in which good is bad happy 
is sad up is down square is round best is worst last is first 
strong is weak bottom is peak rich is poor and less is more 
and if the sages are being spooked by the good news news 
for which theyve waited months and which they deemed necessary for 
economic survival its no wonder theyre exaggerating bad 
news of which theyve found plenty 
late last year for instance the pessimists said consumers 
would reduce spending forcing the economy into recession it 
didnt happen then they said an inventory glut might produce 
recession in 1988 but the glut disappeared 
it is ironic that the pessimistic crowd see a boom just as 
bloated inventories are starting to cool things off said 
economist edward yardeni of the prudentialbache investment firm 
who fears neither a boom nor a bust 
throughout there has been wide disagreements among economists 
some of whom believed the biggest threat was from recession others 
that inflation would turn out to be the big problem 
whatever the interpretation however the conclusion has been 
the same ie bad news if the economy expanded it would strain 
production facilities and produce inflation should expansion 
cease recession would follow 
the dramatic improvement in the nations trade deficit a 4 
billion reduction to 97 billion in march provides the most 
vivid example of the syndrome 
nothing economic has been more eagerly awaited in recent months 
since a shrinkage of the deficit means us goods especially 
manufactured items are becoming more competitive abroad 
in fact many economists and investors made the latest trade 
figures the fulcrum of their analyses when the deficit grew in 
february the stock market plunged would a gain in march make the 
market rise 
it didnt happen once again the news though opposite to that 
of february produced a negative reaction both the bond and stock 
markets interpreted the news as indicative of an economy about to 
overheat and produce inflation 
it seems the better things get the worse theyre going to 
be quipped malcolm forbes the publisher who was addressing a 
business luncheon group shortly after hearing the news 
why the mood 
economists themselves have been asking that question and most 
have defended their positions with data and theories that to the 
layman seem thorough reasonable and even sagacious 
while recognizing that pessimism may be justified and that 
inflation high interest rates and perhaps recession lie ahead 
some economists believe there is a large psychological element 
involved 
in fact with so many disproportions and dislocations in the 
economy big budget and trade deficits uncollectable third world 
loans and the crash of the securities markets in october no 
matter how poor or inaccurate an analysis might be a negative 
forecast stands a chance of being correct 
there are also the awful memories of the 1970s to contend with 
economists back then couldnt believe what was happening that 
inflation and interest rates were not just high but in the double 
digits they cannot forget 
and finally anxiety is produced by the very expansion itself 
now in its 66th month it has lived far beyond the usual lifespan 
of expansions and inevitably will turn down but when and will 
inflation or recession end it 
h erich heinemann chief economist for ladenburg thalmann amp 
co a securities brokerdealer remains optimistic at least about 
inflation he notes that major inflation indicators rose less in 
the first quarter of 1988 than in the final quarter of 1987 
his forecast contrasts with that of most economists 
were convinced that with just a little bit of luck the 
expansion could continue into 1991 or 1992 he says adding the 
caveat 
however this will be a respite not a reprieve if washington 
cannot deal with its problems mainly the budget deficit we will 
all have to live with the consequences

us district judge alcee hastings and his 
supporters see him as a courageous outspoken fighter now taking 
unfair shots from those who cannot accept him as the first black 
federal judge in florida 
hastings whose impeachment hearing began wednesday in congress 
has been battling bribery and conspiracy charges for the last seven 
years 
but he has remained a popular figure in south floridas black 
community which has held impassioned demonstrations in his support 
and contributed 65000 to his legal defense 
hes never been the kind to back down from a fight hes had 
to pull himself up from his bootstraps from day one said dr 
gordon merritt a fort lauderdale dentist and longtime friend who 
helped raise funds for hastings most federal judges are the 
placating type but alcee speaks out hes a maverick 
the flamboyant hastings has proclaimed his innocence ever since 
he was indicted on bribery charges in 1981 and then acquitted two 
years later 
the case didnt end there fellow judges accused hastings of 
obstructing justice and lying under oath and issued a report 
recommending his impeachment 
im not going to be impeached and im not going to be 
removed hastings said in a recent interview its pure 
unadulterated politics 
hastings in sermonlike speeches around the country has 
blasted the secret judicial investigation after his acquittal as a 
witchhunt and an unconstitutional throwback to star 
chamberism 
he has suggested his race has had something to do with the 
effort against him and said he really angered justice department 
officials with his 1981 rulings blocking deportation of haitian 
immigrants 
complaints were filed against him in 1984 for his alleged 
improper political statements including harsh criticism of the 
reagan administration hastings said his position on the federal 
bench does not mean he cant speak his mind 
i dont have any organized effort said hastings who added 
he has also spent much of his own money its draining me 
financially its impacting me from an emotional standpoint im 
tired from all this mess 
his 70yearold mother mildred with whom hastings 51 has 
shared a lauderhill apartment since his second divorce said her 
son would come out of the hearings fine and he doesnt need me to 
talk for him 
the only child of a maid and butler in altamonte springs a 
small town north of orlando hastngs earned his law degree at 
predominantly black florida aampm university became a civil rights 
leader and ran unsuccessfully for office several times 
in 1970 he was the first black man to run for the us senate 
from florida but failed to win nomination 
he returned to his private law practice where he did much free 
work in civil rights cases until 1979 when president jimmy carter 
appointed him to the federal bench

federal law officers searched wednesday for any 
shred of evidence that might link a missouri couple charged 
with plotting to kill presidential candidate jesse jackson to 
violent white supremacist groups 
londell williams 30 and his wife tammy williams 26 of 
washington mo were in custody on charges of conspiring to kill 
jackson threatening an informer and possessing an automatic rifle 
a secret service agent testified at a hearing tuesday that 
agents had taped a conversation in which williams said the 
covenant the sword and the arm of the lord was planning the 
assassination of jackson 
we are out seeking every shred of evidence and talking to 
every person we can who might know something rich adams a 
spokesman for the secret service in washington said wednesday the 
secret service is responsible for protecting jackson 
meanwhile the secret service on wednesday found a bullet under 
a seat in the jackson campaign plane but adams later said it was 
determined the 9mm bullet belonged to the secret service its 
one of ours he said 
jackson campaigning in california suggested that comments by 
some public officials had helped set the stage for the alleged plot 
against him he was apparently referring to strong criticism of him 
during the new york primary campaign by new york city mayor ed 
koch who at one point said jews would have to be crazy to vote 
for jackson 
the climate for this kind of antagonism and violence of 
course has been set by many irresponsible public leaders whose 
attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate 
such as the onein new york in april for example jackson told 
reporters in fresno calif 
tom den ouden the agent in charge of the springfield mo fbi 
office located in an area that has become known for attracting 
members of extremist groups said he had done some checking into 
the williamses background and found no evidence the pair belonged 
to the order or csa 
papers filed in federal court indicated londell williams told an 
informer that he was a member of the order and other white 
supremacist groups and that jackson was to be killed 
a st louis television station ksdk reported that williams had 
telephoned from jail on wednesday to say he had not been involved 
in any plot against the democratic presidential contender 
i did not conspire to kill the man the station quoted 
williams as saying if jesse jackson makes it to the presidency 
well fine 
and in an interview with the belleville ill newsdemocrat 
published in thursdays editions williams admitted he is a racist 
but said he is not affiliated with any group 
if there was a crime done ive done it all on my own he 
told the newspaper in a telephone interview from jail on wednesday 
i deny that there is a crime done i did not conspire with anyone 
to kill any presidential candidate especially jesse jackson 
i do have prejudices against anything that isnt white 
he added 
lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white 
supremacist group and after the hearing tuesday mrs williams 
said as she was escorted out of the courtroom were not part of 
the csa 
according to the criminal complaint filed in us district 
court an unidentified person contacted the franklin county 
sheriffs office earlier this month claiming that the williamses 
were conspiring to assassinate jackson 
the information was relayed to the secret service and agents met 
with the informant who agreed to wear a hidden microphone and meet 
again may 10 with londell williams this time with law enforcement 
officials listening in the complaint said 
the complaint said the informant later received a death threat 
from the williamses for informing on them 
at the hearing secret service agent j christopher murphy 
testified that the informant led sheriffs deputies to a wooded 
area in franklin county where they found an ar15 colt 
semiautomatic rifle and a bag the informant said belonged to the 
williamses 
the complaint said the bag contained a postcard addressed to 
londell williams and maps one of which had his fingerprints the 
rifle had been reported stolen from springfield according to the 
agent 
murphy said that during the recorded conversation with the 
informant williams said he wanted to get the rifle back because it 
had been issued to him by the csa williams also said the 
organization wanted it returned because it had been used to kill a 
law enforcement officer murphy said 
murphy said that the informant brought up the assassination plot 
during the conversation and williams said the csa was planning to 
assassinate candidate jackson on the fourth of july 
murphy said that after the williamses were arrested williams 
told authorities about the individual who provided him with the 
rifle and also made statements about a plan to kill jackson 
secret service agent david northcutt testified that he had 
interviewed ms williams after her arrest at that time she said 
she was present when her husband discussed the csa and other groups 
jackson who is seeking the democratic presidential nomination 
and has been the target of hundreds of death threats in his 1984 
and 1988 campaigns said wednesday he would not be deterred 
we will not surrender to the dreambusters jackson said in 
los angeles the secret service will handle the dreambusters 
and i will keep articulating the dream and keep hope alive 
the williamses were being held without bond in the federal 
detention facility in belleville ill across the mississippi 
river from st louis 
records in christian county circuit court show londell and tammy 
williams were both arrested in ozark dec 7 1986 he was charged 
with unlawful use of a weapon and she was charged with possession 
of marijuana both ended up serving short sentences in the 
christian county jail and are on probation according to records

insurance companies can cut medical expenses 8 
percent if they require people to get approval from a review board 
before being treated in the hospital says a study published today 
such utilization review progams are intended to hold down 
medical expenses by checking to make sure hospitalization is 
necessary 
the study found that the controls save money although it did 
not determine whether they have any effect on health 
utilization review programs generally require that hospital 
admissions be approved by a review panel before or at the time of 
admission 
the study directed by dr paul j feldstein of the university 
of california at irvine was published in the new england journal 
of medicine and was based on a review of 222 groups of employees 
and dependents who were covered by a large private insurance 
company that required utilization review 
the study concluded that utilization review reduced hospital 
admissions by 12 percent and total medical expenditures by 8 
percent 
for a typical company with 1000 employees this could mean 
saving 636000 over five years the study said for a similar 
company with a high rate of hospital use the savings could total 
22 million

the nations cable television subscribers will 
face massive blackouts in service under a new federal policy 
allowing local stations to buy exclusive rights to syndicated 
programs cable industry officials say 
under the policy approved 30 by the federal communications 
commission on wednesday cable tv systems that broadcast the same 
programs in a local stations viewing area will have to black out 
the shows or substitute other programs 
some in the cable industry are predicting dark screens and the 
demise of some tv superstations as a result 
ted turner chairman of turner broadcasting inc which owns 
nationally distributed wtbs said the new rules do not give the 
cable industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said the new rules will result in 
less duplication of programs and will provide an incentive to 
produce new programs 
blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause 
turmoil for shortterm political advantage which i cannot believe 
they will do he said 
the national cable television association said it will challenge 
the rules in court 
the fcc pulled the plug on the favorite tv programs of 
millions of people ncta president james p mooney said people 
whose favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered 
and the cost of syndicated programming will rise he added 
the rules will likely reduce how often tv viewers can see 
syndicated reruns of shows like mash taxi and my 
three sons 
a cable subscriber now can see one of these shows several times 
a day if it is aired by a local broadcaster and by outoftown 
superstations whose signals are carried by the local cable operator 
the rule of reruns is what prevails today patrick said he 
said that by giving broadcasters a measure of programming 
protection the rules will increase the value of their programs to 
advertisers more ad revenue in turn will foster production of 
new programs he said 
in addition cable systems will be forced to be come up with 
more programming he said 
he also said cable systems should not have to resort to 
blackouts to comply with the rules because of a oneyear transition 
period a variety of exceptions that will be allowed and the amount 
of substitute programming that is available patrick said 
but the cable industry expects that at least some screens will 
go dark and that some of the smaller tv superstations may return to 
being just local stations 
that view was expressed by jeff treeman senior vice president 
of united video the tulsa oklabased cable carrier that 
distributes superstation signals including wgn he said cable 
systems in some large markets where independents can afford to buy 
exclusive rights to programming may have to black out or 
substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of a superstations 
programming 
thats enough for the cable operator to drop the signal he 
said 
similar rules were dropped by the fcc in 1980 since then cable 
systems have been able to carry the signals of outoftown stations 
such as wtbs in atlanta wwor in the new york area and wgn in 
chicago which have become known as superstations even when those 
stations transmit programs whose rights were bought by a local tv 
station 
superstations also have become popular for the local sporting 
events they carry 
under the new exclusivity rules tv stations will be able to 
negotiate for exclusive rights to a syndicated program and will be 
able to force a cable system to honor that contract by blacking out 
that show when it is aired by a superstation on the system the 
rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate rights with cable 
systems 
superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for 
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis 
the rules wont apply to cable systems with fewer than 1000 
subscribers about half of all cable systems fall into this 
category though they serve only about 5 percent of the nations 45 
million cable subscribers the fcc said

leaders of the house interior committee are 
split over whether a proposed swap of 925 usowned acres in 
downtown phoenix for 118000 acres of swampland in florida is fair 
to taxpayers but the committee approved the arrangement 
this is a good deal everybody wins says longtime 
interior chairman morris udall dariz who helped put the 
proposal together 
strongly disagreeing is rep george miller dcalif an 
interior subcommittee chairman who is first in line to eventually 
succeed udall as chairman and who normally is aligned with udall on 
issues before the panel 
miller says the deal could find taxpayers trading the phoenix 
acreage for a bargain basement price because nobody knows just 
how much the property will be worth when it is rezoned for 
commercial development 
udall on wednesday had the clout that normally flows to a 
chairman easily winning voicevote approval for legislation 
authorizing completion of what miller says would be the biggest 
interstate land trade in us history 
the proposed deal involves the 104acre site that now houses the 
phoenix indian school a federal facility that is slated to close 
next month miller says the property is one of the most valuable 
undeveloped urban tracts in the west an interior department 
appraisal values the parcel at 122 million 
on the florida end are 118000 acres owned by the collier 
family although miller says that 4236 of them are under tidal 
water and possibly owned by the state of florida this land would 
be used to enlarge the big cypress national preserve and the 
florida panther refuge in the southwest part of the state but the 
government would not own the subsurface mineral rights 
the deal worked out by the interior department and the arizona 
congressional delegation values the florida land at 451 million 
the proposal also calls for the collier family to pay the 
government 349 million 
under the plan the colliers would get 68 of the 104 acres in 
phoenix the city of phoenix would be given 20 acres for a park and 
the veterans administration 115 to expand a hospital with the 
state of arizona possibly getting the other 45 acres 
miller challenged the appraisal on the phoenix property citing 
a report by the congressional general accounting office that says 
the real value of the land wont be known until the 68 acres are 
rezoned for commercial use 
by a 363 vote he lost an attempt to amend the bill to delay 
completion of the deal until after phoenix substantially completed 
the rezoning process new appraisals were submitted to congress and 
gao ruled that what the government was getting was equal to what it 
was trading away 
my intention is to make this exchange look a little more like 
a business transaction miller said we owe this to the 
taxpayers there is no private individual who would get rid of 
these lands under these circumstances 
udall and other supporters argued that the legislation could 
bring a higher price for the 68 acres because it requires the tract 
to be offered to the highest bidder once rezoning is completed 
under the plan the colliers could get the land by matching the 
high bid 
miller said however that there is little likelihood another 
buyer could quickly put together the financial package to satisfy 
the bills requirement that the buyer pay cash for the property 
within 30 days of the bidding 
defending the legislation rep don young ralaska said that 
its a good package for what were all trying to do forget the 
value of the phoenix land were not in the moneymaking 
business

banks should be required to cash government 
checks for the elderly and the poor even if they have no accounts 
with the financial institutions an advocacy group told lawmakers 
peggy miller representing the consumer federation of america 
told a senate subcommittee on wednesday that people on social 
security and welfare would be willing to pay a fee of 2 for the 
check cashing service by banks even though legislation does not 
call for it 
ms miller provided the senate banking subcommittee on consumer 
affairs with statistics showing that check cashing outlets 
including liquor stores often charge exorbitant fees for the 
service because of the unwillingness of banks to provide it 
she said check cashing outlets and unlicensed community 
locations often charge as high as 20 percent to 30 percent for 
personal checks 10 percent for money orders and 6 percent for 
government checks 
they can do so because they are vendors of last resort she 
said many of their customers including our elderly have no 
where else to go 
ms miller said her group supported legislation introduced in 
the senate by sen howard metzenbaum dohio and in the house by 
rep charles schumer dny which would require banks to cash 
government checks of customers with no accounts once their 
identification has been verified 
august zinsser iii representing the american bankers 
association told the committee that the legislation would subject 
banks to large fraud losses and is premature inappropriate and 
unfair to depository institutions 
proponents of the legislation including ms miller denied that 
fraud would be a problem 
ms miller said currently 54000 government checks out of 482 
million are forged each year this represents less than the 
normal bounce level of all checks cashed in banks she said 
another witness assistant comptroller general richard l fogel 
released a prelimary report done by the general accounting office 
which indicates that social security and welfare recipients in the 
nations urban areas have the most difficulty cashing their 
government checks in banks where they have no accounts 
he said the unbanked population of the united states is at 
the lower end of the income scale relies relatively heavily on 
government benefit programs includes a significant percentage of 
the unemployed and most have 12 years or less of education 
some individuals do not have depository accounts and are not 
able to cash their checks at local banks or thrifts fogel said

the federal government needs to set higher 
standards for state poverty programs so that the assistance 
available to poor people wont vary so widely from state to state 
a private research group says 
at the same time states need to do more on their own to improve 
programs for the disadvantaged said the center on budget and 
policy priorities 
the center which analyzes government spending and its impact on 
the poor from a liberal perspective reported wednesday that most 
states fail to provide adequate safety nets for the poor 
the centers report holes in the safety nets found broad 
differences among the states in the quality of assistance provided 
to the poor it concluded that shortcomings exist in all regions of 
the country and even in some states with sound economies and 
aboveaverage personal income 
the extent of variations in state poverty policies makes a 
strong case for an enhanced federal role both in setting standards 
and providing funds the researchers said assistance to many 
poor families would not then depend so much on where in this nation 
they happen to live 
but center director robert greenstein said that because budget 
constraints probably will prevent sweeping changes at the federal 
level we believe that the principal choices made in determining 
the quality of the state safety nets are likely to be those made in 
each state capital 
to narrow some of these holes in the safety net state action 
is crucial he said 
the center studied government programs that provide cash 
medical and other assistance to the poor and found that none of 
the states nor the district of columbia met all 10 standards in a 
reasonable adequacy test developed by the center 
twentynine states meet three or fewer of the criteria 
including indiana and texas which meet none just 14 states meet 
more than half the criteria including minnesota and massachusetts 
which did the best by meeting nine of the 10 
the study found for example 
in 32 states maximum benefits from aid to families with 
dependent children are below half the poverty line for a family of

families living below half the poverty line 
in 26 states fewer than one in three jobless workers received 
unemployment insurance in an average month in 1986 
greenstein told reporters that some of the states that are the 
most stingy with benefits turn around and extract significant 
amounts of the income of poor families through the tax system in 
their states 
he said that because the assistance gaps are present in all 
regions of the country and in states with both low and high 
personal income this indicates that really youre talking about 
political questions in determining benefits

the political weakness of lowincome families greenstein

attorney general edwin meese iii is launching 
a counterattack against his critics and telling conservative 
senators he wont resign in the absence of evidence of wrongdoing 
meeses private lawyers said wednesday that a senate 
subcommittee report is seriously wrong in accusing meese of 
violating a white house policy by assisting scandalplagued wedtech 
corp 
in addition meeses counselor at the justice department 
william bradford reynolds claimed that subcommittee chairman carl 
levin of michigan hadnt given the panels members an opportunity 
to vote on the report 
in response levin said the report was circulated to every 
member of the subcommittee for comment release of the report 
was approved by the subcommittee members 
the report issued earlier this month says that thenwhite house 
counselor meese and his deputy violated a white house policy 
barring contacts with procurement officials resulting in 
favoritism toward wedtech 
meeses private attorneys nathan lewin and james rocap said 
the subcommittee report was incorrect because the white house 
policy permits contacts with procurement agencies when the white 
house has a legitimate interest in information about procurement 
matters 
president reagan had campaigned in the south bronx ny area 
where wedtech was located and had expressed an interest in 
promoting jobs in the area 
independent counsel james mckay who has been conducting a 
criminal investigation of meeses involvement with wedtech and 
other matters is expected to issue a report in several weeks 
raising ethical questions about the attorney generals behavior 
sources familiar with the investigation have said 
meese told seven conservative republican senators on wednesday 
that if he resigned now it would be an admission of guilt when 
there is no evidence he has done anything wrong congressional 
sources said 
the attorney general made the comment after being asked by one 
of the conservative senators whether he had weighed the possibility 
of quitting said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
meeses 90minute closeddoor luncheon at the capitol came two 
days after it was disclosed that the attorney general had fired his 
staunchly conservative chief spokesman terry eastland allegedly 
for not defending him aggressively enough 
after the meeting sen jesse helms rnc told reporters the 
subject of meeses future had come up peripherally helms 
added i assume hell be attorney general for the rest of this 
year 
the meeting was a good candid frank amicable discussion 
about the operations of the justice department said christopher 
simpson press secretary for sen strom thurmond rsc who also 
attended the meeting 
the best thing for all concerned is to wait to see the mckay 
report added sen orrin hatch rutah 
in related developments 
rep william ford dmich has written to the house and senate 
judiciary committees accusing patrick s korten meeses new chief 
spokesman of making false statements while he was chief spokesman 
for the office of personnel management the washington post 
reported today 
in a letter obtained by the newspaper ford said he was stunned 
when meese appointed korten who as opm spokesman lost all 
credibility as a result of repeated instances of false and or 
misleading statements to the house post office and civil service 
committee which ford chairs 
peter flaherty chairman of the citizens for reagan a 
100000member lobbying group urged meese to fight it out 
my impression is that the attorney general is anxious to confront 
his critics and anyone who thinks ed meese is leaving soon is going 
to be disappointed

a hate crimes bill requiring the 
government to keep figures on violence motivated by prejudice is on 
its way to the senate complete with a provision to tabulate crimes 
against homosexuals 
the house passed the hate crimes statistics act 38329 on 
wednesday after overwhelmingly rejecting an attempt to remove 
attacks on homosexuals from the hate crimes list 
peri jude radecic a lobbyist for the national gay and lesbian 
task force said the action fell short of a step towards gay civil 
rights but was nevertheless encouraging 
members of congress have recognized that antigay and 
antilesbian violence is not acceptable in our society she said 
they are on record as not condoning it 
the measure passed by the house requires the justice department 
to collect and publish data on the incidence of crimes motivated by 
prejudice based on race religion ethnicity or homosexuality 
homicide assault robbery burglary theft arson vandalism 
trespassing and threats would be tabulated 
the fbi publishes an annual uniform crime report on a variety of 
crime based on information from some 16000 state and local law 
enforcement agencies however the report does not currently 
include a national count of hate crimes 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on criminal justice described a hate crime as an 
act of violence which is accompanied by an additional motive an 
attempt to intimidate a larger group or class of people 
it is important to document that cross burnings are more than 
arson and that swastikas painted on synagogues are more than 
vandalism said rep barbara kennelly dconn sponsor of the 
bill 
conyers kennelly and others said comprehensive national figures 
on crimes motivated by intolerance would enable law enforcement 
authorities to spot trends in bigotry develop enforcement and 
educational strategies and concentrate manpower in the right 
places 
house debate centered on the inclusion of hate crimes committed 
against people on grounds of their sexual orientation a provision 
that was not in a similar bill passed by the house in the last 
congress 
rep george gekas rpa argued that the provision would 
elevate homosexuals to a position higher than other people who 
are in perhaps worse circumstances 
he asked why the bill did not require separate data on crimes 
against octogenarians child abuse victims bus passengers and 
police officers killed in the line of duty they are not included 
here and theyre all protectable groups of people gekas said 
we are not talking about crimes committed against 
passengers on a bus countered rep gerry studds dmass one of 
two acknowledged homosexuals in congress there is no 
centuriesold tradition of hatred against bus passengers 
policemen the handicapped or the young 
studds and others said hearings produced substantial evidence 
that gaybashing is frequent and on the rise and in fact is 
the most prevalent form of hate crime they said deleting that 
category from the bill would imply that violence against gays is 
acceptable 
the gekas amendment was killed when the house voted 38430 for a 
substitute amendment that changed a phrase in the bill but had no 
substantive effect the successful measure sponsored by rep john 
miller rwash replaced the phrase sexual orientation with a more 
specific reference to homosexuality 
supporters of the bill include the american civil liberties 
union the leadership conference on civil rights several religious 
groups and organizations representing police officers 
psychologists homosexuals and women 
the reagan administration opposes the measure contending its 
datacollection requirements will be difficult and expensive to 
meet and be burdensome to law enforcement authorities

a petition organized by a christian human 
rights group asks a shiite moslem religious leader in beirut to 
intercede on behalf of westerners being held hostage in lebanon a 
former captive said wednesday 
the prayerful plea with 40000 signatures was carried out of 
the united states this week and is expected to be delivered this 
weekend to sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah in beirut said david 
jacobsen who spent 17 months in captivity 
the wording of the petition was carefully worked out in 
consultation with shiite religious leaders jacobsen said in a 
telephone interview at his home in huntington beach 32 miles south 
of los angeles 
reading from a copy of the petition jacobsen said it reads 
in the name of one merciful god we the undersigned wish to 
express to you our concern and prayers for the hostages held 
captive in lebanon 
we also pray for the countless lebanese held captive in 
lebanon and elsewhere in the middle east 
as believers in almighty god we have faith that prayer is more 
powerful than armies or contingents of diplomats because of this 
we respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you can 
to intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives 
fadlallah is a shiite moslem religious leader associated with 
the hezbollah or the party of god 
the iranianbacked hezbollah is the group believed responsible 
for the kidnapping of americans british and other westerners in 
lebanon 
what makes this so very important is that a story came out 
tuesday in which sheik fadlallah said the only way the hostages can 
be released is through direct talks with the abductors jacobsen 
said 
it is hoped that fadlallah can facilitate those talks jacobsen 
said 
a total of 18 westerners are being held in lebanon including 
nine americans terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press has been held captive longest he was 
kidnapped on march 16 1985 
jacobsen 57 was released by his captors in beirut on nov 2 
1986 after being held for 17 months he was working as the 
hospital administrator at the american university hospital in 
beirut when he was seized on may 28 1985 
jacobsen said the petition specifically asks fadlallah to join 
us in prayer for the safe return home of anglican church envoy 
terry waite who was taken hostage last year while trying to 
negotiate the release of other western captives 
the petition concludes we share with you the desire to see 
all people safe and at peace and we agree with your statement 
neither islam nor christianity justify kidnapping 
the petition was organized by friends in the west a small 
protestant group based in seattle wash that has worked quietly 
but tirelessly for the release of the hostages since 1986 jacobsen 
said 
jacobsen asked that the leader of friends in the west not be 
named saying it may endanger his life or his freedom in further 
efforts to free the hostages

members of congress say theyll accept 
president reagans call for a bipartisan antidrug task force but 
some question his electionyear timing and wonder why he didnt act 
sooner 
reagan called wednesday for the task force to find a consensus 
within 45 days on all aspects of the antinarcotics campaign and 
said the battle against illegal drugs is in danger of being 
tripped up by political debate 
reagans proposal comes as his administration faces mounting 
criticism on the drug issue most notably for its willingness to 
consider dropping drug charges against panamanian military leader 
manuel antonio noriega 
and with elections approaching the nations politicians are 
trying to outdo each other as foes of drug abuse presidential 
candidates speak of the issue lawmakers are demanding that the 
military be more involved and congressional task forces in both 
houses are studying new comprehensive legislation to supplement a 
major 1986 drug bill 
rep charles b rangel dny and chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics said of reagan in this political year 
he thought there was still something more that had to be done and i 
could not agree with him more 
but rangel noted that the task force proposed by reagan would 
report on the eve of the democratic convention this july and the 
august republican convention 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said wednesday 
we welcome the presidents belated leadership we are ready to 
cooperate with him 
we have already begun to work byrd said the 
administration has been lax in the treatment of this subject the 
president has suddenly decided he will cooperate with the 
congress 
on tuesday byrd appointed a working group on substance 
abuse as part of the senates democratic caucus the group to 
report by june 29 will work to expedite the consideration of 
legislation to strengthen existing drug laws and to provide 
additional resources for the drug abuse crisis 
reagan made his comments in new london conn in a commencement 
address at the us coast guard academy 
if we cannot remove the politics from drugs how can we hope 
to remove the drugs from our communities workplaces and schools 
reagan asked his audience of 159 whiteuniformed graduating cadets 
and their relatives 
illegal drug use is the foremost concern in our country and 
frankly as i finish my final year in office and look ahead i 
worry that excessive drug politics might undermine effective drug 
policy he said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said he welcomes the 
administrations interest in the drug issue and pointed out that 
the house established its own bipartisan task force on may 9 to 
produce a new drug bill 
rep larry smith dfla and a member of the house narcotics 
committee said reagan was plowing old ground we already had 
task forces and already had bills with bipartisan support this is 
a feeble attempt to justify what has been a failed policy 
but a republican member of the panel rep duncan hunter 
rcalif said the administration alone cannot be blamed for 
problems in the war on drugs he said the house democratic 
leadership tried to block his amendment to the defense bill that 
would require the military to seal us borders against drug 
smugglers within 45 days after enactment 
the amendment passed 38523 and its fate will be decided in a 
housesenate conference the senate by 836 passed a less 
sweeping amendment to get the military involved 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said he was delighted to hear 
president reagan once again declare illegal drugs public enemy no 
1 
the senator said he and sen alfonse m damato rny have 
spent nine months drafting a comprehensive drug bill and suggested 
it be used as a blueprint for the presidents task force 
damato was critical of reagan on wednesday 
if we took action there wouldnt be any necessity for 
rhetoric he said speaking of the bipartisan commission damato 
said it is unfortunate that it took the congress to drag the 
administration kicking and screaming to the altar on doing 
something about drugs 
reagan said his task force should produce a report on issues 
such as how the military should be involved in the campaign and 
whether the death penalty should be imposed when a police officer 
or other people are killed as a result of drug trafficking 
our task force should agree on solutions for every area of the 
drug problem from blocking supplies to curtailing demand from 
treatment to education to prosecution from interdiction and 
confiscation to eradication nothing should be overlooked or ruled 
out the president said

having such fun in his fifth year of the cosby show that the 
network can persuade its no 1 star to stay on past next season 
cosby had said he would only do five years of the cosby 
show which quickly became the toprated network show four 
seasons ago and is credited with putting nbc into first place 
this is our fifth season and its supposed to be our last so 
im going to have my fun this year not in messing up but in 
doing things even better cosby told advertisers here wednesday 
to get a peek at the networks fall lineup 
abc and cbs are also scheduled to announce their fall schedules 
this month 
at a news conference nbc entertainment president brandon 
tartikoff said the network hoped to persuade cosby to stay after 
next season 
if hes having fun and hes got stories to tell we might 
convince him to come back said tartikoff though he added that 
there had been no formal talks with cosby 
at wednesdays presentation nbc unveiled some of its new 
series tartikoff insisted the network is not playing it safe with 
the fall schedule having canceled some successful but aging series 
and adding stylish new shows advertisers were shown clips from 
some of them 
midnight caller stars gary cole fatal vision as a 
mouthy troubled excop who is persuaded by a radio station owner 
to take on a latenight radio callin show and becomes a cult hero 
the show is set in san francisco the clips from the pilot looked a 
little derivative it was directed by thomas carter the talented 
director of the miami vice pilot but cole is a charismatic 
actor and the series shows promise 
baby boom based on and produced by the same people who did 
the movie of the same name stars kate jackson in the diane keaton 
role as a highpowered career woman suddenly saddled with an infant 
she inherits from a distant relative the clips got laughs from 
advertisers and the show looks to be a sophisticated winner 
another tantalizing sophisticated hourlong series 
tattingers comes from the producers of st elsewhere and 
shows the same smart dramatic and comic twists it stars stephen 
collins sure to be a new tv heartthrob as a flamboyant recently 
divorced restaurauteur who battles rude cabbies drug dealers and 
mobsters while courting his longsuffering exwife blythe danner 
another virtually certain hit is dear john starring fine 
comic actor judd hirsch taxi as a newly divorced middleaged 
man it is based on a bbc series of the same name and will go into 
nbcs thursday lineup of hit comedies 
likewise empty nest from the makers of golden girls 
starring richard mulligan as a recently widowed pediatrician 
contending with life and kids the show will follow golden 
girls on saturday night and there will be some crossover of 
characters between the two series 
nbc canceled the facts of life crime story a year in 
the life our house beverly hills buntz the bronx 
zoo and aarons way 
the days and nights of molly dodd is getting a summer run on 
wednesday nights and tartikoff said if the show does phenomenally 
well which he didnt really seem to expect it could come back 
day by day and in the heat of the night which were 
spring replacement series made the fall schedule 
tartikoff said it was a tossup between day by day and my 
two dads but nbc is gambling on the appeal of teen star cb 
barnes of day by day 
another star nbc is pinning hopes on is mario van peebles of 
sonny spoon an offbeat detective series that was also a 
replacement series 
tartikoff said he regretted bidding farewell to crime story 
but the hardest decision was canceling a year in the life 
there were some darlings of mine that in this game of musical 
chairs i could not get everybody to sit down he said

defense minister yitzhak rabin accused jordan 
and egypt of not doing enough to prevent guerrilla raids into 
israel from their territory 
rabin made the comment wednesday a day after one palestinian 
guerrilla crossed the border fence between jordan and israel and 
was wounded and captured by israeli troops two other guerrillas 
escaped back to jordan 
there is no doubt in my mind that the authorities in egypt and 
jordan are doing sometimes not everything that can be done to 
prevent the infiltrations rabin said on israel radio 
tuesday nights infiltration was the second from jordan and the 
13th attempt since the arab uprising began dec 8 in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip since dec 1 guerrillas have twice tried 
to enter israel from egypt 
rabin linked the increase in infiltration attempts to the 
intefadah arabic for uprising he charged the plo with 
inciting terror attacks from lebanon jordan and egypt as well as 
inside the occupied lands to breathe life into the rebellion 
but rabin said that thanks to the armys tough response the 
uprising was dying out we have seen a gradual reduction of 
civilian violent activities as a result of measures we have 
taken such as arrests administrative detentions deportations 
he said on a tour of the gaza strip 
jordan denied that the latest raid into israel was launched from 
its territory saying it would never allow infiltrators to cross 
from jordan into occupied arab territories 
in another development israeli troops backed by helicopters and 
bulldozers on wednesday carried out a predawn raid on two arab 
mountain villages and were surrounded by hundreds of stonethrowing 
palestinians hospital officials said one arab villager was killed 
and 10 were wounded 
troops also shot and wounded four arabs during a confrontation 
in the marketplace of nablus the largest west bank city the army 
said 
the fatality wednesday brought the arab death toll in the 
uprising to 191 according to un figures two israelis also have 
died 
arab doctors said at least 20 palestinians were injured by 
beatings and rubber bullets during the clashes in abwein and arura 
neighboring villages north of ramallah witnesses said hundreds 
were arrested 
an army spokesman confirmed one arab was killed and nine 
wounded but he refused comment on the arrests or the reason for 
the sweeps on the final day of id el fitr the threeday moslem 
holiday marking the end of the holy month of ramadan 
in both villages fighting lasted through wednesday morning with 
helicopters dropping tear gas before soldiers gained control and 
moved from house to house in search of suspects witnesses said 
in arura troops rounded up about 300 teenagers and young men 
in a schoolyard a 19yearold palestinian said from his hospital 
bed in ramallah 
in abwein soldiers made no arrests apparently because most 
youths fled into the surrounding hills said a merchant who would 
only give his first name saam but he said troops beat several 
women and in some cases smashed furniture with clubs 
army bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks that had been set up by 
villagers and forced residents to remove outlawed palestinian flags 
from a mosque tower and utility poles witnesses said 
a black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of majdi 
youssef hilal a 16yearold boy who was fatally shot in the chest 
during the clashes 
in nablus troops were attacked by youths throwing stones as 
they patrolled the citys market an army spokesman said 
the troops fired at the arabs when they were in danger 
wounding four palestinians the spokesman said 
the defense ministry on wednesday ordered that teenagers in the 
gadna paramilitary youth corps not be allowed to serve in areas 
where arab prisoners were held the army said 
a army spokesman said the order was in response to an incident 
in which a teenager in the corps beat an arab prisoner during a 
visit to a detention center after being encouraged to do so by an 
army sergeant

howard h baker jr says top white house aides 
have at least an implied commitment not to write about their 
intimacy with power if so its a commitment as often honored in 
the breach as in the observance 
a quick survey shows that half a dozen people who have held 
bakers post of white house chief of staff or its equivalent have 
written books about their experience about the same number have 
passed up the temptation 
at least three of the chiefs of staff who have written books 
have described tempestuous circumstances surrounding their 
departures from the white house 
donald t regan however was apparently the first to rush into 
print while the president he had served was still in office which 
partly accounts for the unprecedented furor his book has aroused 
i dont think you ought to write those books baker told 
reporters wednesday i think when you take a job like this that 
theres at least an implied commitment that youre not going to 
write books like that if youre in daily intimate contact with 
the president in a decisionmaking process i think theres an 
obligation to treat that discreetly and confidentially 
i do not intend to write a book baker said i think the 
bloom is off the rose now with the kissandtell books and i very 
much hope that thats a phenomemon thats going to subside and go 
away 
maybe so but its been around for a while the very first 
person to hold the title of white house chief of staff sherman t 
adams brought out a book about his experiences in 1961 one year 
after the president he served dwight d eisenhower left office 
like more recent ones the book contained direct quotations from 
the presidents conversations such as one in which eisenhower told 
adams that the maneuverings of one gop party leader looked like 
pretty slippery business to him adams did not identify the party 
leader 
regan also sprinkled his book with what appear to be direct 
quotes from president reagan although he omitted the quotation 
marks out of deference to the office and the man except when he 
was quoting what had appeared elsewhere 
adams book firsthand report contrasts sharply with 
regans in one respect in the index it has nine entries for first 
lady mamie eisenhower the index to regans for the record has 
half a column of entries for nancy reagan and nine separate 
headings covering his controversial disclosures of her interest in 
astrology 
adams is one of the two previous chiefs of staff who like 
regan left office under fire regan over his handling of the 
irancontra affair and adams over his acceptance of gifts from 
boston industrialist bernard goldfine 
regan describing his abrupt replacement by baker recounts an 
angry telephone conversation in which he told reagan he had 
deserved better treatment and the president replied only that 
he was sorry 
adams who had a reputation for reticence wrote that when he 
handed the president his proposed statement of resignation 
eisenhower said that he wanted nobody but me to make this 
decision and that under the circumstances he thought i had acted 
wisely 
in contrast to this lowkey account hr haldeman wrote a 
dramatic recital of his dismissal by richard nixon at camp david 
with nixon telling him that the night before he had prayed that i 
wouldnt wake up in the morning 
haldeman said he was touched by the presidents words but was 
hurt to discover after a nixon television interview in 1977 that 
the president had spoken the same words to john ehrlichman in 
firing him the same day in fact he said it was this interview 
that prompted him almost four years after leaving the white house 
to write his book the ends of power 
he said the effect of the nixon interview was to distort and 
confuse watergate issues 
the most recent chief of staff to break into print was hamilton 
jordan whose 1982 book crisis dealt with the last year of 
the carter presidency other books by top white house aides include 
a political education published in 1972 by harry c 
mcpherson who was special counsel to president johnson and two 
books about the kennedy administration by theodore sorensen both 
andrew goodpaster who took over many of adams duties and 
alexander haig who succeeded haldeman have written books but they 
did not deal with their white house days

in 750 tortilla shells and sprinkle with 15 pounds of cheese 
and hope the locals like mexican food

still the project raised 300 for the cookeville rescue mission 
for the homeless said bob hagemann a spokesman for tennessee tech

interfered as workers tried to cover 65 tables with the flour 
tortilla shells in preparation for stuffing 
it was too windy a day all of our burrito flours tortilla 
shells were flying away said jeff dishman shift manager for 
the cookeville taco bell which helped build the burrito

the late head of west germanys 
jewish community may not have acted alone in the apparent 
embezzlement of millions of dollars of government funds earmarked 
for holocaust survivors prosecutors say 
the family attorney for werner nachmann who died in january 
said on wednesday that he had been unable to determine where the 
missing money had gone and that nachmann may have squandered much 
of it 
the family has filed for bankruptcy in karlsruhe where nachmann 
lived and ran a wholesale textile business 
nachmann who headed the central jewish council for 23 years 
until his death from a heart attack at age 62 may have had 
accomplices in the scheme said manfred roething a spokesman for 
the karlsruhe prosecutors office 
he said investigators would seek to determine whether other 
parties may be liable for prosecution as accessories 
government officials have vowed to bring the truth to light a 
top aide to chancellor helmut kohl is to meet friday with heinz 
galinski who succeeded nachmann as council president 
jewish leaders have expressed shock and outrage they say they 
believe nachmann had for years embezzled money earmarked for 
holocaust survivors around the world which he was in charge of 
disbursing 
galinski said nachmann appears to have stolen more than 6 
million 
but peter paepcke the nachmann family attorney said he 
believes the late jewish leader may have embezzled up to 15 
million and used some of it to bolster his failing business 
paepcke who said he had worked for nachmann for a decade 
indicated he believed nachmann had squandered some of the money he 
said he filed for bankruptcy march 30 for nachmanns heirs and the 
karlsruhebased company 
i do not understand this yet he told west german 
television the sums of money that were apparently taken should 
have been more than enough to cover the nachmann business 
debts 
i can only conclude that perhaps the money also went 
elsewhere he added without elaboration 
eberhard braun a courtappointed investigator who has been 
examining nachmanns financial records told the associated press 
he found unexplained income of 13 million in nachmanns company 
records 
jewish leaders vowed to launch their own investigations to help 
clear up the case 
we will use all legal means at our disposal to take action 
against everyone who took part in this hanover jewish leader 
michael fuerst said in a telephone interview 
nachmann who became jewish council president in 1965 was in 
charge of disbursing about 236 million that had been allocated by 
the government in 1980 for holocaust survivors who had not 
previously made reparations claims 
those funds were in addition to the 47 billion already paid by 
west germany to holocaust victims or their families 
nachmann is suspected of having taken interest that accumulated 
from the funds appropriated in 1980 and transferring it to other 
accounts including his private business according to newspaper 
and other media reports 
nachmanns family fled nazi germany to france in 1938 he 
returned to karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward 
reestablishing jewish communities in the country

the white house has entered the congressional 
fray over a proposed increase in the minimum wage arguing that it 
could cost 850000 jobs while adding to the budget deficit 
beryl w sprinkel chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisors says even the smallest increase under 
consideration raising the minimum wage from 335 to 465 per 
hour by 1992 would cost 600000 jobs 
those losses would be concentrated among younger less skilled 
and minority workers he said 
a chart supplied by sprinkel indicates an increase in the 
minimum wage to 505 an hour over four years would eliminate 
850000 jobs by 1992 
legislation to raise the minimum wage 465 by 1991 was 
introduced last year but the house education and labor committee 
raised the figure to 505 per hour over four years the original 
bill proposed by sen edward m kennedy dmass is pending in the 
senate labor and human resources committee which kennedy chairs 
increasing the minimum wage would have adverse effects on 
employment unemployment economic output and on the budget 
deficit sprinkel said in a letter to rep thomas e petri 
rwisc a committee member 
increasing the federal minimum wage would do little to help 
the working poor under 20 percent of minimum wage workers are poor 
and many would lose employment sprinkel wrote in the letter 
released wednesday the direct impact on the budget deficit would 
be about 2 billion due to both increased budget outlays and 
reduced revenues 
he also said consumers would have to absorb roughly 13 billion 
more in higher costs for the products that minimumwage workers 
help to produce 
democrats have argued that a minimum wage would have a minimal 
effect on unemployment and the economy and kennedy denounced 
sprinkels findings in a statement released wednesday night 
thats preposterous he said the president could have 
obtained a more reliable estimate of the job effect from joan 
quigley the san francisco astrologer contacted by nancy reagan 
for advice 
petri sought sprinkels assessment of the minimum wage 
legislation after charging that the democratic leadership had 
attempted to suppress a congressional budget office report that 
said an increase to 505 an hour will cost up to 500000 jobs 
the draft study was sent to house labor chairman augustus 
hawkins dcalif who returned it to the cbo asking only the 
costs of the bill and not its economic impact 
house republicans charged that the cbo deliberately censored 
information pertinent to consideration of the bill or was 
specifically instructed to do so and followed that instruction 
according to a letter from house minority leader robert michel 
dill 
sprinkel said an earned income tax credit eitc an alternative 
proposed by petri but rejected by the house labor committee would 
target assistance to families of the working poor more directly 
than an increase in the minimum wage 
petri plans to place his proposal for a wage supplement which 
would base the credit on family size before the full house when the 
legislation reaches the floor 
without the same adverse effects on the economy and with 
comparable or even smaller budgetary cost than the proposed 
increased in the minimum wage an expanded eitc would target 
increased income to working heads of larger families below or close 
to poverty level said sprinkel

sex therapists william h masters and virginia 
e johnson say they published their controversial book on aids 
because too little attention was being paid to the potential spread 
of the disease among heterosexuals 
ms johnson told the white house aids commission on wednesday 
that the authors did not mean to create panic in the streets 
but wanted to counteract an earlier absence of openness of 
honesty in collaboration on the part of government officials 
federal health officials have criticized the book for suggesting 
aids is spreading more rapidly among sexually active heterosexuals 
than projected by official government estimates 
another criticism is that the mastersjohnson findings did not 
go through the peer review process required for publication in 
a major medical journal 
there would have been no way to publish in journals said 
masters citing both the length of the material and what he said is 
traditional difficulty in getting sex research accepted in such 
forums 
books are the characteristic mode of publishing in the field 
of sex research which is our field added dr robert c kolodny 
a longterm associate of the mastersjohnson team and a coauthor 
of the book crisis heterosexual behavior in the age of aids 
to commission chairman james watkins admonition that there 
should be an element of solidarity you might say among the 
scientific and medical community on aids kolodny replied 
with all due respect the process of science is not and has 
never been served by looking for unanimity of opinion the process 
of science has always been served by allowing people to speak on 
varying interpretations 
kolodny acknowledged the books estimate that as many as 3 
million americans may have the virus without knowing it is about 
twice as high as the official government estimate but he 
emphasized that the difference stems from different interpretations 
of the same raw data available to both government and private 
analysts 
as to controversy over what is often called casual spread of the 
disease kolodny said the book carefully distinguishes between 
theory and saying as a practical matter this is not something 
you ought to worry about 
for example on the question of risk of catching the virus in a 
restaurant where a waiter or chief has aids we said in our book 
specifically not unless you have sex or share needles with that 
person 
on catching it from a toilet seat 
we traveled here by public transportation and we all used the 
toilets in those areas and that should address the practical 
aspects of the risk said kolodny 
we do not suggest for a minute that people not use public rest 
rooms but we do suggest that if the public place looks to be 
contaminated with suspicious substances blood or other materials 
we wouldnt have used that 15 years ago in the time before aids and 
we dont suspect that anyone would really use that now 
this is common sense no one is claiming that the virus jumps 
off a surface and bites you kolodny said

a new york disc jockey claims the white house 
acted very bizarrely when his listeners took the advice of sen 
alfonse damato and called to complain about president reagans 
handling of the situation in panama 
the white house switchboard refused to take the complaints 
wednesday or to transfer callers to a special presidential 
inquiries extension said jim kerr a disc jockey with wwprfm an 
abc affiliate in new york city 
i spent two hours of my day today before i escaped from the 
station taking all these phone calls from people saying i tried 
to call the white house and they told us to call another number 
kerr said 
he said he believed the white house did not want to keep what 
could be an embarrassing tally of the calls 
the white house is now acting very bizarrely he said 
damato spokesman ed martin said abc thinks theyre getting 
jerked around because the presidents giving a big drug speech and 
they dont want to have anything critical like this the 
president stressed his administrations antidrug efforts in a 
commencement speech at the us coast guard academy on wednesday 
white house spokesman ben jarrett refused a reporters request 
to find out whether operators were refusing to transfer the calls 
i dont know anything about the operators he said im 
not going to track that down im sorry 
he also declined to explain how the inquiries office functioned 
and refused a request to determine how the office decides when to 
begin keeping a tally of calls on an issue

situation in panama but they didnt have a count of them and no 
characterization of the answers 
but martin said he got a call from a volunteer at the complaint 
number who left a message with our reception area saying the 
senator made some comments in new york today and were getting a 
flood of calls and wed like to know what he said

black backers of democratic frontrunner michael 
dukakis who have seen jesse jackson reap almost unanimous black 
support in the primary races to date are now moving aggressively 
to court the black vote for the november election 
a group of 80 minority members who advise dukakis has decided 
with his approval to expand efforts to meet and talk with members 
of the jackson campaign and to lobby black leaders before the 
democratic national convention in july 
the group will be working to identify possible party platform 
differences before the convention can put them in the spotlight 
also there is to be a meeting later this month between the 
massachusetts governor and about 100 black leaders from across the 
country and there will be appearances by black dukakis supporters 
throughout the south in the next eight weeks 
the dukakis groups leader longtime adviser joseph warren 
says he and jackson go way back together 
warren a college classmate of jackson said in an interview 
this week we went to civil rights fights together to jail 
together 
we see our role as getting out there now as advance folks 
getting out and letting our people know who this man is much more 
aggressively than we have in the past warren said 
we feel that the people who are supporting jesse jackson ought 
to know who mike dukakis is he said that investment at this 
time is very important 
besides warren himself the group of minority dukakis supporters 
includes many black leaders with ties to jackson aides 
jackson supporters have threatened to fight delegateselection 
and other rules at the convention but warren said he hoped 
increased communication between the campaigns would allow dukakis 
and jackson to settle other differences and avoid public feuding 
that could alienate black jackson supporters 
were going to talk unity warren said but there are only 
two guys who can make the final deal mike dukakis and jesse 
jackson 
robert beckel walter mondales presidential campaign manager 
who handled negotiations with jackson in 1984 said dukakis who 
speaks with jackson at least weekly appears to have a better 
relationship with jackson than mondale did 
jackson believes that dukakis respects him and that goes a 
long way with jackson beckel said its not a question of 
getting something resolved now but to begin talking about how 
youre going to do it 
jackson campaign manager gerald austin declined comment when 
asked if the jackson campaign would cooperate with warren and other 
black dukakis supporters he said recently that he was speaking 
frequently with dukakis campaign manager susan estrich but that 
those talks have not involved issues likely to arise at or just 
before the convention 
dukakis has insisted the choice of picking a running mate is his 
alone to make and he is not expected to offer jackson the no 2 
spot on the democratic ticket 
as his delegate lead has widened dukakis in recent weeks has 
been more forceful in asserting differences with jackson but still 
has avoided direct criticism of the civil rights leader aides say 
dukakis is banking on winning the final primaries in new jersey and 
delegaterich california on june 7 to lessen jacksons bargaining 
position heading into the atlanta convention 
some dukakis aides say privately that they fear a fallingout 
with jackson would cost the democratic ticket black support it 
needs to carry several states in the south publicly however the 
aides profess only optimism 
we feel strongly that jesse will come out with us warren 
said we are looking forward to a fight with george bush and we 
are looking forward to locking arms with jesse jackson 
christopher edley issues director for the dukakis campaign and 
a white house aide during the carter administration refused to say 
whether he personally has had recent talks with jackson aides 
edley who is black did say i share my candidates optimism 
that we will be able to bring the party together without serious 
acrimony on any front 
the meeting between dukakis and the black leaders most of them 
already dukakis supporters is planned for memorial day in boston 
members of warrens group and other black dukakis supporters then 
will fan out across the south and to northern cities with large 
black populations holding rallies and meeting with black media 
organizations to discuss dukakis record warren said 
we want to get there early not wait until after june 7 or 
after the convention to sell the dukakis message and the dukakis 
record warren said 
an information package his group has put together says that 
while minorities make up 67 percent of massachusetts population 
12 percent of dukakis judicial appointments have been minorities 
and 13 percent of state workers are minorities 
this isnt some johnnycomelately that were all sitting here 
window dressing because the national press is asking where is the 
black presence around michael dukakis its always been there 
said janet langhart a former boston television personality serving 
as a dukakis media adviser

when virginia b calvin got word that her 
south bend ind elementary school had been chosen as one of the 
nations best she made good on a promise to her pupils and kissed 
the concrete steps to the building 
i told you if we won this id kiss the steps you walk on 
said the overjoyed principal of muessel school as students watched 
her fulfill the pledge 
her jubilation was shared by the principals pupils teachers 
and parents at 286 other schools across the country wednesday from 
a posh private academy in grosse pointe farms mich to a largely 
hispanic public school in chandler ariz to a chevy chase md 
school for the learning disabled 
all made the us department of educations list of exemplary 
elementary schools 
sidney i dupont headmaster ofgrosse pointe academy in 
michigan said as an independent school in a pretty sharp place 
im not really too surprised we got it 
the real question remains how close are we to no 1 added 
dupont whose school charges up to 5700 tuition and whose parents 
raised more than 500000 at the schools spring auction last 
weekend 
at frye elementary school in chandler ariz one of 230 public 
schools in the winners circle more than half the children are 
hispanic and nearly twothirds qualify for free or reducedprice 
meals because of their families low incomes but 75 percent read 
at or above grade level and their math scores are even higher 
the award shows that a school doesnt have to have a 
demographic breakdown that is mostly high socioeconomic to be 
considered an excellent school said frye principal ray polvani 
too often in this country a school is evaluated by the color of 
the kids and their ethnicity or the socioeconomics it 
shouldnt be that way 
a powersharing arrangement with fryes teachers has helped the 
school rack up achievement gains said polvani as has a very 
very effective bilingual education program 
at the hebrew academy of greater washington in silver spring 
md rabbi pinchos hecht said the award means a lot i can tell 
you until tomorrow that we really do a good job but when somebody 
from the outside says it it feels good 
the selections were made by 100 people from outside government 
only a third of them educators who reviewed more than 600 schools 
nominated by state school superintendents and the council for 
american private education 
every state except delaware and south dakota produced at least 
one winner south dakota did not nominate any school one delaware 
school failed to make the final cut 
principals and other school representatives will be invited to 
washington in the fall to receive flags of excellence 
president reagan has hosted the ceremony in past years at the white 
house 
the schools were judged by their stated philosophy and goals 
organization leadership curriculum instruction climate 
character development and community relations 
the program also gave extra attention this year to schools with 
special math and science programs 
the department honors exemplary elementary schools one year and 
secondary schools the next junior highs usually compete among the 
secondary schools

the air force has awarded two contracts 
totaling almost 329 million to develop a railcar launching system 
for the mx nuclear missile the pentagon says 
the contracts were let after defense secretary frank c carlucci 
authorized fullscale development of such a rail garrison system 
as currently configured the rail garrison system will 
consist of 50 missiles based aboard 25 trains with each carrying 
two missiles a pentagon statement said 
the mx a 10warhead 195000pound missile is now entering the 
air forces inventory as a silobased weapon president reagan has 
asked congress to allow deployment of 100 of the missiles but so 
far only 50 have been authorized 
reagan in a bid to obtain approval for the second 50 proposed 
in december 1986 that a rail version of the missile be produced to 
improve its survivability in the event of a soviet attack 
his proposal is known as rail garrison because it envisions 
placing mx missiles on rail cars that would remain inside military 
bases or garrisons until there was a threat of attack only then 
would they scatter across the country on the commercial rail 
network 
unlike the soviet union the united states currently does not 
have any mobile intercontinental missiles 
the air force contracts are for the construction and testing of 
the missilecarrying launch control and security rail cars that 
will be needed to make the 71foot missile mobile 
a 167 million contract was awarded to westinghouse electric 
corps marine division in sunnyvale calif to design develop 
and test the missile launch car 
the second contract worth 1617 million was awarded to 
rockwell international corps autonetics electronics systems 
division in anaheim calif for the design development and 
testing of the launch control system launch control car and 
security car 
both contractors will be expected to complete their work by july 
1992 the pentagon said 
the air force has said it expects each train to include two 
locomotives and six cars two missile launch cars with missiles 
inside one launch control car two security cars and one 
maintenance car 
congress has generally endorsed the idea of developing a mobile 
missile but is now locked in a debate over whether to produce a 
rail version of the mx or a much smaller singlewarhead missile 
known as the midgetman that could be fired from a truck launcher

thousands of people rallied in armenia to tell 
authorities the sentencing of an azerbaijani man does not address 
their demands that a neighboring region be annexed a dissident 
source said 
they think the problem goes deeper than sentencing guilty 
people vladimir ryabokon an editor of the dissident journal 
expresskhronika said wednesday 
ryabokon said about 15000 armenians rallied in the streets of 
yerevan the armenian capital on tuesday a day after talekh 
salekh ogli ismailov was found guilty of premeditated murder and 
given the maximum sentence of 15 years 
it was the first conviction in connection with three days of 
rioting that broke out in the azerbaijani city of sumgait on feb 
28 
ryabokon said there were no arrests by police during tuesdays 
protest 
he said a few thousand people also gathered in stepanakert the 
major city of nagornokarabakh after ismailov was sentenced to 
stress that they consider the annexation issue still not settled 
ryabokon said his information came from the weekly journals 
correspondent in yerevan 
expresskhronika has been distributing information on dissident 
activities and actions by various ethnic groups in the soviet union 
since the fall 
armenians began agitating in midfebruary for permission to 
annex the predominantly armenian nagornokarabakh region from 
neighboring azerbaijan their campaign apparently led to the riots 
thirtytwo people 26 ethnic armenians and six ethnic 
azerbaijanis were killed in the rioting 
the soviet government has refused to permit the annexation 
instead it has come up with a costly development program for 
nagornokarabakh to improve economic and social conditions

the chief chef at a popular seafood restaurant 
chain returned to the hospital where he had been a patient recently 
to perform some corrective surgery of his own in the kitchen 
as the specialist he is jeanjacques paimblanc supervised a 
wellscrubbed staff of more than 100 at beth israel hospital 
a few watched as he made an incision into a cooked fish 
perfect said paimblanc of legal sea foods restaurants 
it should taste moist but not too soft this is good 
for wednesdays lunch and dinner paimblanc and two legal sea 
food employees oversaw preparation of 1400 meals for patients and 
staff at the 460bed hospital 
it just takes a little attention to make good fresh meals 
said paimblanc hospitals serve fish sticks when they could get 
in fresh fish they serve frozen vegetables when they could buy 
presliced fresh vegetables it doesnt take much to make a much 
better meal 
the items on the menu were identical to those served at legal 
sea foods six massachusetts restaurants including the fish 
chowder included at president reagans inaugural dinner in january 
1981 
paimblanc added a newly created lowcalorie clam chowder with 
clams and vegetables 
with all the studies talking about the benefits of fish and 
fish oils on health it seems like hospitals should be talking a 
closer look at their meals paimblanc said 
well put the hospitals out of business if people keep eating 
like this 
gail deluca beth israels director of nutritional services 
said research is still ongoing on direct correlations between fish 
oils and lower incidence of cardiac problems the hospital omitted 
a reference to fish oils health benefits from the back of the 
legal sea food menu used at the hospital 
paimblanc 54 was recovering from a mild infection 18 months 
ago when he wandered into the beth israel kitchen bored by his 
meals he suggested trying his hand at preparing the hospitals 
food for a day 
on wednesday 250 pounds each of cod and tuna were baked or 
broiled under the supervision of paimblanc who wove his large 
frame through the crowded kitchen to inspect the meals 
during a break in preparing the fish and stirring the chowder 
paimblanc took time out for his own lunch 
a corned beef sandwich

gov michael s dukakis has ordered the state 
government to use recycled goods and stop buying polystyrene 
products an action that won the praise of environmentalists 
it is time for us to get away from the notion of a throwaway 
society and to do everything possible to promote use of recycled 
and recyclable products dukakis said wednesday in a statement 
that aides admitted was printed on nonrecycled paper 
the democratic presidential frontrunner signed an executive 
order to phase out the purchase of polystyrene whose production 
has been blamed for harming the earths ozone layer the order came 
one day after a canadian researcher warned that a hole in the ozone 
layer may be developing above the north pole 
earlier studies identified a seasonal hole over the south pole 
in the ozone layer which protects the earth from harmful solar 
radiation scientists have attributed the potentially damaging 
ozone loss to chemical reactions touched off by 
chlorofluorocarbons a family of chemicals used in making plastic 
foam 
the foam known as polystyrene and sold widely under the trade 
name styrofoam was the target of dukakis order under its terms 
the state purchasing agent was told to immediately stop buying 
disposable polystyrene products manufactured with 
chlorofluorocarbons 
as of june 1 the state will stop buying polystyrene products 
that are not made from recycled materials state officials said 
recycled plastic foam is not considered a threat to ozone 
dukakis also ordered the state purchasing agent to expand 
purchases of recycled paper recycled aluminum and recycled 
lowgrade plastic products such as trash bags 
in addition the state will begin using composted soil 
supplements in parks and roadsides wherever compost is available 
and appropriate 
what we have here is another example of how economic growth 
can be combined with a commitment to the environment and high 
standards of environmental protection dukakis told reporters at 
a statehouse news conference 
on monday dukakis won praise from environmentalists by joining 
rep gerry studds dmass in calling for an expanded moratorium 
on exploratory oil drilling off the new england coast 
on wednesday dukakis said his goal was to boost the recycling 
industry by expanding the supply of recyclable materials and the 
market for recycled products aides said the states purchases of 
paper aluminum and plastic amount to millions of dollars annually 
according to the governors staff the state will incur a 
slightly higher cost for purchases of recycled paper and an 
increase of 5 percent or more on recycled aluminum 
new york and vermont earlier banned state purchases of 
polystyrene and 11 states have programs to encourage government 
purchase of recycled materials according to massachusetts 
environmental officials 
minnesota lawmakers recently banned the manufacture and sale of 
foam products made with chlorofluorocarbons in the state starting 
in 1990 but the packaging industry views the law as symbolic since 
no such products are made in minnesota 
judy shope of the environmental lobby of massachusetts said 
the new policy puts massachusetts in the forefront of recycling and 
noted that the us environmental protection agency has yet to 
adopt a similar requirement 
who knows maybe next year that will change she said 
referring to dukakis presidential campaign

the british may have to discard their cherished 
good manners to combat littering the chairman of the tidy britain 
group said 
im beginning to think weve been nice about it for a little 
bit too long lord parry told a conference wednesday sponsored by 
the antilitter organization 
parry called for tougher enforcement of antilittering laws the 
law permits fines of more than 700 for littering but in 1986 the 
average fine imposed was less than 60 
parry also suggested hiring wardens to ticket litterers much 
like meter maids ticket parking violators and producing a black 
book illustrating a communitys litterers or even awarding a 
booby prize to the worst 
a major soccer match can pile up 5 tons of garbage in and around 
a stadium and on an average week commuters leave 25 tons of 
rubbish behind in the london underground subway system said graham

the leftist sandinista government and 
the rebels have tentatively agreed to hold a third round of talks 
in hopes of securing a lasting peace the government announced 
a communique issued wednesday night said the ussupported 
rebels known as contras have agreed to a government proposal to 
hold the talks may 2528 at an as yet undetermined location 
the agreement was reached at meetings tuesday and wednesday 
between deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco and azucena 
ferrey one of the five directors of the nicaraguan resistance 
the meeting was held in miami where the contras are based 
according to the communique the sandinistas proposed that the 
third meeting be held in managua as the previous two had been but 
the contras appeared reluctant and delayed the decision on a site 
rebel leaders had complained that the sandinistas restricted 
their delegates to a hotel during the previous two meetings 
refusing to allow them to meet with domestic opposition political 
leaders 
on march 23 the two sides signed a preliminary peace accord in 
the southern border post of sapoa and a ceasefire that ends may 30 
took effect 
during the truce the belligerents were to meet in managua and 
try to end the civil war that began in 1982 and has claimed more 
than 26500 lives 
since the sapoa accords the two sides have delineated seven 
ceasefire zones into which the rebels are to move but they remain 
far apart on issues of democratic reforms and what role contra 
leaders will be permitted to assume in nicaraguas political future 
until those issues are settled the contras say their fighters 
will not enter the ceasefire zones and lay down their weapons 
if peace talks do not resume by june 1 the sandinistas have 
threatened to mount an allout offensive to try to wipe out the 
rebels

jesse jackson was campaigning in 
californias agricultural heartland today sounding environmental 
and farming themes as he searched for votes in the june 7 primary 
at a stop in fresno wednesday night jackson suggested that past 
comments by irresponsible public leaders could have helped set 
the stage for an alleged assassination plot against him 
a st louis couple londell and tammy williams were charged 
this week with conspiring to kill jackson according to court 
papers londell williams told an informant he was a white 
supremacist but investigators said they had not found evidence 
linking him to any organized white supremacist group 
jackson suggested that racial hatred could have been fueled by 
statements made during last months raucous primary campaign in new 
york new york city mayor ed koch criticized jackson harshly and at 
one point said jews would be crazy to vote for him 
the climate for this kind of antagonism and violence of 
course has been set by many irresponsible public leaders whose 
attacks based on race have set a divisive and dangerous climate 
such as the onein new york in april for example jackson told 
reporters 
however jackson vowed not to lower the tone of my campaign 
adding i will keep dreaming 
londell williams in an interview published today in the 
belleville ill newsdemocrat said i did not conspire with 
anyone to kill any presidential candidate especially jesse 
jackson 
im sorry that this mess has been brought up he said 
this is a very bad mistake im really sorry the man jackson 
has to hear anything like this the man should not be afraid of 
anything from me i could care less if hes elected president or 
not 
jackson whose relations with the jewish community have been 
strained in the past met wednesday with some three dozen rabbis 
and jewish leaders 
jackson was beginning the day today in bakersfield with stops 
set later in san francisco 
jackson received a warm welcome at fresnos saroyan theater from 
a crowd of about 3000 including toddler jonathon clark last 
year jackson taped a public service announcement to appeal for a 
new liver for the boy then 10 months old who needed the 
transplant to survive the child received the donor liver last may 
and will celebrate his second birthday next month 
jackson hoisted the boy in his arms during the speech and told 
the crowd of the challenge to save our children by putting a 
higher priority on education and social programs 
after the rally jackson reiterated his support for the united 
farm workers boycott on table grapes and questioned about

requires commitments and enforcement

environmental and worker safety laws as scandalous

a top general said in a rare interview 
that taiwans military could repel an invasion from communist china 
hau peitsun chief of the general staff said in the interview 
with the global views monthly magazine that taiwan was building up 
its defenses to deter an invasion from communist china which 
maintains this island off its coast is a renegade province 
hau was quoted as saying that there has always been the threat 
of a communist chinese armed invasion against taiwan although 
beijing might hesitate to launch such an attack because of negative 
international reaction 
but from the military standpoint alone we still have chances 
of winning hau was quoted as saying in the edition of the 
magazine published sunday it said the interview was the generals 
first with the media 
despite chinas large amount of military equipment taiwan can 
win by the quality of not only our defense equipment but our 
troops he was quoted as saying the united states has been 
taiwans main weapons supplier 
although communist china has roughly 3 million troops while 
taiwan has fewer than a half million hau told the magazine that 
china could not bring into play all its forces against the island 
the room for battling is very small in taiwan he was quoted as 
saying they cannot fly thousands of aircraft nor can they send 
millions of troops here at the same time 
the nationalist government based in taiwan claims to be the 
rightful ruler of all china although it lost a civil war to the 
communists in 1949 beijing has refused to rule out using force to 
reunify with taiwan but tension has eased as unofficial contacts 
have increased in recent years

if youve got a big brain a yen for the indoors 
and little love of glamour or rawboned rigor then america has just 
the right job for you according to the publishers of the jobs 
rated almanac 
ranked as the best of 250 american jobs is a career few children 
are likely to have heard of much less name an actuary next are 
computer programmer computer systems analyst mathematician and 
statistician 
typical more glamorous childrens career choices like being a 
dancer doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanacs 
overall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in at 
least one of the six ranking criteria 
according to the almanac published this month by american 
references inc of chicago the worst job listed in the ranking was 
migrant worker which rated near or at the bottom in all six of the 
criteria 
the second worst commercial fishing also was ranked low 
because of long hours seasonal work high government regulation 
and tough physical demands that was followed by construction 
worker roofer seaman dairy farmer roustabout lumberjack 
cowboy and professional football player 
almanac editor and publisher les krantz identified the criteria 
used to judge jobs as salary stress work environment outlook 
security and physical demands 
most of the best paying jobs are performed in highly 
competitive and physically confining environments for long hours 
krantz said dont expect a cushy job if you want to earn more 
than 50000 a year 
but ultimately he added the job best for an individual is 
the one the person likes the best and that depends a lot on 
someones priorities 
astronauts have the worst working environment with surgeons 
second the book concluded firefighters have the longest work 
weeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physically 
demanding it said 
but actuaries who interpret statistics to determine expected 
personal losses due to sickness or disability and material losses 
from disasters did well in all six categories 
a 23year old actuary in training mike vaughan said he agreed 
with the assessment 
once the training exams are over id say the stress would 
be pretty much nonexistent and the job market is so open i could 
just walk out and find a new job in a day he said 
vaughan who works for allstate insurance co in suburban 
northbrook said his 31000 annual salary was probably 20 to 25 
percent higher than any other job i could have gotten and it goes 
up faster 
william hermes a fisherman for 47 years said he wasnt 
bothered by his jobs low ranking and couldnt imagine making a 
living any other way 
its the only job ive ever wanted said hermes 62 owner 
of big bay denoc fisheries in garden mich youre out in the 
open youre your own boss and you dont have to answer to nobody 
krantz said most of the information for the almanac comes from 
the us bureau of labor statistics the department of commerce and 
the census bureau but tracking down some statistics like a 
cowboys wages took some legwork 
we literally called cattle ranches and they told us well if 
you have a good horse you can make about 150 a week he said

defense secretary frank c carlucci pointing 
to the need to reduce the federal deficit says he supports 
congressional attempts to close unneeded military bases 
it makes sense to look seriously now at closing bases because 
our military force structure is being reduced and growth in the 
defense budget is being slowed carlucci told a house 
subcommittee on wednesday 
we must stop spending money to operate bases we do not need 
he said our increasingly scarce resources simply must be applied 
to higher defense priorities so that we do not jeopardize 
americas national security interests 
carlucci was testifying in support of a plan designed to 
surmount the strong reluctance of congress to allow military bases 
to be closed 
it calls for creation of a pentagon commission to review bases 
by dec 31 and recommend a list of which can be closed carlucci 
would then have 15 days to accept or reject the entire list his 
decision would be made less than a week before the end of president 
reagans term in office 
the pentagon estimates 2 billion to 5 billion could be saved 
by closing the unneeded bases

a mob of neighbors chased down and apprehended a 
man accused of breaking into a home and raping a 7yearold girl in 
front of her 5yearold sister authorities say 
one of the neighbors said later that if they had known why they 
were chasing the man they might have killed him 
the man a parolee who was once accused of making a telephone 
threat against the life of president reagan was chased for about 
four blocks by about eight people surrounded and held until police 
arrived officers said 
i think we basically got there before anybody had a chance to 
lay into him said sgt bill staney of the juvenile division 
charles franklin ireland 42 was being held in the harris 
county jail today in lieu of 20000 bond on charges of burglary 
and aggravated sexual assault of a child 
ireland is accused of climbing through a window of a house late 
tuesday and sexually assaulting the girl in her bedroom staney 
said her 5yearold sister was in the room and saw the attack he 
added 
the victim was released wednesday from ben taub hospital 
the girls were alone in the house while their mother worked at 
her eveningshift job staney said she normally had a babysitter 
stay with the girls but she told police she had no money to pay 
the sitter this week and left them at home with a padlock on the 
front door he said 
the girls father does not live with the family staney said 
neighbors saw ireland climbing back out the window and heard the 
girls frantically screaming staney said 
its a mostly hispanic neighborhood so when the neighbors saw 
this big white guy coming out the window they knew he didnt 
belong there he said 
ireland did not resist and was not harmed by the neighbors 
staney said 
guadalupe ramirez one of the people who chased the man said 
they heard someone yelling and ran toward the house 
we were behind him there were about eight of us ramirez 
said 
we were trying to catch him but we really didnt know exactly 
why ramirez 43 said if we had known what had happened he 
might have died 
ramirez said ireland started crying after he was caught 
he just started crying crying like a baby ramirez said 
ireland a welder told police he didnt remember assaulting the 
girl staney said 
ireland was charged in august 1984 after calling the local us 
secret service and fbi offices from a houston telephone booth and 
making a threat against reagan police said 
agents said his threat stemmed from a belief that reagan was 
sending money to africa instead of helping people in this country 
staney said ireland also was paroled from the texas department 
of corrections in october 1982 after serving about five months of a 
twoyear sentence for auto theft

ousted gov evan mecham whose criminal 
trial was scheduled to begin today has been barred from speaking 
at brigham young university because of questions about his honesty 
we havent decided that evan mecham is guilty but now is not 
the appropriate time for him to appear on campus said brent 
harker a spokesman for the university thats operated by the 
mormon church 
mecham who is a mormon had been scheduled to speak at the 
provo utah campus on may 26 or 27 in an appearance sponsored by 
campus republicans a student group 
we do not allow to speak on campus people who are not worthy 
examples said brad hanesworth a communications professor and 
the groups faculty adviser i thought it was clear that he did 
not meet the criteria on which speakers may appear at byu 
it wasnt an effort to say heres governor mecham hes a 
great guy and the people of arizona treated him unfairly it was 
an effort to say governor mecham heres a chance to explain 
yourself and give one side of the issue said joe woodwell 
president of the campus republicans 
school policy says that in order to appear at byu a speaker 
must not in his or her personal life as reflected in the news 
media and common understanding of the public have committed acts 
of immorality dishonesty or other conduct that would make it 
inappropriate for the church education system to feature him or her 
as a speaker 
his or her life and advice should make an appropriate model 
for students in an educational system with our ideals 
mecham a republican said wednesday he is not upset by the 
decision barring him from speaking on the campus 
i dont get too upset about anything mecham said it was 
just a group of young republicans who wanted me to speak if they 
have a policy they have a policy and i wont speak 
harker said one reason for not permitting mecham to appear is 
that he is under indictment and his trial on charges that he 
concealed a 350000 campaign contribution was about to begin 
when a person is involved in a court case if he comes to 
speak that would imply an endorsement by the university harker 
said people would say oh hes speaking at byu they must 
think hes ok

jesse jackson commenting wednesday on the arrest of a st louis 
couple charged with plotting to kill him the climate for this 
kind of antagonism and violence of course has been set by many 
irresponsible public leaders whose attacks based on race have set 
a divisive and dangerous climate such as the one in new york 
in april for example 
 
george bush declaring he wont negotiate with drug dealers 
drug dealers are domestic terrorists killing kids and cops and 
they should be treated as such i wont bargain with terrorists and 
i wont bargain with drug dealers either whether they are on us 
or foreign soil 
 
michael dukakis on jesse jacksons claim that the super 
delegate system has unfairly favored dukakis i think jesse has 
a perfect right to voice criticism of whatever he chooses to 
criticize i dont think we are going to have a fight with mr

a federal judge set bond at 1 million 
for a puerto rican nationalist who is accused of helping mastermind 
a 7 million wells fargo robbery and has been held without trial 
for a record 32 months 
us district judge t emmet clarie acting under a federal 
appeals court order set the bond wednesday for filberto ojeda rios 
under last weeks order by the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals ojeda must be released by 5 pm friday 
clarie had denied bond for ojeda five times before at the 
request of authorities who sayd ojeda is a cuban agent and would 
flee the country before trial 
it 32 months detention is not a record i am proud of 
ojeda said in a telephone interview wednesday night from a federal 
detention center to tell you the truth id rather have the 
record for the shortest 
he said he considers his imminent freedom only a partial 
liberation it could only be total liberation if i was in my 
home and my country was free 
ojeda is accused of helping plan the september 1983 robbery of a 
wells fargo depot in west hartford to finance los macheteros 
spanish for the machete wielders a violent group seeking 
puerto rican independence 
clarie rejected a prosecution request that he set bond at 25 
million but imposed sharp restrictions on ojedas movements once 
he is released 
ojeda must wear an electronic bracelet that will tell 
authorities where he is must live in hartford and will be able to 
move around the city only between 7 am and 8 pm 
clarie rejected the governments request that ojeda be confined 
to a defense attorneys home and a defense request that he be 
allowed to return to puerto rico to convalesce from triplebypass 
heart surgery april 11 
defense attorney richard j harvey called claries ruling a 
clear defeat for the government 
as long as justice is done the government never loses said 
us attorney stanley a twardy jr 
twardy said that despite the 1 million bond he still does not 
believe ojeda will appear in court 
if i thought this was enough i would have done this three 
years ago the prosecutor said 
ojeda who is in his mid50s has been in pretrial detention 
since his august 1985 arrest in luquillo puerto rico 
he had been held under the bail reform act of 1984 which allows 
federal judges to deny bond to dangerous suspects however the 
appeals court ruled that further detention would violate ojedas 
constitutional rights 
the 15 other wells fargo defendants are free on bonds of up to 
15 million

the sikh elders who manage the golden 
temple were called into session today to discuss reopening the 
goldendomed shrine where a 10day police siege ended with the 
surrender of militant sikh separatists 
the 400yearold temple sikhisms holiest shrine had become a 
base for extremists waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an 
independent sikh homeland in punjab state 
fortyfive men and one woman walked out of the temple on 
wednesday their hands in the air or clasped on their heads and 
surrendered to the 2800 policemen commandos and paramilitary 
troops surrounding it 
at least 42 people mostly militant sikhs were killed during 
the siege four other militants committed suicide rather than 
surrender 
bhan singh secretary of the sikh elders committee that runs 
the temple told reporters late wednesday night that it would today 
discuss how to restore daily religious rites at the shrine 
a curfew remained in effect today within 300 yards of the 
complexs walls and municipal workers began cleaning its dining 
hall hostels and offices 
despite the governments success in ending the siege its 
authority is still challenged by continuing sikh attacks elsewhere 
in punjab state 
the united news of india said today that 13 more people were 
killed during the night around the northern state in attacks by 
sikh extremists who killed at least 99 people in punjab while the 
siege was under way 
at least 40 people were killed tuesday and wednesday including 
more than 30 migrant hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at 
a camp near the state capital of chandigarh a note found near the 
laborers bodies said the killings were to avenge the golden temple 
siege 
so far this year at least 1076 killings in the state have been 
blamed on sikh gunmen in all of 1987 the militants killed about 
1030 people in punjab 
sikh militants say they need a separate homeland to preserve 
their faith and combat what they call discrimination by indias 
hindu majority 
sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam comprise less than 2 percent of 
indias 800 million people but are a majority in punjab 
the temple siege began may 9 after sikh gunmen fired from inside 
the complex at a party of police commanders who were on an 
inspection tour outside its walls five of the officers were 
wounded 
eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated the 
following day and security forces proceeded to fire hundreds of 
rounds at the temple complexs office and residential buildings 
they were however under orders not to hit the temple itself 
on sunday 146 people including a number of wanted sikh 
extremists surrendered during a ceasefire the last of the 
hardcore militants gave up on wednesday 
sidharth shankar ray the governor of punjab called it a day 
of great relief but added it is neither victory nor defeat 
he urged sikh gunmen throughout punjab to turn themselves in and 
pledged to restore religious rites at the temple as soon as 
possible 
the siege was the largest show of force at the temple since june 
1984 when prime minister indira gandhi had the army storm the 
complex to oust armed sikhs more than 1200 people mostly sikhs 
died in the onslaught 
many sikhs considered the raid the worst sort of desecration 
and it was avenged less than five months later when mrs gandhi was 
assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards 
mrs gandhis son and successor as prime minister rajiv gandhi 
said on wednesday that the carrying of arms in the temple should be 
banned 
he also told reporters in new delhi that he thought most of 
indias sikh community had supported the siege

soviet officials today reluctantly allowed 
japanese investigators to search a portion of a soviet passenger 
ship to determine what caused a fire that killed at least 11 people 
and injured 35 
after 70 minutes of heated negotiations with soviet consular 
officials police agreed to pare down to 15 a team originally 
consisting of more than 60 investigators 
police also gave in to soviet demands that the probe be limited 
to the passenger cabins of the 4870ton priamurye gutted by a 
fire on wednesday 
all of the 129 crew members and 295 passengers listed in the 
ships registers were soviet nationals and all of the dead were 
passengers 
i have no idea why they the soviets demanded this and i 
dont really understand what the problem is with them said 
yoshihide yasuda a police official in charge of the investigation 
but the fact remains that our investigations are limited 
and may not be carried out as expected yasuda said at a news 
briefing 
earlier yasuda said police and firefighters had been through 
the gutted ship in a preliminary probe but the soviets asked them 
not to enter the engine room police had said the fire was 
discovered in an area above the engine room 
it took 18 hours for firefighters to put out the blaze aboard 
the priamurye which was blackened and listing at dock in this port 
city of western japan the investigative team clad in boots and 
overalls and equipped with cameras and flashlights entered the 
ship at 1043 am 
yasuda said the 10 police three fire department and two 
maritime agency specialists will concentrate on a cluster of cabins 
on the second deck one level below the main deck where nine of 
the 11 bodies were found 
maritime official norimasa watanabe in charge of emergency 
measures said earlier that a cigarette or faulty lighting could 
have started the fire which gutted most of the 85cabin ship 
registered in vladivostok ussr 
osaka fire department officials contacted by telephone said 15 
of the original 35 injured in the fire remained hospitalized this 
afternoon 
yasuda described as uncooperative the attitude of both 
soviet consulate officials and ship captain aleksandr yerastov he 
said there was little likelihood that investigations could be 
completed prior to the arrival of a soviet vessel to take back 
survivors 
soviet crew members including about 50 who had remained on 
board the ship overnight despite police objections began loading 
food and beverage supplies to prepare to pull out as early as 
friday officials at the site said 
the piramurye pulled into osaka port tuesday after calling on 
otaru hokkaido may 8 and tokyo may 12 the vessel was to leave for 
hiroshima tonight 
maritime officials said the passengers many of them in their 
20s and early 30s were visiting japan for sightseeing purposes as 
part of the sputnik youth group tour organized by the soviet 
communist youth league

indicted on charges of taking bribes for trying to influence meese 
meese has not been indicted in the wedtech case 
the defense has been trying to show that biaggis role in 
helping wedtech win nobid government contracts was insignificant 
compared to wedtechs ties to the reagan administration 
neuberger the third wedtech executive to testify backed up 
earlier testimony that wedtech paid 300000 to help defray 
wallachs costs in defending meese during his 1985 confirmation 
hearings 
larossa asked neuberger if wallach asked for the 300000 to 
assist in the defense of his friend ed meese during the 
confirmation hearings 
oh yes neuberger said at that time yes he said to me 
its clear that he hasnt got any income now because he is involved 
in the defense of mr meese and he needs help for that reason so 
if wed pay his expenses which are very high in washington 
larossa asked neuberger whether it was your belief that you 
were paying 300000 to mr wallach and in effect wedtech was 
paying for meeses legal representation 
replied neuberger that was my thought

author sidney sheldon sued columbia pictures 
and spellinggoldberg productions claiming they owe him 14 
million in compensation for creating the television series hart 
to hart 
sheldon said in his superior court lawsuit wednesday that he 
gave spellinggoldberg the right in 1973 to use certain material 
which resulted in the creation of the program about a globetrotting 
husbandandwife detective team 
the rights later were transferred to columbia 
the suit says sheldon was to get 15 percent of the producers 
net profit but several improper charges such as excessive studio 
overhead were billed to the production sheldon was told the 
series had not produced a net profit until this year 
sheldon said a 1988 accounting showed the series grossed 1789 
million 
hart to hart which starred robert wagner and stefanie 
powers ran from 19791984 on abctv 
the lawsuit seeks 14 million in compensatory damages and 
unspecified punitive damages 
an afterhours call seeking comment from columbia pictures was 
answered by a recording saying the switchboard had been shut down 
there was no los angeles area listing for spellinggoldberg 
productions 
sheldon is the bestselling author of such books as windmills 
of the gods a rage of angels and the other side of

signs of renewed vigor in the us economy are 
likely to play a role in determining the outcome of the november 
presidential election treasury secretary james a baker said today 
my rosy predictions wont decide the election if they come 
true they might have some impact baker told a breakfast meeting 
with reporters 
he said the reagan administration was sticking to a forecast 
that the economy would expand by 24 percent this year and that 
inflation would hold near the current level of 4 percent 
in our view at least there is not going to be a resurgence of 
inflation baker said the economy is a major factor in any 
election particularly in a presidential election people tend to 
vote their pocketbooks 
we have no reason to suspect or expect that the economy is not 
going to perform reasonably well 
baker was in paris for two days of talks with trade and finance 
ministers from leading industrial countries 
some european officials expressed concern on wednesday that us 
consumer demand was growing too fast raising the risk of a revival 
of worldwide inflation baker said he rejected this view 
baker also said he had no immediate plans to leave his post to 
manage the fall election campaign of vice president george bush 
who has virtually locked up the republican nomination 
for now im staying at the treasury department he said 
what i do in the future of course is a matter for the vice 
president and the president

iranian speedboats attacked a norwegian 
tanker twice in the strait of hormuz today firing rocketpropelled 
grenades that set the vessel afire and injured one crewman 
shipping executives said 
the 55173ton berge strand an empty liquefied petroleum gas 
carrier sailing to saudi arabian ports was the second vessel 
attacked by iran in the persian gulf in the last two days 
iranian speedboats raided the japaneseowned ace chemi on 
wednesday following iraqi attacks on iranian terminals and tankers 
the shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the berge strand was damaged slightly in the first attack by 
two speedboats at 630 am 1030 pm edt wednesday they did 
not know what weapons were used in the first strike but said no 
injuries were reported 
an hour later one of the speedboats caught up with the berge 
strand and pumped five rocketpropelled grenades into its 
accommodation quarters then veered away the sources said 
a small fire broke out and flying shrapnel injured one of the 19 
crew members in the face and forearm the sources said the crew 
believed to be norwegian put out the fire 
an omani warship on patrol rushed to help the vessel and took 
the injured sailor to a hospital in oman they said his condition 
was not serious they added 
the berge strand headed to the southern gulf port of dubai 
where the ace chemi is docked for repairs 
the us central command meanwhile said the navys 32nd convoy 
of the year was sailing south through the gulf it included one 
usflagged kuwaiti tanker the 46723ton gas prince escorted by 
the missile frigate copeland 
a fire on the 6730ton ace chemi forced its japanese captain 
and 16 south korean crewmen to abandon ship all were reported 
rescued by salvage tugs 
the raid on the chemical tanker was the first by iran since the 
united states implemented a new policy may 3 that permits us navy 
ships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels on request 
regardless of the flag they are flying 
us ships were unable to respond to the ace chemi raid because 
the closest us navy vessel was 60 miles away a twohour sail 
said us navy sources 
the attacks on the japanese and norwegian ships occurred about 
11 miles south of irans offshore larak oil terminal where iraqi 
warplanes on saturday devastated the worlds largest tanker the 
564739ton seawise giant and four other ships 
the unofficial death toll stood at 34 after iraqi f1 mirage 
jets streaked into larak following a 750mile run down the gulf 
the seawise giant chartered by iran as a storage ship had been 
unloading oil to the spanish ship barcelona at larak tankers pick 
up oil brought down the gulf by irans fleet of shuttle tankers 
baghdad has claimed a dozen raids six of which were 
independently verified on iranian tankers and terminals since 
april 29 the raids seek to strangle oil exports that support 
tehrans side of the 7yearold gulf war 
iranian officials recently declared that their policy of 
blowforblow retaliatory attacks on neutral shipping would 
continue but wednesdays was the first since april 24 
about 350 seamen have been killed and hundreds of others injured 
in attacks on more than 500 vessels in gulf waterways in the 
spillover of the iraniraq land war which began in september 1980 
in the ground war irans official islamic republic news agency 
said iranian forces killed or wounded 2000 iraqi troops and 
captured more than 10 square miles of northeast iraq in an

united nations said today he will talk with syrian officials in 
damascus to try to help secure the release of nine americans held 
hostage in lebanon 
walters who leaves friday for the syrian capital would not 
give details of his plans when it comes to the hostages the 
less you talk about what you plan to do the more you get done he 
said 
walters said his visit to damascus was prompted by a concern for 
the safety of the hostages because fighting between rival shiite 
moslem factions has escalated in the southern suburbs of beirut 
where the captives are believed held 
of course were concerned about the safety of the hostages 
walters said in an interview were concerned about their safety 
all the time we think about them all the time 
fighting has been raging between the prosyrian amal militia and 
the proiranian hezbollah since may 6 in the 16squaremile slums 
of south beirut 
most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon are believed to be 
held by hezbollahbacked shiite zealots

armored vehicles on the edges of south beirut syrian officers have 
said the army is prepared to move in to stop the fighting

the earth will only be able to support its 
population in the coming century if all countries cooperate to 
reverse environmental destruction and control population growth an 
annual un report said 
the 1988 state of world population report released in london on 
wednesday says increasing human demands and population are 
damaging the natural resources on which all life depends 
the report says world population now at more than 5 billion is 
expected to reach 61 billion by the year 2000 
all countries must face the fact that the combination of 
population and industrial growth could destroy the land water and 
air on which everything else depends dr nafis sadik executive 
director of the united nations population fund told a news 
conference 
the pakistani physician expressed hope that action by 
governments individuals and international organizations to curb 
population growth and encourage conservation will safeguard the 
future of our planet 
but population and resources could become more seriously out 
of balance unless we do something about it today she said 
every year the world adds a nation the size of mexico to the 
population about 80 million people with nearly all the growth 
occurring in developing countries in africa asia and latin america 
that are least able to absorb it the report says 
it says that though most developing countries are trying to 
reduce population growth their needs are increasing and their 
attempts to find new land and increase food production are 
destroying the environment rapidly 
there is urgent need for action in the poorest areas the 
scissors effect of poverty and increasing population is slicing 
away at their ability to sustain human life 
the report encourages slower growth and more even distribution 
of population to take pressure off agricultural land forests and 
water and energy sources 
tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a 
year topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year 
about 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year and 
about half the worlds irrigated land is in danger it says 
by the end of the century half the world will be living in 
urban areas and onefifth of the urban population will live in 
megacities of 4 million or more the report says 
it says population growth will not stop for perhaps another 
century when world population may be over 10 billion twice its 
present level 
part of this dramatic rise in numbers is the result of 
widespread improvements in basic health care which have contributed 
to lower infant mortality and longer life spans but the very 
success of these interventions now threatens the future

education health services and jobs

population 42 percent of africas and 37 percent of asias will be 
urban dwellers the report adds 
the number of people living in cities of over 1 million also has 
grown rapidly 
in 1940 one in 100 cities topped a million in 1980 one in 10 
cities contained more than a million people and in highly urbanized 
latin america the present ratio is one in four the report says 
eleven of the worlds 13 most populous cities will be in the 
developing world by the end of century compared with eight now it 
adds 
the 13 largest metropolitan areas in 1985 were tokyo 188 
million mexico city 173 sao paulo brazil 159 new york

the supreme court today overruled the nations 
rabbis and upheld the appointment of the first woman to a religious 
council in israel 
the councils chairman in the southern town of yeroham condemned 
the decision and threatened to resign if he is forced to implement 
it 
the ruling of the threejustice panel marked an unusual 
intervention of secular courts in religious matters and followed a 
twoyear battle by leah shakdiel 36 who was prevented by rabbis 
from accepting the appointment to her hometown council 
the justices who included a woman miriam benporat ordered 
mrs shakdiel appointed to the council within 30 days saying the 
rabbis action was based on considerations that are extraneous 
to israeli law 
reacting to the ruling an elated mrs shakdiel told reporters 
at the court i think this is a very big achievement for israel 
for religious zionists and for women in israel 
mrs shakdiel appealed to the court after orthodox rabbis in 
yeroham a town of 6000 refused to let her sit on the council 
she was chosen for the position in march 1986 by leftleaning labor 
party city councilors 
most jewish communities in israel have religious councils that 
administer synagogues ritual baths and other religious affairs 
the council members are chosen by local municipalities and are 
usually symbolically approved by the rabbis 
but in yeroham the rabbis blocked mrs shakdiels appointment 
on the grounds that orthodox tradition bars women from taking an 
active role in public religious affairs such as leading prayers or 
interpreting laws 
the orthodox rabbis have a monopoly on jewish affairs in israel 
and sole authority to minister rituals such as marriages and 
divorces 
moshe peretz a rabbi who heads yerohams religious council 
responded with anger to the court ruling 
the supreme court cannot force us to sit with a woman on the 
council if the religious affairs minister forces us then i will 
resign peretz said in an interview with army radio 
peretz also criticized the court for intervening in religious 
matters 
i dont force the justices to wear yarmulkas religious skull 
caps so they cant force me to sit with a woman on my council

the editor of a wellknown soviet dissident 
journal said police held him for a week and seized the computer and 
printer he uses to produce the magazine as well as its archives 
kgb security police even took all the pictures off the 
walls sergei i grigoryants told reporters in his moscow 
apartment on wednesday 
the editor said that his arrest and detention show that mikhail 
s gorbachevs promised reforms have not ended civil rights 
violations by the state security apparatus 
the former political prisoner was arrested may 9 with four other 
people at a small country house he uses to produce his 11monthold 
unofficial magazine named glasnost after gorbachevs policies of 
more openness in society 
grigoryants a literary expert said the officers had no arrest 
or search warrants and a judge convicted him of malicous 
disobedience of a police officer and sentenced him to seven days 
in jail without a proper trial 
it is a result of the demonstrably sharp deterioration in the 
situation in the country of peoples rights he said 
the actions show that gorbachevs drive for democratization of 
soviet society and openness has not meant more tolerance of 
dissent grigoryants said 
grigoryants was released from jail on monday and the following 
day tried to visit the house in the village of kratkovo 25 miles 
southeast of moscow 
police sealed off the house and prevented him from entering 
saying he must prove to a prosecutor he has the right to live there 
and that his property wont be returned until he shows evidence it 
belongs to him 
grigoryants said however that a prosecutor told him the matter 
should be taken up with the militia its not even clear to whom 
to turn he said 
the editors of glasnost hope to continue publishing but they 
are having trouble getting needed equipment and offices 
glasnost was the first privately controlled periodical to be 
published openly in the soviet union past dissident magazines had 
been published clandestinely and many of their publishers were 
arrested 
grigoryants was sentenced in 1983 to 10 years in prison for 
writing for an underground bulletin on human rights he was 
pardoned in february 1987 
his arrest may 9 came hours before a group seeking to found a 
political party called the democratic union planned to meet in his 
offices 
the group met instead at a nearby club to form the party which 
seeks to challenge the communist partys political monopoly 
the weekly newspaper moscow news has accused the democratic 
union of seeking to replace socialism with capitalism and called 
its members convinced enemies of our system the political and 
economic system of the soviet union 
the democratic union calls for multiparty parliamentary 
democracy independent trade unions a new constitution and the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern europe and areas of the 
soviet union seized in world war ii

a new expedition led by the 
first man to conquer mount mckinley alone in winter ended less than 
1000 feet from the top when one climber apparently froze to death 
and three others suffered hypothermia 
lynn salerno 31 died early wednesday at the 19500foot level 
of north americas highest peak the national park service said 
two other members of the nineperson expedition were evacuated by 
helicopter 
we had a beautiful experience turn into a nightmare one 
exhausted climber leonard kelly said as he clutched a hot cup of 
tea at denali medical camp at the 14000foot level of mount 
mckinley 
its unbelievable that one minute you can be on top of the 
world and in the next minute under it kelly said 
the expedition which began about may 1 was led by veteran 
guide vern tejas who last march became the first mountaineer to 
survive a winter climb to mckinleys 20320foot summit 
according to accounts from expedition members tejas called a 
conference at about 8 pm tuesday after nearly 10 hours on the 
trail they were still more than 1000 feet below the summit 
tejas warned that the approaching night would be bitterly cold 
he told them to make individual decisions on whether to continue 
kelly at 57 the oldest member of the party said he had 
intestinal cramps and decided to turn back with another man dave 
burns tejas sent assistant guide john swider to accompany them to 
the 17200foot camp the others led by tejas went on 
before the trio reached the haven swider fell on the steep 
rocky terrain he was saved from certain death only when kelly 
secured them using an ice ax 
we all ended up in kind of a blob hanging on looking at each 
other because the next step was really kind of a big one like a 
couple of thousand feet right off the ridge going straight down 
kelly said 
other climbers saw the fall and went to the rescue 
swider who had head lacerations and a back injury and kelly 
were helped back to camp where they spent a long night worrying 
about their companions 
the others had it even worse 
some 500 feet below the summit lynn salerno began acting 
irrationally 
it remains unclear whether she was ailing from hypothermia or 
some sort of altitude sickness but she grew increasingly cold and 
unresponsive the climbers said 
while others worked desperately to warm her tejas tried to dig 
a snow shelter in the icy rocky terrain but in a matter of 
minutes she was dead 
she was such a strong supporter of verns kelly said she 
was practically on the trip because of him after hearing him 
describe his mountain experiences at a talk in anchorage 
kelly was assisted down the mountain wednesday evening by other 
climbers he was treated for three frostbitten toes 
swider and mike moss 50 of minnesota who had severely 
frostbitten feet were flown off the mountain to a hospital in 
anchorage 
tejas remained with the rest of the expedition at 17200 feet 
two reportedly were recovering well from hypothermia 
i felt like we had the best guide in the world kelly said 
he did everything in the world a human being could be expected to 
do in a dangerous occupation like this

the president of middlebury college 
suspended a fraternity for hanging a battered female mannequin 
splattered with red paint from a balcony during a toga party 
earlier this month 
college president olin robison on wednesday accepted the 
recommendation of the schools community council to ban the delta 
upsilon fraternity from living in its house next year or 
functioning as a social organization 
members of delta upsilon also must participate in a sexism 
awareness course said college spokesman ron nief 
the fraternity was deluged with criticism last week after 
several students complained about the mannequin used as a 
decoration at the party 
the mannequins breasts were mutilated and splattered with red 
paint and its head and face were bashed in according to a letter 
of complaint seven students wrote to robison 
the action was characterized as being sexist and insensitive to 
violent crimes against women 
in a statement robison said it is at just such times as this 
that we recognize how very much our community depends upon a shared 
acknowledgement of the limits of permissable behavior 
our very survival as a community of learning requires both a 
generous amount of tolerance and a concomitant willingness to 
insist that there is a point beyond which our tolerance cannot 
and must not be stretched robison said this recent episode 
has defined and defined appropriately such a limit 
the fraternity called the councils decision too severe 
jennifer weiss one of the students who complained said she was 
pleased that a sexism awareness program would result from the 
complaint 
after the end of the school year the council will decide 
whether the fraternity should be placed on probation suspended for 
another year or closed the council is made up of students faculty 
and staff members

the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
the armed forces will carry out any antidrug assignments that 
congress decides upon but he warned the practice could compromise 
civil rights 
putting an end to the drug problem would be much broader than 
our mission adm william j crowe jr said at a news conference 
wednesday before a luncheon speech to the economic club of detroit 
i think there are things we can do primarily identification 
surveillance and tracking of people bringing in drugs in illicit 
fashion crowe said 
but he warned to solve the drug problem and still guarantee 
all americans the rights and privileges they enjoy today is a 
difficult thing to truly stop the flow of drugs you would have 
to increase police powers and do some searches and seizures that 
are not contemplated today 
the senate last week approved a provision giving the military an 
expanded role in stopping drug smuggling including new arrest 
powers for navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug 
boats on the high seas 
the house has passed a more farreaching provision ordering the 
president to have the military essentially seal off us borders 
against illegal drug trafficking 
the provisions were attached to the defense departments budget 
which is being debated on capitol hill 
crowe also said he did not expect increased us military 
activity in panama would force the exit of its leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
the admiral said he did not know when us involvement might end 
in the persian gulf 
i do not see any shortterm or longterm end to the iraniraq 
war he said adding that the united states is committed to 
protecting shipping in the gulf 
as long as those interests are in jeopardy we will be 
there crowe said of course the government never said it 
would be a shortterm operation

president corazon aquino said she 
will convene her cabinets crisis committee to discuss the 
implications of a summons a philippine court issued to her ousted 
predecessor ferdinand marcos 
mrs aquino told reporters on wednesday that she would convene 
the committee soon to discuss the summons issued on tuesday by the 
antigraft court the sandiganbayan 
the summons stems from a 25 billion lawsuit filed by the 
presidential commission on good government to recover some of the 
10 billion it alleges marcos stole during his 20 years in office 
mrs aquino has barred marcos from returning from hawaiian exile 
to the philippines from which he was forced in a february 1986 
popular uprising 
government sources said the committee must study the legal 
implications of the lawsuit including whether the summons can be 
served on marcos in hawaii and if so whether he has a legal right 
to return to answer the charges 
a source at the antigraft court said on condition of anonymity 
that the summons was forwarded to the department of foreign affairs 
but had not yet been sent on to honolulu 
the source said marcos and his wife imelda could respond in 
writing within 60 days of receiving the order legal sources said 
it was not clear whether marcos could demand to answer the charges 
personally in manila 
on wednesday police fired tear gas and smoke bombs to halt a 
rally and march to the us embassy by protesters demanding that 
marcos be allowed to return for his mothers funeral 
organizers said at least four women and two children were hurt 
police said there were minor injuries to several demonstrators but 
did not give a figure 
about 5000 demonstrators rallied to urge the government to 
allow marcos to return to attend the funeral of his mother josefa 
edralinmarcos who died may 4 a breakaway group of 2000 
demonstrators chanting if you want trouble we will give you 
trouble later marched toward the embassy and were blocked near 
city hall by 50 policemen 
a police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when 
they started throwing stones at the officers who fought back with 
truncheons and later used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the 
marchers the marchers later regrouped in the central bonifacio 
square to protest the dispersal

tamils in exchange for a surrender of weapons has been rejected by 
the militants 
indian troops landed on july 30 1987 to disarm the militants 
and enforce the peace pact and an estimated 50000 indian soldiers 
are now in sri lanka 
india a regional power became involved because of its own 60 
million ethnic tamils who are politically powerful and have close 
ties with the sri lankan tamils

extremists killed a candidate of the governing united national 
party in the central kandy district on wednesday night

a 19yearold student aruna saman dissanayake also was killed 
wednesday when gunmen shot at another government party candidate

gives too many concessions to the tamils they have vowed to kill 
government officials politicians and others who support the peace 
pact 
tamils are 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people most of 
whom are sinhalese tamils say they are discriminated against by

a judge will hear defense 
arguments next month that the sharpeville six defendants should 
be spared death for complicity in the mob killing of a black 
official court officers said 
the black defendants five men and a woman were scheduled to 
hang march 18 for their role in the 1984 mob slaying of a black 
town councilor in sharpeville south of johannesburg 
however a stay of execution was granted march 17 in the case 
which has attracted international attention and widespread appeals 
for clemency 
pretoria supreme court justice wj human this week gave 
permission to defense lawyers to present arguments june 6 on why 
the trial should be reopened the lawyers say they have evidence 
that a key state witness was coerced into giving false testimony 
the justice department said wednesday that no decision had been 
made on whether to reopen the trial it noted that government 
prosecutors would be arguing against the application to try the 
defendants again 
president pw botha has said he will not intervene in the case 
the trial caused debate in part because the six were not 
convicted of contributing physically to the death of councilor 
jacob dlamini instead they were convicted under the doctrine of 
common purpose which held them responsible because they actively 
joined the mob 
the killing occurred during riots provoked by a rent increase in 
sharpeville and neighboring townships 
also wednesday police said a former mental patient on tuesday 
night killed two officers including one accused by black squatters 
of organizing vigilante gangs against them 
the 30yearold white man who killed the officers in a shootout 
was identified as christopher du plooy he later was killed by 
police who stormed his house in fish hoek a coastal town on the 
cape peninsula 
one of the slain police officers warrant officer hendrick 
barnard was a cape town policeman for 20 years the white officer 
usually worked in impoverished black townships and squatter camps 
east of cape town 
last year he was injured in a hand grenade attack in one 
township 
many blacks said barnard was connected with attacks and 
factional fighting aimed at intimidating or displacing squatters 
barnard has been mentioned frequently in an ongoing court action 
filed by squatters who were burned out of their shacks in 1986 
the plaintiffs said that barnard and other officers either 
encouraged or condoned an onslaught on the squatter camp by black 
vigilantes some witnesses have testified they saw barnard in a van 
leading a force of 1000 vigilantes and others say they saw him 
distributing incendiary devices 
scores of people were killed and more than 70000 burned out of 
their homes during attacks on the squatters in may and june 1986 
barnard said police tried to stop the violence but were unable 
to move through the densely packed shanties in vehicles and 
considered it too dangerous to go on foot 
some squatters have banded together to resist attempts to 
relocate them and the government considers other squatter 
communities strongholds of antiapartheid militants 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a soviet media official today confirmed that 
12000 to 15000 soviet soldiers died in afghanistan during the 
kremlins more than eight years of military involvement in that 
countrys civil war 
eduard rosental a political observer for the government news 
agency novosti confirmed a recent report by the parisbased agence 
francepresse news service that 12000 to 15000 soviets had been 
killed in afghanistan 
rosentals comment during a news conference to discuss 
afghanistans history was believed to be the first time a soviet 
official has approximated the death toll from the soviet 
intervention 
he had been asked by a reporter how many soldiers had died in 
the war 
he reviewed various western media assessments including the afp 
report and said i think the figures cited by agence 
francepresse are more or less correct but you can obtain more 
correct figures from our military men 
gennady i gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman has 
promised to bring highranking military officials to a news 
conference soon to discuss the wars costs in more detail rosental 
said 
a sovietinspired revolution in april 1978 brought a marxist 
leadership to power in afghanistan the kremlin sent troops and 
tanks in december 1979 to help the allied kabul government fight 
usbacked moslem rebels 
under a unmediated accord signed in geneva on april 14 the 
soviets began pulling out their 115000 troops from afghanistan on 
sunday and are expected to complete the withdrawal within nine 
months 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said after the 
signing ceremonies in geneva that his government would release 
casualty figures once the pullout began 
no date for the gerasimov military press conference has been 
announced yet 
a us state department report released in december estimated 
the total number of soviet casualties in afghanistan since 1979 at 
at least 33000 to 38000 more than onethird of whom were 
killed 
that would make the number of men killed in combat between 
11000 and 12700 or more those estimates do not include heavy 
losses to disease the state department report added 
the report said disease is rampant among the soviet troops 
particularly dysentery and hepatitis caused by poor hygiene 
if the death figures mentioned by rosental are correct then the 
soviet union suffered far fewer losses in afghanistan than the 
united states did in the vietnam war 
a total of 47253 americans were killed or mortally wounded in 
combat in vietnam and adjacent military theaters of southeast asia 
and more than 150000 were wounded 
rosental rejected a reporters suggestion that the kremlin was 
abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide 
insurgency 
to withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the 
lurch the novosti official said we leave many cultural and 
economic facilities there the soviet union is not abandoning 
anyone 
the first soviet soldiers to be withdrawn under the geneva 
accords about 1300 men from a motorized rifle unit crossed the 
border at termez in the soviet central asian republic of uzbekistan 
on wednesday

a spell of cool dry weather has helped illinois 
bell restore telephone service to thousands of customers in six 
suburbs west of chicago whose phones went dead after a fire ravaged 
a switching center a company spokesman said 
illinois bell has advanced its target date from midjune to 
early june for restoring normal service to the 35000 customers who 
lost all service after the may 8 fire spokesman larry cose said 
wednesday 
illinois bell expects to start connecting subscribers to a new 
digital call switching system being installed at its hinsdale 
center by may 26 instead of the original june 1 target date cose 
said it normally takes 50 weeks to install such equipment under 
phone company guidelines 
the weather has been our friend the last couple of days 
cose said as long as it stays dry and cool its great for us 
if it was wet and humid out there wed probably be seeing more 
problems than we are seeing now 
hinsdales weather with daytime temperatures in the 60s and 
nights in the 40s under clear skies has been good for the 250 
employees working 24 hours a day to repair or replace old equipment 
and install the new switching system 
the cool dry weather has reduced problems with corrosion of old 
switching equipment badly damaged in the fire as a result cose 
said bell officials are using the old equipment to restore partial 
service to customers until the new system is installed 
twenty dehumidifiers also have been set up to prevent corrosion 
of the old equipment 
by thursday the company had restored partial service to 31000 
of the 35000 customers whose service was cut off by the fire cose 
said 
by the end of the week all 35000 subscribers in the hinsdale 
area should have limited service with irregular dial tones and 
crackling on the lines cose said the technical problems will 
continue until the customers are hooked up to the new switching 
equipment he said 
as partial service is restored many wouldbe callers have 
encountered delays because of heavy demand 
its like a jam getting on the expressway during the rush 
hour cose said but the situation is better than it was 
yesterday 
bell expects that regional and long distance lines and special 
business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through 
the hinsdale center should be functioning normally by the end of 
the week cose said 
more than 125 coinoperated telephones were set up around the 
western suburbs the company said many businesses that rely on 
telephone orders have been suffering from lagging sales and one 
hospital started using pizza trucks to make birth announcements 
meanwhile volunteer workers continued to staff mobile emergency 
reporting patrols in the six suburbs to relay calls for police 
fire or medical services 
hinsdale village manager ron ruskey said 19 emergency vehicles 
would be on the street until the town was sure all local phones 
were operating 
a naperville company angels international travel inc filed a 
lawsuit seeking classaction status and unspecified damages in du 
page county circuit court for what it said was bells failure to 
protect properly against the fire 
richard janney vice president and general counsel for illinois 
bell said the company will give double credit to customers who 
have been without service bell has said it believes it is 
protected from legal damages under state law 
sam mitchell of the chicago association of commerce and 
industry said it might take months to determine the financial 
losses caused by the phone outage

authorities said today that two men killed in a 
car bomb explosion were planning to park the automobile near the 
headquarters of the kuwait airways corp but the explosives 
apparently went off prematurely 
an interior ministry spokesman identified the men killed in the 
explosion wednesday as nasser mohammed ali hassan ahmed 22 and 
walid abdelnabi mohammed mousa almousa 23 both were kuwaitis 
they were killed as a punishment for their intended crimes 
said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity under 
ministry rules they wanted to plant the explosive somewhere in 
the area 
he did not say what detonated the bomb on a main downtown 
avenue the explosion about 25 yards from the airlines office 
destroyed the car and killled both men 
no other casualties or damage were reported 
shops in the area were closed because wednesday was the third 
day of the moslem feast of id el fitr which marks the end of the 
holy month of ramadan there would have been few pedestrians in the 
area at the time of the blast residents said 
police speaking on condition of anonymity said they believe 
that the driver wanted to park the mazda929 in front of the 
airlines headquarters 
the explosion was the third in this northern persian gulf 
country in a month kuwait is close to the iraniraq warfront and 
has been the target of attacks blamed on proiranian terrorists 
the previous explosions occurred in the same area of the capital 
the first on april 27 injured a guard near the offices of the 
saudi national airline then on may 7 an explosion occurred at the 
offices of avis the american car rental company 
a kuwaiti newspaper recently reported three people were arrested 
in connection with the earlier blasts authorities have not 
confirmed the report 
a kuwait airways boeing 747 was commandeered last month on a 
flight from bangkok by gunmen who have been identified as 
proiranian moslem extremists two of its kuwaiti passengers were 
killed during the 16day ordeal and the other passengers and crew 
were released 
the hijackers sought the release of 17 people convicted of 
bombing the us and french embassies the same demand made by the 
captors of proiranian groups holding 18 foreigners hostage in 
lebanon

the man who built sasson jeans inc into a 
multimilliondollar business before winding up in bankruptcy court 
has been charged with threatening the judge who is hearing the 
firms bankruptcy reorganization case 
i did not threaten anybody i am astonished to see i have been 
accused of this paul guez told us magistrate barbara a lee 
during a hearing wednesday in which prosecutors sought to have him 
detained without bail 
guez had been arrested and charged with threatening the life of 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
guez claimed the charges were part of a conspiracy to block 
his attendance at an afternoon hearing on sassons chapter 11 
reorganization plan 
the magistrate ordered guez who was dressed in a rumpled gray 
suit and white shirt without a tie held overnight 
according to federal prosecutors guez 43 threatened to kill 
lifland and the trustee he appointed to oversee sassons 
reorganization if a result contrary to his interest were to be 
reached 
fbi agents arrested guez on wednesday afternoon at the lower 
manhattan building that houses bankruptcy court 
the allegations of threats on lifland were based on information 
supplied by an informant described as a lawyer with a privileged 
professional relationship with guez 
the complaint further stated that due to the tone and 
demeanor of guez the informant believed he was fully capable 
of carrying out his threat 
sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since october 1986 on

cuban troops in angola have 
moved south and are within 45 miles of the border with southwest 
africa a newspaper reported today 
business day citing unidentified south african intelligence 
sources said the cubans were concentrated in five areas in 
southcentral angola 
the newspaper did not say how many cuban troops were involved 
defense minister magnus malan said monday that up to 9000 of the 
more than 40000 cuban soldiers in angola were advancing 
south african and angolan officials have met twice this month in 
a bid to resolve the 13yearold civil war in the former portuguese 
colony 
angolas marxist government is supported by the cuban forces 
while south africa and the united states support the rebel national 
union for the total independence of angola 
us officials said south africa and angola joined by the 
united states and cuba are scheduled to meet next week in 
brazzaville congo 
south africa and angola have said initial talks were cordial 
but south african officials continue to make hostile statements 
malan had suggested that south africa may have to respond 
militarily to the reported cuban troop movements 
angola says south africa has 9000 troops in its territory 
backed by heavy artillery south africa says it has never had more 
than 3000 troops in angola since it began deploying combat forces 
there a year ago 
a resolution of the angolan conflict also could lead to a 
political settlement in neighboring southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
south africa administers the territory in violation of a un 
resolution and says it has no plans to grant independence until 
cuban forces leave angola

nine black police officers have quit their 
union to protest its staunch support of a white officer who was 
fired for making racist and sexist slurs 
the pba is not in my best interest said detective bob 
wright 32 a 10year veteran and union member for the past two 
years the pba always seems to revolve around racial issues 
six officers quit the police benevolent association on tuesday 
and three more canceled their 15 monthly dues payments wednesday

criticism last month of a stinging manuscript on race relations by 
hillsborough county sheriffs maj arnie myers who is black 
the police union has lambasted last weeks firing of officer 
charles w glass by mayor sandy freedman sheehan called the 
mayors action illegal and a violation of due process 
but wright said he supports the mayors decision to fire glass 
and favors her tough policy against discrimination 
being black i like the policy it was long overdue he said 
in a letter to the mayor tuesday r jeffrey stull attorney for 
the police union urged her to reinstate glass 
the dispute between the police union and the mayor began friday 
when ms freedman fired glass 26 after he acknowledged to police 
investigators he made sexually and racially derogatory comments 
about officer vicky thomas 
police officials reprimanded glass on april 28 but when the 
mayor learned about the incident she intervened on the grounds 
glass had violated her 1987 policy on discriminatory conduct which 
calls for at least a 15day suspension and possible dismissal

meteorologists are calling the worst blowing dust in at least a 
decade damaging crops and creating hazardous driving conditions in 
minnesota south and north dakota 
light rain that fell in parts of northern minnesota and north 
dakota today will help somewhat said sam standfield of the 
national weather service in minneapolis 
it will help at least keep the dust down for a while but 
were going to need more rain than this to end the drought 
problem standfield said 
in northern minnesota the dry spring has caused the worst 
conditions of blowing dust in a decade said william larson head 
of the university of minnesotas soil science department 
the dust has been even worse in north dakota says state 
climatologist john enz over most of the state weve had the 
driest septemberthroughapril since the 1930s he said

japanese workers at us navy bases are protesting 
a policy that requires employees who deal with confidential matters 
to submit to lie detector tests 
the plan neglects our basic human rights said misao 
kamiyama chairman of the all japanese garrison forces labor union 
which represents 1200 workers at the us bases 
the union monday asked the defense facilities administration 
agency which hires japanese workers for the bases to urge the 
americans to drop the polygraph requirement 
in japan only criminals get that kind of treatment we are 
planning a fullscale nationwide protest against the decision if 
the agency does not respond by friday he said 
the navy briefed the workers on the tests in april kamiyama 
said about 500 japanese at were asked to sign an agreement to take 
a polygraph examination and were threatened to be transfered to 
other sections if they refuse to sign he said 
the accuracy of polygraph tests is widely disputed 
an agency spokesman said it consented to the us plan but 
expressed concern about the human rights standpoint of 
polygraph tests the spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity did not elaborate 
the agency acts as liaison between the us military in japan 
and the japanese government under the plan only employees at navy 
plants would have to take the tests 
since september 1987 the navy has been requiring the polygraph 
examination before it grants limited access authorization to 
personnel a us military spokesman said 
this is a measure taken worldwide and not aimed at japanese 
alone he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
about 500 japanese base workers are subject to the lie detector 
test the spokesman said most work at ship repair facilities in 
yokosuka and sasebo 
kamiyama said trasfers of employees who refused to take the 
tests could fuel antiamerican sentiment among the japanese 
in okinawa where people feel uneasy about the us bases 
occupying such a vast land such an insensitive policy could easily 
cause a major protest not only among base workers but also other 
people he said 
us bases occupy about 11 percent of the island of okinawas 
867 square miles

senior leader deng xiaoping said today he advises 
chinas leaders not to be afraid to take risks for the sake of 
progress and he cited recent price increases as an example 
deng made the comment during a twohour meeting with o jin u 
north koreas minister of the peoples armed forces who led a 
military delegation on a fiveday visit to china the official 
xinhua news agency reported the delegation returns to north korea 
friday 
the 83yearold senior leader went into semiretirement last 
fall and has made rare public appearances 
the nationally televised evening news showed deng looking fit 
and alert greeting o with a hug and kisses on both cheeks 
i often tell my colleagues to be brave and not be afraid of 
risks because otherwise no progress will be made deng told the 
north koreans 
he made the statement while talking about drastic price reforms 
that have raised the prices of four staple foods by as much as 60 
percent 
the price increases went into effect in beijing four days ago 
raising the prices of eggs pork vegetables and sugar by 28 
percent to 60 percent they created much grumbling among consumers 
already unhappy about skyrocketing prices 
chinas current price reform is a bold yet risky action but 
the countrys leadership is confident of doing a good job deng 
said 
he said the price increases are necessary because food prices in 
the past were kept artificially low through government subsidies 
deng said reform of the price of raw materials would follow the 
rise in food prices 
resolving the price problem is imperative to chinas economic 
progress and its attainment of the goal of reaching 
developedcountry status by the middle of the next century 
xinhua reported deng as saying 
chinas leadership knows every step the country takes involves 
risks and it could encounter difficulties deng said the party 
and the masses have to understand this is a demanding task

a soviet space official said today two cosmonauts 
probably will man the nations first shuttle flight 
the soviets earlier had indicated the inaugural flight of the 
space shuttle might be unmanned no date has been announced 
radio moscow quoted vladimir shatalov head of the soviet 
cosmonaut training program as telling reporters visiting the space 
center in baikonur that two cosmonauts would be aboard 
the test flight will be carried out after all the systems of 
the energia booster rocket and of the shuttle have been thoroughly 
checked the broadcast quoted shatalov as saying 
radio moscow said the soviet shuttle is similar to the 
american model but has a number of design peculiarities 
no other details were provided 
sources in washington familiar with the soviet space program say 
the shuttle has been tested at baikonur on a 15000foot landing 
strip and that cosmonaut igor volk is the programs chief pilot and 
likely to be part of the crew 
soviet officials have been saying since january that the first 
launch of a reuseable spacecraft was imminent and have varied in 
their reports about whether it would be manned or not 
alexander dunaev head of the soviet space agency glavkosmos 
told a news conference in march that scientists were working around 
the clock to prepare for the first shuttle flight which he said 
would be unmanned 
we pursue the fundamental objective whether man is alive or 
dead after the flight dunaev said in pointed reference to the 
january 1986 us space shuttle disaster in which seven astronauts 
were killed 
the american shuttle program has been grounded since the 
challenger tragedy 
the first soviet satellite launch for a paying customer was made 
on march 17 when an indian satellite was lifted into orbit from 
the baikonur spaceport in the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
western sources have told the associated press that the soviet 
shuttle will not have rocket engines mounted on it as the us 
shuttle does instead the engines are mounted on the energia 
booster rocket and the reuseable craft is powered by jet engines 
which give it more maneuverability on landing

the top elective body in ayacucho province 
said soldiers entered a village and massacred about 100 peasants in 
retaliation for a rebel ambush of an army convoy 
the military in a communique issued late wednesday called the 
charges unfounded and said they were aimed at blocking efforts to 
capture the maoist shining path rebels in lima lawmakers said the 
government would investigate 
the alleged massacre reportedly occurred just hours before pope 
john paul ii arrived in peru during a fournation south american 
tour he did not travel to ayacucho which is 230 miles southeast 
of lima 
the leftistoriented ayacucho provincial council said troops 
swarmed into cayara 50 miles south of this provincial capital on 
saturday and slaughtered the peasants 
cayara residents told council members soldiers 
indiscriminately killed 30 to 50 defenseless young men who were 
harvested corn in fields surrounding the town of 1000 people the 
council said in a statement wednesday 
residents said troops then herded 50 more peasants into a chapel 
and killed them the statement claimed 
it said townspeople told the council they were unsure how many 
people were killed because the attackers poured gasoline on and 
burned some bodies and because many people had gone into hiding it 
said the troops used bayonets to kill many of them 
the council is headed by ayacucho mayor fermin azparrent a 
member of the marxist opposition party the united left 
senate president jorge lozada said the government of president 
alan garcia would investigate 
leftist and human rights groups have frequently accused the 
military in the past few years of killing civilians in areas where 
rebel activity is intense and soldiers suspect villagers of 
sympathizing with the insurgents 
the ayacucho military command said on wednesday that 100 
guerrillas of the shining path movement ambushed two army trucks 
around midnight on friday near cayara it said four soldiers and 
six guerrillas were killed and 15 troops wounded in the fighting 
wednesdays communique the first official description of the 
attack said troop reinforcements pursued the guerrillas and the 
two sides clashed again on saturday causing unverified 
casualties among the subversives 
the military communique said cayara residents had fled and the 
town was empty when troops arrived on saturday it said four bodies 
were found in the chapel 
ayacuchos impoverished highlands were the birthplace and remain 
the stronghold of the shining path the eightyear insurgency has 
cost more than 10000 lives mainly those of peasants caught up in 
the violence between guerrillas and government forces 
police in the provincial capital say the shining path has 
murdered hundreds of villagers in the province more than 100 so 
far this year who it accuses of supporting the army 
the province had been under direct military control since late 
1982 
residents of the province have linked the military with the 
deaths of nearly 150 peasants in three earlier purported massacres 
since garcia took office in july 1985 
charges by human rights groups that the military has waged a 
dirty war against peasants have eased however during garcias 
term

the slovenian youth organization 
says the military planned a coup in the republic of slovenia but 
that the government prevented it 
the allegation and a demand for an explanation came in an open 
letter to slovenias communist leader milan kucan and its interior 
minister tomaz ertl it was published by the magazine mladina 
official mouthpiece of the socialist youth 
in the letter the socialist youth alleged the coup was planned 
for earlier this year and included the arrests of nonconformist 
journalists writers and officials it said its report was based on 
widely spread rumors 
the military was to quell street demonstrations and other unrest 
that were expected to follow the arrests mladina said in its 
current edition 
the report said that according to rumors the army had failed to 
notify the countrys and slovenias civilian communist leadership 
of the coup plans 
slovenian security organizations notified kucan and stane 
dolanc slovenias member in the collective presidency and now 
yugoslavias vice president who prevented the plan said the 
magazine 
from kucan and ertl we demand a clear and detailed answer to a 
simple question how much truth is there in the above summarized 
rumors said mladina 
france zavrl an editor of the magazine told the associated 
press that kucan promised to reply 
a number of articles published in the slovenian press this year 
particularly in mladina denounced the army as an undemocratic 
prosoviet institution intent on staging a military coup 
in april a parliamentary commission responsible for state 
security said the articles were part of an international conspiracy 
to weaken national defense and to overthrow the government 
the army has criticized slovenias leadership for not taking 
tough action against dissent in slovenia the dissent includes 
frequent attacks on yugoslav domestic and foreign policies and such 
figures as the late yugoslav leader josip broz tito 
earlier this month mladina published what it said was a speech 
by kucan at a closed session of yugoslavias communist presidium on 
march 29 in which he said that the coup plan existed 
the article quoting kucans speech was immediately banned by the 
authorities under the pretext that it revealed a state secret said 
zavrl 
communists in slovenia have often been at odds with official 
yugoslav policy by offering unorthodox solutions to the countrys 
deepening economic and social problems the proposals include 
introduction of a more marketoriented economy and closer ties with 
the west 
yugoslavia is officially nonaligned

house speaker jim wright said today that the 
government watchdog group common cause was wrongly accusing him of 
unethical behavior and that his actions were clearly legal and 
proper 
common cause president fred wertheimer announced on wednesday 
that his group which monitors and suggests ways of enforcing 
ethical practices by public officials was requesting an 
investigation by the house ethics committee into whether wright 
violated conflictofinterest rules 
wright dtexas for months has been the subject of published 
reports about his activities on behalf of texas associates and 
campaign contributors 
according to the reports wright receives 55 percent of the 
royalties far above the normal 10 to 15 percent for his book 
reflections of a public man the book published by longtime 
campaign supporter william carlos moore has earned wright more 
than 54000 
moores firms reportedly received more than 250000 for 
campaign services during 1985 and 1986 from wrights reelection 
committee 
wertheimer said the ethics committee needs to examine whether 
the speakers campaign committees were at all involved in either 
publishing or selling the book which he said could be a violation 
of house or other federal conflictofinterest rules 
the committee also needs to determine whether wright improperly 
sought special treatment for constituents and party campaign 
contributors in connection with the regulatory activities of the 
federal home loan bank board including blocking legislation 
wertheimer said 
common cause believes that it is in the best interests of the 
public the house of representatives and of speaker wright for the 
house ethics committee to examine and resolve these matters 
wertheimer wrote in a letter to the ethics panel 
we further believe that in conducting its inquiry the 
committee should retain an outside counsel as it has done on a 
number of occasions in the past to ensure that the results of 
the inquiry are credible to and accepted by the public 
wright said today his discussions with the banking officials 
were part of a congressmans job this action is clearly legal 
and proper he said 
most members of congress intercede regularly on behalf of 
constituents with the various regulatory agencies of government 
he said 
wright said the rules of congress clearly authorize members to 
receive royalty payments for their books and he said his campaign 
committee did not pay any amount for publishing the book nor did 
it purchase any copies of the book 
the speaker today criticized wertheimer for not contacting him 
directly about the accusations on wednesday the speakers office 
released a statement accusing common cause of being the 
handmaiden of a partisan political initiative 
wertheimer said his request was not associated with the actions 
of wrights opponents but rep newt gingrich rga who has led 
the criticism said common cause was giving ideological balance to 
the criticism 
gingrich said in a statement wednesday he was working with 
lawyers to develop formal charges along the lines common cause 
suggests 
the ethics committee officially called the committee on 
standards of official conduct has been criticized by gingrich and 
others for apparent reluctance to investigate the speakers 
activities 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said he had no 
comment on the letter

fruits spices and grains entombed with the 
ancient egyptian boy king tutankhamun for his journey to the 
afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty 
storeroom a newspaper reported today 
the times of london said an archeological student discovered the 
boxes of food remains at the royal botanical gardens 
the newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since 
they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by howard carter who 
discovered tutankhamuns tomb in the valleys of the kings at luxor 
egypt in 1922 
the remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist 
leonard boodle but were apparently forgotten after his death in 
the 1930s 
arthur bell director of the gardens at kew in south london was 
quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by christian 
tutundjian de vartavan a 23yearold french student working on a 
master of science degree in ancient egyptian plants at londons 
university college 
the times said the colleges institute of archaeology is trying 
to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard 
which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five 
pounds of seeds fruits and spices placed in tutankhamuns tomb 
after his death more than 3300 years ago 
the times said the species indentified so far include emmer 
wheat for making bread on the journey barley for brewing beer and 
a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on 
also found were coriander fenugreek black cumin sesame seeds 
two kinds of juniper berries and grapes 
the times quoted university college botanist gordon hillman as 
saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds 
they will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated how 
they were harvested and how they were stored hillman was quoted 
as saying 
the newspaper said officials at kew are willing to return the 
specimens to the egyptian government but would like to put some on 
display 
the independent newspaper said tutundjian de vartavan came 
across the tutankhamun remains while studying ancient egyptian 
plant remains 
the times and the independent said the find represents only a 
fraction of the food buried in the tomb the rest is still in 116 
original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the cairo 
museum and the dokki agricultural museum in egypt

report as saying that in talks with prem on wednesday soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev pledged to assist in every way in the 
search for a political settlement of the cambodian problem and 
agreed with cambodia being a neutral and independent country 
soviet officials previously have said they had no direct role to 
play in the situation vietnam has occupied cambodia since 1978 
when it drove the bloody khmer rouge from power 
the state department says vietnam has 120000 soldiers in 
cambodia 
the soviet union is the main supplier of arms to vietnamese 
forces that are battling guerrillas backed by thailand and other 
countries cambodia is on thailands eastern border and bangkok 
regards the vietnamese occupation as its major security threat 
 
while visiting thailand last month the soviet deputy foreign 
minister igor i rogachev said the kremlin couldnt pressure 
hanoi on cambodia because vietnam is a sovereign country 
thai officials responded that hanoi would be forced to end the 
occupation if the soviets stopped supplying arms 
radio thailand said that in talks with gorbachev prem referred 
to the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and said he believed the 
cambodian conflict also could be resolved gorbachev then pledged 
to help 
siddhi said that moscow wants him to hold talks on cambodia with 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach after thailands 
general elections on july 24 
the khmer rouge a radical communist guerrilla group defeated 
the usbacked cambodian government in the spring of 1975 and 
forced the evacaution of the countrys cities making the residents 
go into rural areas to work millions of cambodians were killed by 
the khmer rouge or died of starvation and disease

youths from rival housing projects 
should be able to meet peacefully on the basketball court say 
school officials but police arent so sure that street warfare 
wont spill over into the contest 
the board of education this week unanimously approved a request 
to hold a basketball match june 5 between students from pitney 
village and the nearby shore park complex both on the citys west 
side 
a school official said he believed there would be no replay of 
the violence that marred a tournament last year 
wilbert l royal coordinator for the west side school complex 
where the game would be held said the game would be the first 
attempt to try and ameliorate any animosity that still exists 
between these two areas 
it will be a friendly rivalry rather than the combative 
rivalry that a turf war brings he said 
but atlantic city police chief joseph pasquale called the idea 
ridiculous and said he doubted the event would be permitted 
we discourage any gathering of these two groups because they 
hate each other he said both areas have a lot of weapons 
both areas dislike each other both areas are druginfested and 
weve got two big investigations going on in both areas 
pasquale fears a repeat of the shooting and stabbings at the 
seagull classic high school basketball tournament in nearby absecon 
in december 
royal said he would not dispute pasquale if he believes the 
basketball game would be a risk to safety but he said he believed 
the sides have cooled 
royal pointed to a recent incidentfree rap concert at a city 
complex calling it an example of the ability of students from 
different parts of the city to get along

senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
said today the ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty could be 
approved before president reagan leaves for moscow next wednesday 
if only the legitimate and serious points of order and 
amendments are called up this treaty can be approved in time for 
the president to take it with him to the summit byrd dwva 
told reporters 
the senate voted 916 wednesday to reject the first conservative 
attack on the treaty that was a point of order raised by sen 
jesse helms rnc who claimed soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
wasnt authorized to sign the pact and the senate therefore should 
not ratify it 
the first vote would indicate the senate did not think it was 
a serious point i did not think it was said byrd 
republican leader bob dole rkan said we need to get some 
actionwe need to have the debate have the vote and move on 
i feel a particular responsibility in this instance because 
there is a republican in the white house and republican 
conservatives are the chief critics of the treaty dole said 
the burden is on the republicans to move this along said 
dole noting that the only proposed amendments have been spelled 
out by members of his party 
maybe we could even get lucky and finish this by next tuesday 
or wednesday said dole i hope we continue to expedite this 
process 
reagan leaves wednesday for his moscow summit meeting with 
gorbachev and he has said he hopes he take a ratified treaty with 
him 
after the vote late wednesday dole said i think the vote 
weve just had is an indication of the strong support we have for 
this treaty lets get on with it 
sen james exon dneb agreed with dole lets do our work 
lets not fool around which i think we are doing to a large extent 
on the amendment that was just defeated i dont know what 
benefit there is in waiting until after the summit begins to ratify 
this treaty 
there is no cause for further untimely delay said exon 
sen robert stafford rvt said the american people want the 
president to have a ratified treaty in his briefcase when he 
meets gorbachev 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed dec 8 by 
reagan and gorbachev calls for the elimination of all missiles 
with a range of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
helms contended that because gorbachev was signing as the 
general secretary of the soviet unions communist party he 
represented a political party and not the soviet state 
this document now at the desk is not binding on the soviet 
union it is only an agreement between the president of the united 
states and the head of a foreign political party said helms 
sen steve symms ridaho agreed with helms noting that if 
gorbachev is removed from power someday they could easily come 
back and say he was only the head of the communist party and 
therefore the treaty is invalid 
but sen richard lugar rind responded that there is no 
substance whatsoever to the claim that the treaty was not legally 
signed treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise 
judgment 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee said there was no question that gorbachev was 
representing his nation when he signed the pact 
it is clear that mr gorbachev and no one else in that 
delegation was the chief representative of the soviet union pell 
said 
helms rejected what he said he were insinuations that he was 
raising technical points simply for the sake of delay what is 
occurring is not dilatory but is instead and in fact 
deliberative he told his colleagues 
the senate still faces an unresolved fight over the legal 
interpretation of treaties 
that dispute arises from reagans claim that he has the legal 
right to unilaterally change how a treaty is viewed by the united 
states he has asserted that right in relation to the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
democrats who control the senate have added an amendment to the 
inf pact which says no future president can reinterpret the pact 
without senate approval republicans object to the addition 
sen arlen specter rpa said wednesday that the 
interpretation amendment was a booby trap that creates 
confusion and confrontation he called it a turf battle 
extraordinaire in which the senate is seeking primacy in the 
treatymaking process 
but sen paul sarbanes dmd disagreed arguing that the 
senate should protect its rights if we do not do this the 
senates role in treatymaking will be completely obliterated he 
said

pope john paul ii returned to rome today after a 
12day south american tour in which he condemned drugs in bolivia 
preached reconciliation in peru and paraguay and reminded uruguay 
of its roman catholic roots 
the pontiffs plane arrived at romes ciampino airport shortly 
after 4 pm and he headed directly for the vatican 
he ended his tour in the paraguayan capital of asuncion on 
wednesday with a plea for listeners to settle their differences and 
build a better nation the day also marked his 68th birthday 
the key to unity reconciliation and brotherhood is in the 
scriptures the pontiff said at an airport farewell ceremony 
attended by authoritarian president gen alfredo stroessner 75 
the western hemispheres longestruling head of state 
by building a christian nation and being faithful to your 
genuine roots you can build a paraguay of tomorrow said john 
paul who early in the visit preached respect for human rights and 
civil liberties to stroessner in power since a 1954 coup 
stroessner bidding the pope goodbye said the visit had been a 
source of joy and hope for paraguay which he described as a 
pluralistic and democratic society without terrorism and 
enjoying full freedom within a state of law 
most outside observers regard the nation of 38 million people 
as a dictatorship 
the asuncion daily newspaper patria run by the governing 
colorado party lashed out on wednesday at the popes tuesday night 
meeting with a churchselected group of civic and cultural leaders 
which included opposition activists the church had called the 
group builders of society 
labeling the group a grabbag of societys destroyers patria 
said in an editorial there is no doubt about the oppositions 
ideologizing politicizing and manipulating everything concerned 
with the meeting 
john pauls trip his 37th since becoming pope in 1978 and the 
ninth to latin america took him from tiny uruguay on the atlantic 
coast to bolivia high in the andes peru on the pacific and 
landlocked semitropical paraguay 
the pontiff ended his trip at a giant youth rally where he was 
serenaded with happy birthday sung in his native polish and in 
guarani the indian language spoken along with spanish by most 
paraguayans 
i feel young especially when im with young people the 
pope told the youngsters estimated at more than 100000 
john paul urged them to love god above all things to be 
saints 
the rally ended a gruelling 57hour schedule that included 
visits to five paraguayan cities and meetings with stroessner 
opponents who accuse the president of political repression church 
leaders poor peasants and landless native indians 
john paul flew on wednesday to the southeastern parana river 
port of encarnacion for a prayer meeting and visited caacupe for a 
mass at the national catholic shrine 
speaking at a copperroofed basilica dedicated to the virgin of 
caacupe the pontiff repeated an earlier call that special 
attention be given to the rights of paraguays peasants and indians 
difficulties and problems are not lacking in the life of the 
native as well as that of the peasants the pope said often 
they have been marginalized and forgotten 
the roman catholic church john paul added strongly supports 
these groups and their demands that their legitimate rights be 
respected 
the pope told tens of thousands of faithful at a prayer service 
in encarnacion that paraguay suffers from a concept of life that 
puts profits and a thirst for power above the human person and 
his needs 
the paraguayan visit was perhaps the most politically sensitive 
on the trip just after the pope arrived police arrested four 
people associated with opposition activity including a us jesuit 
priest but later released them without comment 
in uruguay south americas most secular nation the pontiff 
told the populace to remember its catholic roots and spoke out in 
favor of union rights 
bolivia south americas most impoverished nation and a leading 
cocaine source heard the pontiff call for a campaign against drug 
traffficking and corruption 
in peru amid massive security and the arrest of thousands of 
suspected troublemakers john paul urged an end to the hate and 
violence that have claimed 10000 lives over a decade of leftist 
terrorist activity

a man who served time for killing his 
heiress motherinlaw and her nurse in 1977 has apparently 
committed suicide authorities said 
roger s caldwell 54 slit both wrists and bled to death on his 
living room floor late tuesday or early wednesday according to 
westmoreland county deputy coroner joseph musgrove 
caldwell was convicted in the slayings of elisabeth congdon of 
duluth and her night nurse velma pietila 67 in congdons lake 
superior mansion on june 27 1977 
musgrove said caldwell left three suicide notes the st paul 
minn pioneer press dispatch reported one note said he was 
innocent of the murders 
the newspaper also cited unidentified sources who said caldwell 
recently complained of being unable to get a job in his hometown of 
latrobe and of being haunted by notoriety from the murders 
an agreement nearly five years ago allowed caldwell to plead 
guilty to seconddegree murder and he was released on time already 
served in prison 
it came after the minnesota supreme court overturned his 1978 
murder conviction released him from prison and granted him a new 
trial 
prosecutors and police had contended the slayings were part of a 
plot by caldwell and his wife marjorie to kill her adoptive 
mother and collect an inheritance of about 82 million 
marjorie caldwell was later tried and acquitted on similar 
murder charges the couple were divorced according to musgrove

the guardian of london liberal something that has not 
happened since 1964 may suddenly unpredictably be happening 
again almost 24 years ago lyndon b johnson won california for 
the democrats no democratic candidate since has performed that 
trick and yet this morning we not only find gov michael 
dukakis leading george bush by 10 clear percentage points on 
nationwide polls the frontrunner in every major area of the 
united states we also find him 17 points ahead in california 
may polls of course may be broken reeds in november 
but at the very least europe ought now to be sitting up and 
taking urgent notice our leaders and those they pay to advise 
them on diplomatic developments have until very recently 
tended to assume that president bush is a foregone conclusion that 
was always a little wonky today it looks stupid try president 
dukakis for size

the times of london independent the american presidency 
has more often than not been held by dull men or by men who would 
have been thought dull were it not for the interesting events in 
which they were caught up that is perhaps the explanation of the 
bore factor which is affecting not just george bush but his most 
likely democratic opponent michael dukakis this years campaign 
is taking place in times of peace and prosperity for america 
unmatched in most presidential election years this century it is 
difficult for candidates to sound exciting in such times 
whoever wins an envious world will eventually make sure that 
america becomes for a while at least less peaceful and perhaps 
less prosperous that is the fate of great countries which are also 
democracies in a world in which most countries are neither great 
nor democratic either candidate will soon become more exciting 
than he is at present because sadly the events will become so 
america should be grateful for these two bores while she can

the herald of harare governmentcontrolled in comparing 
democrats and republicans the former are more accessible and easier 
to communicate with american interests are interwoven with the 
interests of others at worst the democrats make third world 
countries at least feel they are considered when america makes 
decisions but republicans act in ways that fly in the face of 
accepted diplomatic norms 
because of that primary consideration for american interests 
it is highly unlikely that anyone with political ideas such as 
jesse jacksons would ever reach the white house 
mr ronald reagan had no political program when he came in and 
may not quite understand the differences between the contras and 
unita but he went through on the make america the greatest again 
ticket 
yet the democrats are the lesser of the two evils developing 
countries would certainly be better off with michael dukakis if he 
appointed a black to the post of secretary of state this would be 
for the purpose of internal public relations and not for any 
consideration of black africa 
developing countries must accept the fact that developed 
countries are only what they are because we are how we are any 
change in our status will proportinately change theirs it is this 
that is drilled into the resident of the white house to always 
remember 
we too in developing countries must always remember that

a bipartisan group of senators aserting that 
the war powers act doesnt work introduced a measure today 
overhauling the 15yearold law 
theres an old saying that if something isnt broke dont fix 
it said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services 
services committee well the war powers act is broken and it 
should be fixed 
the vietnamera law enacted over the veto of president nixon 
restricts the power of a president to send us military personnel 
to situations of imminent hostilities 
the current law requires a report from the president when such 
troops are dispatched under some circumstances those troops must 
be withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days unless congress specifically 
votes to authorize them to remain 
the new proposal would allow the troops to remain for an 
unspecified length of time unless congress votes to remove them 
in addition the proposal creates a group of 18 senior 
congressional leaders who would regularly meet with the president 
to discuss national security matters 
in situations of hostilities the group of congressional leaders 
could trigger the war powers law by introducing a resolution to 
either authorize the troops to remain or to order them withdrawn 
sen george mitchell dmaine said the regular consultations 
between the congressional leaders and a president will forge a 
stronger basis for bipartisan cooperation in national security 
matters 
meaningful and consistant consultation with the congress would 
also help prevent the president from implementing a controversial 
policy that congress could not responsibly change said mitchell 
all four presidents since the enactment of the war powers law 
have contended that it is an unconstitutional restriction on their 
authority 
the war powers act as presently constituted is unworkable 
said senate majority leader robert byrd dwva a cosponsor of 
the proposed change 
frankly if i were president i would thumb my nose at this 
legislation said byrd speaking of the existing law no 
president can indicate to a potential enemy plans such as the 
length of a proposed deployment of troops he said 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said he supports the change because the 
existing law has never worked very well 
every president resents a diminution of his power said 
warner explaining why the law has always been a focus of 
legislativeexecutive fights 
byrd and warner said the reagan administration had not been 
consulted in advance about the proposed change in the law 
i would hope the administration wont veto this said byrd 
he said hearings will be held later by the foreign relations 
committee 
warner said it will be up to the administration to look at 
this and see if they can support it 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee agreed that the present law does not seem to be 
working 
the latest fight over the war powers act involves reagans 
persian gulf policy of reflagging 11 kuwaitiowned tankers and 
protecting them with navy warships 
reagan has refused to invoke the law even though there have 
been four separate clashes between the navy and iran congress has 
debated trying to invoke the law but has been unable to agree on 
whether that should be done

syrian and iranian efforts to end a 
twoweek battle between rival shiite moslem militias remained 
deadlocked today as fighting raged on in south beirut where 
foreign hostages are believed held 
police said one man was killed and 10 people were wounded as the 
prosyrian amal militia bottled up in shiyah its last stronghold 
in the southern slums traded machine gun fire with the 
iranianbacked hezbollah 
todays casualties brought the overall toll to 244 killed and 
772 wounded since the fighting began may 6 in the 16squaremile 
district the man killed was a bystander who was checking on his 
damaged apartment police said 
a police spokesman said the fighting has settled into 
exchanges of machinegun fire as hezbollah or party of god 
tightens its grip on 90 percent of south beirut 
the spokesman who by regulation cannot be identified said most 
of those wounded today were civilians hit by rooftop hezbollah 
snipers 
syria on sunday massed 7500 troops and 500 tanks and armored 
vehicles on the southern western and northern edges of south 
beirut and its officers said the army was prepared to move in to 
quell the fighting 
however there was fear that such a move might endanger foreign 
hostages believed held in the slums 
the independent beirut daily newspaper annahar said meanwhile 
that iran was opposed to such a deployment and wants the syrians to 
send in only a limited disengagement force to separate the 
combatants 
annahar said the iranians also want guarantees that the syrian 
force would not seek to disarm hezbollah 
irans third demand annahar reported is that the issue of 
releasing the hostages be separated from the objectives of the 
syrian deployment the paper added without further elaboration 
most of the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon are believed held by 
hezbollahaffiliated zealots based in the southern slums 
acting iranian foreign minister ali mohammed besharati said on 
wednesday that the hostage issue will be solved once the 
fighting ends the case of kidnapping foreigners in lebanon is 
part of the crisis which lebanon is passing through i believe that 
if we could end the state of war currently prevailing then 
definitely the other case would be solved too he said 
in jerusalem today the us ambassador to the united nations 
vernon walters said he would talk with syrian officials in 
damascus to try to help secure the release of the nine american 
hostages in lebanon 
the nine include the longestheld foreign hostage terry 
anderson associated press chief middle east correspondent he was 
seized march 16 1985 
walters who leaves friday for the syrian capital would not 
detail his plans he said the trip was prompted by a concern for 
the safety of the hostages because of the fighting in south beirut 
meanwhile brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon said besharatis efforts to arrange 
a peaceful settlement were not succeeding 
the two met for 90 minutes on wednesday after which kenann 
said we are giving political efforts a chance to solve the 
problem and end the bleeding in south beirut 
the iranian embassy said besharati would meet later today with 
lebanese parliament speaker hussein husseini to pursue his 
efforts 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans main arab 
ally in the war with iraq however it recently has been alarmed by 
irans efforts to dispute its role in lebanon by trying to dominate 
the nations 12 million shiites through hezbollah lebanon has 
been embroiled in civil war since 1975

some 15000 umbrella strollers with small 
parts that may detach and pose a choking hazard are being recalled 
the consumer product safety commission announced today 
the strollers were made by services merchandise company of

president reagans spokesman said today there 
is no conflict resulting from vice president george bushs 
implied criticism of administration policy on panama 
im saying that he has his ideas on how hes going to want to 
do things and thats fine said marlin fitzwater the spokesman 
spoke one day after bushs aides suggested a break with reagan on 
the question of dismissing drugtrafficking indictments against 
panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
bush didnt mention noriegas name as he touted his own drug 
enforcement policies on wednesday in los angeles and he 
sidestepped reporters questions on the subject but an aide told 
a reporter president bush just wouldnt make a deal with a guy 
like noriega 
at his daily news briefing fitzwater was questioned about the 
white house view of bushs apparent move to distance himself from 
some of reagans policies 
we expect the vice president to be speaking out on how he 
would do things differently and what his opinions are fitzwater 
said 
as we go through this campaign i would expect to see the vice 
president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he 
would do he said i expect a number of them will be different 
than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way 
if you want to drive a wedge between the white house and the vice 
president forget it 
in his speech at the los angeles police academy wednesday bush 
said drug dealers are domestic terrorists killing kids and cops 
and they should be treated as such i wont bargain with terrorists 
and i wont bargain with drug dealers either whether they are on 
us or foreign soil 
bush didnt expand on those phrases and repeatedly refused to 
comment on the noriega situation directly 
but in background discussions aides said that if bush were to 
become president he wouldnt do what reagan is doing offering to 
drop drug indictments if noriega will yield his power in panama 
the vice president has never directly criticized the 
administrations dealings with the panamanian leader 
bushs latest pronouncement wrapped up a weeklong western 
campaign swing that had been dogged by reagan administration 
controversies those problems are sticking to bush he conceded 
tuesday helping drive down his ratings versus democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis 
the republican standardbearer used this trip to new mexico 
oregon california and washington to lay out some differences if 
not dramatic ones with reagan for example he called monday for 
action on acid rain where the administration has for the last 
seven years called only for more study 
the noriega situation is a particularly sticky one for bush for 
it hurts him on an issue drugs that aides say he wants to use 
against dukakis in the fall bush chief of staff craig fuller said 
the speech is the first of a series by the vice president on drugs 
asked why polls show democratic frontrunner michael dukakis is 
perceived as tougher on drugs fuller said 
the voters will get a chance to decide who will be tougher on 
drugs you can count on the vice president spending more time 
on the problem fuller added 
in words and actions bush worked wednesday to emphasize his 
commitment to fight drug abuse and his different approach from 
reagans 
the vice president began the day with a private meeting with los 
angeles police chief daryl gates and then visited a storefront 
raided by police earlier this month where the potent cocaine 
derivative crack was sold and used 
asked about the practical value of his visit to the onetime 
crack den bush bristled a bit 
its not show business he said anybody who has practical 
experience you learn more from them you try to learn and 
understand and then take actionits been extraordinarily 
helpful 
bush praised the reagan efforts to curb drug abuse but said he 
would do things differently for one he said he would make his 
vice president more than just the head of a task force on drug 
interdiction 
if im elected i will put my vice president in charge of 
every aspect of federal drug policy bush announced i will ask 
the vice president to head a cabinetlevel council of war to pull 
the effort together to make sure its carried out 
he repeated his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins 
ill demand stronger penalities for drug offenders mike 
dukakis and jesse jackson criticize our antidrug effort i 
readily concede theres room for improvement but i want them to 
join me on these tougher penalities this isnt democrat or 
republican bush said

the house banking committee voted unanimously 
today to require banks and credit unions to provide more timely and 
complete information on home equity loans or second mortgages 
under the bill passed by voice vote lenders would have to 
disclose prior to making a loan the annual interest percentage 
rate any fees associated with the loan a series of warnings about 
the risks involved and a description of repayment options 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the committees 
consumer affairs subcommittee said this legislation will 
provide consumers with important information regarding home equity 
lines of credit 
it will enable those consumers to understand fully the 
conditions of this new form of consumer borrowing said annunzio 
it will make clear to them that they risk the loss of their home 
in the event of default 
the american bankers association in a statement handed out in 
the committee room after the bill was approved said in recent 
months we have worked with legislators to ensure that the bill 
preserves the product by providing for creditors remedies in 
deteriorating loan situations 
however the disclosure and advertising provisions are 
impractical they will result in an unnecessary overload of 
information for consumers and they will severely limit the 
creditors ability to design informative advertisements the aba 
said 
the biggest difference in the measure approved today and the one 
which came out of the annunzio subcommittee in february was a 
provision barring lenders from unilaterally changing terms of the 
loans except in some instances 
traditionally in openend accounts a lender has reserved the 
right to change the terms of the loan said rep david e price 
dnc chief sponsor however this provision causes special 
problems in the home equity area the high initial fees the fact 
that the home is at risk and the large lines of credit involved 
make this unilateral right to change the terms of the loan 
undesirable in the home equity area 
a home equity loan disclosure bill has passed the senate as part 
of a bigger bank restructuring bill now being considered by the 
house banking committee a committee staffer said proponents wanted 
a separate bill to pass the house and be sent to the senate in case 
the bank restructuring measure is not approved

a us environmental organization said today 
it had agreed to help the soviet academy of sciences investigate 
and demonstrate energy conservation in homes and commercial 
buildings as a method of slowing the greenhouse warming of the 
earth 
the agreement between the academy and the natural resources 
defense council also calls for research help in minimizing the use 
in appliances of the chlorofluorocarbon refrigeration fluids which 
as gases help destroy the earths protective ozone layer 
those gases contribute to the expected warming of the earth but 
the major source of that warming will be carbon dioxide formed by 
the combustion of fossil fuels 
the united states and the soviet union together probably account 
for almost half the worlds emissions of carbon dioxide the 
council said 
among other things the agreement calls for construction of a 
building technology demonstration center in the soviet union 
visits to us sources of information demonstration of 
retrofitting energysaving devices such as insulating windows to 
residential buildings in the soviet union and drafting model 
building codes 
the agreement was signed in moscow last friday by the councils 
executive director john adams and academy official yevgheniy 
velikov 
the soviet union is believed to be one of the worlds most 
energyinefficient economies because most energy use is not 
regulated through a market 
many families still use open windows to regulate the 
temperature in their centrally heated apartments even in the dead 
of the soviet winter the worldwatch institute said in its 1988 
state of the world volume 
while us energy efficiency improved 23 percent from 1973 to 
1985 and japanese efficiency improved 31 percent soviet efficiency 
did not improve at all worldwatch said 
the institute a washington environmental policy research and 
advocacy organization has estimated that the soviet economy uses 
about 45 megajoules 125 kilowatt hours or almost 43000 btus per 
dollar of gross national product 60 percent more than the us 
economy in 1985 and more than three times the comparable figure for 
west germany 
the natural resources defense council founded in 1972 is a 
private group based in washington and new york that does research 
and advocacy on behalf of environmental causes it is perhaps best 
known for its frequently successful litigation against government 
agencies one survey two years ago by the magazine environmental 
forum concluded that it was the most effective of all the 
environmental groups that lobby congress 
it has engaged in joint research with soviet scientists on 
questions of verification of arms control agreements

the white house said today that the 
drugsmuggling indictments against panamanian ruler manuel antonio 
noriega were not brought to president reagan for advance approval 
but that it views the charges as a correct course 
even so the administration is ignoring senate appeals and 
appears intent on offering to drop the indictments in return for 
noriegas resignation as defense chief 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the national 
security council staff justice department officials and state 
department officials monitored the process as the indictment 
against noriega was being considered earlier this year 
it wasnt brought to the president for decision fitzwater 
said there was no questioning of it by the administration we 
still think its a correct course 
fitzwater said it doesnt do any good to go back and start 
secondguessing it now were standing by it were on a course and 
thats it 
asked to reconcile his assertion that the administration was 
sticking by its course with the reported offer to drop the charges 
fitzwater said indictments are very important to putting the 
pressure on him its all part of the process 
the state departments no 3 official michael armacost said 
wednesday that the objective is to find a way to remove noriega 
from politics and withdrawing the indictments may represent one 
means of accomplishing that goal 
armacost said that approach may be a worthwhile way of 
proceeding because noriega would be beyond the reach of us 
prosecutors so long as he remains in panama he noted that the us 
extradition treaty with panama does not provide for the extradition 
of panamanian nationals 
on tuesday the senate voted 8610 to approve a nonbinding 
resolution expressing opposition to dropping the indictments 
armacost made his remarks during a transatlantic interview with 
foreign reporters sponsored by the us information agency his 
statement broke what had been a prolonged news blackout by state 
department officials on the nature of the discussions with noriega 
the first indications that dropping the indictments was being 
discussed with noriega came last week from justice department 
officials speaking privately 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr said wednesday he 
is reasonably hopeful that the united states will succeed in 
removing noriega from power 
the negotiations are under way baker said our policy is 
that noriega must go and indeed that remains our commitment 
referring to the senate vote baker said he understands the 
frustration of his former colleagues 
the fact remains that the administration has a firm fixed 
policy that noriega must go and we are working very hard to see 
that that happens baker said were working very hard to see 
that that happens i am reasonably hopeful that well get that 
result but we dont have it yet 
meanwhile the los angeles times reported today that 
administration officials are now trying to depict the initial 
justice department decision to seek noriegas indictment as poorly 
thought out the newspaper which did not identify the 
administration sources reported that they also said the justice 
department did not submit the decision to reagan or baker for their 
approval 
however the justice department did consult with officials of 
the state and defense departments and with the white house 
national security council staff before the indictments were 
returned one official told the times 
white house spokeswoman leslye arsht said wednesday night she 
had no comment on the report 
president reagan asked wednesday whether a deal with noriega 
had been completed said i dont know 
asked whether the two sides were close to an agreement reagan 
gave the same response 
the negotiations with noriega are being carried out by michael 
g kozak a state department official who has spent much of this 
month in panama 
the plan reportedly calls for noriega to step down as commander 
of the panamanian defense forces in august and to leave panama for 
at least one year

wall streets underlying dread of another stock 
crash has been aggravated by two significant events an upward 
spike in interest rates and the first notable selling by big 
institutional investors in several weeks 
unresponsive to good news and obsessed with the bad the stock 
market took another sharp spill wednesday depressing the dow jones 
industrial average to its lowest point in more than three months 
broader market indexes also fell sharply 
prices weakened further this morning the dow average was down 
2486 points to 192623 by 11 am edt on wall street and losing 
stocks outnumbered gainers by nearly 5to1 on the new york stock 
exchange 
the declines themselves were not particularly new or alarming 
because prices have been bouncing up and down for a while in a 
postcrash market dominated largely by brokers buying and selling 
to each other 
what concerned investment professionals this time was an influx 
of sell orders from large institutional investors such as pension 
funds and mutual funds the flesh and bones of the stockholding 
public the selling suggested that these crucial investors are 
growing exasperated 
todays the first day ive seen some real institutional 
liquidations william king head trader at nikko securities co 
international in new york said as the selling intensified late 
wednesday youre getting some acknowledgement from institutional 
investors that theres a problem 
institutional selling partly was responsible for inflating the 
volume on the new york stock exchange where 20942 million shares 
were traded it was the first time the volume exceeded 200 million 
shares in more than a month 
to the technical strategists who attempt to plot the stock 
markets course based on mathematical formulas and past behavior 
the price drop signaled some serious concern as well 
the dow industrials fell 3532 points to 195109 on wednesday 
the lowest since feb 9 when it closed at 191446 at one point 
the average fell through 1950 which strategists have called an 
important support level 
in addition a drop in the dow transportation average which 
often precedes declines in the industrial average suggested prices 
would keep falling 
more disturbing to some strategists was the lack of support 
levels on their technical charts based on the markets movements 
since it plunged 508 points on black monday oct 19 to 173874 
between that level and the dow averages position now there have 
been only two stable points 1930 and 1860 
stock strategists who look at economics to predict the markets 
behavior said rising concern about inflation and interest rates was 
a key reason for wednesdays big selloff 
they were particularly alarmed by the bond market where prices 
tumbled and yields on the 30year treasury bond flirted with 93 
percent the highest point since the crash this has made bonds 
increasingly attractive as an alternative investment to stocks 
when the bond market started falling apart we saw quite 
substantial blocks of institutional selling in the stock market 
said jack barbanel a trading strategist at the new york investment 
firm gruntal amp co 
its certainly bearish for the stock market because 
institutions get out of the stock market when they can get 
riskcontrol yields elsewhere the bond market he said 
why take risks in a stock market that in the past three or 
four months has been volatile with not much volume to support it 
the flight to quality bonds and riskcontrolled investments is 
going to be the thing to do

federal judge alcee l hastings gave false 
trial testimony about draft letters and telephone calls in an 
attempt to hide his involvement in a bribery scheme a house 
impeachment panel was told today 
new york lawyer john doar summarized the evidence used by a 
special judicial panel in concluding that hastings who was 
acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges in 1983 had actually 
committed the crime and tried to conceal his part in the scheme 
hastings sat silently with his lawyers in the hearing room as 
the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice heard doar 
outline the judicial panels case for impeaching the miami judge 
doar said hastings gave knowingly false trial testimony 
about phone calls and draft letters purportedly made in behalf of 
an old friend hemphill pride who was seeking reinstatement as a 
lawyer after serving a prison sentence in connection with 
misappropriation of housing funds 
but doar said the judicial panels investigation concluded that 
the letters cited by hastings were intended to conceal his 
participation in the bribery scheme through false evidence he 
said hastings testimony about the phone calls also was knowingly 
false and intended to mislead the jury 
it was the second day of testimony by doar a former assistant 
us attorney general for civil rights in the mid1960s and special 
counsel to the house judiciary committee in its move to impeach 
president nixon in the watergate scandal a decade later 
the deliberate softspoken doar was selected by a special 
fivejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta to lead its exhaustive 3year investigation of hastings 
judicial conduct 
hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring to solicit a 
150000 bribe from two convicted racketeers 
but the judicial panel said it had found clear and convincing 
evidence that hastings conspired with washington lawyer william 
a borders to solicit the bribe in exchange for a promise of 
lenient sentences 
the panel also accused hastings of trying to conceal the sale 
of justice by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his 
highly publicized trial in miami five years ago 
hastings who was nominated to life tenure on the federal bench 
by president carter in 1979 has consistently denied any wrongdoing 
they found me not guilty of crimes i never committed he 
said wednesday at the start of impeachment hearings by the house 
judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice 
i am not guilty but i am not free said hastings the first 
black federal judge in florida his voice rising he declared 
i ask you in the name of decency in the name of justice in 
the name of the american jury system i ask you in the name of 
the american way of life i beg you i beseech you i implore you 
hell no i tell you and i demand of you that you set me free 
rep john conyers jr dmich the subcommittee chairman 
expressed concern that the case against hastings might be racially 
and politically motivated as hastings has charged in the past 
but rep george gekas of pennsylvania the ranking republican on 
the panel said hastings race played no part whatsoever in the 
impeachment inquiry 
following hastings to the witness table doar reviewed the 
massive evidence used by the appeals court judges in their 381page 
report charging hastings with impeachable misconduct 
the report was endorsed unanimously by the judicial conference 
of the united states the chief policymaking body of the federal 
judiciary which told house leaders that consideration of 
impeachment may be warranted 
doar and subcommittee members listened to a series of secretly 
taped conversations and telephone calls in late 1981 between boders 
and an fbi undercover agent posing as racketeer frank romano 
borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges of 
arranging the alleged bribe payment to hastings from romano and his 
brother thomas 
if the subcommittee recommends impeachment and the full 
judiciary committee concurs the house must vote whether to impeach 
hastings if impeached he would face a senate trial on the 
charges a twothirds senate majority would be required to convict 
hastings and remove him from office 
rep claude pepper dfla whose district includes miami 
entered the hearing room late wednesday shook hands with hastings 
and took a frontrow seat to listen to doars testimony for about a 
halfhour

a state department official said today there 
are indications the soviets will turn over facilities and equipment 
worth up to 1 billion to the afghan government after red army 
troops depart afghanistan 
michael armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
told reporters there have been indications that we have picked 
up that the soviets intend to leave behind equipment and 
installations perhaps a half billion or billion dollars worth 
that doesnt strike me as a demonstration of tremendous 
restraint armacost said reiterating a us policy that calls 
for continued supply of american aid to the afghan resistance 
forces as long as the soviets continue giving aid to the afghan 
government 
we will have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose 
armacost said of us deliveries 
when the united states and the soviet union signed an agreement 
setting the stage for the withdrawal of the estimated 115000 
soviet troops soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
rejected a us proposal that both superpowers stop aiding their 
clients in afghanistan 
us officials said however they still hoped the soviets would 
change their minds as the withdrawal proceeded it began several 
days ago and the first brigade of forces reached soviet territory 
on wednesday 
armacosts comments indicated those hopes may have been dashed 
at least according to the current indications 
he noted that there have been reports of fighting between soviet 
forces and the usbacked mujahadeen 
asked if the united states expected the soviets to ask us 
officials to urge restraint on the part of the resistance to 
facilitate the withdrawal armacost said the position weve 
taken on that has been generally a prompt timetable is one that is 
more likely to elicit cooperation from the mujahadeen 
he advised the soviets to make some kind of local 
arrangements with resistance leaders through direct talks to 
secure protection for the withdrawing soviet troops 
he said he had heard rumors of such arrangements in some areas

the number of new college graduates with 
agricultural degrees is down again this year but agriculture 
department officials say their job outlook is the brightest in a 
decade 
one official warned wednesday that the graduates are declining 
in number and that this could spell problems in critical food and 
agricultural specialities in the future 
the demand comes in part from recent advances in agricultural 
science and technology and from the need of us agribusiness to 
improve its position in international marketing said j patrick 
jordan administrator of the departments cooperative state 
research service 
despite the good news of greater job demand and recordhigh 
starting salaries jordan and college officials said the nations 
supply of graduates in agriculture majors continues to decline 
this year for example iowa state university graduated about 
500 agriculture majors down 35 to 40 from 1987 and purdue 
university graduated 225 down from 301 a year ago 
but salaries are looking up at iowa state starting salaries of 
graduates with bachelors degrees in agriculture are averaging just 
over 20000 a year the university of georgia estimates starting 
salaries near 19000 for those with bachelors degrees 24000 
for those with masters and 34000 to start for holders of 
doctoral degrees 
the university of california davis reported situation is 
bright for all food science graduates who will attract starting 
offers averaging 22000 to 36000 
at texas aampm agriculture graduates will average 17000 to 
26000 to start cornell university says its graduates with 
bachelor of science degrees will see salary offers running 4 
percent to 6 percent above last years average of 20406 
campus recruitment also has perked up with many businesses 
finding a shortage of new graduates to fill current openings 
the hottest spots in the job picture according to college 
officials include food science poultry production agricultural 
education agricultural chemistry and engineering dairy science 
agricultural journalism entomology landscape architecture and 
ornamental horticulture 
jordan said a usda panel forecasts a continuing national 
shortage of 4000 agriculture and life sciences graduates 
annually through 1990 some experts predict the shortage will 
continue beyond that date and that it will become more significant 
as good starting salaries and career opportunities draw off 
bachelor of science graduates who otherwise might obtain masters 
or doctoral degrees 
to a degree the laws of supply and demand will no doubt enter 
into play here so that more college students seeing that the 
agricultural professions offer good career opportunities will 
choose an agricultural major jordan said 
but he added that if collegebound young people fail to see the 
opportunities in agriculture then the nation may soon face a 
critical shortage of expertise in the food and agricultural 
sciences and professions

farmers will get a smaller share of what 
consumers spend on food this year according to a new agriculture 
department report 
the food marketing bill or the difference between consumer 
expenditures and the farm value of domestically produced food is 
expected to increase 66 percent in 1988 compared with a 47 
percent gain last year 
food marketing includes the costs of transporting processing 
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm 
while food expenditures will rise 48 percent about the same 
as the pace last year the farm value of food is expected to 
decline 1 percent because of bigger supplies and lower prices for 
livestock and poultry products the departments economic 
research service said wednesday 
during the first quarter consumer food costs rose 31 percent 
above a year earlier with much of the increase due to higher 
prices for fruit vegetables and fish 
prices for food served in restaurants and fastfood outlets 
rose a little faster than prices for food at home the report 
said for all of 1988 food prices are forecast to rise 2 percent 
to 4 percent from 1987 when they increased 41 percent 
the report continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers 
at 50 billion to 55 billion down from last years record of 57 
billion rising production costs and lower federal payments to 
farmers are factors in this years decline

world sugar production in 198889 is expected 
to be a record of about 1039 million metric tons slightly more 
than the 1038 million tons produced in 198788 says the 
agriculture department 
the latest figures announced wednesday included revisions from

at least 15 children became sick with an 
intestinal bacteria and health officials suspect tainted snow 
cones 
the children ages 15 months to 12 years were infected with the 
bacteria shigella and have symptoms of vomiting diarrhea 
abdominal cramps and fever said dr mary duffy knox county health 
director 
the illnesses began may 9 she said 
after talking with the children health officials figured the 
culprit could be snow cones from delivery trucks that circle 
knoxville neighborhoods 
but health department personnel have been unable to find the 
trucks duffy said no snow cone vendors have obtained the necessary 
permit to sell the cones 
these are usually kitchen operations and they sell the ice 
and sell the syrup to other people who in turn peddle it around 
she said

a 6yearold schoolyard preacher and his 
sister were suspended for a fourth time today for violating school 
rules 
now is the day of salvation 6yearold matthew strode 
shouted at a crowd of reporters schoolchildren and tv cameras as 
5yearold pepper stood beside him holding a bible hell has 
enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure 
the two children returning today from their third suspension 
arrived at eastfield elementary school in a car driven by their 
mother robin 
they stood at a teachers entrance and waited for a cue from 
their 10yearold brother duffey who was outside the school gate 
duffey was suspended for 10 days last friday for refusing to stop 
proselytizing and go to class 
for god so loved the world duffy called from the gate 
setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother 
fools make a mock at sin matthew shouted at principal jim 
gorst who asked him to come inside the school the boy stood his 
ground as gorst repeated his request several times 
the children are not being suspended for their preaching gorst 
said but rather for remaining outside the school building when 
school rules require them to be inside 
he said if the children would agree to come to school friday and 
discontinue preaching the suspension would be dropped 
gorst complained that the children were being encouraged by 
publicity 
if the news media was not here and if the offers for talk 
shows were not present i believe in my mind theyd be back in 
school he said 
pepper does not preach because she doesnt want to the 
childrens father david has said 
school officials call the preaching a disruption while parents 
have complained that the fireandbrimstone tone of the sermons is 
frightening other children 
but the childrens parents who moved to marion 17 months ago 
from pennsylvania call the suspensions an attack on their 
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of 
religion

democrat michael dukakis today criticized the reagan 
administration for proposing another indepth look at the nations 
drug problem saying we dont need another study george bushs 
statement that he wouldnt bargain with drug dealers prompted a 
white house spokesman to say he has his ideas on how hes going 
to do things and thats fine 
dukakis made a final appearance in new jersey before heading off 
to california both states part of the june 7 primary season 
finale californias will be the biggest primary of the season 
offering 314 democratic delegates with 109 at stake in new jersey 
in camden nj dukakis spoke with community leaders in a 
neighborhood marred by drug use and violence asked about president 
reagans announcement wednesday of a new bipartisan study on drugs 
he said i dont think we need another study 
there is no democratic or republican or independent way to 
fight this the massachusetts governor said 
bush wrapped up a sevenday west coast campaign swing on 
wednesday and made an antidrug message his central theme 
campaigning in los angeles he said that as president he 
wouldnt bargain with drug dealers whether they are on us 
or foreign soil 
although he repeatedly refused to state his views directly on 
the administrations attempts to cut a deal with panamanian leader 
manuel noriega who is under indictment on drug charges his aides 
said on background that the message was president bush just 
wouldnt make a deal with a guy like noriega 
at the white house today spokesman marlin fitzwater was drawn 
into a debate with reporters over bushs edging away from reagan 
administration policy 
im saying that he has his ideas on how hes going to want to 
do things and thats fine fitzwater said 
if you want to drive a wedge between the white house and the 
vice president forget it 
dukakis only remaining rival jesse jackson suggested that 
racist comments by irresponsible public leaders helped create 
the climate for an alleged assassination plot against him 
jackson campaigning in fresno calif was asked about this 
weeks arrest of a st louis couple accused of plotting to kill 
him londell williams and his wife tammy were also charged with 
threatening an informant and possessing an automatic rifle 
papers filed in federal court indicated londell williams told an 
informer he was a member of the order and other white supremacist 
groups and that jackson should be killed 
but lawyers for the couple said each denied belonging to a white 
supremacist group and the fbi said no evidence had been found that 
the pair belonged to the order 
jackson initially downplayed word of the arrests saying i 
cannot just focus on the two people arrested in st louis 
but later he told reporters the climate for this kind of 
antagonism and violence of course has been set by many 
irresponsible public leaders whose attacks based on race have set 
a divisive and dangerous climate such as the one in new york 
in april for example 
jackson was apparently referring to comments by new york city 
mayor ed koch during the new york primary campaign last month koch 
said among other things that jews would be crazy to vote for 
jackson 
jackson met privately wednesday with nearly three dozen rabbis 
and jewish leaders in los angeles in what he described as a step 
toward healing the wounds many jews were offended by jacksons 
1984 reference to new york as hymietown and his association 
with muslim leader louis farrakhan 
a dozen demonstrators outside the hollywood hotel where the 
session was being held chanted lose jesse lose and jew 
hater 
jackson was campaigning in california again today 
in los angeles the vice president stopped in at a storefront 
raided by police earlier this month where the potent cocaine 
derivative crack had been sold and used later he visited the los 
angeles police academy and said he would convene a cabinetlevel 
council of war against illegal drugs 
together we can coordinate an attack on the drug trade that 
will be nothing less than a modern dday said bush 
the delegate race is over on the republican side bush 
mathematically clinched the nomination last month in the 
pennsylvania primary 
on the democratic side dukakis has dramatically widened his 
delegate lead in recent weeks by the latest ap count he has 1643 
to jacksons 974 
jacksons campaign has written to democratic party chairman paul 
kirk complaining that under the delegateselection process the 
vote of the people is distorted 
jackson has long maintained that the support of socalled 
super delegates party and elective officials who have a vote 
at the convention should be roughly in line with the popular 
vote but under party rules the super delegates are not bound to 
follow primary results in their states 
the letter to kirk signed by jacksons campaign chief willie 
brown and jackson adviser walter fauntroy the district of 
columbias delegate to congress urged the party chairman to 
consider the moral and political questions raised by the rules 
a copy of the letter dated tuesday was sent to the dukakis 
camp 
dukakis however said he did not believe jackson would mount a 
challenge to delegates at the democratic convention 
i dont think we are going to have a fight with mr jackson 
he said 
the massachusetts governor who added a primary win in oregon to 
his column this week was in new jersey on wednesday where he met 
with local democratic leaders then mingled with patrons and served 
up beers at a restaurant in the waterfront city of hoboken

the war powers act a vietnamera law that has 
been the focus of a longrunning fight between the white house and 
congress would be overhauled by a proposal introduced thursday in 
the senate 
our goal is to make the statute more workable said senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva a sponsor of the reform 
measure 
commenting about the existing act byrd said frankly if i 
were president i would thumb my nose at this legislation the war 
powers act has never really worked 
the law was enacted in 1973 over the veto of president nixon 
who argued that it was an unconstitutional restriction on his 
authority that is the same position taken by all three subsequent 
presidents 
the law requires a report from the president when us military 
personnel are sent to situations of imminent hostilities under 
some circumstances those troops must be withdrawn after 60 days or 
90 days unless congress specifically votes to authorize them to 
remain 
the new proposal would let the troops remain for an unspecified 
length of time unless congress votes to remove them it also 
creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would 
regularly meet with the president to discuss national security 
matters 
presidents have not consulted adequately with congress prior 
to making decisions to involve the nation in a situation where 
hostilities are certain imminent or probable said byrd arguing 
that the new 18member group would change that 
the congressional leadership group could trigger the war powers 
law by introducing a resolution to either authorize the troops to 
remain or to order them withdrawn 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said he believes the change is a good idea 
because the current law has never worked very well 
warner said he doesnt know whether president reagan will back 
the change 
it will be up to the administration to look at this and see if 
they can support it said warner explaining that administration 
approval was not sought by the group of legislators who drafted the 
plan 
byrd said i would hope the administration wont veto this 
he said action is likely later this year by congress 
sen george mitchell dmaine said that the war powers act is 
a good example of the limited ability of human beings to predict 
future events 
it was written for the vietnam war said mitchell and has 
been difficult to apply to current situation of small brief 
military clashes or terrorist situations 
the most recent dispute over the war powers act involves 
reagans persian gulf policy of reflagging 11 kuwaitiowned tankers 
and protecting them with navy warships navy vessels have also been 
authorized to aid neutral merchant vesels which seek help 
reagan has refused to invoke the law even though there have 
been four separate clashes between the navy and iran congress has 
debated trying to invoke the law but has been unable to agree on 
whether that should be done 
last year 115 legislators went to federal court and filed suit 
seeking an order directing reagan to invoke the law but the suit 
was thrown out of court and the legislators are now appealing that 
ruling 
mitchell said the law was well intentioned but it has not 
worked we have spent countless hours proposing filibustering and 
debating measures to invoke a law rather than assessing the 
wisdom of the policy that prompted the deployment of forces 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said theres an old saying that if something isnt broke dont 
fix it well the war powers act is broken and it should be fixed 
nunn said the law encourages confrontation rather than 
consultation between the presidents and congress when forces are 
introduced the debate in the congress is frequently on procedure 
rather than policy 
warner said many of the problems in the current law arise 
because every president resents a diminuation in his power 
the law was approved in november 1973 despite the veto by nixon 
the house voted 284135 to override nixons veto while the senate 
vote was 7518 
backers of the law argued that it was needed because nixons 
vietnam policies were usurping the congressional right to declare 
war 
since the law was enacted presidents have formally submitted 
reports on a dozen occasions although they have rarely cited the 
section of the law which triggers the 60day time period for a 
congressional vote

jose cura was by many accounts a 
gentle dentist 
but he gave up his license three weeks ago when officials 
learned he never went to dental school 
cura 46 was trained in the army as a dental technician and 
easily passed floridas dental exam seven years ago his lawyer 
harold m braxton said 
he treated more than 3500 patients 
he learned a lot of techniques in the army braxton said 
he just watched observed and started reading a lot of books 
doctors praised him as highly competent and patients said he 
was generous and had a knack for putting them at ease and getting 
rid of pain 
state licensing officials alleged that cura forged transcripts 
indicating he had attended the university of havana 195863 and had 
received a doctors degree in dental surgery they said cura 
actually was a high school student in new jersey from 195860 
we were absolutely thunderstruck and flabbergasted said 
robert t ferris an altamonte springs dentist who chairs the state 
board of dentistry 
cura told state officials he plans to go dental school but the 
board last month rejected his request for a license suspension 
until he graduated state officials said wednesday no decision has 
been made on criminal charges 
bill oneil general counsel for the department of professional 
reguation said he wished cura would go to dental school because he 
did a good job 
curas undoing was person who wrote anonymously to the 
department saying that on a visit to curas office he noticed no 
degrees on the walls and began to investigate 
i am asking you for all the innocent people that put their 
lives in his hands on a daily basis and trust him wth surgery 
without even imagining that he has never had university studies and 
does not know what he is doing the letter said 
cura couldnt be reached but braxton said he was contrite 
id say remorseful is a very good word the lawyer said 
he comitted a wrong theres no question about it

one of the worlds most successful filmmakers 
and a legendary film company release a 55 million cinematic gamble 
on friday with the opening of the medieval fantasy willow 
both george lucas whose star wars and indiana jones 
movies have grossed 1 billion and mgm which once was hollywoods 
greatest studio need a hit the movie is directed by ron howard 
who won acclaim with splash and cocoon 
lucasfilm ltd has produced two expensive flops labyrinth 
and howard the duck mgm meanwhile is struggling to regain 
momentum after several reorganizations as a further complication 
financier kirk kerkorian who owns 824 percent of the parent 
mgmua communications is seeking a buyer for the company a 
willow hit would enhance the price 
despite some early negative reviews for the movie which goes 
into 1000 theaters nationwide friday mgm and lucas can be proud 
of their achievement willow is movie storytelling in the grand 
tradition 
no it isnt a landmark film such as the star wars trilogy 
the kind of achievement that happens once a decade much of 
willow may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special 
effects movies of recent years or to animated classics from disney 
but willow stands on its own merits as high adventure 
executed with superior imagination 
theater owner and reviewer screenings drew mixed responses 
daily variety called the film a medieval mishmash but predicted 
kids will probably love it time magazine said for now 
lucas wonder wand is broken newsweeks headline was the 
raider of lost art 
facing blockbuster competition from rambo iii and 
crocodile dundee ii on may 25 mgm prudently released 
willow five days earlier 
willow centers on the efforts of a brave dwarf to save a 
baby from the clutches of an evil queen who fears the child will 
destroy her power the hero willow finds allies in an 
overthehill knight and a pair of mischievous brownies 
creatures 9 inches tall 
there are no major stars in the film which features val kilmer 
top gun joanne whalley dance with a stranger jean 
marsh upstairs downstairs and 19yearold warwick davis as 
willow the 3foot4 davis was discovered by lucas a few years ago 
and cast as an ewok in return of the jedi 
the producers count on a boxoffice success to help their 
massive merchandising campaign more than 30 companies have been 
licensed to manufacture such items as willow underwear bed 
sheets lunch boxes meal promotion at wendys coloring sets toy 
action figures computer and board games magic tricks records 
tapes and compact discs 
willow resulted from a friendship between lucas and howard 
who met 15 years ago when lucas directed american grafitti 
with howard as one of the principal actors 
lucas was just out of usc film school directing his first major 
film under the sponsorship of his friend francis coppola howard 
had been an actor from the age of 5 working mostly in tv series 
such as the courtship of eddies father the andy griffith 
show and happy days 
they met again a few years ago howard recalled their 
conversation in a recent interview 
lucas id like to do a fantasy 
howard thats something id like to do 
lucas ive always wanted to do a story that centered on a 
little person 
howard thats something ive always wanted to do too ive 
always been intrigued by the idea of taking a little person or the 
relationship of two little people and developing it so that 15 or 
20 minutes into the picture youd forget completely that the person 
was small 
willow was the result with lucas creating the story bob 
dolman writing the script and howard directing 
among the directors many chores was preserving believability in 
the happenings of another world 
fantasy works best when everyone involved in a project 
writer producer director and certainly the actors believe what 
theyre doing and try to be as honest as possible howard said 
the actors really had to trust that it was ok to look at a 
talking animal and play a scene just as if that creature was an 
important character in your life gee they all really committed to 
it thats the only way you can make a movie like this one 
shooting locations for willow ranged from the glacial 
mountains of new zealand to the craggy cliffs of wales with 
interiors at the elstree studio near london 
the cost of willow has been reported from 35 million to 40 
million with 20 million for prints and advertising howard 
declined to confirm the amount 
this is an escapist movie and i dont want people thinking 
what it cost when a lot of soldiers charge down a mountain when 
theres an amazing special effect i dont want them whipping out 
their pocket calculators and saying by my estimate 
i want them to say oh wow whats going to happen next

the house banking committee on thursday 
unanimously approved legislation requiring lenders to make full 
disclosure on home equity loans 
the bill also is designed to put an end to the use of unfair 
contract provisions and misleading advertisements 
committee chairman fernand j st germain dri said the 
measure contains the kind of disclosures that will enable a 
consumer to make a reasoned judgment with the full understanding of 
what lies down the road 
the legislation he said assures that the consumer will not be 
surprised by unilateral changes in terms after the contract is in 
force 
the legislation is a major protection against consumers being 
duped by misleading claims and falling into financial traps that 
could lead to loss of a home st germain said 
the bill requires banks and credit unions to disclose important 
information about the terms and conditions of the loan such as the 
various repayment options with the application and before fees are 
required current law allows lenders to withhold disclosures until 
the consumer is about to sign on the dotted line 
lenders also would be required to tell the consumer about all 
fees which may charged in connection with the loan and whether or 
not the terms disclosred are guaranteed to remain in effect for a 
specific period of time 
the full committee amended the measure that came out of the 
consumer affairs subcommittee on feb 24 by making more stringent a 
provision prohibiting lenders from unilaterally changing the terms 
of the contract after it has been signed except in narrow 
circumstances 
the bill also limits lenders from calling in the loan before the 
due date except in narrow circumstances and requires lenders 
offering variable interest rate programs to use an index which is 
outside their control and is publicly available 
the consumer also is protected from misleading statements or 
halftruths in advertisements if an ad tells of a superlow 
shortterm rate it will also have to display in equal prominence 
what the normal rate would be all ads will have disclose the 
hidden cost such as fees and points 
leslie gainer representing us public research group said 
lenders have insisted on onesided contracts which allow them to 
change the terms at any time after the borrower has signed on the 
dotted line the house banking committee has corrected this 
inequity by prohibiting the lender from altering the terms after 
the contract has been signed by both parties 
michelle meier representing consumers union said these 
loans can be land mines for some consumers the house bill will 
give consumers the information they need to keep in a financial 
safety zone 
home equity loans a line of credit available to borrowers who 
provide their homes as collateral have grown quite popular in 
recent years especially since the federal tax law that went into 
effect last year still makes the interest on them tax deductible in 
most cases 
consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between 
1986 and 1987 from 40 billion to 80 billion 
the senate has passed a less stringent measure as part of a 
bigger bank restructuring bill which is now before the house 
banking committee a committee aide said proponents wanted a 
separate bill in case the restructing bill gets bogged down 
the american bankers association said in a statement that the 
trade group had worked with legislators to ensure that the bill 
preserves the product by providing for creditors remedies in 
deteriorating loan situations 
however the disclosure and advertising provisions are 
impractical said the statement they will result in an 
unnecessary overload of information for consumers and they will 
severely limit the creditors ability to design informative 
advertisements

in a painfully slow ballet george bush is 
delicately stepping away from ronald reagan 
each step is carefully choreographed as the cautious republican 
vice president tries to define what he would do as president 
without undermining or angering the president 
the republican nomineetobe cannot win without convincing 
americans he is his own man but he cannot break with reagan 
dramatically for that would shatter bushs hold on the 
conservative foundation of his bid for the white house 
and bush does want to be identified with low unemployment 
continuing prosperity and a declining trade deficit all current 
conditions the reagan administration brags about 
but he is falling in the polls against democratic frontrunner 
michael dukakis in part because he has failed thus far to paint 
for the voters a vivid picture of what he would do as president 
as new jersey gov tom kean said thursday ronald reagan is a 
very popular man but nobody wants a clone 
the white house appeared to ease the way for bush when spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said he has his ideas on how hes going to want 
to do things and thats fine 
a weeklong trip through the west demonstrated graphically the 
easy and the hard choices bush must make in the next six months to 
try to put together a winning coalition in the fall 
in the pacific northwest bush hit hard on protecting the 
environment proclaiming that the government must do more 
he didnt directly criticize the environmental record of the 
administration but he did break cleanly with reagan on one issue 
monday bush said he would act to stop the sources of acid rain 
while the administration just wants to study the problem more 
this was an easy one for bush for the environment is close to a 
motherhood issue no one is against clean air and clean water even 
though there are disagreements on how to achieve those goals 
and acid rain is not a burning issue for reagan nor is it one 
that is central to the basic gop constituencies 
the hard choices for bush come in packages like the 
administrations dealings with panamanian strongman manuel noriega 
the reagan justice department indicted noriega for involvement 
in drugrunning but the white house is thinking of dropping the 
indictments if noriega will give up power 
bushs first reaction was to say that talking about sensitive 
matters is a mistake of course the white house was talking 
albeit carefully about the negotiations 
next the vice president said he wanted noriega out of panama 
leaving the impression perhaps that a deal dropping the charges 
was all right 
then bush tried yet another formulation with yet a different 
emphasis he said friday in san diego he wanted noriega brought 
to justice 
that meant he was against dropping the indictment right bush 
wouldnt say and neither would aides it was a precisely vague 
phrase for bringing someone into court is only one meaning of 
justice 
this careful wording didnt draw the attention bush wanted and 
thus didnt deal with the problem 
at every stop reporters shouted questions to the gop 
heirapparent on noriega bush would smile and just say nothing 
wednesday brought yet another effort 
drug dealers are domestic terrorists killing kids and cops 
and they should be treated as such bush said at the los angeles 
police academy i wont bargain with terrorists and i wont 
bargain with drug dealers either whether they are on us or 
foreign soil 
he didnt say noriega and aides were quick to say he was not 
talking about the current situation only what he would do in the 
future 
now there was no doubt that bush wanted to leave the impression 
that he simply would not cut a pleabargaining deal with noriega 
to say it clearly would have been critical of reagan and a step 
into the middle of a mess bush would like to avoid as much as 
possible 
so bush tried to say it without saying it 
but the problem is a simple one it does not answer the basic 
question what does bush think of the proposed deal 
so the questions will continue as long as noriega is on the 
front pages 
likewise with the scandals swirling around attorney general 
edwin meese bush has refused to comment and so he faces 
questioning almost every day on whether or not he thinks meese 
should resign 
bush aides will talk privately about the need for the vice 
president to step away from reagan but bush himself is the one 
arguing the time is not yet ripe for clear and definitive moves 
the problem for bush as an aide once said is that he is the 
velcro candidate everything sticks to him to win in the fall 
that must change for bush

a court has fined two organizers of a 
fishing contest about 700 each for cruelty to animals ruling that 
fish feel pain when hooked and pulled from the water 
the april 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animal 
rights group against a local angling club that staged a fishing 
contest two years ago 
the object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catch 
the most pounds of fish in two days after the fish were pulled in 
and weighed they were returned to the water 
civil court judge horst brinkmann based his decision on 
testimony of experts called in to determine whether or not fish 
feel pain when hooked and if they suffered during the time they 
were out of the water 
four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate and 
labored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the water 
indicated that they feel pain 
brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were 
quickly killed and if they were caught for useful purposes but he 
added that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which 
angler was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually cruel 
treatment 
fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine 
who has won brinkmann ruled

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis responded thursday to president reagans call for a 
bipartisan task force on drugs by criticizing administration 
cutbacks on money for drug education and enforcement 
i have no problem with another study the massachusetts 
governor told a news conference but he then added i dont think 
we need another study 
dukakis said that in 1985 reagan signed a sweeping drug 
education prevention act and then four months later cut 50 
percent from the funding that had been agreed upon 
there are modest sums that have been appropriated by congress 
for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war 
against drugs the president is the one who zeroed them out he 
said 
apparently unwilling to flatly reject reagans call for a 
bipartisan effort dukakis said this is a bipartisan issue 
there is no question about that there is no republican or 
democratic or independent way to fight it 
dukakis campaigned half a day in new jersey before flying to 
california on thursday 
they are the two biggest states holding primaries on june 7 the 
day dukakis hopes to bring his delegate total over the 2081 needed 
to lock up the democratic presidential nomination 
he denied he was already looking at potential running mates 
there was not a word of truth in that article he said of a 
washington post story that said dukakis aides were looking closely 
at sens john glenn of ohio and bill bradley of new jersesy for the 
second spot on the ticket 
bradley has said he isnt interested 
i havent even thought about it said dukakis 
after the last democratic primaries on june 7 he said there 
will be plenty of time to be thinking about running mates 
he added that no member of his staff was authorized to discuss 
the selection process 
he said he would make his choice thoughtfully and with a 
certain amount of reflection

communist party delegates gather friday 
to consider changes in hungarys divided leadership including the 
possible replacement of party leader janos kadar 
kadar the partys general secretary since the soviets crushed a 
revolt in 1956 has been increasingly blamed for hungarys 
deepening economic crisis and for resisting political reforms 
kadar has come to personify the mistakes that have been made 
in the past said a prominent party official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified further 
no real change can occur as long as he remains on top the 
official said adding that a growing number of party members wants 
to see him step down 
hungarys communist leaders are under mounting pressure from 
both inside and outside the party to adopt political reforms as a 
first step in revitalizing the nations stagnating economy 
last week the partys central committee said personnel changes 
would be high on the conference agenda fueling speculation kadar 
would be asked to step aside 
however western diplomatic sources say there is still no clear 
indication that kadar intends to relinquish control soon 
the situation is very fluid and the outcome of the 
conference is almost impossible to predict said a western 
diplomat who requested anonymity 
any changes in the party leadership would likely be announced 
after a central committee meeting scheduled for sunday 
while kadar pioneered reforms that made the country relatively 
prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s a series of recent economic 
setbacks and austerity measures imposed to curb them have angered 
many hungarians 
premier karoly grosz a leading contender to succeed kadar has 
said that the political future of the party leader may be up for 
debate during the conference the first since 1957 
kadar has said in recent interviews that he would step down if 
asked 
in addition to personnel issues some 900 delegates are to 
debate a package of economic refoms and proposals for modest 
political changes drafted by kadar 
reformists in the party say the political reforms which 
include provisions for secret ballots limited terms of office for 
party officials and multicandidate elections do not go far enough 
imre pozsgay an outspoken central committee member and a 
leading proponent of reforms has called for changes in the 
constitution that would provide for referendums and guarantee the 
independence of a growing number of political interest groups 
pozsgay leader of the communist sponsored peoples patriotic 
front has also urged that the leading role of the communist party 
be reviewed 
the central committee announced last week that the delegates 
would discuss the partys tasks and the development of the 
political system 
a commentary published in the latest edition of magyar ifjusag 
the official newspaper of the hungarian communist youth union also 
called for changes saying that internal instransigence within 
the party has come to hamper roads to reform 
the economic weekly figyeloe said in an editorial thursday that 
the conference will be a turning point in hungarys national 
destiny 
economic reforms cannot be separated from the political 
sphere the editorial said 
a gross foreign debt of more than 17 billion and rising 
inflation led hungarys leaders this year to impose eastern 
europes first personal and value added taxes 
many hungarians whose standard of living has been hit hard by 
the measures are calling for more of a voice in hungarys economic 
and political affairs

the judge who declared a mistrial in a conspiracy 
case against political extremist lyndon larouche has scheduled a 
new trial for october and challenged a defense request to question 
oliver north who larouche claims tried to ruin him 
although us district judge robert e keeton has set the trial 
for oct 3 he will first have to rule on defense contentions that 
retrying larouche and his followers would violate their 
constitutional protection against being tried twice on the same 
charges 
keeton last week ordered defense lawyers to submit written 
arguments on the double jeopardy issue by july 15 and given 
assistant us attorney john markham until aug 1 to respond 
keeton is expected to rule before a sept 8 status hearing 
keeton declared the mistrial last month following complaints 
from several jurors who had been told when the trial began in 
december that it would last about six months but later were told it 
might last up to a year 
the judge was careful to note he blamed the mistrial both on 
lengthy hearings needed because of alleged government withholding 
of documents from defense lawyers and on agressive behavior by 
defense lawyers a comment widely interpreted as an indication 
keeton would reject arguments that larouche and the others cannot 
be retried because the mistrial was the prosecutions fault 
larouche six aides and five larouche political groups were 
charged with conspiring to obstruct a 1986 federal grand jury 
investigation of allegations that larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign raised more than 1 million through credit card fraud and 
another 1 million or more through loan fraud 
larouche who is making his fourth run for the presidency 
contends the fbi and cia infiltrated his organizations because of 
reagan administration anger at his refusal to support efforts to 
arm the contra rebels in nicaragua larouche contends the 
infiltration and fabrication of evidence of fraud was directed by 
north the former marine lieutenant colonel who ran a contra 
resupply network from the white house at a time when such aid was 
prohibited by congress 
defense lawyers have sought to question north from the outset of 
the case and stepped up the effort three months ago after obtaining 
a declassified memo written to north in which another key player in 
the irancontra affair retired air force maj gen richard secord 
mentioned an associates efforts to gather info against 
larouche 
keeton last week ordered defense lawyer william moffitt who is 
handling the north request to refine his lengthy arguments on the 
request in a memo outlining what testimony defense lawyers believe 
north could give that would be relevant to the case 
markham has opposed the request and said that he likely would 
have to grant north immunity if keeton ordered him to testify 
because north is under indictment for his role in the irancontra 
scandal

a jewish group asked a french 
bank thursday for financial records to trace millions of dollars 
earmarked for holocaust survivors that allegedly were embezzled by 
the groups former leader 
jewish officials said it was still not certain how much money 
late central jewish council leader werner nachmann allegedly took 
nor where the funds went 
hesse state radio without citing sources said that nachmann 
may have embezzled up to 24 million a much higher figure than 
previously reported some of the money appears to have gone to a 
fashion store nachmann owned the radio said 
the radio station also said higherlevel officials moved to 
block a karlsruhe tax office audit of nachmanns records in 1980 
but the tax offices director bernhard schmitt flatly denied the 
report 
no audit of his nachmanns accounts was ever ordered and 
could therefore not have been blocked schmitt said in an 
interview 
heinz galinski who took over the councils leadership after 
nachmanns death in january was to meet with an aide to chancellor 
helmut kohl friday to discuss the incident 
galinski said he and the kohl assistant wolfgang schaeuble 
would seek to determine whether government officials should have 
better monitored the flow of money paid by west german for 
holocaust survivors 
galinski in an interview said the jewish council had asked the 
karlsruhe branch of the bank societe generale alsacienne for full 
financial records of nachmanns transactions 
the french bank handled some of nachmanns accounts and an 
account belonging to the jewish council according to galinski 
galinski said earlier this week that nachmann appeared to have 
embezzled about 6 million since 1980 
the nachmann familys attorney peter paepcke said he believes 
nachmann apparently took the money to help bolster his failing 
karlsruhebased textile business but added that he had been unable 
to trace the funds 
the attorney filed for bankruptcy for nachmanns heirs and his 
business on march 30 the proceedings opened thursday paepcke said 
nachmann president of the jewish council from 1965 until his 
death at age 62 in january was in charge of disbursing the 
government funds to holocaust survivors around the world 
about 236 million was allocated by the west german government 
in 1980 for holocaust survivors who had not previously made 
reparations claims 
on wednesday karlsruhe prosecutors said they would seek to 
determine whether other people may have been involved in the 
embezzling case 
nachmanns family fled nazi germany to france in 1938 he 
returned in 1945 and began working toward reestablishing jewish 
communities in the country 
about 530000 jews lived in germany when the nazis took power in 
1933 west germany has about 30000 jewish residents today

jury selection began today in former gov 
evan mechams criminal trial on charges of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan 
about 100 prospective jurors filed into the maricopa county 
superior court room and then were sworn in the first step in 
choosing a jury for the ousted governor and his brother willard 
the mechams did not attend todays court session the former 
governors attorney michael scott said mecham probably would 
attend next week after the field is narrowed and questioning of 
prospective jurors begins 
on wednesday a state supreme court justice refused a defense 
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense 
motion to return the charges to the state grand jury however the 
justice agreed that the supreme court will hear arguments on that 
issue june 1 
the state court of appeals rejected a defense claim monday that 
the mechams were denied substantial procedural rights in the 
grand jury process 
the former governor said he could not predict whether he will 
fare any better in court than he did at his state senate 
impeachment trial the senate removed the 64yearold republican on 
april 4 a year into his first term 
i havent broken any laws mecham said wednesday i looked 
at the laws my attorney looked at the laws weve had experts look 
at the laws we havent broken any of them 
the prospective jurors were given a questionnaire worked out by 
the prosecution defense and trial judge michael ryan and designed 
to ferret out obvious bias for or against the former governor 
please do not withhold any information in order to be seated 
on this jury ryan told the prospective jurors 
the 99 questions included whether the prospective jurors know 
anyone involved in the mecham case and whether they signed or 
circulated petitions for or against mecham while he was governor 
others asked about favorite television shows and whether 
prospective jurors have bumper stickers on their cars 
the field is to be narrowed by the attorneys and judge with the 
remaining prospective jurors to be called back for questioning 
either monday or tuesday 
mecham faces six felony counts on three charges perjury 
filing false documents and fraud accusing him of concealing a 
350000 campaign loan willard mecham who was his brothers 1986 
campaign treasurer faces three similar counts 
prosecutors said the mechams failed to report the loan from 
tempe developer barry wolfson on personal or campaign financial 
statements until after a newspaper reported the contribution 
the former governor could face up to 22 years in prison if he is 
convicted on all six counts 
if the attorneys are unable to choose an impartial jury from the 
initial pool of 100 scott has said he probably will seek either to 
dismiss the charges or to move the trial to another location 
scott said other motions may be filed before trial testimony 
begins probably after memorial day both sides have said they 
expect testimony to take two to three weeks 
in papers filed wednesday with the state supreme court defense 
attorneys said the mechams were entitled to an adequately 
informed and properly instructed grand jury 
instead the attorney generals office in its inordinate 
thirst for an indictment and perhaps the celebrity that 
prosecuting a controversial governor can bring repeatedly tested 
the very limits of judicial tolerance to which they might go in the 
manipulation of this grand jury the defense said 
mechams attorneys contend that prosecutors were not justified 
in pursuing a grand jury indictment after an earlier grand jury was 
disbanded 
also wednesday the defense asked ryan to reconsider a claim 
that the mechams were victims of selective prosecution 
ryan has rejected several other defense motions including a 
proposed change of venue and a motion by willard mecham for 
separate trials 
mecham was convicted in the senate of trying to thwart a death 
threat investigation and of misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership 
he also was impeached on charges of concealing the 350000 
loan but the senate decided not to consider that charge for fear 
of prejudicing mechams criminal trial

vice president george bush received an open invitation from the 
white house thursday to express policy differences without fearing 
criticism in any way from president reagan michael dukakis hit 
administration cutbacks in money for drug education 
dukakis democratic challenger jesse jackson campaigned on the 
west coast but spent most of the day in private meetings 
bush who has the republican presidential nomination locked up 
also spent most of the day working privately but the political 
repercussions continued from his declaration on wednesday that he 
would not negotiate with drug dealers an implied disagreement 
with administration talks with manuel noriega the panamanian 
general facing drug charges in this country 
the vice presidents comment dominated the daily press briefing 
at the white house where spokesman marlin fitzwater said no 
offense was taken by the president 
as we go through the campaign i would expect to see the vice 
president speaking out on a number of issues he said i expect 
a number of them will be different than existing policies and 
we will not we will not criticize them in any way 
at the same time fitzwater defended the administrations 
approach to noriega which white house chief of staff howard baker 
has likened to plea bargaining 
but the spokesman also gave these words of advice to white house 
reporters if you want to drive a wedge between the white house 
and the vice president forget it 
bush received his freeexpression pass from the white house as 
public opinion polls showed him losing ground to dukakis the 
allbutcertain democratic nominee a decline widely believed 
linked in part to controversies involving noriega and embattled 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
the vice president who stressed his loyalty to reagan during 
the early competitive weeks of the primary campaign has been 
receiving unsolicited advice from republican allies that he needs 
to establish his own identity with the voters 
ronald reagan is a very popular man but nobody wants a 
clone said new jersey gov thomas kean interviewed while 
visiting london he must separate himself from ronald reagan 
dukakis spent part of the day campaigning in new jersey before 
flying to california the two states are among four that hold 
primary elections on june 7 the last day of the democratic primary 
season 
dukakis is heavily favored to defeat jesse jackson in both those 
primaries and aides say he will have enough delegates to assure 
his nomination by the time the results of those elections are 
counted 
the massachusetts governor responded mildly to reagans call for 
a bipartisan drug study commission i have no problem with 
another study he said although he also added i dont think 
we need another study 
dukakis also criticized the administration as he spoke to 
community leaders in a camden nj neighborhood known for drug 
problems 
he said that in 1985 reagan signed a sweeping drug education 
prevention act and then four months later cut the funding in half 
there are modest sums that have been appropriated by congress 
for state and local law enforcement agencies to fight this war 
against drugs the president is the one who zeroed them out he 
said

a pastor charged with raping two teenagers 
required members of his church to turn over their savings accounts 
to him and furnish tax records to prove they were giving enough to 
the church 
law enforcement sources also said wednesday that newlywed 
members of the rev thomas streitferdts true church of god were 
required to honeymoon at a churchowned resort in mexico and to 
register babies at the churchs school 
in order to get to heaven he told his congregants they had to 
be buried at the churchowned cemetery in new jersey according to 
the sources who spoke on condition their names not be used 
streitferdt took complete personal charge of the savings 
accounts of many of his members and offered them other banking 
services the sources said 
he is free on 25000 bail following his arraignment monday on 
two counts each of firstdegree rape and firstdegree sodomy 
involving two sisters age 14 and 16 a hearing was scheduled for 
friday 
a brooklyn minister who spoke wednesday on condition of 
anonymity said some members of streitferdts church said that the 
pastor required them to show him their w2 forms to prove they were 
giving part of their incomes to the church 
the minister said members of the church located in a poor 
harlem neighborhood called him fearing they would be charged with 
tax violations following news reports of questionable financial 
activities by streitferdt 
law enforcement sources said tax and financial records of the 
church and streitferdt will be subpoenaed the sources said a 
twoyear investigation showed the pastor registered possessions in 
the name of a church or religious group 
among the possessions is a 14 million waterfront estate on 
long island where the pastor who is white lives with his wife 
who is black it also includes several mercedesbenz automobiles 
property in the virgin islands a honeymoon resort in acapulco and 
the rose hill cemetery in linden nj 
everything is owned by the church confirmed streitferdts 
lawyer ben herzweig who added its a legitimate church he 
called streitferdt an honorable deeply religious man who tries 
his best to help people 
the law enforcement sources said streitferdt had churches in 
other cities including elmira and syracuse and in the caribbean 
to finance purchase of the properties including the lavish 
harlem church streitferdt required an annual 10 percent tithe from 
his 700 members except every third year when he required 30 
percent 
streitferdt required that children born to congregants be 
registered for a fee with the churchs school at the age of 6 
months sources said tuition is 600 at the school which is not 
regulated by the state because it does not go through the 12th 
grade or offer diplomas 
the harlem church dedicated in 1975 was locked wednesday a 
church employee said streitferdt was not in the building but would 
conduct services sunday morning

sea world trainers have returned to the water 
to train with killer whales under stricter safety guidelines but 
no performances with humans and the giant mammals together are 
scheduled 
i would say that the biggest change is in the raised 
experience level of the trainers said michael scarpuzzi the 
marine parks new director of training from now on trainers 
have to have a minimum of four years of experience before they can 
even get in the water 
scarpuzzi would not specify when the trainers would go back into 
the pool for performances but he said wednesday it probably woudl 
be soon 
the trainers were ordered out of the water following a series of 
accidents last year including one in november in which a trainer 
with two years of experience was critically hurt when a whale 
landed on him during a show 
in response william jovanovich chairman of harcourt brace 
jovanovich inc sea worlds parent company ordered trainers out 
of the water during shows and fired three executives one of the 
executives later was reinstated 
jovanovich also vowed that humans would never again enter the 
water with killer whales which had become a trademark of the 
aquatic park 
i dont think it was ever their intent to just say flat out 
no scarpuzzi said i know the chairman said that but it was 
said during a very emotional time

a mountain of castoff clothing offered 
free in a pasture to bargain hunters who pay 5 to park could 
become north carolinas hottest tourist attraction this weekend 
authorities say 
we have been besieged with calls from all over the state 
wanting to know how people can get to the free clothing said 
sheriff tommy allen of anson county 
lee wright a usedcar dealer who owns the farm where the 
clothes are stored has refused to say where the garments came 
from but the sheriff said the clothing cost wright nothing and was 
hauled away from a secondhand clothing exporter in new york city 
allen said nothing apparently is illegal about giving the 
clothing away or charging the 5 parking fee and anson county

wildlife officials say they are stumped by 
the discovery of three more dead eagles along the piney river 
bringing to 10 the number of eagles found dead in the area recently 
about 30 eagles are killed each year in colorado most are hit 
by cars while as they feed on dead animals in the road or are 
electrocuted when they land on power lines said todd malmsbury 
spokesman for the state division of wildlife 
but in this case he said were looking at something 
completely different 
the state and the us fish and wildlife service are conducting 
tests to find out what might have killed the birds 
traces of mercury in their systems would not necessarily cause 
the birds to die and officials have been unable to find a source 
of mercury in the area 
the birds are protected by several state and federal laws 
including the endangered species act

legislation designed to close a loophole in 
the handling of highly toxic chemicals known as polychlorinated 
biphenyls or pcbs was approved thursday by the house energy and 
commerce committee 
the bill endorsed by a voice vote would require the 
environmental protection agency to write regulations controlling 
socalled pcb brokers the middlemen who contract to transport the 
chemicals to disposal sites 
there is no federal manifesting requirement to adequately 
track pcbs from owner to final disposal said rep mike synar 
dokla the bills principal sponsor literally anybody with a 
truck can get into the pcb brokerage business 
the manufacture of pcbs most often used as insulators in 
electrical equipment has been banned since the late 1970s the 
nation faces a growing rate of pcb disposal in the coming years as 
this equipment wears out 
synar said the broker loophole has resulted in pcb dumpandrun 
cases across the nation one broker who was paid millions of 
dollars to handle disposal of 13 million pounds of the chemicals 
left them in holden mo and went bankrupt leaving behind a site 
cleanup bill of more than 30 million he said 
the legislation would require epa to set up a system to keep 
track of pcbs once they leave the original owner and to require 
brokers to demonstrate they have the financial capability of 
assuring safe disposal 
rep thomas luken dohio said the bill has the support of the 
environmental and business communities and of epa which is 
drafting the type of regulations that would be required by the 
legislation 
dave colbert an aide to luken said lawmakers feel epa should 
have a congressional directive to regulate pcb brokers in case the 
presidents office of management and budget opposes such action 
epa and omb have tangled during the reagan administration over 
the issue of whether the environmental agency should issue 
regulations that havent been specifically mandated by congress

carlos lehder rivas the biggest 
foreign drug dealer ever brought to trial in this country was 
found guilty today of running a smuggling operation that shipped 
tons of cocaine from colombia to the united states 
the verdict against the reputed leader of colombias violent 
medellin drug cartel came just after 11 am following seven days 
of deliberation 
lehder 38 and codefendant jack carlton reed 57 were 
convicted of conspiring to smuggle 33 tons of cocaine by way of 
normans cay in the bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
prosecutors and government witnesses had described lehder as a 
onetime new york street hood who put together a vast 
cocainesmuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland 
us attorney robert merkle called him the henry ford of drug 
trafficking pioneering mass shipments of cocaine by air from 
colombia to the united states 
at a news conference this afternoon merkle called the verdict 
a victory for the good guys 
asked whether lehder would spend the rest of his life in jail 
merkle said i certainly hope so that is certainly going to 
be my recommendation 
lehder was found guilty on all counts one count of conspiracy 
two of importation of cocaine seven of possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute and one of engaging in a continuing criminal 
enterprise 
he looked down then stared straight ahead as the court clerk 
read the verdicts two jurors cried with one sobbing and burying 
her face in her hands as the sevenmonth trial came to an end 
reed of san pedro calif was convicted on a single conspiracy 
count and faces up to 15 years in prison and 25000 in fines 
lehder now faces life plus 150 years in prison and up to 350000 
in fines 
following the verdict on the charges the jury had to consider 
whether lehder should be forced to forfeit all his bahamian 
property including large parts of normans cay several homes an 
airstrip and possibly a number of planes to the us government 
the jury returned to deliberations after a brief hearing and 
attorneys both sides refused immediate comment if its any good 
its worth waiting for merkle quipped when asked for reaction to 
the verdict 
attorney general edwin meese iii commenting to reporters 
outside justice department today cited a fine job by the 
prosecutor and investigating agents and said the case was an 
excellent example of international cooperation against a major 
drug trafficker 
authorities said the medellin cartel named for a city in 
colombia was believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine smuggled into the united states prosecutors called lehder 
the biggest foreign drug smuggler ever brought to trial in the 
united states 
jurors names have not been revealed for security reasons and 
us district judge howell w melton had the foreman sign the 
verdict form only with his number 
when lehder was first brought to the jacksonville federal 
courthouse a small army of police armed with shotguns and 
automatic weapons surrounded the building security eased during 
the trial but each day up to 10 federal marshals were in the 
courtroom 
during the trial witnesses told of lehders flamboyant 
personality which included admiration for both adolf hitler and 
former beatle john lennon 
witnesses said lehder after initially smuggling the drug 
himself and paying mules to fly between colombia and the united 
states earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments 
lehder allegedly paid off bahamian prime minister lynden o 
pindling to look the other way while his smuggling operation took 
over the small island of normans cay a short hop from florida 
pindling himself reportedly a target of a florida grand jury 
investigation based in part on trial testimony has called the 
charges a fairy tale 
the principal prosecution witness was ed ward an exmarine 
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the 
island he teamed up with lehder but eventually fell out with 
lehders codefendant reed he said 
after he was arrested in early 1981 he began cooperating with 
the dea 
ward who is under federal protection and has been given a new 
identity testified about hauling 1600 kilograms of cocaine from 
colombia o normans cay and flying tons of cocaine from the 
bahamian island to airstrips in florida and georgia 
the trial included a brief appearance by former cbs news anchor 
walter cronkite who testified about being chased away from 
normans cay in 1978 when he tried to anchor there i was the 
most naive yachtsman in the bahamas he said 
defense attorneys edward shohat and jose quinon hammered away at 
the credibility of ward and other prosecution witnesses they 
accused them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own 
crimes and said lehder was a legitimate businessman being 
victimized by drug investigators 
in a surprise move they presented no defense witnesses after 
the prosecution rested sending the trial immediately to the jury 
lehder was captured by the colombian army on feb 4 1987 after 
a firefight outside a medellin mansion he was immediately flown to 
florida in a swift extradition move that caused controversy in 
colombia 
a day before bringing in the verdict the jury had reviewed a 
videotape made by lehder in 1985 when he was a fugitive in the 
jungles of colombia 
this is about political action and cocaine has become and 
marijuana has become a revolutionary weapon in the struggle 
against north american imperialism stimulants from colombia are 
the achilles heel of imperialism lehder said 
merkle accused lehder of threatening to kill federal judges if 
he were extradited lehders attorneys denied that but the violent 
history of the medellin cartel made authorities cautious 
hundreds of colombian officials have been murdered by drug lords 
connected to the cartel including justice minister rodrigo 
larabonilla the cartel also had a hand in the louisiana slaying 
of adler barry seal a top us drug informant according to 
the miami indictment 
lehder is also named in the miami indictment for his role in the 
medellin cartel but that indictment was not included in his 
extradition papers and under the uscolombia treaty in effect at 
the time he apparently cannot be tried on the charges 
lehder also is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in 
los angeles

the orderly atmosphere at the smithsonians 
national museum of american history was broken by a shattering 
tarzan yell on thursday 
school children and elderly vacationers looked around expecting 
to see a group of noisy teens or someone dressed up like edgar rice 
burroughs jungle hero 
what they found was comedienne carol burnett emerging from a 
news conference where she had just donated the charwoman costume 
she made famous on her television program to the museums history 
of american entertainment collection 
i feel very proud she said at the ceremony this is a 
ten a definite ten 
a native of san antonio miss burnett developed the tarzan yell 
as a child and it has become one of her professional trademarks 
i wish some of my folks were here she said especialy my 
grandmother who raised me this would be a kick for her 
the costume consists of a plaid wool skirt yellow checkered 
apron flower print blouse a red bandana a ragged brown sweater 
a mopcap white gloves sweat socks and hightop army boots 
the charwoman character was created for miss burnetts 1963 
television special carol amp company in which the ragged 
cleaning lady performed a modified striptease in her work clothes 
miss burnett developed the skit after she heard a radio disc 
jockey allude to the fact that some american housewives were fond 
of practicing a striptease to david roses the stripper while 
doing their chores 
it thought maybe i should do a charwoman cleaning up in a 
burlesque house after everyone is gone and then imagines shes 
gypsy rose lee miss burnett said all i really took off was 
the sweater and one long glove i decided there was enough 
violence on tv 
the character which the actress said never had a name or fully 
developed persona became as signature figure on her comdeyvariety 
tv series which ran from 1967 to 1978 
reminded that the gowns of the first ladies were also in the 
smithsonian miss burnett said maybe well call her first 
charwoman

people infected by the aids virus may be more 
likely to go on to develop the deadly disease if they also are 
infected by a related virus that can cause a particularly fatal 
form of leukemia a study says 
these laboratory results suggest that doubly infected 
individuals have a worse prognosis for developing aids than those 
who are infected only by the aids virus said molecular virologist 
irvin sy chen who published his study in fridays issue of the 
journal science 
the chances of any individual being infected by both viruses 
are very slim but among selected populations such as intravenous 
drug abusers the chances are quite high said chen of the 
university of california los angeles 
except among iv drug abusers the leukemia virus is quite rare 
in the united states it is fairly common in southern japan the 
caribbean and parts of africa chen said so the study suggests 
that people in those areas may be more likely to develop 
fullfledged aids if they are exposed to the aids virus 
but more study of people infected by both viruses must be done 
to confirm the suspicion raised by laboratory studies said dr 
stanley h weiss chief of aids epidemiology at new jersey medical 
school in newark weiss is already undertaking such research in the 
newark and new york area 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which usually remains dormant in 
infected people for years before it may be activated to cause 
fullfledged aids which cripples the diseasefighting immune 
system 
previous studies suggested almost any infection may help trigger 
the dormant aids virus into an active killer 
chen and his colleagues performed experiments in laboratory 
culture dishes showing that aidsinfected white blood cells called 
t cells produce large amounts of active aids virus if the cells 
also are exposed to the human tcell leukemia virus type i or 
htlvi 
people infected by htlvi have a 1 percent lifetime chance of 
developing a blood cancer called adult tcell leukemia which often 
kills quickly it is an important cause of leukemia in southern 
japan and the caribbean htlvi also is linked to a potentially 
fatal degenerative nerve disease that causes spasticity and 
paralysis of the legs 
last month the american red cross recommended that all donated 
blood be tested for htlvi as soon as scientists develop a 
practical test a red cross study found about one out of every 
4286 units of donated blood carries htlvi the risk of aids virus 
in blood has been reduced to about one in 40000 units because 
donors are tested for signs of aids infection 
a study performed by weiss when he worked for the national 
cancer institute showed htlvi is spreading among intravenous drug 
abusers with infection rates of 12 percent among new jersey 
addicts 33 percent among new orleans addicts overall and 49 
percent among black addicts in new orleans 
intravenous drug addicts also are high risk for infection by the 
aids virus which also is spread in blood on shared needles and by 
sexual contact 
infection by htlvi apparently activates the aids virus by 
stimulating aidsinfected white blood cells to divide according to 
the study chen performed with molecular virologists jerome zack 
alan cann and james lugo 
while the study in science deals only with htlvi unpublished 
laboratory results suggest fullfledged aids also may be triggered 
in aidsinfected people who also are infected by htlvii an 
extremely rare virus that can cause another type of leukemia 
the aids virus is distantly related to the leukemia viruses 
dr edward l murphy jr a national cancer institute expert on 
htlvi agreed with chen that the problem of dual infection by the 
aids and leukemia viruses is mainly a problem for us drug addicts 
and for people in areas such as the caribbean

a student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain 
dried fruit spices and insects from the 3300yearold tomb of the 
egyptian king tutankhamun archaeologists said thursday 
it obviously is extremely important archaelogically because 
its a very large amount of material said john evans director 
of the university of londons institute of archaeology 
very little work has been done on material of this period in 
egypt and i understand that some of the species which have been 
identified are in fact the earliest occurrences evans said at 
a news conference 
most of the discovery consists of the food placed in 
tutankhamuns tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife 
scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide 
best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the egyptians at 
the time of tutankhamuns death in 1323 bc 
for more than 50 years the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30 
cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the royal botanical 
gardens the specimens were sent in 1932 by howard carter the 
british archaeologist who discovered tutankhamuns treasureladen 
tomb in the valleys of the kings at luxor egypt in 1922 
they were to have been cataloged by the botanist leonard boodle 
but boodle and carter both died in the 1930s before the work could 
be completed and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled from 
ancient egypt 
in february of this year the material was turned over to a 
french graduate student at the archaelogical institute 23yearold 
christian tutundjian de vartavan for research leading to a 
masters degree in archaeobotany the institutes speciality 
he recognized notations on the boxes as those of carter 
providing the first clue that they might be from tutankhamuns 
tomb scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually 
fragments were matched with photographs taken by carter 
it all fit in it was beyond coincidence said 
archaeobotanist gordon hillmann who supervised the students work 
tutundjian de vartavan did not attend the news conference 
professor david harris director of the archaeology institutes 
department of human environment said the announcement was delayed 
until it had completed scientific analysis 
we were anxious to announce it as soon as possible lest it 
should leak out but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long 
as possible so that we could get as much work accomplished as we 
could harris said 
he acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that 
the egyptian government might demand possession before the 
institute had completed its analysis 
last week the institute informed the egyptian embassy in london 
about the discovery and offered to return the material as of 
thursday the institute had received no reply harris said 
the hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than 
five pounds of seeds fruits and spices placed in tutankhamuns 
tomb harris said 
among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the 
journey barley for brewing beer a large quantity of watermelon 
seeds to chew on coriander fenugreek black cumin sesame seeds 
two kinds of juniper berries grapes and a datelike fruit known as 
a jujube 
the grains fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that 
figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into 
food needed by the ka one of the kings souls in the 
afterlife harris said 
dr ken thomas a specialist in insects said the remains of 
thousands of beetles also had been identified the foods were to 
sustain the boy king through eternity thomas said but the 
insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them 
the find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the 
tomb harris said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker 
baskets and several pottery jars in the cairo museum and the dokki 
agricultural museum in egypt

nasa scientists who bounced radio waves 
off cloudshrouded venus detected huge blobs that may be lava flows 
and rings that may be volcanic crater rims both very bright and 
possibly rich in fools gold a new study says 
the study provides more evidence that venus volcanoes erupted 
within the last few million years and possibly within recent 
centuries said researchers from the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
their findings appear in fridays issue of the journal science 
coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the pioneer 
venus orbiter a spacecraft that still circles the second planet 
from the sun 
jpl radar scientists ray jurgens and martin slade and geologist 
r stephen saunders transmitted radio waves from goldstone to 
venus equatorial region half the waves bounced back to three 
210footdiameter dishshaped antennas at the mojave desert 
facility 
the fuzzy radar pictures revealed bright or highly reflective 
rings of material on the surface as well as bright blobs 
the largest blob measuring 350 miles long and 180 miles wide 
apparently is a large lava flow and has a large mound possibly a 
volcano at its west end jurgens said 
the largest ring is roughly 60 miles across and appears to be 
the rim of a crater caused by a meteorite impact but other rings 
about 18 miles across may be rims of large volcanic craters called 
calderas he said 
the researchers speculate the blobs and rings are so highly 
reflective to radar because the lava flows and crater rims are rich 
in iron pyrite or other metallic minerals blasted to the surface of 
the planet by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts iron pyrite 
is known as fools gold because it looks like gold 
because fools gold or other metallic minerals should decompose 
and lose their reflectivity over time the discovery certainly is 
evidence of relatively recent volcanism since old craters lack 
bright rings jurgens said 
it isnt possible to say whether recent means within the 
last few million years or last few centuries because researchers 
dont know how quickly rocks break down on venus said jurgens and 
saunders who is project scientist for the magellan venus radar 
mapper spacecraft set for launch next april 
radar readings from pioneer suggested volcanoes existed on 
venus previous radar pictures made from earth and by soviet 
spacecraft in 1983 revealed lava flows volcanic craters and 
craters from meteorite impacts 
but researchers dont know if volcanoes still are active on the 
planet which is covered by thick acidladen carbon dioxide clouds 
that prevent direct observation by telescopes 
in 1984 scientists announced that pioneer detected lightning 
bolts and a 50fold increase in sulfur dioxide concentrations in 
venus atmosphere after 1978 because lightning and sulfur dioxide 
can be caused by eruptions the discoveries suggested a gargantuan 
volcano may have erupted shortly before 1978 
other studies also found highly reflective features on venus 
mountains but scientists debated whether the brightness was from 
volcanic metallic minerals or simply artificial brightness created 
by rough landscape 
the blobs and rings found by the jpl study are the first highly 
reflective features discovered on venusian lowlands and thus 
support the theory that the brightness is caused by metallic 
minerals jurgens said 
its a good working hypothesis to say these blobs are young 
lava flows but the radar images arent good enough to determine 
which rings are volcanic craters and which are impact craters said 
harold masursky a planetary geologist with the us geological 
survey in flagstaff ariz 
well settle this argument with magellan which is scheduled 
to reach venus in august 1990 and map most of the planet using 
radar he said 
some of the big volcanoes on venus may still be active which 
would be interesting masursky said the only other places 
we have ongoing volcanism are the earth and jupiters moon io

a highranking state department official on 
thursday criticized plans by retreating soviet forces to leave up 
to 1 billion in equipment and facilities for the kabul government 
and reaffirmed the us intention to continue backing the afghan 
rebels 
there have been indications that we have picked up that the 
intention of the soviets to turn over equipment and facilities will 
be on a fairly large scale said michael h armacost 
undersecretary of state for political affairs 
weve heard estimates ranging from a half a billion to 1 
billion worth of equipment and or installations and facilities 
he added that doesnt strike me as a demonstration of tremendous 
restraint 
he was referring to statements by lt gen boris gromov the 
soviet commander in afghanistan that the value of soviet bases and 
equipment left behind after the withdrawal would be 600 million 
rubles the equivalent of 1 billion 
during negotiations that led to the soviet agreement in geneva 
to withdraw its estimated 115000 red army troops from afghanistan 
armacost and other us officials proposed a mutual phaseout of 
superpower military assistance to the sovietbacked kabul 
government and ussupported mujahadeen 
the soviets rejected the offer but the united states kept its 
promise on the table saying it would match soviet restraint with 
symmetrical reductions in aid to the mujahadeen otherwise 
us support to the rebels would continue 
armacost said on thursday i would recall simply what we 
said at the time we signed the geneva agreement that we retain the 
right to support our friends we will exercise the right in the 
event the soviets continue to supply equipment to kabul and well 
have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose 
armacost made the comments to reporters while outlining various 
regional issues president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev are likely to discuss at their moscow summit may 29june 
2 
he declined to predict whether gorbachev would ask reagan to 
help ease the soviet withdrawal by advising the mujahadeen to 
refrain from harassing red army forces as the first soviet unit 
crossed into its homeland on wednesday there were reports that 
guerrilla attacks were continuing 
the position weve taken on that has been generally that a 
prompt timetable would be one which is more likely to elicit 
cooperation from the mujahadeen armacost said beyond that the 
best way to protect withdrawing forces from attack is to make 
local arrangements with guerrilla groups he said 
on capitol hill meanwhile the afghan accord was criticized as 
betrayal of the resistance and an invitation to chaos and civil war 
with the superpowers continuing the arms flow whats to 
prevent a continuing series of civil wars rep chester atkins 
dmass said at a hearing of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asian and pacfic affairs 
my fear is we are going to see a continung inferno in 
afghanistan that in time will lead to some kind of soviet presence 
unacceptable to the united states atkins said 
rep stephen solarz dny also said he was concerned about 
the apparent contradiction in the united states and soviet 
union vowing to halt interference in afghan affairs while at 
the same time reserving the right to aid the rival factions 
dan burton rind declared his disgust that our state 
department with its appeasement policy has settled for half a loaf 
there is no substitute for victory and they afghan resistance 
were well on their way to victory we stopped them short of it 
with the removal of afghanistan as the no1 issue on reagans 
list of regional confrontations with the soviets more attention is 
likely to be given at the summit to conflicts in southern africa 
and cambodia 
armacost said he was optimistic about the prospects for progress 
in resolving conflicts in southern africa in part because of what 
he termed quite successful talks recently among officials from 
the united states angola south africa and cuba 
the united states is seeking a formula under which all cuban 
troops estimated at up to 45000 would be withdrawn from 
angola and south africa would turn over namibia to an independent 
government 
armacost said the united states is hopeful that the soviets will 
use their influence with cuba and angola but he expressed concern 
that a reported increase in the number of cubans in angola might 
set back the process 
to lay the groundwork for discussion of the issues at the 
summit assistant secretary of state chester crocker was in 
portugal on thursday winding up talks with a soviet deputy foreign 
minister anatoly adamishin 
armacost reiterated administration views that the regional issue 
most ripe for settlement is the restoration of a neutral cambodia 
which is controlled by an estimated 120000 vietnamese troops 
vietnam which is beset by major economic problems has stated its 
intention to withdraw its forces in the early 1990s 
the principal things we would like to see from the soviets 
here are that they press hanoi to accelerate the timetable for 
their withdrawal the official said he also said the soviets 
should talk directly with prince sihanouk who represents the 
antivietnamese factions

senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
on thursday renewed his call for the resignation of attorney 
general edwin meese iii and said that if meese doesnt quit the 
president ought to do it for him 
meese has launched a counterattack against his critics and has 
told conservatives that he wont quit in the absence of evidence of 
wrongdoing 
byrd asked about meeses comments said i think mr meese 
ought to resign 
the perception is that theres a great loss of morale at the 
justice department because of the ongoing investigations of meese 
said byrd 
later byrd said again that meese should go and added if he 
doesnt do it the president ought to do it for him 
byrd was commenting a day after meese met with conservative 
senators to say again that he wouldnt quit 
a senate subcommittee report issued earlier this month accused 
meese of violating a white house policy by helping the 
scandalplagued wedtech corp 
in addition independent counsel james mckay has been conducting 
a criminal investigation of meeses involvement with wedtech and 
other matters mckay is expected to issue a report within several 
weeks which will raise ethical quetions about the behavior of 
meese according to sources familiar with the investigation 
according to byrd meese and any occupants of high political 
office should be willing to resign if their actions put their 
offices under a cloud 
a president should tell his top appointees that if your 
actions are such to put the office under a cloud youll have to 
leave byrd said he suggested that is what had occurred with 
meese

former gov evan mecham says he is unfazed 
that a morality clause at brigham young university prevents him 
from speaking there 
i dont get too upset about anything mecham said wednesday 
it was just a group of young republicans who wanted me to speak 
if they have a policy they have a policy and i wont speak 
the policy says that to appear at byu which is owned by the 
mormon church a speaker must not in his or her personal life 
as reflected in the news media and common understanding of the 
public have committed acts of immorality dishonesty or other 
conduct that would make it inappropriate for the church education 
system to feature him or her as a speaker his or her life and 
advice should make an appropriate model for students in an 
educational system with our ideals 
mecham a mormon had been scheduled to speak at the provo 
utah campus on may 26 or 27 in an appearance sponsored by campus 
republicans a student group 
we do not allow to speak on campus people who are not worthy 
examples said brad hanesworth a communications professor who is 
the campus republicans faculty adviser i thought it was clear 
that he did not meet the criteria on which speakers may appear at 
byu 
we havent decided that evan mecham is guilty but now is not 
the appropriate time for him to appear on campus said brent 
harker a university spokesman 
harker pointed out mecham is under indictment jury selection 
began thursday in phoenix ariz in mechams criminal trial on 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
when a person is involved in a court case if he comes to 
speak that would imply an endorsement by the university harker 
said people would say oh hes speaking at byu they must 
think hes ok 
mecham 64 was impeached by the state house in february and 
removed from office by the state senate april 4 
he could face up to 22 years in prison if he is convicted in the 
criminal trial on all six felony counts on charges of perjury 
filing false documents and fraud

statesponsored death squads and terrorist groups 
are blocking economic development in central america southern 
africa and the philippines speakers at an international conference 
said thursday 
people like agricultural extension workers will not go out 
into rural areas organizing people into agricultural programs if by 
doing so they are branded as communists and are liable to be 
harassed attacked and even murdered said ian linden general 
secretary of the catholic institute for international relations 
linden said the independent charity sponsored the twoday 
conference on the growing phenomenon of development projects 
shut down by death squads and vigilante groups he said such 
shutdowns which had occurred in the philippines southern africa 
and central america had created anxieties in many development 
agencies including the catholic institute 
in mozambique a member of the countrys ruling politburo said 
south africanbacked death squads were destroying mozambiques 
potential for independent selfsustaining economic development 
jorge rebelo blamed south africansponsored attacks for severe 
food shortages 
a haitian priest said repression and terror by 
statesponsored death squads remain the reality in his nation the 
western hemispheres poorest country 
the rev freud jean who is general secretary of the roman 
catholic churchs national commission of justice and peace said 
there is no possibility for development if people continue to be 
terrorized by the paramilitary tonton macoutes which started 
operating with backing from former president francois duvalier 30 
years ago 
in the philippines there is a growing perception that active 
church members antinuclear activists and proponents of agrarian 
reform are communists or radicals said a philippine human rights 
advocate 
dr maria serena i diokno head of the national movement to 
disband vigilantes said these people and farmers have little 
chance for judicial recourse if they are harmed because vigilante 
groups enjoy government sanction 
mrs diokno said massive poverty and inequality which cause 
and nurture insurgency must be attacked from the roots 
author and university lecturer jorge caceres prendes said that 
in central america economic development has been hindered not only 
by statesponsored terrorism but by the continued us intervention 
in the region 
linden said virtually every speaker provided evidence that 
national security forces are sponsoring vigilante groups and death 
squads in one way or another 
some speakers such as caceres said one solution to these 
paramilitary forces is for governments to be held accountable to 
world opinion others called for threatened groups to form their 
own selfdefense units 
but linden said obviously the solution is going to be along 
the lines of strengthening poor communities with education with 
community organanization and with the type of development projects 
that will give them the courage and the mutual trust and the 
solidarity among themselves to withstand some of these assualts

israeli officials in the occupied territories 
have jailed one out of every 200 arab men over the age of 18 for 
six months without trial a legislator said thursday 
in addition to the 1900 jailed under emergency regulations 
requiring no trial or specific charges another 8100 palestinians 
are in prison awaiting trial or serving sentences for specific 
actions leftwing legislator dedi zucker said 
the scale of the arrests shows the political echelon has lost 
all control over the situation zucker of the citizens rights 
movement alleged 
army and defense ministry officials refused comment saying only 
they were checking zuckers figures 
chief military prosecutor brig gen amnon strachnov said last 
week that 5000 palestinians were jailed since the start of the 
arab uprising on dec 8 of those 1700 were being held without 
trial he said 
but former cabinet member amnon rubinstein of the center 
movement told israel radio that close to 2000 palestinians were 
being held without trial 
rubinstein a law professor also criticized authorities for 
abolishing a legal safeguard that required administrative detainees 
to appear before a judge within four days of their arrest 
the requirement was scrapped when the number of administrative 
detainees skyrocketed during the uprising and rubinstein demanded 
reinstatement 
israeli officials have said the mass arrests have helped calm 
the violence in the west bank and gaza strip 
also thursday the americanborn director of the jerusalem 
visitors information bureau a palestinian information service 
said she visited a village of 6000 near the west bank town of 
ramallah that was raided by israeli troops for three straight days 
this week 
lesley abukhater originally of louisville ky said she saw 
five arab homes with broken furniture and windows in the village of 
beita laqya and the owners told her israeli troops were 
responsible for the damage 
she said six villagers were arrested in the raids and that local 
residents said many people were beaten 
mrs abukhater said beit laqya apparently was targeted because 
it is a socalled liberated village meaning arab residents 
have blocked off roads to outsiders and fly the palestinian flag 
outlawed in israel 
two other liberated villages near ramallah were raided 
wednesday and one palestinian was killed and 10 wounded hospital 
officials said about 300 arabs were detained 
zucker said that before the arab uprising began only about 70 
palestinians were held without trial under emergency regulations at 
any one time 
he said the present detainees were denied special privileges 
including access to radio television and newspapers that they are 
supposed to enjoy since their detention is viewed as a preventive 
measure instead of punishment 
zucker said he also conducted a random study of 3300 arabs held 
for six months without trial and determined the average age of the 
detainee was 25 fifteen percent of the detainees were between the 
ages of 16 and 21 while 58 percent were between 21 and 30 years 
old 
in other developments 
the west banks military government permitted the 
reunification of 40 palestinian families as a goodwill gesture 
the military government applies stringent standards in issuing 
residency permits for example often only granting temporary 
tourist visas to the foreignborn spouses of west bank residents 
as result hundreds of palestinian families are separated 
in tel aviv a district court judge rejected a motion to 
release from custody four staff members of the ultra leftwing 
newspaper derech hanitzotz 
the four were jailed for unspecified security offenses 
providing the first details on the case the court said thursday 
the prosecution presented evidence the defendants were members of a 
hostile organization israel radio reported

interior minister tomas borge was 
quoted thursday as saying a nicaraguan journalist penetrated the 
cia as a sandinista counterintelligence agent 
the reporter was identified as maria lourdes pallais checa a 
graduate of columbia university in new york 
the sandinista newspaper barricada quoted borge as saying that 
she was a counterintelligence agent who worked in enemy ranks 
it said he made the remarks sunday at an appearance on the 
remote caribbean coast of nicaragua 
barricada said pallais had lived for five years in the united 
states and had been employed by various american and european news 
organizations 
pallais worked for the associated press in new york from august 
1978 until november 1979 first on the editing desk of the latin 
american service and later in the new york city bureau 
borge was quoted as saying she carried out missions in the 
heart of the cia 
some have been there for several years and continue there 
others we have been forced to take out of there for different 
reasons and one by one they will continue to be claimed back by 
our people he said 
no one answered the telephone at pallais home in managua 
thursday 
pallais brother marcel pallais checa a supporter of the 
sandinista national liberation front was killed by the national 
guard of thenpresident anastasio somoza during the 197879 
revolutionary war 
pallais resigned from the ap in 1979 saying she wanted to 
investigate her brothers death and help care for her ill mother 
the sandinistas came to power in july 1979 ending 42 years of 
rule by the rightist proamerican somoza dynasty

the method a smoker chooses to try to kick the 
habit is less important than a doctors firm advice and the 
longterm support of others a new survey says 
there is no single intervention method clearly more effective 
for all people than the other methods said dr thomas k kottke 
a mayo clinic heart specialist and coauthor of the survey 
he and his colleagues on the us preventive services task force 
reviewed 39 studies of ways to stop smoking those techniques 
ranged from oneshot strategies such as sensory deprivation and 
injections to combinations of techniques such as physician 
counseling nicotine gum and behavorial therapy 
success was not associated with novel or unusual 
interventions the team reported in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
it was the product of personalized smokingcessation advice 
and assistance repeated in different forms by several sources over 
the longest feasible period 
most effective were approaches in which physicians and 
counselors worked with smokers and the smokers also attended 
stopsmoking groups and perhaps used booklets videotapes and 
homework kottke said 
nicotine gum was also helpful though not everyone can use it 
he said 
after a sixmonth period such programs achieved a success rate 
37 percent above that for individuals trying to quit on their own 
he said 
least effective and often costly as well were onetime 
techniques such as sensory deprivation treatments he said 
a related report in the chicagobased medical journal said a 
bloodpressure drug called clonidine has been shown effective in 
reducing the craving to smoke 
seventyone heavy smokers who had tried unsuccessfully to quit 
were recruited for the study 
thirtythree took clonidine and 38 took a tablet containing no 
medication neither group knew what it was taking all subjects 
also underwent behavioral therapy 
six months after discontinuing medication 27 percent of the 
clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking compared 
with 5 percent of those who took the placebo the researchers said 
clonidine also marketed as catapres inhibits some of the 
action of the nervous system and has previously been shown to 
reduce opiate and alcohol withdrawal symptoms the study said 
its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that 
reported with nicotine gum but clonidine may eventually prove 
superior because it doesnt perpetuate nicotine dependence the 
study suggested 
but the researchers said larger studies over longer periods are 
needed before it becomes a standard treatment 
one surprising finding according to dr alexander h glassman 
of columbia university in new york was that 61 percent of the 
subjects had suffered from major depression at some time in their 
past 
people who have made several attempts to stop smoking and failed 
often believe they have a moral weakness the study said 
but its findings suggest that for many smokers who try to stop 
and cannot the problem is not a moral one but rather an associated 
vulnerability between affective mood disorder and nicotine

wilberforce a black and white tomcat who was a 
companion to four british prime ministers after straying into 
downing street in 1973 died in his sleep thursday at the age of 15 
the feline often seen lounging on the front doorstep of the 
prime ministers official residence at no 10 downing st 
developed a reputation for being the best mouser in britain 
wilberforce was found during the tenure of edward heath and 
served as a mousecatcher and pet for successive administrations 
he received lots of mail people wanting to know how he was 
wish him luck and the downing street staff answered for him a 
staff spokesman said 
prime minister margaret thatcher talked to wilberforce when she 
encountered him in the corridors of power and she gave him a 
special farewell present when he retired to a private home at an 
undisclosed location in essex northeast of london more than a 
year ago 
one of his last meals at downing street was a tasty tin of the 
best soviet pilchards a kind of herring picked out specially by 
mrs thatcher at a moscow supermarket during a tour of the soviet 
union 
mrs thatcher was saddened by the news of wilberforces death

the new exhibit deals with a product that 
comes from cows but to many lawmakers its just plain pork the 
new york state museum of cheese opened thursday 
sen nancy larraine hoffmann was scheduled to preside over the 
ribbon cutting for perhaps the states most notorious porkbarrel 
project 
the museum was developed with the help of money tucked into the 
state budget at hoffmanns request the 425000 museum received 
175000 over the past three years from the state legislatures 
pork barrel with the rest of the cost coming mainly from local 
sources in this central new york community 
the museum is housed in the former weeks and merry cheese 
factory which shipped cheese to england a century ago the 
building was moved from nearby verona to erie canal village here a 
recreation of a mid19th century erie canal community 
cheesemaking tools and equipment including curd knives cheese 
forms and a cheese press were collected from barns and old cheese 
factories across the state 
while almost everyone else calls it pork barrel spending 
legislators and gov mario cuomo refer to the allocations such as 
the ones to the museum as member items or legislative 
initiatives 
the items proposed by individual legislators are reviewed by 
the state budget division but in general dont get the kind of 
scrutiny that major spending items do 
hoffmann who admits that the cheese museum sounded kind of 
funny the first time i heard it too said the project makes 
good economic sense for rome which lost more than 50 percent 
of its manufacturing jobs in the last decade 
the people of rome have experienced three years of being the 
brunt of everybodys joke and recurring stories about pork barrel 
spending said hoffmann a syracuse democrat 
the cheese musem is something of which they are enormously 
proud she said 
she added that she hopes the publicity can be turned into an 
advertising plus for the tourist industry being developed by rome 
meanwhile cheese museum continues to be synonymous with 
pork barrel and the brunt of jokes in the state capital albany 
even cuomo got a few guffaws wednesday when asked why he wasnt 
attending the ceremony 
i gave scheduling aide larry belinsky some beef when i found 
out i was going to be in new york city instead of the cheese 
museum said cuomo who will be watching his chief of staff 
gerald crotty receive an award from a citizens group it was a 
close call the cheese museum or crotty

prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday 
rejected indirect white house criticism of his refusal to accept a 
us middle east peace plan and blamed arab leaders for blocking 
peace talks 
shamir did not directly criticize the reagan administration for 
issuing a statement that also praised his political rival foreign 
minister shimon peres who supports the us plan 
but leaders of shamirs rightwing likud bloc accused the white 
house of interfering in israels domestic affairs and warned such 
actions would backfire in israels november election 
this will just strengthen the likud because we dont want to 
be a banana republic likud legislator david magen was quoted as 
saying by the domestic itim news agency 
the white house statement issued after a meeting in washington 
on tuesday between peres and president reagan praised peres for 
the courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise 
in an oblique reference to shamir the statement criticized 
those leaders who are negative consistently reject new ideas and 
fail to exploit realistic opportunities to bring about 
negotiations make progress impossible in the end they will have 
to answer to their own people for the suffering that will 
inevitably result 
labor and likud have governed in a fragile coalition since 1984 
but the alliance has all but disintegrated because of the dispute 
over the middle east peace process 
peres backs the us plan which calls for an international 
conference to launch direct talks between the parties to the 
conflict the plan also provides for talks on a final settlement to 
begin by the end of 1988 
shamir objects to the international conference and to setting a 
timetable for negotiations 
responding to the white house statement thursday shamir said he 
did not believe it was directed at him 
i think that if there are elements in the middle east who 
reject peace who avoid peace talks its the arab leaders 
shamir was quoted as saying by israel army radio 
shamir also said he hoped the united states would continue its 
policy of not interfering in israels internal affairs 
likud leaders meanwhile criticized peres saying he should be 
recalled to israel and had no authority to speak for the israeli 
government 
peres told israel radio that we should always ask whats good 
for the state not whats good for the likud i think this was a 
trip with important possibilities during which we explained 
israels position in a positive way 
peres was scheduled to return to israel friday after a twoweek 
trip that included stops in hungary spain and the united states 
shamir also criticized peres for meeting tuesday in washington 
with yuri dubinin the soviet ambassador to the united states 
shamir demands that the soviet union establish diplomatic ties 
with israel before getting involved in the middle east peace 
process moscow cut the ties after the 1967 middle east war 
peres told israel radio an intensive dialogue with the soviet 
union is in israels interest

former gov evan mecham removed from 
office last month by impeachment conviction went on trial thursday 
on criminal charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
about 100 prospective jurors were sworn in during the brief 
opening session at maricopa county superior court mecham did not 
attend 
i havent broken any laws he said wednesday i looked at 
the laws my attorney looked at the laws weve had experts look at 
the laws we havent broken any of them 
mecham and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer willard 
mecham are charged with perjury willful concealment and filing 
false documents for failing to report a 350000 campaign loan from 
a developer 
mecham 64 could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of 
all six felony counts his brother could be sentenced to up to 9 
years if convicted of the three counts he faces 
the former governors attorney michael scott said mecham 
probably will attend court sessions next week after the pool of 
prospective jurors is narrowed and questioning of individuals 
begins 
thursday those in the jury pool were given a questionnaire 
worked out by the prosecution defense and trial judge michael ryan 
and designed to identify anyone biased for or against the former 
governor 
please do not withhold any information in order to be seated 
on this jury ryan told the prospective jurors 
thursdays session lasted about 15 minutes and the prospective 
jurors left as they completed the questionnaires there were few 
spectators besides reporters 
the 99 questions included whether the panelists know anyone 
involved in the case whether they signed or circulated petitions 
for or against mecham while he was governor whether they belong to 
the john birch society whether they have bumper stickers on their 
cars also they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list 
of people associated with mecham or his criminal case 
after the initial screening the remaining prospective jurors 
are to be called back for questioning tuesday or later next week 
on wednesday a state supreme court justice refused a defense 
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense 
motion to return the charges to the grand jury the supreme court 
is to hear arguments on that issue june 1 
evan mecham has refused to predict whether he will fare better 
in court than at his impeachment trial the state senate removed 
the republican governor april 4 15 months into his first term by 
convicting him of two impeachment counts 
prosecutors said the mechams failed to report the 350000 loan 
from tempe developer barry wolfson on personal or campaign 
financial statements until after a newspaper reported the 
contribution in october 1987 
the defense filed two new motions released thursday one to 
dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign and personal 
finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally vague ambiguous 
imprecise and overbroad 
the other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury 
for a new finding of whether probable cause exists that motion 
argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the 
prosecutors in mechams senate impeachment trial 
the defense contended it was denied access to grand jury 
transcripts but the impeachment prosecutors were given documents 
by the attorney generals office however officials have said 
those documents were not transcripts of grand jury testimony 
ryan did not immediately schedule arguments on the motions 
assistant attorney general barnett lotstein coprosecutor in 
the criminal trial said some of the defense requests were 
laserbeam mentality motions the remark referred to mechams 
claim earlier this year that attorney general bob corbins office 
was using laser beams to eavesdrop on conversations in the 
governors office corbin denied doing so 
mecham was convicted in the senate of trying to thwart a death 
threat investigation and of misusing 80000 from the governors

a study of lifespans of baseball players leads two 
doctors to suggest that righthanded people may live slightly 
longer than lefthanders 
in a letter published thursday in the science magazine nature 
they said they studied the baseball encyclopedia and found that 
righthanders averaged a lifespan of 6464 years compared with 
6397 years for lefthanders 
the letter was signed by diane f halpern of the psychology 
department of california state university and stanley coren of the 
psychology department of the university of british columbia 
they said their study covered 1472 righthanders and 236 
lefthanders and excluded players who batted with one hand and 
threw with the other 
no discrepancies appeared until after age 33 after that about 
2 percent more righthanders than lefthanders survive at each 
following fiveyear period the researchers said 
they said the study gave no information about the possible cause 
of the apparent discrepancy but suggested three possibilities 
that lefthanders may suffer stresses in the womb or around the 
time of birth that affect their longevity that genetic effects or 
hormones may have hampered their immune system or that 
lefthanders may have more accidents in an environment designed 
for a righthanded majority 
they concluded these factors may act singly or in concert to 
account for the fact that lefthanders seem to have a shorter 
lifespan

senators renewed the governments pledge 
thursday to stand behind deposits in the nations savings and loan 
institutions after a congressional agency reported the doubling of 
red ink in the federal sampl insurance fund 
there is absolutely no doubt the us congress stands behind 
our deposit insurance program banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis said at a hearing by his panel 
frederick d wolf director of the accounting and financial 
management division of the general accounting office said the 
liabilities of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
exceeded its assets by 137 billion at the end of 1987 up from 
63 billion a year earlier 
further he said the money available to the insurance fund 
28 billion over the next 10 years probably will not be 
adequate to restore the industrys health by closing or merging 
505 institutions listed as insolvent 
wolf estimated it would cost 30 billion to 35 billion to clean 
up the sampl mess which is primarily centered in southwestern states 
hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets that estimate 
does not include an additional 435 barely solvent institutions 
he said 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates 3120 
federally insured institutions says the cost will be 218 
billion but wolf said that projection was based on some 
extremely optimistic assumptions 
private analysts who testified after wolf put the price tag as 
high as 64 billion and growing proxmire called that sum 
equivalent to 25 percent of the national debt enormous 
however sen jake garn of utah the ranking republican on the 
committee said the 64 billion estimate offered by bert ely an 
alexandria va analyst was ridiculous 
i dont want to minimize the problem but lets not panic 
the american people and create a selffulfilling prophecy garn 
said i want to keep this in perspective not one single 
federally insured depositor up to the 100000 limit has lost one 
dime 
the gao report comes only nine months after congress authorized 
the sale of 108 billion in bonds over three years to bring in 
money to the insurance fund the bonds are being paid off through a 
special assessment on savings institutions 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich considered the likely 
successor to proxmire when the committee chairman retires next 
january said congress should be ready to act again soon after the 
next president takes office 
he accused the reagan administration of papering over the 
problem adding its clear we have a big problem here i 
think its getting worse not better 
bank board chairman m danny wall speaking with reporters 
outside the hearing room said it is too early to tell if fslic 
will need more money for now he said the bank board has 4 
billion in cash on hand and enough additional money coming in over 
the next two years 
we dont think we can responsibly shut down thrifts at a 
faster pace wall said 
however most of the private analysts appearing before the 
committee urged swift action to stem mounting losses 
because the insurance fund needs to conserve cash it has been 
keeping hundreds of moneylosing institutions open hoping to 
persuade private investors or healthy sampls to take them over with 
federal assistance 
if regulators are to move faster the key question is who should 
pay 
theo h pitt jr chairman of the us league of savings 
institutions the industrys largest trade group stopped short of 
calling for a taxpayer bailout but he told reporters the industry 
has reached the limit if what it can pay 
we cant pay any more and not reduce the capital levels of 
this industry to perilous levels he said 
proxmire said he hoped a taxpayer rescue could be avoided and 
sen phil gramm rtexas said flatly he would oppose use of tax 
money 
however ely stanley c silverberg of the washingtonbased 
golembe associations and stuart i greenbaum a professor at 
northwestern university said 30 billion to 40 billion in tax 
money would have to be spent 
the key thing the next president has to do is recognize that 
the big hit must be taken quickly ely said

bomb experts searched the golden temple 
on thursday after a 10day standoff between militant sikhs and 
indian security forces and sikh gunmen reportedly killed 25 people 
to avenge the siege of the holy shrine 
as the search for hidden explosives began a committee of sikh 
elders that manages the 400yearold temple began trying to work 
out ways to reopen the temple to worshipers 
police chief kps gill said workers found four bodies inside 
the shrine thursday one day after the last of the militant sikhs 
emerged and surrendered to indian authorities 
we are still searching for dead men and arms it may be by the 
weekend we can say it is all clear gill said 
a curfew was in effect in the temples immediate vicinity 
residents were kept out of an area extending for 300 yards outside 
the walls of the sprawling complex 
the temple is the center for sikh extremists who have waged a 
guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent sikh homeland in the 
rich farming state of punjab sikhs are a religious minority in 
india but a majority in punjab 
fortyfive men and one woman walked out of the temple wednesday 
during a ceasefire by the 2800 policemen commandoes and 
paramilitary troops posted outside 
twelve of the men described by authorities as hardcore 
terrorists were charged with murder and possession of arms 
at least 46 people mostly militant sikhs died in the siege 
according to official statements four other militants committed 
suicide 
despite the governments success in ending the siege its 
authority is still challenged by continuing sikh attacks elsewhere 
in punjab state 
the united news of india said sikh gunmen shot and killed 25 
people across punjab in seven separate overnight attacks raising 
the death toll since the start of the year to 1088 
at least 40 people were killed tuesday and wednesday including 
30 migrant hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at a camp 
near the state capital chandigarh a note found near the laborers 
bodies said the killings were to avenge the siege of the golden 
temple 
the temple siege the strongest government antiterrorist 
action since a 1984 army raid on the shrine began may 9 after 
sikh extremists inside fired at police commanders on an inspection 
tour outside the temple five officers were injured 
eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated from 
the temple may 10 and 146 people including some sikh extremists 
surrendered during a ceasefire sunday 
during the surrender wednesday the last of the militants 
emerged from the temple in small groups and were taken for 
questioning by police

rob herman grew up thinking he was lazy his 
iq was 156 but he couldnt read he had trouble writing and his 
teachers always made fun of him he became the class clown 
he obtained his high school diploma at a private school without 
doing any work he forged his transcript to get into the university 
of montana but flunked out after four semesters 
herman still calls himself a clown but hes not in class 
anymore on thursday he and two other students became the first 
graduates of landmark college the nations only college for 
dyslexics 
this place changed my life said herman a 26yearold from 
great neck ny with a beard a quick smile and black curly hair 
that falls to his shoulders it gave me an opportunity to get an 
education to understand myself to accomplish goals for myself 
if i didnt come here i dont know where id be probably 
working a manual labor job somewhere he said 
dyslexia is a language disability commonly known for the 
reversal of letters dyslexics also have trouble organizing their 
thoughts writing them down remembering names taking notes and 
learning languages 
it affects 10 percent of the population there is no known cure 
for the disability which has numbered nelson rockefeller thomas 
edison and hans christian anderson among its sufferers 
since 1971 more than 2000 young dyslexics have attended the 
landmark school in prides crossing mass the affiliated college 
opened in september 1985 in red and white brick buildings formerly 
occupied by the bankrupt windham college 
the first year 77 students enrolled in the precollege and 
college programs the latter leading to an associates degree in 
general studies 
the student population has doubled landmarks budget is strong 
it is a candidate for accreditation and its fiveyear plan 
includes more dormitory space a better library and a scholarship 
fund 
i think things are going very well president jim olivier 
said in an interview in his office wednesday weve been 
successful in doing what we set out to do which is prepare 
students for success in nonspecialized colleges 
landmark students have been accepted at more than 100 colleges 
and universities 
olivier said although landmarks curricula is not very different 
from any other general studies college teaching is very 
individualized with a studentfaculty ratio of 31 students are 
expected to learn the same subject matter as students at other 
schools but they are given more time to read texts and take exams 
herman found out about landmark through an education consultant 
the other graduates kevin gott and paul hudson read articles 
about the program 
gott a lanky athletic man from baltimore found out he had 
dyslexia in high school he thought he could cut it at st olaf 
college in northfield minn but he quit at the end of the year 
he said they had the facilities to help him but he was too 
embarrassed to ask 
landmark helped him stick it out in school i guess the 
biggest thing for me is increasing my selfconfidence said gott 
26 who was honored this year with two achievement awards 
hudson a canadian also praised the school for raising his 
selfesteem a former computer programmer he plans to become an 
astronomer 
i probably would have gone to some community college some 
lowlevel school got a bachelors degree and taken a job with 
computers and that would be it said hudson 22 who as a child 
often dreamed of the stars while visiting a montreal planetarium 
instead of setting myself up for failure now i know what i can 
do 
the cost at landmark college is a prohibitive 20500 a year for 
tuition room and board with limited financial aid from the 
institution a fact that upsets the graduates 
i hate seeing this school just be here for people whose 
parents can afford it said herman the son of a pennsylvania 
businessman who said hed like to start a scholarship fund

the house approved a 14 billion legislative 
branch spending bill thursday after voting a policy of zero 
tolerance of drug use among its employees but refusing to extend to 
them any civil rights protections 
the bill passed 277104 would increase spending by congress 
and its agencies by 16 percent above current levels including a 
165 percent hike for its leadership staffs 
the house rejected several amendments aimed at freezing or 
cutting costs accepting only a symbolic 5 million reduction in 
its estimated postage costs 
for the third straight day the house approved an amendment 
requiring that no federal funds go to a workplace where drugs are 
used sold or made 
the provision offered by rep robert walker rpa was 
approved 28698 despite complaints that it was an electionyear 
gimmick that wouldnt solve the problem 
the amendment gives the impression that weve done something 
about drugs but we wont have done a whit said rep david 
obey dwis who called it a garbage amendment 
rep lynn martin rill was forced to withdraw her amendment 
requiring congress to obey the civil rights law it imposed on the 
rest of the nation 24 years ago the amendment banning 
discrimination based on race sex religion age national origin 
or physical handicap was deemed out of order on the spending bill 
the house bill by tradition does not include the allowance for 
the senate where the bill was sent the house appropriations 
committee estimated the senate portion would add 413 million to 
the total 
the bill did not address the question of pay raises for members 
of the house and senate leaving that until later in the year when 
president reagan makes his annual recommendation

president reagan said thursday it is possible 
a ussoviet longrange missile treaty can be reached before he 
leaves office because kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev might not 
want to wait for a new administration 
while acknowledging that none of us really think such a 
strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in 
moscow reagan said he did not think gorbachev necessarily wants to 
take his time 
in a wideranging interview with foreign broadcasters the 
president also maintained again that the clandestine sales of arms 
to iran did not amount to an armsforhostages deal and said the 
soviet union should resume diplomatic relations with israel if it 
wants to take part in an international peace conference on the 
middle east 
asked whether he was worried about the impact on the may 29june 
2 summit of recent reports of astrological influences on white 
house affairs reagan replied 
well i hope that mr gorbachev has heard some of the things 
that i have been saying about those charges because no decision 
was ever made by me on the basis of astrology 
in the questionandanswer session in the oval office the 
president said he thought gorbachev should be encouraged in the 
reforms he is pushing in the soviet union i think it is evident 
that he is running into opposition that there are those who want 
to cling to more of the stalinist policies reagan said 
if theres any way that outside nations could be helpful in 
this they should he said because many of the reforms that he 
has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always 
criticized in the soviet union and if there is a way to be helpful 
in that certainly to at least acknowledge our approval of what he 
is doing that we should do that 
previewing the summit in moscow reagan said he hopes more 
progress can be made in the area of human rights and that the 
kremlin still has not lived up to promises made in the helsinki 
accords on that subject 
asked whether he thought gorbachev might take his time on the 
strategic arms reduction talks in view of the few months remaining 
in his own administration the president said he didnt know if the 
soviet leader was ready to gamble that much 
he said were working as hard as we can and its a far more 
complex treaty than the inf intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev last december 
well continue to work there at the summit if it is not 
completed beforehand reagan said and none of us really 
think that it will be but i think that it is possible that we 
could have that yes while this administration is still here 
if that does not happen he added i would hope that whoever 
is there and whoever is here in this office would recognize 
that a nuclear war cannot be won and should not be fought 
us and soviet negotiators are working on a treaty that could 
slash the superpowers arsenals of longrange missiles by 30 
percent to 50 percent 
the president said he thought the atmosphere for arms control 
had improved in recent years in part because of the nuclear 
reactor accident at chernobyl in the ukraine 
possibly in the soviet union it was their tragic experience 
with chernobyl and to see that how an area was made unlivable for 
the people that had lived all their lives there he said and 
when you stop and think that that explosion was less than the 
power of one single warhead 
reagan also defended anew his decision to permit the sale of 
us arms to elements in iran during parts of 1985 and 1986 even 
though iran was on the state departments list of terrorist 
nations those sales and the subsequent diversion of proceeds to 
nicaraguan contra rebels mushroomed into a major embarrassment for 
his administration 
in the interview the president complained that ive labored 
under a misapprehension here well worldwide i guess about the 
socalled irancontra affair 
we argued right in this room oval office about it he said 
some people said well would that appear to be trading arms 
for hostages well no because were werent giving them to 
the kidnapers we were doing nothing to make an advantage to them 
and ive likened it to if i had a child that was kidnaped i 
dont think that you should pay ransom reagan said 
but if i found there was another individual that could get 
that child back for me in return for my doing something for him 
that would be all right and the truth was we got two hostages 
back

baltimore ap scientists presented new studies thursday about 
what may have killed the dinosaurs some 60 million years ago but 
leading advocates of two competing theories said neither side 
gained ground from the data 
this debate is going to rage on for 50 years sighed carl 
orth of the los alamos national laboratory at the meeting of the 
american geophysical union 
the debate centers on a geologic event that occurred at what is 
called the cretaceoustertiary boundary this rock formation laid 
down about 66 million years ago marks some event that culminated 
in a major extinction of plants and animals among the creatures 
wiped out during or perhaps just before this era were the 
dinosaurs 
in 1980 a group of scientiests at the university of california 
berkeley led by luis alvarez proposed that the extinctions were 
caused by the impact on earth of a massive meteorite the impact 
they suggested vaporized the space boulder and threw vast amounts 
of fine material into the atmosphere this material shaded the sun 
and caused plants to die disrupting the food chain and wiping out 
hundreds of species 
a competing theory proposes that the extinctions were caused by 
volcanic eruptions that darkened the sun the action caused a major 
change in the earths weather created a vast amount of acid rain 
and diminished the ozone layer of the atmosphere 
scientists favoring the volcano theory have proposed that the 
killer volcano was in what is now india and formed a lava deposit 
called the deccan a formation that covers thousands of miles to a 
depth of hundreds of feet 
in a paper presented to the geophysical union vincent 
courtillot of the institute of geophysics in paris said that 
samples of the deccan show that it was laid down at about the time 
of the cretaceoustertiary boundary this supports the contention 
courtillot said that the volcano occurred at the time of the major 
extinctions 
this is an important finding for the vulcanism side of the 
debate said charles officer of dartmouth there are five 
studies now that show the deccan formed during the time of the 
extinctions 64 to 69 million years ago 
but proponents of the impact theory said the volcano studies do 
not explain the presence at the cretaceoustertiary boundary of an 
element called iridium this element is rare in ordinary 
formations but is found in abundance at the ct boundary iridium 
also is found in abundance in meteorites 
courtillot admitted thursday that iridium is not found in the 
deccan 
orth however said he has found an abundance of iridium at 
formations he studied all over the american southwest 
in areas such as the raton basin in new mexico the 
cretaceoustertiary deposits have lain almost undisturbed for 66 
million years samples show a clear clean and significant level of 
iridium precisely where the alvarez theory said it should be he 
said 
that iridium is not native orth said it had to fall in 
from somewhere and the most likely source is from comets or 
meteorites that fell to earth 66 million years ago he said 
orth said he first favored the volcano theory of extinction but 
feels the growing body of evidence now favors the impact theory 
but both sides he said still have fundamental flaws that 
cannot be resolved yet 
more study is needed said orth but its something that 
will be argued for many many years

shells crashed near the syrianheld 
airport highway thursday as rival shiite moslem militias battled 
with artillery and machine guns for a 14th day despite efforts by 
syria and iran to end the fighting 
irans chief mediator acting foreign minister ali mohammed 
besharati toned down his earlier public opposition to syrian 
military intevention to snuff out the fighting for control of south 
beiruts slums 
the thud of shell explosions reverberated across beirut the 
iranianbacked hezbollah and the prosyrian amal militia who have 
been battling since may 6 accused each other of starting the duel 
shelling broke out at midafternoon and raged after nightfall 
police reported earlier that one man was killed and 10 people 
were wounded in daylong machinegun clashes between hezbollah or 
party of god and amal arabic for hope authorities said they had 
no new reports of casualties 
the syrian command said no syrian troops or positions along the 
5mile highway that abuts the shantytowns were hit in the shelling 
thursdays casualties brought the overall toll to 244 dead and 
772 injured since fighting flared in the slums where 
hezbollahaffiliated groups are believed to hold most of the 18 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
in jerusalem vernon walters us ambassador to the united 
nations said he will return to syria on friday on a mission to 
secure the release of the nine american hostages 
he declined to go into details of his damascus trip 
walters said his return to the region was prompted by concern 
for the safety of the hostages as the fighting between amal and 
hezbollah escalated 
he also apparently is seeking israels assurances that it will 
not conduct raids into lebanon against hezbollah and thereby 
endanger the hostages israel has blamed hezbollah for helping 
palestinian guerrillas attack northern israeli settlements 
the independent beirut daily paper annahar said iran was 
opposing a syrian military deployment throughout the 16squaremile 
slums to quell the fighting more than 80 percent of the estimated 
250000 residents have fled 
but besharati told reporters after meeting with lebanese 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite on thursday evening 
that if the entry of the syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees 
security we will not object 
he said wednesday that iran opposed syrian deployment because 
there was some opposition in the suburbs to such a move 
there was no explanation for besharatis change of heart 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans principal 
arab ally but the government of president hafez assad is alarmed 
by tehrans efforts through hezbollah to dominate lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest single sect 
justice minister nabih berri who heads amal announced a 
sweeping purge of the militias military command because of its 
poor performance against the outnumbered hezbollah 
the communique did not say whether new commanders had been named 
a police spokesman said before the shelling that the fighting 
had settled into mere exchanges of machinegun fire between the 
amal fighters entrenched in the district of shiyah on the northern 
edge of south beirut and hezbollah gunmen in control of 90 percent 
of the slums 
he said most of the casualties were civilians injured in shiyah 
by sniper fire one man was killed by a bullet in shiyah as he 
tried to check on his damaged apartment the spokesman said 
annahar said iran wants syria to deploy only a disengagement 
force to separate the fighters and rejects any effort to disarm 
hezbollah 
iran also wants the case of releasing foreign hostages to be 
separate from the objectives of the syrian deployment the paper 
added without further elaboration 
there have been unconfirmed reports that hezbollah was 
threatening to kill foreign hostages if syrian forces moved into 
the slums 
nine of the foreign hostages are american the longest held is 
terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was seized in west beirut on march 16 1985 
syria deployed 7500 troops and 500 tanks and armored vehicles 
on the southern western and northern edges of south beirut on 
sunday and said the force was prepared to move in to quell the 
fighting

carlos lehder rivas reputedly a 
leader of a violent colombian drug cartel responsible for most of 
the cocaine imported to this country was convicted thursday of 
smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the united states 
the verdict capped a sevenmonth trial on a federal indictment 
charging him with taking over the island of normans cay in the 
bahamas to smuggle cocaine into florida and georgia from 1978 to 
1980 
this is truly a major victory in the war on drugs said us 
attorney robert merkle the lead prosecutor 
authorities say lehder 38 is a key figure in the medellin 
cartel responsible for up to 80 percent of us cocaine imports 
and merkle said the case threatens the cartels operations 
i would say they are looking over their shoulders merkle 
said i think their days are numbered 
but lehders attorney edward shohat said the conviction 
sadly means nothing at all he accused the government of 
creating hysteria even convincing jurors their security was 
threatened he promised an appeal 
drug enforcement administration spokesman jack hook called the 
operation the worlds largest drug trafficking ring by comparison 
authorities say the french connection drug ring smuggled in about 
70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971 
this conviction sends a message to the kingpins of the cartel 
you are not able to bribe intimdate or muder your way out of 
custody in the united states hook said it has been a 
tradition in colombia but not in the united states 
in bogota colombia attorney general horacio serpa uribe said 
everyone in colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict he 
declined further comment saying only i understand that he was 
tried in accordance with all the formalities of us law 
the verdict was hailed by us attorney general edwin meese iii 
who called it an excellent example of international cooperation 
against a major drug trafficker 
lehder could face up to 150 years in prison and 350000 in 
fines for his convictions on all 11 counts ranging from possession 
of cocaine to running a continuing criminal enterprise his 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif was 
convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 15year 
sentence 
asked if lehder will spend the rest of his life behind bars 
merkle said i certainly hope so that is going to be my 
recommendation 
when the verdicts were read lehder looked down briefly then 
stared straight ahead two female jurors cried one sobbing into 
her hands as their seven days of deliberations ended 
lehders aunt in the audience also cried and slumped down on the 
bench 
following the verdicts the jury had to consider government 
motions seeking the forfeiture of millions of dollars of lehders 
property in the bahamas including land homes an airstrip and 
planes 
the sevenmonth trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 
government witnesses along with mounds of documents lehder was 
extradited to the united states last year following a firefight and 
his arrest by the colombian army at a medellin mansion 
during the trial merkle called lehder the henry ford of drug 
trafficking the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern 
hightech operation using airdrops and speed boats 
prosecutors and government witnesses described lehder as a 
onetime new york street hood who put together a vast 
cocainesmuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland 
becoming a key figure in the colombiabased medellin cartel 
the cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence across 
colombia including the assassination of a former justice minister 
and the slaying of top us dea informant adler barry seal in 
baton rouge la up to 10 armed marshals were visible in court 
during lehders trial 
witnesses talked of his flamboyant personality which included 
admiration for adolf hitler and slain former beatle john lennon 
they said lehder after initially smuggling the drug himself and 
paying mules to fly between colombia and the united states 
earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments 
he allegedly paid off bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the 
small island of normans cay a short hop from florida 
pindling himself reportedly a target of a florida grand jury 
investigation based in part on trial testimony has called the 
allegations a fairy tale 
the principal prosecution witness was ed ward an exmarine 
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the 
island he teamed up with lehder but eventually fell out with 
reed lehders codefendant he said 
after his arrest in 1981 ward began cooperating with the dea 
ward who is under federal protection and has been given a new 
identity testified about hauling 1600 kilograms of cocaine from 
colombia to normans cay and flying tons of cocaine from the 
bahamian island to airstrips in florida and georgia 
defense attorneys shohat and jose quinon hammered away at the 
credibility of ward and other prosecution witnesses they accused 
them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own crimes and 
said lehder was a legitimate businessman victimized by drug 
investigators 
the prosecution testimony was a litany of lies shohat said 
in a surprise move they presented no witnesses after the 
prosecution rested sending the trial immediately to the jury 
lehder is also under indictment in miami for his role in the 
medellin cartel but that indictment was not included in his 
extradition papers and under the uscolombia treaty in effect at 
the time he apparently cannot be tried on the charges lehder also 
is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in los angeles

socalled type a hepatitis a liver disease 
traditionally linked to poor hygiene is showing up more and more 
in outbreaks among drug abusers federal health researchers said 
thursday 
outbreaks of hepatitis a among drug abusers have occurred in new 
york california and a variety of other locations across the 
country in the past two years the national centers for disease 
control said 
in new yorks upstate cortland county for example 58 percent 
of the hepatitis a cases last year occurred among known or 
suspected drug abusers the cdc said 
between 1982 and 1986 the percentage of hepatitis a patients 
admitting previous use of injectible drugs rose from 4 percent to 
19 percent according to the cdcs viral hepatitis surveillance 
program those statistics are not complete since the program does 
not cover all cases cdc researchers stressed 
how widespread this is we cant really tell said dr craig 
n shapiro a cdc hepatitis specialist where theres a greater 
percentage of drug users there might be a greater problem 
shapiro noted that health officials reporting hepatitis cases to 
the atlantabased federal agency do not routinely report patients 
risk factors 
hepatitis b a bloodborne disease has for some time been known 
to plague intravenous drug abusers who can pass the disease 
through sharing of contaminated needles 
but its only newly recognized that they are a risk group for 
hepatitis a shapiro said hepatitis a is often transmitted in 
cases of poor hygiene through fecal contamination 
about 25000 cases each of hepatitis a and b were reported to 
the cdc last year hepatitis is a serious inflammation of the 
liver causing fever and aches which can in rare cases be fatal 
two explanations have been proposed for the new link between 
hepatitis a and drug abuse the cdc said the illness may be spread 
through use of drugs contaminated with the virus or the virus 
might be spread in direct persontoperson contact perhaps in 
needle sharing sexual contact or poor personal hygiene 
investigations of the various outbreaks have not revealed 
clear modes of transmission the cdc said in its weekly report 
it is possible that each outbreak has multiple modes of 
transmission 
in upstate new york in addition to the cortland county 
outbreak 87 cases of hepatitis a were reported in monroe county 
from december 1986 to may 1987 24 patients were injectible drug 
abusers and eight more were sexual or household contacts of the 
drug users the cdc said 
in northern california in the wake of a foodborne hepatitis a 
outbreak 33 other patients not connected to that outbreak were 
questioned 24 of the 33 patients were abusers of injectible drugs 
other druglinked outbreaks have occurred in recent years in 
alaska oregon washington state southern california oklahoma and 
connecticut the cdc said

ten thousand superagressive killer 
bees almost got a free ride into florida aboard a ship state 
agriculture officials said thursday 
the killer bee colony complete with queen bee that was 
destroyed earlier this month aboard a freighter at port everglades 
was the third and by far the largest swarm of the deadly 
africanized bees that have been found on ships arriving in florida 
within the last two years officials said 
there was chance that the swarm could have helped establish the 
killer bee problem in the united states but the odds were against 
that happening because the bees would probably have bred with their 
gentler cousins officials said 
the nasty little bugs descended from south african bees that 
escaped from a researcher in brazil in 1956 attack much more 
agressively when riled than do ordinary honeybees 
they have been blamed for several deaths of humans and livestock 
in the areas in south and central america where they have taken 
over and are also a threat to the commercial beekeeping industry 
some researchers fear they could spread across the mexican border 
into texas as early as the end of this year 
about 10000 bees were clustered aboard the containerized 
freighter senate carrying fruit and vegetables from guatemala 
when it docked may 6 near fort lauderdale said state agriculture 
commissioner doyle conner 
the inspector who destroyed the swarm john bastianelli was 
stung more than 100 times but it takes about 2000 stings to kill 
an average adult said laurence cutts the states chief apiary 
beehive inspector 
if they had gotten ashore bastianelli said the bees could have 
set up a hive and begun expanding because they included a queen 
the only member of a colony that can reproduce 
but cutts said a single colony is not much of a threat in itself 
because bees do not inbreed a single colony would breed with 
european honey bees and the africanized strain would be reduced 
with each generation until eventually it would be bred out of 
existence he said 
theres always a chance of the bees becoming established 
said cutts just what that chance is we dont know 
since 1986 signs have been posted at ports urging crews and 
dock workers to report swarms and its now common knowledge among 
seaman that authorities want to know about bee activity on ships 
also beenesting lures have be placed at major ports to attract 
bees before they can move inland officials said 
theyll go to a bee box before they go anywhere else 
hopefully bustianelli said once we find out there are bees 
there we can get them although we might have to fight them a 
while 
in late 1986 a colony of killer bees was discovered and 
destroyed aboard a ship docked in west palm beach another was 
removed by a hobbyist beekeeper in april 1987 from a freighter in 
panama city and later destroyed by agriculture officials 
the port everglades swarm was considerably larger than the 
others cutts said but it was still about a fifth the size of a 
normal established colony 
the bees also were infested with varroa mite a honeybee pest 
detected in wisconsin two years ago and since found in 13 other 
states including florida cutts said 
like the killer bee the mite is considered a potential major 
threat to the beekeeping industry the mite feeds on the body fluid 
of bees and pupae eventually causing high bee mortality and 
weakening of colonies 
the discovery of mites in the port everglades swarm has 
increased suspicion the mite infestation that began two years ago 
was caused by an africanized colony which became established 
without detection cutts said

about 200000 people gathered peacefully in a 
square in yerevan thursday in the second large demonstration in the 
armenian capital this week an armenian activist said 
several assemblies were held this week in armenia and azerbaijan 
to address ethnic unrest in the republics armenians want the 
nagornokarabakh area of neighboring azerbaijan to become part of 
their republic 
activist rafael popoyan said in a telephone interview from his 
home in yerevan that some people in the crowd thursday carried 
banners demanding annexation of the nagornokarabakh region 
however it was not clear who called thursdays demonstration or 
what its purpose was he said 
there were rumors it had been organized by officials and people 
may have been attracted by curiosity he said but nothing happened 
in the two hours after people began to gather at 6 pm 9 am 
edt in a square near the city opera house he said 
people were standing around there werent any microphones 
popoyan said 
police surrounded the square but did not interfere he said 
the majority of the people in nagornokarabakh are christian 
armenians and armenians say they are repressed by azeris who are 
moslems 
papoyan said there was a constant danger of an explosion of 
rage in nagornokarabakh armenians had been forced out of the city 
of shusha in the region by other residents and soldiers were 
surounding nagornokarabakh he said 
other calls to officials and activists in armenia and azerbaijan 
did not go through 
armenians began protesting in midfebruary for the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh at the end of the month ethnic rioting broke out 
in the azerbaijan city of sumgait thirtytwo people six azeris 
and 26 armenians were killed 
the soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction 
over nagornokarabakh opting instead for an expensive program of 
social and economic development of the area 
popoyan and moscow dissidents said about 150000 people gathered 
in yerevan on tuesday in a meeting called by the karabakh committee 
leading the effort to annex the section of azerbaijan 
they said the figure of 15000 people reported earlier by other 
moscow dissidents was wrong 
the rally was called a day after the first defendant in the 
sumgait riots was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison 
popoyan said protesters are demanding that trials of those 
accused in the rioting be open and broadcast on television 
the official baku radio said young people intellectuals and 
workers attended crowded meetings monday and wednesday in 
azerbaijan 
they called on the government and communist party to protect the 
interests of azeris living in armenia said the radio reporting 
from baku the capital of azerbaijan 
the broadcasts monitored by the british broadcasting co in 
london did not say how many people were involved 
it said incidents took place in some residential areas of 
the ararat district of armenia on may 11 that had worried some 
azeris it did not elaborate 
popoyan said there had been reports of clashes between azeris 
and armenians in the region but that he did not have details 
baku radio said members of the central committee of the 
azerbaijan communist party and of the presidium of the supreme 
soviet met with some of those attending the meetings and urged 
restraint 
vladimir ryabokon an editor of the dissident journal 
expresskhronika said in a telephone interview that tens of 
thousands of people gathered in baku on monday and tuesday to 
demand that courts not give the death sentence to any of those 
charged in the sumgait riots

oliver l north and former national security 
adviser john m poindexter made damaging admissions to congress 
about the irancontra affair that could be used as evidence against 
them in court prosecutors said thursday 
poindexters statement that he approved norths plan to funnel 
profits from the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels and 
admissions by him and north that they destroyed documents during a 
1986 investigation were among numerous excerpts of congressional 
testimony that prosecutors said were admissible in court 
even though they testified on capitol hill under limited grants 
of immunity from prosecution former national security council aide 
north poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim made statements that 
can be used against them when the irancontra case goes to trial in 
federal court the prosecution said 
volunteered testimony by defendants in their congressional 
testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial 
against them independent counsel lawrence e walsh said in 
briefs filed in us district court 
the three defendants are accused along with retired air force 
maj gen richard v secord who gave congressional testimony 
without an immunity grant of conspiring to defraud the government 
by diverting profits from the usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
the indictment includes charges that north destroyed documents 
during the november 1986 justice department investigation of the 
irancontra affair that uncovered the diversion of armssale 
profits 
it also accuses poindexter and north of lying to congressional 
committees by denying involvement in private contra resupply 
efforts 
walsh offered to forego the use of congressional testimony 
to smooth the way for a quick trial as a way of satisfying defense 
complaints that the prosecution illegally relied on immunized 
statements of the defendants 
however walsh cited hundreds of statements by north poindexter 
and hakim that were either voluntary or not responsive to the 
specific question posed by the committees and therefore not covered 
by the immunity grants 
in a joint filing defense lawyers called simply absurd 
walshs claim that the three defendants waived their privilege 
against selfincrimination during the congressional hearing 
each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and 
never relinquished it the defense said the court should 
flatly reject the ics independent counsels attempt to 
circumvent the immunity statute 
the defense also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment on 
the ground that walsh took insufficient steps to isolate his staff 
from the defendants immunized testimony which has seeped into 
every corner of this case 
the statements that walsh maintains are not covered by the 
immunity grants included poindexters assertion that the diversion 
proposed by north was clearly a new aspect that i had not thought 
about before to make a long story short in the end i thought it 
was a very good idea and i personally approved it 
in my view poindexter continued it was a matter of 
implementation of the presidents policy with regard to support for 
the contras 
poindexter also admitted that he made a very deliberate 
decision not to ask the president so that i could insulate him from 
the decision and provide some future deniability for the president 
if it ever leaked out 
the excerpts also include norths statements that he shredded 
nsc documents while justice department officials were in the next 
room during the november 1986 inquiry prosecutors said in the 
briefs 
i remember shredding documents while they were in there 
reading documents north told the committee 
do you remember shredding them in their presence asked 
arthur liman counsel for the senate panel 
i mean they were sitting in my office and the shredder was 
right outside and i walked out and shredded documents north said 
walsh contended he could also use poindexters statements that 
he intended to withhold information from the chairman of the house 
intelligence committee and his belief that north was evasive and 
withheld information from congress 
i testified that i have withheld information from congress and 
with regard to cabinet officers i didnt withhold anything from 
them that they didnt want withheld from them poindexter told 
the panel 
of norths testimony to the house intelligence committee 
poindexter testified i expected him to be evasive 
poindexter said he was sure norths answers were very 
carefully crafted nuanced the total impact im sure was one of 
withholding information from the congress 
walsh meanwhile also asked us district judge gerhard a 
gesell to set a trial date arguing that defense claims that the 
prosecution illegally relied on compelled congressional testimony 
were meritless 
he argued that gesell should set a trial date and reserve 
judgment on the immunity issues until later a demand for any 
further pretrial hearings by the defense would constitute a 
transparent attempt at delay walsh argued

conservative republicans spurning appeals 
from the senates gop and democratic leaders urged colleagues on 
thursday to ignore the fast approaching ussoviet summit and 
debate the mediumrange arms reduction treaty for weeks 
but senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said its our 
president who will be in moscow next week and hed like to have 
this treaty i say that as republican leader on behalf of a 
republican president 
we have a special responsibility to president ronald reagan 
dole said 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty calls for the 
elimination of all groundlaunched missiles with a range of 300 to 
3400 miles 
shortly before dole appealed to senators to bring any amendments 
they may have to the senate floor for action sen malcolm wallop 
rwyo told his colleagues we should not be playing beat the 
clock in our debate over the treaty 
we cannot feel rushed by the artificial deadline of next 
weeks summit wallop said it should be beside the point to 
meet a deadline 
sen gordon humphrey rnh said let us examine this treaty 
carefully and let the public relations deadline in moscow be 
damned 
president reagans summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev is set to open may 29 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva noting that no 
amendments had been offered to the text of the treaty at that 
point asked unanimous consent to move to the resolution of 
ratification 
sen jesse helms rnc the leading opponent of the treaty 
objected saying amendments were being prepared by as many as four 
senators 
about an hour later sen steve symms ridaho introduced an 
amendment that would prevent the treaty from going into effect 
until the president certifies the soviets are in compliance with 
all other arms control treaties 
he asked for separate roll call votes on all five sections of 
the amendment probably on friday morning 
the soviets cheated in the past and i think we can expect they 
are going to cheat in the future and i think each senator ought to 
go on record whether he wants to condone cheating or not symms 
said 
but sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee noted that secretary of state george p shultz 
testified that the treaty stands on its own merits and should not 
be linked to other arms control treaties or other issues 
it would be like cutting off our nose to spite our face 
pell said 
sen richard lugar rind said that linking the inf treaty to 
other issues is not in the best interest of our country 
the inf treaty is not a favor to the soviet union he said 
to make implementation depend on compliance with other treaties 
is nonsensical 
to deny ourselves a national security option does not make 
good sense lugar said this treaty stands on its own merits 
earlier wallop conceded the senate eventually will ratify the 
treaty but he urged rejection of the drumbeat from the white 
house and our leadership which demands our swift consent to the inf 
treaty 
sen pete v domenici rnm raised the possibility a 
filibuster may have begun and said i think if we were to vote 
tonight it would be a surprise if there were 10 nos i think the 
president of the united states deserves an opportunity for this 
body before he meets in moscow to say yes or no 
sen dan quayle rind told him i dont think now is the 
time to start harping that we have to do this by a certain 
deadline 
wallop added for us to be hurried to suit the climate of a 
summit is just a wrong urging at this moment 
sen dan evans rwash a treaty supporter said this treaty 
should not be asked to bear the burden of amendments which are 
nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to delay its 
ratifications 
evans said hardcore arms control opponents have described the 
treaty unfairly 
for some the treaty apparently would result in apocalyptic 
military consequences he said that means we have had a steady 
stream of misleading false testimony from the very military 
leaders we depend upon and i dont think thats true 
we do this treaty a disservice if we treat it as something 
more or less than what it is a single step back from the nuclear 
precipice evans said i think it is time to focus on what is 
in front of us instead of trying to bring in all of the 
nonrelated nongermane elements 
although debate was sporadic sen john stennis dmiss the 
senates most senior member endorsed the pact calling it a 
small first step in the long and difficult process of 
reducing the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust 
but humphrey denounced it saying the inf treaty is a fraud 
a dangerous fraud 
the senate voted 916 wednesday to reject the first conservative 
attack on the treaty that was a point of order raised by sen 
jesse helms rnc who claimed gorbachev wasnt authorized to 
sign the pact and it was therefore invalid 
byrd told reporters on thursday the first vote would indicate 
the senate did not think it was a serious point i did not think it 
was

a house subcommittee approved legislation 
thursday that would require television stations to limit 
advertising during childrens programs 
the measure approved 222 by the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications is a bipartisan compromise 
stripped of earlier proposals to prohibit programs built around toy 
manufacturers products 
senate legislation on childrens tv would bar these socalled 
programlength commercials 
the bill passed by the house subcommittee would limit tv 
stations to no more than 10 12 minutes of commercials per hour 
during childrens shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during 
these programs on weekdays 
it also would require the federal communications commission to 
consider when deciding whether to renew a stations license 
whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served 
the educational needs of children in its overall programming 
the full committee was scheduled to consider the measure next 
week 
the national association of broadcasters said it would not 
oppose the house measure and predicted that no stations would have 
difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation

legislation designed to protect government 
employees who disclose wrongdoing was approved unanimously by a 
senate committee thursday 
the bills sponsor sen carl levin dmich said the measure 
makes it easier for whistleblowers to win a reprisal case and 
guarantees them the right to a hearing 
the bill sends a strong message to federal employees that they 
will not be punished for disclosing government fraud waste and 
abuse levin said 
thursdays approval by the senate governmental affairs committee 
clears the way for consideration of the bill by the full senate 
under the bill the office of the special counsel an 
independent federal agency would have responsibility for 
protecting employees who disclose wrongdoing 
recent statistics show that 70 percent of federal employees 
claiming knowledge of waste fraud and abuse fail to report it 
levin said these statistics are proof that the current system 
has failed to convince employees that they will be rewarded instead 
of punished if they disclose government wrongdoing

the soviet union lost up to 15000 soldiers in 
afghanistan a government official said thursday as the first 
contingent of red army troops was arriving home from the war with 
moslem guerrillas 
eduard rosental a political observer for the official novosti 
press agency told reporters that a western estimate of 12000 to 
15000 soviet deaths in the armys 8 years in afghanistan was 
approximately correct 
it was the first time a soviet official gave any estimate of 
soviet losses in afghanistan soviet officials have refused to 
specify the death toll or even the number of soviet troops deployed 
there 
in other developments thursday pakistans acting foreign 
minister implied his country will continue to help arm the 
anticommunist guerrillas and tass said afghanistans foreign 
ministry complained to un monitors that pakistan was sending arms 
to the afghan guerrillas 
the soviet withdrawal began sunday in accordance with a 
unmediated peace accord signed april 14 in geneva the first 
1300 soviets to leave afghanistan crossed the border into soviet 
uzbekistan on wednesday 
radio moscow reported that the returning soldiers sent a message 
to president reagan urging him to use americas prestige and your 
personal authority on behalf of this humane goal that of bringing 
war in afghanistan to an end and to ensure that no more bombs fall 
no more people die and no more children become invalids 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said thursday 
that highranking defense and foreign ministry officials would meet 
with reporters next week to discuss afghanistan 
rosental was asked at a news conference how many soviet soldiers 
had died in afghanistan 
he reviewed various western media assessments including a 
report by agence francepresse that 12000 to 15000 soviets had 
been killed 
i think the figures cited by agence francepresse are more or 
less correct but you can obtain more correct figures from our 
military men rosental said 
a sovietinspired revolution in april 1978 brought a marxist 
leadership to power in afghanistan the kremlin dispatched troops 
and tanks in december 1979 to help the kabul government fight 
guerrillas 
a state department report released in december estimated the 
number of deaths and injuries among soviets serving in afghanistan 
since 1979 to be at least 33000 to 38000 with at least a 
third of them fatalities 
in addition many soldiers died from diseases the report said 
if the death figures mentioned by rosental are correct the 
soviet union suffered far fewer losses in afghanistan than the 
united states did during the vietnam war when about 50000 
americans were killed or mortally wounded 
rosental rejected a reporters suggestion that the kremlin was 
abandoning an allied government still beleaguered by a nationwide 
insurgency 
to withdraw troops does not mean to leave the country in the 
lurch he said we leave many cultural and economic facilities 
there 
the head of the soviet contingent in afghanistan lt gen boris 
gromov told reporters in kabul last week that more than 1 billion 
in bases and equipment were to be left behind for the afghan 
governments use 
soviet soldiers have contended the afghan army estimated at 
40000 soldiers can protect the government 
pakistans acting foreign minister zain noorani returned 
thursday from a visit to moscow 
the official pakistani news agency app quoted him as saying 
that although the purpose of the pakistan mission to moscow was 
of goodwill his country would abide by the geneva accord and the 
policy of symmetry 
under that policy the united states and soviet union will 
continue to supply the guerrillas and afghan government forces 
respectively until one of the sides stops 
i have been quoted as saying that pakistan will stop all 
assistance to the mujahedeen rebels noorani said according to 
app this is incorrect we will fulfill all obligations that 
we have taken upon ourselves in the geneva accord and after the 
soviet pullout becomes operative on may 15 1988 
pakistan is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for 
military supplies to the rebels which mainly come from the united 
states pakistan officially denies it has ever helped ship the arms

salvador called on the united states and the soviet union thursday 
to stop intervening militarily in central america and instead send 
tools that will promote growth 
he said nations in the region must find political solutions to 
their difficulties and the problems must be tackled from within 
instead of sending weapons the united states should send 
implements for development rivera damas said but no matter 
how much we shout to them not to send arms they will keep sending 
them as long as the other side communist countries keeps sending 
them 
the problems in central america are geopolitical he said 
in some countries the united states intervenes and in others the 
socialist bloc and through them the soviet union

supported nonintervention and the selfdetermination of our 
peoples

opportunity we should not let go by he said

american governments of political opponents saying we cant 
exclude dissidents just because of their ideas

house speaker jim wright on thursday denied he 
violated ethics rules and said a watchdog groups call for an 
official investigation was based on unsubstantiated allegations 
but a rightwing opponent of the speaker said pressure for a 
house probe was increasing 
common cause a nonprofit group which promotes tougher campaign 
and ethics laws called wednesday for the house ethics committee to 
hire an independent counsel to examine two possible breaches of 
conflictofinterest rules by wright which have been the subject of 
newspaper reports 
in one case wright has received far above the normal percentage 
of royalties for a book he wrote the publisher was a campaign 
supporter who received more than 250000 in business from wrights 
reelection committee in the 19851986 period 
common cause president fred wertheimer said the ethics committee 
needed to examine whether the speakers campaign committees were at 
all involved in publishing or selling the book which he said could 
be a violation of house or other federal conflictofinterest rules 
wright on thursday denied there was a campaign link 
my campaign committee did not pay any amount for publishing 
the book nor did it purchase any copies of the book he said he 
said the house rules clearly authorize members of congress to 
receive royalty payments of this kind 
wright also denied anything improper in a second issue raised by 
common cause his efforts to help constituents including some 
campaign contributors in their dealings with the federal home loan 
bank board 
nothing in the house rules prohibits a member from acting as 
an ombudsman for the citizens he represents in fact it is 
considered to be an important part of our job as representatives of 
the people he said 
conservative opponents of the speaker led by rep newt 
gingrich rga have been spotlighting reports of his personal 
dealings 
but they have not formally asked the ethics committee for an 
investigation if a member makes such a request the ethics 
committee is required to respond 
gingrich said thursday his plans to submit such a complaint had 
been delayed by gop lawyers examining the case but he hoped to 
have it ready early next month 
if you are going to take on the second most powerful elected 
official in america you have got to have arguments that are 
ironclad he said 
the common cause request gingrich said means the ethics 
committee will face an overwhelming burden to at least initiate 
an investigation when he makes his own request

a senior government minister announced 
thursday that indian troops battling tamil rebels in sri lanka will 
withdraw from the island nation 
the government is very keen to see the indian peacekeeping 
troops leave the land and river development minister gamini 
dissanayake told parliament they are definitely going 
india has more than 50000 troops in sri lanka to enforce an 
accord designed to end the fiveyear war by militant tamils 
fighting for a separate homeland 
dissanayake said the indian troops would leave in a phased 
pullout but that the date for the initial withdrawal had yet to be 
discussed 
official sources in the capital colombo said the matter was 
likely to be discussed this month when indias defense minister 
krishna chandra pant visits colombo president junius r 
jayewardene said pant will visit the capital may 30 
pant is also likely to discuss peace proposals with tamil 
militants said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
india this island nations northern neighbor has a large tamil 
population of its own and mediated the peace accord signed last 
july the accord grants some autonomy to tamils in exchange for a 
surrender of weapons but it has been rejected by the main tamil 
guerrilla group the liberation tigers of eelam 
indian officials have been holding talks with tamil rebel 
leaders to try to persuade them to accept the accord but tamil 
rebels say it doesnt go far enough in giving them autonomy 
tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population they claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority buddhist sinhalese 
many sinhalese also have rejected the peace accord on grounds it 
makes too many concessions to the tamils sinhalese extremists have 
threatened to kill politicians and others who support it 
a senior police official said thursday that sinhalese extremists 
killed a candidate of the governing united national party in the 
central kandy district the officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity identified the victim as jayaratna heenbanda who was 
going to run in provincial council elections 
a 19yearold student aruna saman dissanayake also was killed 
when gunmen shot at another governing party candidate sella

nine black police officers have quit the 
tampa police union to protest its staunch support of a white 
officer fired for making racist and sexist slurs 
mayor sandy freedmans firing last week of officer charles w 
glass who admitted making the remarks was criticized by the 
police benevolent association who said the firing was a violation 
of due process 
the associations support of glass in turn caused nine black 
officers to withdraw from the union in protest 
r jeffrey stull an attorney for the police union urged the 
mayor to reinstate glass but the mayor was awaiting the return 
next week of public safety director robert smith mayoral spokesman 
john dunn said thursday 
thenacting police chief col george fox reprimanded glass last 
month after glass told police investigators he made sexually and 
racially derogatory comments about officer vicky thomas 
the mayors policy however calls for a punishment of at least 
15 days suspension or possibly dismissal for such violations said 
dunn the mayor fired glass last friday 
dunn said there has been no decision on whether fox should be 
disciplined for not following the policy both fox and police chief 
austin mclane were out of town thursday and unavailable for comment 
one of the nine officers who quit the union said his decision 
was prompted not only by the associations backing of glass but 
union president bob sheehans criticism last month of a stinging 
manuscript on race relations by hillsborough county sheriffs maj 
arnie myers who is black 
excerpts of the manuscript were published in the tampa tribune 
and sparked a flood of complaint calls to the sheriffs office 
the pba is not in my best interest said detective bob 
wright 32 a 10year officer and union member for the past two 
years who said he supported glass firing 
sheehan met with 20 black officers for three hours wednesday he 
said the group discussed forming a minority officers committee to 
address complaints but no action was taken

ninety percent of catholic educators and 
church officials surveyed believe enrollment in catholic schools 
will decrease by more than half in the next 15 years according to 
a survey released thursday 
although the survey did not ask respondents why they thought 
enrollment would drop one catholic educator suggested three 
causes fewer children being born more parochial schools being 
closed and new schools not opening as people move around the 
country 
the educator the rev thomas gallagher the united states 
catholic conference secretary for education suggested that 
catholic education can be marketed better to draw more students 
he urged parochial schools to return to incorporating the gospel 
and academic excellence a sense of church and community public 
service to that community and prayer 
the survey sponsored by the national catholic educational 
association was released as the weeklong catholic education 
futures project conference got under way thursday at the university 
of dayton 
gallagher said this was the first time 22 groups in catholic 
education have met to discuss religious education problems more 
than 300 people were expected to attend the conference 
among the findings in the survey were comments by a few 
respondents that catholic schools were becoming elitist because of 
their expense and their dwindling numbers 
education will be in the hands of the rich because of the 
cost wrote one respondent 
ncea member and conference chairwoman sister suzanne hall said 
of the comments on elitism my sense from all these folks is that 
we dont want catholic schools catholic education to become 
elitist i dont see it as inevitable 
i think a lot more things need to be done on collaboration at 
the parish level she said 
gallagher said schooling traditionally has been a community 
responsibility deserving of parish subsidy but that this attitude 
has faded as fewer parishoners have had children to send to school 
the report surveyed 336 people representing 18 catholic 
educational organizations including traditional parochial schools 
youth ministries adult religious education catholic universities 
and seminaries they agreed or disagreed with 50 statements about 
the future of catholic education and said whether they thought the 
expected result was desirable 
ninety percent of the respondents predicted enrollment in 
catholic elementary and secondary schools would drop to slightly 
more than 1 million by 2007 compared with 29 million in 1985 
more than 4300 catholic schools have closed since the mid1960s 
among other responses to the questions a majority felt it 
unlikely that the government will provide much financial support to 
church schools 
and although most respondents felt that catholic schools and 
parishes will cooperate with one another to broaden religious 
education some felt that pastors are too provincial or that 
high schools do not value cooperation

a 5yearold schoolyard preacher and his 
sister were suspended again thursday for violating school rules 
while angry parents circulated a petition to stop the childrens 
sermonizing on school grounds 
the children matthew strode and his 6yearold sister pepper 
returned thursday morning to eastfield elementary school from their 
third suspension in 18 days arriving in a car driven by their 
mother robin when they refused to go into the school they were 
suspended yet again 
they stood at an entrance surrounded by a crowd of reporters 
tv cameras and other schoolchildren and waited for a cue from 
their 10yearold brother duffey who was outside the school gate 
duffey was suspended for 10 days last friday for refusing to 
stop proselytizing and go to class 
for god so loved the world duffey called from the gate 
setting off a stream of preaching from his younger brother 
now is the day of salvation matthew cried as pepper stood 
beside him holding a bible hell has enlarged herself and opened 
her mouth without measure 
fools make a mock at sin the younger boy shouted at 
principal jim gorst when asked repeatedly to come inside the 
school both children were then suspended 
though she stood beside her brother pepper does not preach 
because she doesnt want to the childrens father david has said 
officials at the school which has an enrollment of 370 call 
the preaching a disruption but the childrens parents who moved 
to marion 17 months ago from pennsylvania call the suspensions an 
attack on their constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and 
freedom of religion 
gorst said parents appeared increasingly disturbed by the 
preaching on school grounds and were circulating a petition asking 
the strodes to stop it some had complained that their own children 
were frightened by the fireandbrimstone images conjured up by the 
sermons 
he added that the strode children were being suspended not for 
their preaching but for remaining outside the school building when 
school rules require them to be inside 
if the news media was not here and if the offers for talk 
shows were not present i believe in my mind theyd be back in 
school he said he said if the children would agree to come to 
school friday and discontinue preaching the suspension would be 
dropped 
hazel strickland a school parent who signed the petition said 
she did so because theyre talking about demons and devils and 
the other children dont like it 
id just as soon have my young ones home safe said elaine 
harris another parent 
mrs harris said she drove her three children to school thursday 
morning but turned the car around and drove back when she caught 
sight of reporters and two sheriffs cars at the school 
i send my kids to school to get an education mrs harris 
said i take them to church on sunday to get their education in 
church and i dont need some 11yearold or whatever telling my 
son hes going to die or were going to die and all go to hell 
the childrens father said the people who signed the petition 
were ungodly 
of course that would be the reaction david strode said 
if youre in an ungodly community who would want preaching going 
on 
as for the school officials he said they will have to answer 
to the lord for kicking three children out of school one day 
theyll deal directly with the lord jesus christ

tass said thursday that the policymaking central 
committee of the communist party will meet in what is likely to be 
a key session before next months important party conference 
the official news agency said the ruling politburo endorsed a 
draft program for the conference due to open june 28 and that it 
would be submitted to the central committee and workers for 
consideration 
a meeting of the 300odd central committee members could be held 
next week in conjunction with an expected session of the supreme 
soviet which is likely to ratify the ussoviet treaty banning 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
that would allow time for the largely formal nationwide 
discussion of the program before the conference opens 
tass did not say what program for the party conference was 
endorsed 
but earlier this week a central committee official dmitri a 
lisovolik said the conference would take up proposals to limit the 
term of the party general secretary the post held by mikhail s 
gorbachev 
in speeches this year gorbachev also has said the conference 
will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and judicial systems 
he has said a full meeting of the central committee will be held 
to discuss the question of relations among the soviet unions more 
than 100 ethnic groups 
politburo membership can be changed at a central committee 
plenum and the conference that follows also gives gorbachev a rare 
opportunity to strengthen his support on the central committee 
gorbachev himself has called for creating a system to replace 
aging party officials and has been especially critical of the 
18year rule of president leonid i brezhnev as a period of 
stagnation and corruption brezhnev died in 1982 
lisovolik chief of the us section of the central committees 
international department said proposals before the conference will 
call for limiting the general secretary to two or three eightyear 
terms 
reports of a serious policy dispute between gorbachev and yegor 
k ligachev the no 2 man in the kremlin surfaced in moscow last 
month some reports said the dispute rose from the newspaper 
sovietskaya rossiyas running an article in march questioning 
whether gorbachevs reforms had gone too far 
some commentators in the official soviet press suggested that 
the article was the start of an effort by conservatives to halt 
gorbachevs reforms at the party conference

a man who says he is prejudiced against 
anything that isnt white was indicted by a federal grand jury 
thursday on a charge of threatening to kill black presidential 
candidate jesse jackson 
londell williams 30 of washington mo was named in all four 
counts of the indictment his wife tammy 27 was named in three 
of the counts but she was not accused of being involved in the 
threat on jacksons life 
the indictment said that on or about may 10 williams knowingly 
and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily harm upon 
jesse jackson 
the indictment charges both of the williamses with possessing an 
ar15 rifle that had been altered to make it fully automatic that 
gun has been identified by the government as the weapon that was to 
be used in a plot to kill jackson 
the pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to 
harm a government informant in retaliation 
the indictment said the williamses used intimidation and threats 
of physical harm on an informant with the intent to hinder delay 
and prevent the communication of information relating to the 
possible commission of a federal offense 
prosecutors and the couples attorneys met for several hours 
after the indictments issued thursday but declined comment 
afterward cynthia short mrs williams lawyer would say only 
that they the williamses are scared 
williams a construction worker faces a maximum penalty of 
three years in prison and 250000 in fines on the first count on 
each of the other three counts the williamses can be sentenced to 
10 years in prison and fined 250000 
us district judge edward l filippine set the williams 
arraignment for 930 am monday 
in an interview wednesday at a federal detention center in 
belleville ill across the mississippi river from st louis 
williams denied conspiring to kill jackson and said that although 
he sympathized with white supremacists he did not belong to any 
extremist group 
i deny that there is a crime done he said i did not 
conspire with anyone to kill any presidential candidate 
i do have prejudices against anything that isnt white 
williams said but he added regarding jackson if the man makes 
it to president more power to him 
the williamses who live in rural eastern missouri with their 
three daughters have been held without bond in belleville since 
federal agents arrested them at their apartment friday the arrests 
were announced tuesday 
federal agents initially said williams claimed he belonged to 
two violent whitesupremacist groups the covenant the sword and 
the arm of the lord csa and the order 
but tom den ouden who heads the springfield mo fbi office 
said he had found no evidence williams or his wife belonged to the 
order or the csa 
franklin county mo sheriff paul j bruns said the case 
stemmed from an incident earlier this month when his department 
received a call about a domestic argument in which a woman 
brandished and fired into the air what appeared to be an automatic 
weapon 
an informer told investigators that williams not only possessed 
a rifle that had been converted to fire as a machine gun but that 
he was also part of a plot to kill jackson on june 21 or july 4 
bruns said 
the sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area 
where they found the altered ar15 assault rifle federal

pakistans acting foreign minister 
zain noorani returned thursday from a goodwill visit to moscow 
but indicated that this country will continue to help arm 
anticommunist afghan guerrillas 
a leader of insurgents fighting afghan and retreating soviet 
troops told the associated press his forces might concentrate on 
taking a provincial capital in northern afghanistan 
noorani minister of state for foreign affairs returned to 
karachi from a threeday visit to the soviet union which he was 
reported as saying was more than satisfactory 
it was a notable restoration of harmony for two countries long 
at opposite sides of the war in afghanistan 
pakistans official app news agency quoted noorani as saying 
that although the purpose of the pakistan mission to moscow was 
of goodwill pakistan will abide by the april geneva accord and 
the concept of symmetry 
he was referring to the agreement signed by washington moscow 
kabul and islamabad that outlined the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan the united states and soviet union agreed they 
will keep supplying the guerrillas known as the mujahedeen and 
afghan communist forces respectively until one side or the other 
stops 
i have been quoted as saying that pakistan will stop all 
assistance to the mujahedeen this is incorrect we will 
fulfill all obligations that we have taken upon ourselves in the 
geneva accord and after the soviet pullout becoming operative on 
may 15 1988 he was quoted as saying 
the geneva accord covered four basic principles the pace and 
time frame of the ninemonth soviet withdrawal the halt of foreign 
interference in the afghan conflict the right of afghans to 
determine their own government and the safe return of some 5 
million refugees from pakistan and iran 
pakistan is bound by the accord to stop serving as conduit for 
mainly us military supplies to the guerrillas known as the 
mujahedeen although pakistan officially denies it has ever done so 
there have been confirmed reports that dozens of trucks have 
crossed the loosely guarded border from pakistan to afghanistan 
with arms and ammunition for the moslem insurgents 
it is for those who matter the united states and the soviet 
union to stop the supply of arms to any individual faction of 
afghan people noorani was quoted as saying this is a simple 
case as the physicians can diagnose themselves 
nooranis remarks indicated he reached an understanding with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that sovietpakistani 
relations should improve although pakistan has served as 
headquarters for the guerrillas fighting kabuls marxist government 
and the soviet troops who have supported it since december 1979 
the visit commemorated the 40th anniversary of sovietpakistani 
relations 
moslem pakistan achieved statehood in 1947 when it was 
partitioned from hindu india under an agreement with the british 
empire 
as noorani was speaking in karachi the chairman of the 
sevenparty muhjahedeen alliance said in peshawar pakistan that 
the insurgents would begin attacking afghan army strongholds which 
the muhahedeen felt they can take easily 
we will be sure enough we can occupy and the enemy cannot 
resist gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of the revolutionary 
hezbiislami guerrilla party told the ap

anger and guilt but no satisfying 
answers remain for the families and friends of 27 people killed 
in a fiery bus crash a priest said thursday at the funeral for 
three of the victims 
seven of the dead were buried thursday all but two at the north 
hardin memorial gardens graveyard that abuts the high school they 
would have graduated from one day 
gov wallace wilkinson declared a day of mourning with flags at 
halfstaff throughout the state 
the saying is trite but painfully true they had their whole 
lives before them said the rev leo craycroft during mass at st 
christopher church in radcliff for mary catheryn daniels 14 
denise ellen voglund 13 and amy christine wheelock 14 
twentyfour children and three adults were killed saturday night 
when a pickup truck traveling in the wrong direction on interstate

ablaze

this army post town as the bus owned by radcliff first assembly of 
god church carried members of the churchs youth group and their 
guests home from a day at the kings island amusement park north of 
cincinnati the driver of the truck allegedly was drunk 
why do bad things happen to good people none of us can answer 
that question said the rev gene waggoner at a citywide evening 
memorial service and if we could it wouldnt take away your 
grief 
i suggest that you do not blame anybody on that bus i suggest 
that you dont blame god god did not cause this there is sin in 
this world and there are those who make wrong choices and 
innocent people pay the price 
gov wallace wilkinson and maj gen thomas h tait commander 
of nearby fort knox were among dignitaries in attendance at the 
service in the football stadium of north hardin high school

set up on the field to boost capacity to about 4000 rows of 
people crowded around the perimeters of the field

what a friend we have in jesus at the start of the service and 
many clasped hands and supported others during prayers 
w don tennison pastor of the radcliff first assembly of god 
church read letters from president and nancy reagan and vice 
president and barbara bush during the memorial 
your pain and loss is ours too said the letter from the 
reagans your countrymen are with you in prayer 
after the ceremony wilkinson and the preachers who led the 
service slowly made their way down a row of family members to 
express their sympathies

cemetery where five of the victims of saturdays crash were buried 
earlier thursday 
the first victim to be buried was julie ann earnest 12

joshua could have escaped but jerked away from the others ran 
back and crammed aaron out a window 
aaron conyers 13 remained in critical condition at kosair 
childrens hospital in louisville 
there are no real satisfying answers craycroft said during 
the mass which drew an overflow crowd to the small brick church on 
a hilltop overlooking the middle school 
we expect older people to die children in their prime do 
not die craycroft said we may feel guilty we may feel angry 
and all of these are quite natural 
speakers were set up outside st christopher to accommodate 
mourners who could not be seated inside the coffins were decked 
with flowers and wreaths and lined endtoend before a flowerladen 
altar

cardinal jaime sin archbishop of manila said he received a 
telegram from mrs marcos pleading with me to voice an appeal to 
the government to allow former president marcos to return to the 
country for the funeral of his mother 
the cardinal said he forwarded the request without comment to 
president corazon aquino and other government officials who have 
better information 
marcos mother josefa edralinmarcos died may 4 at age 95 no

joining a growing number of jurists a federal 
judge here on thursday declared unconstitutional the sentencing 
guidelines implemented last fall for federal crimes 
us district judge harold h greene ruled that the 1984 law 
setting up a commission appointed by the president to write the 
guidelines violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of 
powers 
the judge found that congress had unconstitutionally delegated 
legislative power to the sevenmember us sentencing commission 
the system thus departs from the basic principle that those 
who make or administer this nations laws shall be accountable for 
their actions greene ruled he accused lawmakers of 
relinquishing their power to insulate congress from extended 
debate and political complaint 
it also departs from the constitutions requirement for clear 
delineations between and among the three branches of government 
he said of the system 
the judge however stayed his order pending supreme court 
review of the question so far 59 federal judges have struck down 
the guidelines as unconstitutional while 31 have upheld the 
regulations 
public citizen a ralph nader group that is challenging the 
guidelines on behalf of criminal defendants and the justice 
department on thursday petitioned the supreme court to review a 
decision by a federal judge in kansas city that struck down the 
guidelines 
the petition seeks highcourt review before the decision is 
appealed to the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis 
the guidelines intended to eliminate wide disparities in 
sentences for the same crimes provide a complicated formula for 
determining prison terms for defendants convicted of federal crimes 
greene said he was particularly troubled by the lack of 
accountability for the way sentences are imposed under the 
guidelines which took effect last fall for crimes committed after 
nov 1 
no one criminal defendant victim and the public can know 
who or what branch of government is responsible for sentences that 
are imposed and there is no one who can legitimately be held 
accountable politically or otherwise for sentences that may be 
regarded as too lenient greene wrote 
the simple and constitutionally tested system of allocating 
responsibility for crafting sentencing policy to congress and for 
imposing individual sentences to a particular judge is essentially 
gone replaced by a hodgepodge of contributions to sentencing from 
personnel from several different branches of government he added 
the commission includes three judges who are appointed by the 
president from a list of six federal judges submitted by the us 
judicial conference 
unlike the delegation of legislative powers to regulatory 
agencies the matters being delegated involve not the regulation 
of economic forces and factors but basic policy decisions of law 
enforcement of criminal control and of punishment greene said 
the case before greene involved a defendant convicted last month 
of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute defense attorney 
greg english said that under the old sentencing rules client 
wilbert s brodie would face a minimum imprisonment of five years 
english said the guidelines would require a much longer minimum 
sentence but that without the probation departments report it 
would be impossible to predict what the regulations would prescribe

in the third world media and spread them throughout the world 
that us military scientists had created the aids virus as a 
biological warfare weapon 
but wick said that during gorbachevs visit to washington last 
december gorbachev agreed that disinformation was 
counterproductive to his efforts to reduce tensions 
wick said that later following a confrontation between 
gorbachev and us secretary of state george shultz the soviets 
admitted they had erred when they claimed aids to be a creation of 
us germ warfare research yet they continued sporadically to 
spread the aids disinformation story 
after a sovietamerican meeting in washington april 2022 to 
discuss media relations wick said promises were made that this 
disinformation would now cease 
already we have seen perhaps the first fruits of our 
discussions on disinformation wick said he said future soviet 
actions would determine how sincere the soviet undertakings are 
in a later interview wednesday with editors and reporters of the 
associated press wick cited other soviet moves to improve 
ussoviet contacts he said these included a soviet agreement to 
allow the voice of america the usias radio network to cover the 
moscow summit this month 
he added that it also looks like voice of america will be 
allowed to open a bureau in moscow amerika usias 
russianlanguage magazine may be allowed to increase its 
circulation from 14000 to 100000 copies 
wick said soviet citizens will also be able to purchase american 
books by mail order at a permanent american book display in moscow 
in moscow the weekly moscow news reported wednesday that 
officials have lifted restrictions on the sale of american and west 
european newspapers and magazines which will be sold at ordinary 
newsstands in the future 
wick also said that soviet officials promised this month to stop 
interfering with us domestic radio broadcasting through cuban 
transmissions 
three us stations operating on the frequency of 1040 
kilohertz complained last year that englishlanguage soviet 
broadcasts from cuba were interfering with their operations

philippine defense secretary fidel ramos said 
wednesday usphilippines relations are on an upswing 
i am confident our relations will continue to be strong and 
will be reinforced in the future ramos said after meetings with 
secretary of state george shultz and michael armacost 
undersecretary of state for political affairs 
earlier he held extensive talks with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci his official host and met with members of congressional 
committees on asian and military affairs 
the meetings were very fruitful in terms of expediting 
delivery of military equipment and joint projects under us aid 
programs ramos said 
progress also was made on plans for restoring the monument at 
corregidor the site of a historic struggle against the japanese 
invasion of the philippines in world war ii he said us 
veterans organization are to provide some of the financing for the 
project 
ramos has declined to comment on talks in manila on the future 
of american military installations in the islands saying the 
matter is being handled at another level but he said other 
countries of the association of southeast asian nations recognize 
the security value of the bases to the region 
however he spoke wednesday about his countrys nuclear weapons 
ban that could threaten the future of us bases in the islands 
that ban is outranked by the higher interest of national 
security he said in a television interview on cable news network 
those who have sponsored a bill in the philippines senate that 
would enforce the ban against us ships do not really represent 
all of the security opinions in the philippines he said 
the philippines constitution contains a clause banning nuclear 
weapons but it is also equally true that in the same constitution 
that this ban should be consistent with our national interests 
ramos said while there is a nuclearfree interest there is to 
my mind a higher interest which is the national security interest 
so the door is not completely closed 
after all this is just a bill that still has to be passed by 
the house of representatives and go through the complete 
legislative process he continued its not yet the law 
its not yet the closed door 
the united states has said enforcement of the ban would be 
incompatible with american policy of refusal to confirm or deny the 
presence of atomic weapons on particular vessels 
ramos said the philippines request for higher payments for us 
use of military bases in the philippines is not a matter of just 
plain dollars and cents but of the value of the installations to 
the security of southeast asia and the south china sea 
if we are to be full partners there must be a better 
balance he said the philippines is very concerned about being 
dragged into the global responsibilities of the united states and 
it is on the basis of this recognition of each others roles that 
the bases review is now being conducted 
the secretary said he agrees with president corazon aquinos 
policy of preventing her deposed predecessor ferdinand marcos now 
in hawaii from returning to the philippines i was part of the 
cabinet crisis committee that recommended this step and in fact 
the cabinet as a whole unanimously recommended marcos exclusion 
he said 
ramos was scheduled thursday to address the council on foreign 
relations and meet with media executives in new york city and he 
said was looking forward to a class reunion friday at his alma 
mater the us military academy at west point ny 
ramos also planned stops in fort bragg nc atlanta and los 
angeles san diego and san francisco in california before leaving 
for manila on may 26

an estimated 500 to 600 
vietnamese army deserters languish in thai refugee camps largely 
forgotten and unwanted 
thailand doesnt want them to stay 
vietnam wont take them back even if they wanted to go back 
western countries including the united states for the most 
part refuse to resettle them as refugees even though they maintain 
they are victims of vietnams communist system 
the deserters are men who were sent to fight guerrillas opposing 
the vietnamesebacked government in cambodia 
the most are at the refugee camp here in phanat nikhom near 
bangkok where about 430 live together in ramshackle bamboo and 
canvas huts isolated from other vietnamese who fear them as part 
of the communist government they fled 
this rejection and the trauma of the war and their flight have 
created what one western relief worker called a hopeless 
helpless lost subculture 
in a camp where most refugees are preparing for new lives in the 
west many deserters have remained for years deep in depression 
some have attemped suicide officials said still others have 
turned to drugs and violence 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and now has 125000 troops 
fighting 50000 or more guerrillas 
more than 1000 vietnamese soldiers have fled to thailand since 
1981 according to thai officials but desertions have decreased in 
more recent years probably because the fighting no longer is near 
the thaicambodian border which made it easy for soldiers to 
desert 
some 300 deserters arrived in phanat nikhom in 1985 when 
thousands of vietnamese troops overran guerrilla bases near the 
border but only 80 came in 1987 and just two so far this year 
the deserters usually single males with few skills or ties 
abroad are among the most difficult refugees in thailand to 
resettle 
canada has taken the most nearly 150 since 1981 
twothirds of the 76 deserters resettled last year were taken by 
scandanavian nations which traditionally accept difficult cases 
the united states by far the biggest resettler of indochinese 
overall has taken only about 100 largely because it considers the 
deserters part of an occupying army that persecuted others 
some aid officials criticize the refusal to accept more 
deserters as being based on political not humanitarian 
considerations 
people dont think of us as people who escaped the army of the 
communists complained hoang manh chuong a 27yearold deserter 
who has been here since 1984 and was rejected by the united states 
in january they think we are still bad people 
chuong said he fled while on guard duty in august 1983 a month 
after arriving in western cambodia he wandered into the jungle for 
five days with nothing to eat following the sunset to the thai 
border he said he added that khmer rouge guerrillas held him 
captive for two months and beat him as a suspected spy he was then 
jailed in aranyaprathet in thailand for 10 months before reaching 
phanat nikhom 
like several others interviewed chuong said he deserted because 
the communists persecuted his family after 1975 he said his 
father a former south vietnam soldier was held in political 
reeducation camps for six years 
chuong said vietnamese who flee to thailand as boat people and 
get more favored treatment as refugees are rich people who can 
afford to pay for boat passage the deserters he added are poor 
chuong said he continues to study english in hopes of getting to 
the united states but he added that many other deserters are too 
angry and dont care any more they get drunk and wind up in 
the camp jail he said 
another deserter le truong truc 29 became addicted to heroin 
i felt very sad ive been in this camp a long time he 
explained he had been accepted by finland but the finns withdrew 
their approval after he was arrested on a charge of buying drugs 
from a thai trader in january

peter fromm a naval cadet with the first west 
german military unit ever to visit israel said he had mixed 
feelings about being here we dont know what the reaction is 
going to be 
moshe biermann 54 a holocaust survivor felt anxiety about the 
young sailors being on israeli soil when i see german uniforms 
i still feel a stab in my heart 
the scene at the port of haifa recently reflected the state of 
relations today between west germany and israel on its 40th 
anniversary as a nation 
if you look back on the history of the two peoples we both 
have come a long way said aviv shiron the israeli foreign 
ministry spokesman relations today generally are very good 
but both israelis and germans professed lingering unease when 
dealing with each other on a personal level and experts say that 
is because neither nation has come to terms with the past 
the germans feel the need to forget there is a strong current 
to minimize the holocaust said professor yeshayahu nir of hebrew 
university who produced a documentary on israeligerman youth 
exchanges 
in israel the subject has been given ritual treatment in 
public celebrations but it isnt discussed openly in the families 
and not given enough attention in the schools 
the unease was apparent when the west german cadet ship gorch 
fock pulled into haifa harbor in early may with 21yearold peter 
fromm and six other cadets shopping around warily for souvenirs and 
moshe biermann feeling the stab in his heart 
nir said german and israeli teenagers he filmed for the 
documentary became friends on a superficial level but there was 
an undercurrent of subjects they didnt want to touch 
when the discussion did turn to the holocaust hidden barriers 
often became visible 
in nirs film a german teenager identified as eva summed up 
the attitude of many of her peers the israelis thought we should 
feel guilty because of what our fathers and grandfathers did but i 
dont feel guilty i didnt do it 
an israeli youth responded i dont feel that eva should feel 
guilty personally but i do expect her to remember to feel bad 
about it and to have the courage to ask about it 
writer lea fleischmann who taught high school in germany until 
emigrating to israel in 1979 said german teenagers face a 
difficult task because most of the older generation remained silent 
about the nazis 
if the germans after the war had punished the guilty they 
would have washed themselves clean of this part of the history 
said ms fleischmann 40 the daughter of holocaust survivors 
they should have done it for the younger generation 
things are better on a governmenttogovernment level a close 
network of economic cultural and scientific ties binds them 
trade last year reached 2 billion israel exported 640 
million worth of goods mainly fruit flowers and clothes germany 
exported 14 billion including industrial machines cars 
electronics and chemical products 
israeli and german scientists cooperate on more than 80 
projects including cancer research physics and solar energy 
israel sends more youth groups to west germany than to any 
other country and for germany israel is second only to france in 
that regard 
as the grandchildren of holocaust survivors reach adulthood 
there are signs that many israelis no longer reject all things 
german as a matter of principle 
thousands of israelis drive germanmade cars and most dont 
bother to remove the handsized d deutschland sticker 
identifying the country of origin as west germany germanmade 
washing machines and kitchen appliances are common in israeli 
households 
more and more israelis are studying the german language 
a travel agency in downtown jerusalem advertises flights to 
frankfurt on lufthansa the west german airline in the 1950s 
israelis couldnt have made the trip because their passports were 
stamped valid for all countries except germany 
the arab uprising in the israelioccupied territories has 
brought the two nations evewn closer partly because the west 
germans have not criticized israels reaction to it 
when philip jenninger the president of west germanys 
parliament visited jerusalem recently he told israeli leaders he 
had come to show that germany was a loyal friend especially at a 
time when the israel is the target of international criticism

as college students sort out their academic and 
career choices for next fall law school looks hot so does 
business but engineering a craze five years ago keeps sliding 
teaching down and out since the 1970s shapes up as next falls 
comeback story 
medicine and nursing continue to fall from favor but there are 
hints that the sharp decadelong enrollment slide may be slowing 
college admissions counselors add it all up this way most 
students still put great weight on financial prospects in making 
career and study choices 
but social service seems to be slowly resurfacing as a goal 
among at least some of next falls students 
i see a little bit of a rise in idealism again said beth 
oneil a spokeswoman for the law school admissions council 
here in brief is what officials say is the fall outlook for 
half a dozen major fields of study 
law the nations 175 accredited law schools are being flooded 
with more than 300000 fall applications from 75000 students 19 
percent more than last year and the most since 1980 according to 
the law school admissions council applications dropped in the 
mid1980s but began recovering last fall and are now surging 
at georgetown law school applications rose 32 percent while 
berkeley saw a 30 percent increase the university of michigan 
stopped accepting applications for its 370 openings at 5500 
starting salaries in excess of 65000 and 75000 have not 
gone unnoticed said oneil 
whats unclear to admissions officials is whether the increase 
is just a blip caused by factors like the televised legal fireworks 
of the irancontra hearings and the supreme court confirmations or 
the popularity of the tv drama la law 
teaching the national attention showered on teaching improved 
starting salaries and hints of renewed idealism are pushing next 
falls enrollments up a few top graduate schools like harvard 
report 50 percent gains in applications for next fall 
more typical however is the university of south carolina 
where the number of teacher candidates next fall is expected to 
exceed slightly the 215 of last year but come nowhere near the 
peak of 650 in the mid1970s according to leonard f maiden 
director of student services of the college of education the 
news is getting out that teaching does pay reasonably well 
maiden said the national average is now 28000 
in addition he said i get more and more women who say i 
want to be a teacher because i see that bringing much joy in my 
life i hear that weekly and sometimes daily 
nursing undergraduate rolls at nursing schools dropped 21 
percent from 198387 according to the american association of 
colleges of nursing which represents 400 schools of nursing 
the 198788 school year counted 85477 undergraduate students 
down 145 percent from 99923 the previous year only 4 percent in 
an annual national survey of freshman attitudes expressed interest 
in nursing compared with 102 percent in 1974 
starting salaries are up exceeding 30000 in some cities but 
nursing is still having trouble competing with other career 
opportunities for women 
i dont think the shortage is going to be resolved quickly 
said diane mcgivern chairwoman of new york universitys graduate 
nursing school where next falls freshman class will number just 
30 down from about 80 in 1980 
i think the demographics are still against us but i think 
nursing will start attracting students again because service as a 
value is coming back a little bit she said 
business despite wall street insider scandals and last 
octobers market crash business has lost little of its luster one 
quarter of entering college freshmen express interest in business 
careers continuing a steady increase since the early 1970s 
onequarter of all bachelors and masters degrees awarded last 
year were in business far ahead of any other field according to 
the american association of collegiate schools of business 
but some schools report applications for next fall are not up as 
spectacularly as in previous years 
nancy anderson director of admissions at nyus graduate school 
of business said fall applications were up 5 percent to 2500 for 
her schools 360 spots a year ago application gains of 20 percent 
were commonplace at nyu and other leading schools 
our sense is that we will see a slow increase every year an 
mba masters degree in business administration is quickly 
becoming the equivalent of an undergraduate degree as a requirement 
for entry level jobs anderson said 
she and others report that wall streets woes have led business 
majors to consider such alternatives as marketing management and 
real estate 
medicine the nations 127 medical schools will receive a 
projected 26700 applications for about 15000 freshman spots a 
47 percent decrease from the previous year no one sees the 
14year downtrend reversing yet but this falls expected decline 
is about half that of the previous year said joan hartman moore 
spokeswoman for the association of american medical colleges 
cost is probably the biggest factor a year at a public medical 
school averages about 13000 for residents at private colleges 
the cost typically runs 24000 according to the association 
eightytwo percent of medical students graduate in debt 
averaging 35621 and 20 percent have debts exceeding 50000 
that plus rising malpractice insurance costs and starting salaries 
averaging about 25000 has made students think twice about 
medical careers 
even top schools have seen a falloff in applications since the 
peak year of 1979 but some report interest is picking up slightly 
for next fall 
thomas lentz assistant dean of admissions at yale university 
medical school said his school has received 2154 applications for 
about 100 freshman spots ahead of the 1935 last year but 
considerably less than the 3261 in 1979 
engineering the number of undergraduates doubled from 201000 
in 1974 to a peak of 406000 in 1983 but the number has since 
tailed off to about 369000 and the number of freshmen engineering 
students has likewise fallen from 115303 in 1982 to the current 
99238 according to the engineering manpower commission in 
washington 
at texas aampm which has one of the largest engineering schools 
admissions director bill lay said the school has admitted 2732 
students for next fall compared with 3566 in 1982 
the decline is not necessarily unhealthy said commission 
spokesman richard ellis its not a craze or fad anymore he 
said interest is now reverting to people wanting an engineering 
career for its own sake not just because of the economics of a 
given era 
engineerings surge five years ago was fueled by the reagan 
defense buildup and job booms in aerospace and electronics the job 
market remains fairly strong according to ellis especially for 
civil engineers and firstyear engineers often command salaries of 
30000 or more

louis gossett jr and levar burton 
reunited for the first time since the blockbuster 1977 miniseries 
roots predict the christmas sequel will become a classic in 
itself a kind of american answer to charles dickens a christmas 
carol 
i think its very wonderful to be able to anticipate sitting 
down with my loved ones and watching not only the dickens classic 
but roots christmas as well and hopefully year after year it 
has the potential be a classic said burton 31 whose career was 
launched by the miniseries 12 years ago 
this is as close to dickens as we can get in an american 
story gossett said on a break in filming on the grounds of the 
hermitage the plantation home of president andrew jackson this 
is ours and we should cherish it its our american classic 
roots still ranks as the highestrated miniseries ever and 
part 8 was the third highestrated television show in history 
according to ac nielsen 
the twohour sequel scheduled to air dec 11 on abc also stars 
avery brooks shaun cassidy michael learned and kate mulgrew 
the story was written by david eyre based on an outline by alex 
haley who grew up in the small western tennessee town of henning 
and wrote the pulitzer prizewinning book roots after tracing 
his ancestry 200 years 
in the sequel kunta kinte burton and fiddler gossett 
clandestinely plan to lead a group of slaves to freedom on 
christmas eve in 1770 
gossett who in 1982 won an academy award for his supporting 
role in an officer and a gentleman said he expected a new 
generation to discover roots through the sequel 
its a new kind of audience the young people that maybe 
couldnt have grasped what the show was about the first time 
gossett said its very special very spiritual 
its even better because of i guess the mutual growth of all 
of us and the growth of america especially he said 
twelve years ago do you think jesse jackson would have the 
chance to win anybodys primary much less running or thinking 
about it the consciousness of america has evolved 
producer mark wolper the son of executive producer david l 
wolper said the sequel evolved from his fathers idea that there 
were too few black christmas shows 
in thinking about what black kind of christmas show he could 
tell he called alex haley the younger wolper said 
and alex haley said oddly enough ive just been thinking 
about examining my relatives roots at christmas and the two of 
them said what a great idea lets write a roots christmas 
the films budget is about 4 million expensive for a twohour 
television movie said bernie sofronski coexecutive producer in 
comparison the last 12 hours of roots cost 6 million he said 
when something has the history of roots theres a lot at 
stake for the producers and actors involved to do this again 
said sofronski 
were also hoping if we do our job right that this will be a 
perennial christmas show 
burton said the quality of the script convinced him he should 
participate in the sequel before this he said he avoided roles 
similar to kunta kinte 
for the first five years of my career i did whatever i felt 
was necessary in order to create distance between kunta and 
levar he said five years ago the thought of playing the 
character again and perhaps forever and inextricably linking levar 
and kunta was a lot more scary 
i dont feel the fear so much of never being able to step out 
of the shadow of kunta 
burton has shed the image in a successful new role as a member 
of the crew in the syndicated television series star trek the 
next generation 
gossett said he was especially enthusiastic about working with 
burton again im astounded at levars growth as a person and as 
an actor he said he doesnt know it i guess but ive been 
learning a lot from his growth we were pretty close before but 
were much much much closer now 
roots was my first job said burton it is not often you 
get an opportunity to play a character as powerful as this twice in 
your career

nearly 20 years after the cuyahoga river last 
caught fire officials say lake erie and its tributaries are 
cleaner than they have been in decades 
scores of lake erie beaches will be open in ohio this year and 
more than 25 million walleye thrive in eries waters boating has 
become so popular that many marinas in the toledo area are running 
out of dock space 
a few decades ago lake erie had only three clean beaches and 
fish were dying at a rapid rate an oil slick on the cuyahoga 
caught fire june 22 1969 
the dramatic improvement has been caused primarily by a decrease 
in phosphates and other nutrients that caused algae to flourish in 
lake erie using up oxygen and killing fish said laura fay a 
research associate for the center for lake erie area research 
phosphate pollution levels were decreased largely through 
improvement of sewage treatment plants she said 
half the people living in the great lakes basin live near lake 
erie including residents of cleveland toledo detroit and erie 
pa eleven million people use lake erie for their drinking water 
ms fay said 
although fish now appear to be thriving in the shallowest of the 
great lakes ms fay said the bottom of lake erie and its 
tributaries has sediments contaminated with such materials as 
mercury and cancercausing pcbs 
funding for research and cleanup on the great lakes has been 
decreasing she said even though contaminated sediments are a more 
chronic problem than phosphates 
i hate to see people sit back and rest on their laurels ms 
fay said weve really come a long way but the toxic problem is 
something we really cant see some of the effects are really going 
to be subtle we might have lower reproductive efficiency of 
walleye or darter but were not going to see that for a while 
the cuyahoga river which has ignited three times since 1936 
remains an area of concern along with several other lake erie 
shipping channels because of the pollutants that have settled on 
the bottom 
the international joint commission on great lakes water quality 
in a 1987 report said sediments in the cuyahoga are tainted with 
pcbs ammonia cyanide and lead 
because of the contaminants the ohio department of health 
advises people not to eat catfish caught in the channel and carp 
caught in the open waters of lake erie said deborah gray a 
toxicologist in the division of epidemiology 
catfish and carp feed on the bottom of lake erie she said and 
tests have shown that nearly half have pcb concentrations that 
exceed levels recommended by the us food and drug administration 
the health department also has issued an advisory for all fish 
caught in the black river in lorain and the ashtabula river in 
ashtabula which empty into lake erie there is no advisory for the 
cuyahoga 
an advisory is just that an advisory she said were 
talking about a very small incremental risk to someone who would 
eat this fish but what were saying is that there are still fish 
exceeding the fda limit and we think people should know about 
this 
but shallow lake erie is cleaner than many of the great lakes 
largely because it is is able to flush itself every 26 years 
officials said the flush time for some of the upper lakes which 
are 1000 feet deep is more than a century ms fay said lake erie 
also has more organic substances that bind up toxic materials 
bob wysenski environmental scientist for the ohio environmental 
protection agency said ohios beaches generally are safer for 
swimming now than at any time in the past decade 
he cited water quality statistics at 20 lake erie beaches that 
show a general downward trend in fecal coliform a bacteria that 
can cause flulike symptoms or ear and eye infections 
there have been no documented cases of severe illnesses caused 
by swimming in lake erie in the past decade he said

theres more than one way to improve the bottom 
line in your business or in your household account or in the trade 
balance of your country 
in each instance you can cut your buying and spending raise 
your income or do both simultaneously 
in the latest trade report for march the figures showed the 
united states raising its gross exports sharply a decidedly 
bullish sign for the economy but imports rose too and that gave 
a bearish cast to the news 
among other things the news also created confusion in the minds 
of those who couldnt understand why an improvement in the trade 
figures could lead to lower stock and bond prices and fears of 
inflation and recession 
wasnt this glittering news yes but it was accompanied by bad 
news 
the goods news was this 
the united states is able to export us goods are competitive 
abroad in both price and quality the us manufacturing sector 
whose weakness once was exemplified by the term rust belt has 
regained strength 
the result more us jobs a strengthening manufacturing 
sector a boost to an economy that for too long has been dependent 
on consumption and that may not be able to depend on consumers much 
longer 
the turn was dramatic it was strong enough to suggest that 
henceforth the trade deficit would decrease gradually thus 
returning to the united states some of the dollars left overseas 
for goods imported during the past 20 years 
fewer dollars overseas means less borrowing by the united 
states it also reduces us dependence on foreign investments in 
real estate stocks and bonds less foreign dependence means less 
risk of volatility in us markets 
the bad news was this domestic consumption remains strong as 
indicated by a simultaneous growth of imports true exports surged 
to an alltime high of 2897 billion but imports rose too 
although at a lesser rate to 387 billion 
it means the united states is still trying to have its cake eat 
it and smile at the same time which is as difficult a stunt 
economically as it is culinarily 
reacting almost immediately to reports of a shrinkage in the 
trade deficit wall street was at first elated it meant strength 
securities prices improved 
then it looked at the rise of imports and saw trouble in the 
form of an overheated economy it questioned whether the united 
states could expand its foreign markets and domestic markets 
together without overheating 
overheating is an apt and vivid term in economics and one of 
the clearest in a very foggy environment when an economy strains 
to produce more than it is equipped to produce it gives off smoke 
in the form of inflation 
there is a way out and that is to hire more people and expand 
capacity 
one way to expand capacity is to reopen idle factory space but 
in all probability that space has remained idle because it was the 
least efficient hiring more people might help but they are likely 
to be the least skilled 
with american production facilities being utilized at 827 
percent of capacity in april highest in eight years many 
economists fear that strains are appearing if capacity hasnt been 
reached they claim it soon will 
at the same time the latest civilian unemployment rate fell to 
54 percent considered low by most modern standards and 
representing a continuing decline from monthly rates above 7 
percent as recently as 1986 
balancing the good news against the bad many economists and 
investors felt the latter outweighed the former they reasoned the 
economy was overheating and that a coolant was needed that coolant 
would be higher interest rates 
there are notable and vociferous exceptions to the consensus 
some economists insist the news is good on balance but that no 
amount of good news will convince a nation predisposed and for so 
long a time to seek the bad 
and as you might expect there are investors today who believe 
that when news is viewed so negatively it is time for them to pick 
up bargains

jack kent is making money and enemies at 
both ends of the 275footlong contraption he runs near this town 
of oil men and shrimp boats 
his hazardous waste kiln at marine shale processors big as a 
football field with a smokestack 140 feet high is a highprofile 
presence on the flat southern louisiana horizon 
its also a target of two groups that want to shut it down some 
local residents who suspect its dangerous and business competitors 
who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations 
marine shale which employs about 240 people denies the claims 
and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators 
in washington as well as louisiana the debate centers on 
whether kents contraption is an incinerator which must meet one 
set of regulations or a recycling plant required to meet others 
kent charges 200 to 300 per 50gallon drum to take in 
hazardous wastes from the companies that make them ranging from 
glues to various petroleum byproducts but excluding pcbs 
dioxins asbestos explosives mercury compounds or 
diseasecarrying materials he receives 720 tons a day 
he heats the waste to about 2500 degrees fahrenheit for 2 
hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an 
elongated cement mixer he sells the resulting aggregate as 
material for road beds and parking lots he has about 10 customers 
so far 
if marine shales claims about its process and product are found 
valid by state and federal officials examining the companys 
operations it could render competitors incinerators obsolete 
while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste 
disposal problem is handled 
it could also be very lucrative for marine shale company 
attorney and vice president george eldredge says a patent is being 
sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will 
follow 
eldredge likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste 
for storage in landfills while marine shale eliminates it in the 
creation of a product 
at marine shale next to bayou boeuf conveyors lift piles of 
various materials some sludgy some solid and some that serve as 
their own fuel into a huge rotating cylinder 
cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln which looks 
like hollywoods vision of hell red hot with glowing embers and 
tumbling debris a computer keeps tabs on temperature gases and 
pressure shutting down the operation if anything goes awry 
according to eldredge 
earlier this year marine shale gave members of congress clear 
plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate 
in the handle the public relations gimmick prompted richard 
fortuna lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors to 
write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the capitols 
safety engineer to arrange for the transportation of this 
material to a permitted facility for proper disposal 
sure we did it acknowledged fortuna director of the 
hazardous waste treatment council he contends the marine shale 
product is dangerous 
kent says envy motivates the treatment council hes charging 
less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste 
and then turns it into a product that sells for 1 a ton 
it makes them sad he says sardonically 
the treatment council has joined south louisianians against 
pollution or slap to fight marine shale 
sally herman head of slap says she opposes marine shale 
because she believes admittedly without evidence that the company 
may be a factor in the areas unsually high cancer rate 
personally i think theyre contributing to it she said 
slap and fortunas group have threatened a federal suit to try 
to halt marine shales operations 
the battle has spread to congress 
sen john breaux dla attacked the company in april in a 
subcommittee hearing suggesting that laws might be needed to close 
loopholes that allow marine shale to operate without an incinerator 
permit 
kent suggested that breaux was acting on behalf of his friend 
bill broadhurst whose law firm has represented rollins 
environmental services inc a treatment council member broadhurst 
is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential 
candidate gary hart on the ship monkey business with donna rice 
breaux spokesman bob mann labeled kents suggestion ridiculous 
the 140foot emissions stack at marine shale puts out a steady 
plume of vapor which the company says is clean water used to 
scrub the gases of particles that might pollute the air is 
reused in the process he said emissions pass through a bag 
house where according to eldredge they are filtered through 
more than a thousand bags resembling vacuum cleaner bags before 
release into the air 
eldredge stressed that none of the water from the marine shale 
process is discharged into the bayou he cited state department of 
environmental quality records showing that traditional 
incinerators such as the one run by rollins in baton rouge 
contaminate scrub water that must be treated before it is 
discharged into the mississippi river a source of drinking water 
for new orleans and other communities 
about 1750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42 
states ship them to marine shale according to spokesman larry 
august the materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely 
put in marine shales kiln he said

they shift wastes they dont treat them fortuna asserted 
when fortuna complains that the marine shale aggregate doesnt 
meet specifications to be declared nonhazardous eldredge counters 
that those specifications are meant to apply to hazardous wastes 
not to a product that meets industry standards for use as road 
material 
the epa has taken samples of the product regularly and so far 
has found no reason to stop its distribution said a lawyer for the 
agency james neet 
were not saying the aggregate is pure he said what 
were saying is that the aggregate does not pose an imminent or 
substantial endangerment to the public health or environment 
fortunas group complains that marine shale by calling itself a 
recycler instead of an incinerator is avoiding the stringent 
regulations of the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
if marine shale did go through the permit process under that 
act eldredge said it could take three years during which the 
company would have to shut down eliminating a payroll approaching 
10 million that would probably shut the company down for good he 
said 
what youve got here is really an economic battle observed 
neet who said the epa has been investigating marine shale for two 
years partly to determine whether it should indeed be regulated as 
an incinerator 
neet said two federal grand juries are also looking into marine 
shales operations but he declined to give details 
one thing to remember is that their entire facility is 
governed by the clean water act the clean air act he said 
adding that the treatment council has been falsely implying that 
marine shale isnt regulated 
indeed chris roberie of the department of environmental quality 
said marine shales air quality permit is stricter than the one 
issued for rollins baton rouge plant because it was issued four 
years ago when the facility had to meet tougher rules than when 
rollins permit was issued about 18 years ago 
state and federal regulators have cited marine shale for several 
alleged opacity violations meaning smoke or vapor emanating 
from the plant was darker than it should have been 
the state last month ordered marine shale to install equipment 
for constant monitoring of its stack and the company has announced 
it signed a 750000 contract for such a system 
water quality on bayou boeuf is another concern 
mike schurtz of the state environmental agency said its true 
that marine shale reuses rather than discharges waste water 
but he said the agency has ordered the company to clean up oily 
material it believes was leaked into the bayou from a storage barge 
and an oyster bucket used to transfer material 
the agencys order also calls for marine shale to apply for a 
stricter water quality permit schurtz said marine shale must make 
sure rainwater that runs off the site doesnt carry dangerous 
materials eldredge said the company will meet all requirements 
ms herman is unconvinced she dismisses criticism that her 
group is being manipulated by treatment council companies that have 
been accused of polluting the environment 
im not taking up for rollins she said but what does it 
matter what somebody else is doing if youre wrong it doesnt 
matter what anybody else is doing 
my main concern is my family and the people in this 
community

they came to appalachia in the late 
1960s and early 1970s as eager young college students determined 
to wipe out something most of them had never experienced firsthand 
rural poverty 
as they prepare for a reunion on memorial day weekend former 
members of volunteers in service to america appalachian volunteers 
and other federal volunteer programs say their work showed the 
power of community action but often put them at odds with local 
officials 
if they made some difference in the lives of poor people in west 
virginia kentucky tennessee and virginia the volunteers also 
agree their own lives were changed 
thenvolunteer nowus sen jay rockefeller called his vista 
work in the tiny community of emmons a turning point in his life 
after two years i got hooked said rockefeller who later 
gave up his plans for a foreign service career to serve in west 
virginias legislature and as secretary of state and governor 
before winning election to the senate in 1984 
linda cooper elkinton who served in kentucky said the 
experience of recruiting 500 eager agents of social change 
started her on a life of community organizing 
i was not a politically aware person at 18 said elkinton 
who now works for a social service agency in huntington but i 
certainly was three years later after volunteering 
the volunteers first hurdle was gaining acceptance 
the poor people up the hollows accepted them pretty well 
particularly once they got to know them a little bit said jeff 
monroe who headed west virginias office of economic opportunity 
from 1964 through 1968 
but monroe said the next step acceptance by local officials 
often failed 
as long as antipoverty workers helped repaint schools organize 
recreation programs and teach nutrition classes there was little 
trouble with local power brokers but the volunteers activism 
didnt stop there 
to young idealistic college students who had taken seriously 
president johnsons challenge to replace despair with 
opportunity it soon became apparent that local politicians were 
often part of the problem 
when you start fixing up a oneroom school you start 
wondering why didnt the local school board fix this up a long 
time ago then you ask why arent there books one step at a 
time you start seeing a pattern said gibbs kinderman a former 
volunteer who recently completed a series of radio shows about 
appalachian volunteers for the west virginia humanities foundation 
volunteers realized appalachian residents had little power to 
influence their own affairs because of unresponsive and often 
corrupt bureaucrats who controlled county jobs and welfare benefits 
organizing power groups is a scary thing for any structure 
thats taking advantage of people monroe said they local 
officials were very threatened 
many impoverished appalachian residents knew well what they were 
up against and were mad about it strip mining the roads the 
schools lack of jobs the courthouse gang said ronnie sue 
jaffe now a hospital worker in new york city and an organizer of 
the may 29 reunion in twin falls state park 
kinderman described county governments in the coalmining 
regions of appalachia as set up to do things the way the coal 
companies wanted it 
huey perry whose novel theyll cut off your project 
describes antipoverty anticorruption efforts in mingo county 
said the whole system was as corrupt as it could be 
elections he said were more like sporting contests and 
after the election the losing party would just say they were 
able to buy more votes than we were 
perry said it would be hard to beat the voter turnout in mingo 
county where the 1960 federal census showed 19879 votingage 
residents but county records listed 30331 registered voters 
a fair elections committee supported by antipoverty volunteers 
but run by local residents purged the voter registration books of 
5000 people who were dead or who had moved away 
still the volunteers differ over whether their reform efforts 
had much longterm success 
in mingo county recently more than 50 present and former public 
officials among them the head of the antipoverty program were 
indicted on charges of conspiracy to subvert the free election 
system 
but said monroe that theyve been indicted at all shows a 
change there was a time when people did a lot and never got 
indicted for it 
there was a time when getting a teaching job getting on 
welfare and staying on it even getting a job on the state highways 
department were all controlled he said id venture to say 
that doesnt exist at least its much improved of course there 
are those who think im naive to say that 
you could say we didnt make any significant changes he 
added but i think we did 
the percentage of appalachian households below the federally 
defined poverty level has dropped from 312 percent in 1960 to 14 
percent in 1980 according to the appalachian regional commission 
in washington dc 
the high school dropout rate among the regions 18 to 
24yearolds has declined in the same period from 315 percent to 
253 percent the commission said 
but the average annual jobless rate in the region increased from 
54 percent in 1970 to 74 percent last year according to the us 
bureau of labor statistics 
there are still terrible pockets of unemployment in west 
virginia tennessee and kentucky said commission statistician 
judith maher 
would a new war on poverty work today 
vista has shrunk from a peak of 4580 fulltime volunteers in 
1975 to 2740 today 
antipoverty programs declined mainly because of resistance from 
local politicians and the governments growing preoccupation with 
the vietnam war perry and other observers said 
but milton ogle who recruited volunteers in kentucky and now 
works at the appalachian research and defense fund in charleston 
said more young people would volunteer today if national leaders 
again stressed social issues 
im not being political he said the fact is there has 
been a major reduction in these programs 
how is the 60s and 70s volunteer effort recalled by those 
meant to be its beneficiaries 
at least it provided some hope said herb meade of kermit 
people slowly but surely realized that some changes could be 
brought about and it did away with the fear the intimidation 
that we had among the people you dont find that much anymore 
mae shrewsbury of shady spring agreed the vista workers helped 
they gave us more courage than anything else she said

police and social service workers guess the young runaway 
population in hollywood numbers 10005000 
if you stay out there long enough youre going to be a victim 
or a suspect said police lt ed hocking who is in charge of 
hollywood division detectives 
kids congregate at the famous intersection of hollywood and 
vine where the brass stars on the walk of fame give tourists a 
glimpse of glamour down on sunset boulevard the boys and girls 
can be found hustling tricks despite efforts by police 
they tell officers they are 18 years old but are often 15 or 
younger say hocking and yates they say they can go home anytime 
but theyre often unwanted there 
the real story yates said is that they usually come from 
a history of terrible abuse physical and sexual abuse 
their new life is little improvement hollow eyes scabs and 
roughened skin are signs of drug and alcohol abuse and chronic 
malnutrition 
sleeping in abandoned buildings called squats the children 
often fall victim to pimps drug dealers and exconvicts who like 
fagin in oliver twist need young prey 
a lot of pedophiles live in hollywood said lois lee who 
founded children of the night in 1979 its like they all moved 
here when they heard this is where the kids are 
ms lees agency is a nonprofit volunteer group that helps 
young people escape the streets her volunteers help about 100 
children a month almost all of whom have fallen into prostitution 
ms lee believes otherwise inexplicable deaths are tied to the 
pimps she described a diabetic girl who died in a hotel room 
she was locked in her room without her medicine 
many of the street children are middleclass youngsters running 
from homes in the los angeles suburbs but yates keeps records on 
cases from 47 states 
there has always been a draw to hollywood he said this 
isnt like haightashbury in the 60s though those young people 
were collegeage they were rebelling against their parents these 
kids in hollywood are much younger theyve been rejected by their 
parents 
with no place to belong the new arrivals in hollywood turn to 
older people who will feed them first then degrade them ms lee 
said 
their parents say they cant come home in a sad way with 
prostitution theyve got job security 
for those not yet tied to a pimp life is handtomouth so they 
seek security with the pack hocking said they steal to survive 
some of them girls as well as boys shave their heads so the 
pimps wont want them hocking said everyone rips them off so 
they hang together 
in the squats which are often covered with satanic grafitti 
they listen to heavy metal tapes on pilfered cassette players 
its sex and drugs and rock n roll hocking said but i 
havent met one who wants to stay on the street 
at the storefront office of children of the night an 
18yearold girl calling herself mimi stopped in and said she 
didnt know where she was going to stay 
the squat she had stayed in the night before was set afire by 
someone looking for a girl named star she said he says 
hell keep burning places down until he finds star 
mimi said shed like to be a model and that she left home 
because her father tried to rape her she said she met a sweet 
boy who gave her a gold ring the boy is about twice her age 
another girl at children of the night said that during her years 
on the street she lived with older drugdealer boyfriends until 
she joined an outcall prostitution ring the adults in the ring 
moved her into an apartment 
they gave me my food they washed my clothes and gave me an 
id said the girl who called herself cheryl i hung out for a 
couple of months until i got sick of it 
cheryl says she is off the streets and going to school 
yates hocking and ms lee say young people can be rescued each 
cited success stories of kids who returned to school or got jobs 
but many will never return home because the home was unsuitable 
we need programs that get them out of the law enforcement 
system and into the social service system hocking said calling 
for shelters that offer refuge hygiene and counseling 
in 1983 ms lee and police discovered dozens of street kids in 
the biggest squat of them all a crumbling apartment they called 
hotel hell next door to the famed chinese theater the 
building was once home to comedian stan laurel and other 
celebrities 
we found evidence of everything there there was disease 
malnutrition drug abuse some kids were shooting whiskey in their 
veins for a cheap high said yates who gathered medical 
histories on the youngsters evacuated from the fire trap on 
hollywood boulevard 
sacramento lawmakers toured hotel hell and legislation 
followed to fund a program called project homeless youth 
supervised by childrens hospital the 20 shelter beds are 
constantly filled and many young people must be turned away 
the ones who opt for counseling and intervention at the shelter 
often get away from the exploitation of the streets yates said 
they need an adult they can trust and a situation where there 
is no manipulation said ms lee who hopes to raise enough money 
to start a shelter run by children of the night 
we have to try to get them to somewhere where somebody gives a 
damn about them hocking said

everywhere he goes vice president george bush 
talks about wanting to be the education president singling it 
out as one area he would emphasize more than president reagan 
but the republican nomineeinwaiting has offered few specifics 
on how he would carry out that mission apart from proposing a new 
tax break for college savings accounts and promising to support the 
head start program for disadvantaged children 
at a recent campaign stop in indiana pressed to explain how a 
bush administration would handle education differently the vice 
president said he would bring outstanding school teachers to 
washington for recognition ceremonies he also called for 
restoration of the four rs reading riting rithemetic and 
respect 
but those are precisely the kinds of bully pulpit efforts that 
reagan and his secretary of education william j bennett have 
specialized in school recognition programs are already a regular 
rose garden feature blossoming in the reagan years even while the 
president sought to slash the education budget 
former tennessee gov lamar alexander whom bush identifies as 
one his education advisers said in an interview i think hes 
not yet spelled out his views in a number of areas and im looking 
forward to his doing that 
the former governor who launched a 10point program in 
tennessee that included a controversial groundbreaking 
careerladder plan for teachers said he expects bush will put 
education right up there with peace and prosperity as a concern of 
his administration if he carries through with that for eight 
years he will have a massive effect on how americans value and 
view education 
alexander said the next president should look for ways to help 
communities make schools better including helping to pay the 
bill 
bush told republican activists at a fundraiser in fort wayne 
ind last month i dont want to have the federal government 
come in and tell the superintendents in these schools heres your 
curriculum here are the a bs and cs and you got to follow it 
but i do want to see the federal government used to put more 
emphasis on excellence 
pressed to spell out what he meant bush said i want to build 
on education add to the concept of an education president because 
as i look at our ability and some would say inability to compete 
the answer is education its not going to be a radical 
philosophical change its going to be a question of emphasis 
it wont be turning my back on a record that i have identified 
with he added 
bush recently visited garfield high school in the barrio of east 
los angeles where scores of hispanic students have won honors in 
calculus under the tutelage of prizewinning teacher jaime 
escalante a new movie stand and deliver celebrates 
escalantes success story 
when one of escalantes pupils asked the vice president if money 
would be available to help them attend college bush replied i 
think the federal government has a responsibility there will be a 
change of priorities to some degree under his administration 
but bush added the problem is there is always going to be a 
limitation in what the federal government can do in this country 
if you can afford to pay for a kids education you should do it 
in vandalia ohio when a butler high school student asked how 
bush would help public schools in financial trouble he replied 
the federal government should not create increased funding for 
the public schools thats not the function of the federal 
government the way i see it he said 
bush a product of prep schools and yale supports tuition tax 
credits for privateschool parents but has not made clear whether 
he would seek as reagan did vouchers that poor parents could 
spend on public or private education 
he told the students in vandalia i like the idea of trying to 
get as much competition going between the schools as possible 
i wouldnt want to do anything to weaken the public school system 
although i think we should have the challenge and diversity that 
weve got in the way of private schools and parochial schools 
elsewhere bush has said the federal government pays 7 percent 
of schools bills and thats about right 
the national education association which tracks school finance 
contends the federal share of public elementary and secondary 
expenditures has dropped during the reagan administration from 92 
percent to 62 percent 
bush has said i love the concept of head start the 12 
billion preschool program for disadvantaged children 
although head start was included in the 1982 reagan safety 
net it serves only 445000 children or 16 percent of those 
eligible according to the childrens defense fund 
the governments biggest school aid program the 45 billion 
chapter 1 remedial program for the disadvantaged reaches nearly 5 
million children but still only half those who need it 
reagan twice sought to cut the department of education budget by 
5 billion the only increases he proposed were in election years 
1984 and 1988 in his first term reagan sought deep cuts in 
chapter 1 as well as aid for teaching the handicapped bilingual 
education and help for college students congress nevertheless 
has boosted the education budget to more than 21 billion from less 
than 15 billion 
bush also speaks frequently about his desire to strengthen 
student aid for those that need it including loans for college 
pell grants and the college workstudy program 
but he will have to reconcile those intentions with another 
promise his plan to seek a modified fouryear freeze on the 
federal budget with the exception of social security that would 
allow spending to rise no more than 4 percent a year 
education accounts for only a tiny portion of the 
trilliondollar federal budget but most school programs fall into 
the category of discretionary spending where the pressure from a 
freeze would be greatest 
bush says with disdain that the liberals dukakis and 
jackson their answer is hey if you really believe in education 
double the spending im going to be saying great how are 
you going to pay for it and why is it better to have it dictated 
from washington 
bushs wife barbara has been a longtime activist in the fight 
against adult illiteracy and he frequently tells audiences that 13 
percent of americas 17yearolds are functionally illiterate bush 
often extols publicprivate sector partnerships as a tool in the 
fight against illiteracy 
bush says he is also getting education advice from david 
packard the hewlettpackard co founder who headed a federal panel 
that called two years ago for more federal support for university 
researh 
after a recent tour of coal research facilities at west virginia 
university in morgantown bush said the people working in 
research institutions around this nation pushing back the 
frontiers of human understanding will have more of an impact on the 
21st century than all of us down in washington dc

like millions of abandoned children in 
brazil leonardo arcanjo lived on the streets stealing and 
begging he faced an adulthood of misery and crime 
but late last year the sao paulo child welfare department 
persuaded him that he could be more than a beggar or a thief and 
today the 15yearold street kid is learning to be a carpenter with 
the guarantee of a job when he finishes 
leonardo is one of about 9000 children being helped in a new 
program praised by the united nations childrens fund unicef as 
unique creative and forward looking 
our basic aim is to provide alternative educational and job 
training programs that will give the abandoned child the 
selfrespect he never had and detour him from the path that usually 
leads to a life of crime said alda marco antonio head of the 
child welfare department 
to achieve her objective marco antonio created a multiapproach 
program that includes boarding houses where the children receive 
medical and dental care and are fed and clothed 
after a process of adaptation in which they overcome the 
fears hatred and skepticism caused by years of abandonment the 
children are placed in schools or sent to vocational training 
centers 
one of the most innovative parts of the program is its 
jobtraining project in which children learn a trade of their 
choosing at one of several companies owned and operated by the 
state of sao paulo 
leonardo for instance is learning carpentry at the sao paulo 
state banks supply maintenance and operations center other 
children learn how to become computer programmers printers 
electricians and auto mechanics 
at the end of the sixmonth program each child is guaranteed a 
fulltime job 
since may 1987 when the project was created 258 children have 
learned a trade and been hired 1177 others are now being trained 
marco antonio said one reason for the success of the program is 
that it involves no coercion or locking up 
it has been proven that forcing children to do what they dont 
want to do and locking them away in detention centers does not 
work she said in an interview they are worse off and more 
violent when they leave than when they go in 
she described the states juvenile detention centers as 
repressive places where children lose all their selfesteem 
jose roberto melo a spokesman for the state foundation that 
runs the centers said of the 2500 children currently detained 
only a small minority can be considered dangerous most are there 
because of vagrancy or because of some petty crime like 
pursesnatching 
marco antonio said eventually her program would expand so that 
one day the detention centers will be empty of all but the most 
dangerous individuals who have committed crimes like murder or 
rape 
to take part in her program a child must decide for himself 
that he wants to be helped and of course we help him reach this 
decision marco antonio said 
the first contact a child has with the program is through one of 
the 120 street educators psychologists sociologists social 
workers lawyers and other professionals who look for abandoned 
children and win their friendship and trust 
when that relationship is established a process that could take 
several months the street educator introduces the child to the 
program and guides him through its initial phases 
leonardo said for years i lived on the streets begging and 
stealing or shining shoes or selling candies in the subway 
a street educator once approached me and told me about the 
program but i didnt trust her i thought she wanted to lock me 
away somewhere 
then leonardo was arrested for vagrancy and police planned to 
send him to a juvenile detention center 
but the street educator intervened out and thats when i 
decided to give the program a try leonardo said it was the 
best decision i have ever made 
john donahue unicefs representative in brazil called the 
program one of the most coherant and complete efforts at dealing 
with abandoned children 
he said it was unique because it simultaneously reduces the 
number of street children and prevents others from taking to the 
streets to survive 
he said it should serve as a model for other brazilian cities 
and other countries 
the national child welfare foundation estimates the number of 
abandoned children in brazil at 7 million they are among 36 
million who lack education health care housing and parental 
guidance and affection 
marco antonio said one of the basic reasons for the large number 
of street children is societys abandonment of adults who are 
exploited by low wages and who therefore cannot properly care for 
their children 
most brazilian workers earn the equivalent of about 125 a month 
marco antonio also cited a poorly structured public school 
system that excludes the poor 
there may be enough classrooms and teachers but the poor 
cannot send their children to school simply because they cant pay 
for supplies and uniforms she said 
most street children start off begging for food little by 
little they start committing petty thefts and as they grow older 
they start stealing cars or pushing drugs so from innocent 
vcitims of societys injustices they end up the aggressors 
one 17yearold street kid identifying himself only as beto is 
one a group of 12 boys 11 to 18 years old who hang out in a large 
square in front of the roman catholic cathedral 
we prefer to earn our living by either asking people for money 
or selling things he said but when the money is short and 
hunger sets in then of course we are going to steal 
when they are not stealing begging or selling they sleep on 
benches or under store awnings or theater marquees they bathe and 
wash their clothes in public fountains 
no official figures have been compiled on the number of crimes 
committed by street children said jairo pires spokesman for the 
sao paulo state security department 
the rev john drexel a roman catholic priest who has worked 
with poor children in brazil for more than 25 years said children 
often are exploited by adults for whom a street kid is a useful 
instrument to commit crimes 
it is a grownup who buys the watches bracelets and necklaces 
stolen by a child he added it is a grownup who drives away 
the car first broken into by a kid and it is a grownup who uses 
children as messengers in drug transactions 
and most of this kind of exploitation is usually done by 
adults who were once street children themselves

when jimmy carter as president needed to get away for a while 
before he went to camp david with israeli prime minister menachem 
begin and egyptian president anwar sadat his thoughts turned to 
fly fishing 
when i was president rosalynn and i fly fished out west he 
says on the precamp david trip i took along with me the 
briefing books that i would be using to prepare myself for the 
mideast negotiations so it was a combination of delightful 
surroundings good companionsand also just clearing my mind when 
i was ready to embark on one of the major challenges of my 
presidency 
he now fly fishes throughout the world but loves to come home 
to north georgia to the little log cabin he furnished with his 
handmade wooden furniture 
the cabin is within 20 feet of turnip town creek which has a 
fairly good native population of rainbow trout its the perfect 
environment for writing in placid beautiful surroundings in 
almost total isolation when rosalynn and i are there which is 
never enough it makes for good thoughts and productive days 
the former president has written a new book an outdoor 
journal reflections and adventures recalling favorite fishing 
experiences writing it he said was a labor of love 
jack hemingway i bet i was the only american in world war ii 
who parachuted into occupied france with a fly rod i used it 
too 
the son of legendary fisherman and writer ernest hemingway now 
lives in ketchum idaho between angling excursions to distant 
parts of the globe but some of his most vivid memories are of his 
happy days on clear rivers with his father 
when i was 6 before id ever picked up a fly rod i spent one 
whole summer watching him fish the clarks fork river of the 
yellowstone hemingway says finally at the very end when id 
spent the whole summer building up the need to fish my father 
taught me how to cast 
author of misadventures of a fly fisherman jack hemingway 
says his love for the sport has lasted throughout his life not so 
for his late father 
dad had a big nice trunk outfitted with all his rods and 
reels and tackle everything he had collected over his years of fly 
fishing remembers hemingway right after that wonderful summer 
on the clarks fork in the fall of 1939 he had the trunk shipped 
by railway express and they lost it he never trout fished again 
i think it was as if he felt hed have to start all over again and 
it just wasnt worth the trouble 
paul volcker i took my wife fishing on our honeymoon and she 
hasnt been since says the former chairman of the federal 
reserve board 
volcker now teaches at princeton university and is chairman of a 
new york investment banking firm when he resigned from the fed 
last year he said he planned to go fishing 
i went maybe eight times last summer i ought to be doing 
more says volcker whos cast for trout in scotland england 
and yugoslavia youre out with nature and all that stuff its 
nice to be more or less alone testing your wits and skill but im 
a real amateur 
in the winter he ties his own flies at his manhattan home and 
plots a warm weather assault on distant rivers perhaps in new 
zealand or montana from now on im going to grab fishing 
whenever i can get it 
linda morgens on the first date with my future husband my 
train into new york was late so he occupied his time by going to 
abercrombie amp fitch and buying some artificial flies he was very 
surprised when he showed them to me and i started identifying them 
our mutual enthusiasm for fly fishing was certainly a plus 
mrs morgens is a veteran member of trout unlimiteds board of 
directors and chairs the nominating committee 
both my parents were fishermen my mother once held a blue 
marlin record and since i was an only child i spent a lot of time 
doing male sort of things with them i grew up before the womens 
lib thing so fishing taught me how to do things on my own taught 
me i could go off alone without needing any help in those days 
there werent that many things which could teach women to be 
independent but fly fishing was one of them 
mrs morgens and her husband ned live in south norwalk conn 
curt gowdy who for 20 years hosted the american sportsman on 
abc when wed go fishing my dad would say curtis remember 
the buffalo there were millions of them before the white man wiped 
them out for money that could happen to trout too so from the 
very beginning when i learned to fly fish at the age of 8 i was 
always a catchandrelease fisherman 
he fishes almost everywhere now and wherever he goes he 
preaches conservation 
gen john piotrowski commander in chief of the united states 
space command and the north american aerospace command puts in 
crowded workdays in his colorado springs headquarters but 
sometimes in the evenings i can slip away up into the mountains 
and fly fish 
i always like to match wits with a trout its great when you 
win but the alternative isnt desirable its very humbling to 
come home emptyhanded 
william horn assistant secretary of the interior is partial to 
fishing in montana alaska and wyoming but spends more time 
fishing on the east coast before i was working and got married 
and had kids i went fly fishing 40 or 50 times a year he says 
now im lucky if i go 15 times a year but i dream about it a 
lot 
i like companions who have the same appreciation for the 
sports traditions and ethics as i do and who provide just enough 
subtle competition on the stream to make it intriguing

fine craftsmanship the kind expected of a 
classic is part of the aura of the 1988 audi 90 its in the 
impeccable stitching of the leather along the door interiors and on 
the seats 
its in the understated cockpit design of this new downsized 
audi its in the stable firm ride and the smooth shifting of the 
fivespeed manual transmission 
you wouldnt guess that the audi 90 along with its companion 
vehicle the audi 80 are the first new cars that audi has 
introduced in the united states since 1983 they seem to be so 
wellhoned that one might think they have been around for years 
and sadly you wouldnt know by the sales figures either that 
they are impressive new competitors in the european luxury car 
market 
hindered by publicity of complaints that the larger audi 5000 
cars have suddenly accelerated out of control on some us drivers 
the audi 80 and 90 autos have not been selling as well here as had 
been hoped 
while the company had expected up to 28000 sales annually it 
now looks for maybe 8000 audi 90 sales and another 8000 audi 80 
sales in the united states in the current model year a company 
spokeswoman said 
there are no projections for the 1989 model year she added the 
federal government by the way continues to monitor sudden 
acceleration complaints on the audi 5000s audi has installed shift 
locks on the cars which require that the brake be depressed before 
the vehicle can be shifted out of park 
the audi 8090 series is a replacement for the audi 4000 line 
and is not directly part of that controversy but some consumers 
seem to be shunning audi nameplates altogether 
thats unfortunate because the audi 90 test car was admirable 
in many respects audi engineers thought ahead in their 
installation of the antilock braking system 
unlike many other european luxury cars the audi 90 allows 
drivers to turn the abs off with a switch on the dashboard that 
might be needed for example on gravel roads where a buildup of 
dirt and stone ahead of the tires could help a driver slow down or 
stop 
antilock brakes which prevent wheels from locking wouldnt 
necessarily allow that to happen audi engineering also was evident 
in the sleek aerodynamic shape the audi 90s drag coefficient 
which indicates how easily it cuts through air with little 
resistance was low thanks to a raked windshield flush window 
glass aerodynamic headlights and door handles that are integrated 
into the car body 
such aerodynamics are designed to reduce wind noise and reduce 
driver and passenger fatigue the audi 90s new fivespeed 
transmission was flawless and smooth the engine a 23liter 
fuelinjected inline fivecylinder could produce up to 130 
horsepower was steady and performed well 
the white paint outside was a special pearlescent metallic that 
really shone leather seats the front ones were heated at an 
optional 225 were comfortable rear leg room ranged from 
acceptable to roomy depending on the location of the front seats 
there were fasteners to keep the floor mats in place and there 
were childroof rear door locks as well as a feature that locked 
the rear windows and turned off the rear cigarette lighter from a 
switch on the driver door 
the center arm rest in the front adjusted to different heights 
nice for different drivers a vehicle monitoring system was 
engineered with two types of warning signals red if some systems 
were in really bad shape and needed immediate attention and yellow 
if corrections needed to be made soon 
my biggest concern was the audi 90 trunk it did not go back 
very far and seemed small but thats a small complaint for a small 
car that packages superbly some wonderful luxury car features from 
its bigger rivals 
in sum the audi 90 test car was solid and conveyed the casual 
elegance of a classic inside and out base price for the audi 90 
is 24330 putting it in the ballpark of such competitors as the 
bmw 325 which starts at around 24000 and the mercedesenz 190e 
which starts at more than 29000 
target buyers of the audi 8090 cars are mostly male most 
mostly married mostly college graduates between 35 and 44 with 
median family income of 68900 the audi spokeswoman said 
because the audi 90 is a new vehicle there are no reliability 
reports

ending its consideration and that the letter effectively 
terminated a standstill agreement between international multifoods 
and the group 
bregman partners had agreed not to purchase additional 
international multifoods shares during talks between the two

partners and in october filed suit alleging that the partnership 
had illegally caused speculation in its stock and filed misleading 
government disclosure statements 
bregman partners disclosed in a securities and exchange 
commission filing in december that it held 107 percent of 
international multifoods outstanding common stock earlier it had 
sought federal government clearance to raise its stake to as high 
as 25 percent 
the filing said the partnership had held discussions with 
multifoods financial adviser about the possibility of entering 
into negotiations to buy certain assets of the company but no 
negotiations were held and no agreement or understanding was

concerns about rising interest rates are depressing the stock 
market and the singlefamily home segment of the construction 
market analysts say 
on wall street stock prices slumped wednesday for the second 
consecutive session sending one widelywatched market indicator to 
a threemonth low 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 3532 to 195109 
the lowest level since it closed at 191446 on feb 9 broader 
market measures also tumbled 
bond prices fell broadly pushing interest rates higher the 
yield on the treasurys 30year bond regarded as an indicator of 
interest rate speculation rose to 929 percent from 921 percent 
late tuesday 
the commerce department said singlefamily home building dropped 
69 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110 million 
units last month 
construction of multifamily units which swing widely from 
month to month soared by 233 percent to a rate of 466000 units 
overall housing construction rose 05 percent in april to a 
seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 156 million units following 
gains of 23 percent in march and 99 percent in february the 
report stated 
but housing activity was still 45 percent below last year 
economists said the increase in apartment building probably was 
an aberration and rising mortgage interest rates likely would 
depress singlefamily construction 
the singlefamily number is not a bad number but i think its 
an indication that as rates rise through the year its going to 
impact the housing market said martin a regalia chief 
economist of the national council of savings institutions 
rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages were just under 10 
percent through march but began edging up in april and averaged 
104 percent last week 
housing permits considered a good sign of future construction 
activity fell 41 percent in april to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 142 million units singlefamily permits fell 68 percent 
while multifamily units rose 22 percent

younger less skilled and minority workers 
us imports of crude oil rose 241 percent in april from

an industry report showing buildups of crude and heating oil 
inventories and weakerthanexpected demand for gasoline analysts 
say 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
the benchmark us crude fell 33 cents to settle at 1743 per 
barrel wednesday 
among june contracts for refined products wholesale prices for 
unleaded gasoline fell 051 cent to 5223 cents per gallon while

international futures inc said the reports indication that 
stocks of heating oil were up by more than 3 million barrels and 
crude stocks were up by 16 million barrels were negative for the 
market 
increased supplies amid stable or shrinking demand put downward 
pressure on prices

imports together with changes in inventories over the last four 
weeks indicated a 57 percent decline in gasoline consumption

wall street has propelled macmillan inc common 
stock above the 64ashare price suggested in a 15 billion 
buyout proposal from a group led by texas investor robert m bass 
indicating invsetors expect a higher bid is expected 
macmillan chairman edward p evans meanwhile told the 
companys shareholders at their annual meeting wednesday that the 
publishing and information services concern isnt for sale 
securities analysts speculated the bass proposal could attract 
others possibly foreign companies to become involved touching 
off a bidding war 
macmillan stock soared 1825 a share to close at 6887 on the 
new york stock exchange after trading as high as 7162 earlier in 
the day 
some analysts have speculated the company could sell for as much 
as 85 to 90 a share in a bidding contest 
bert boksen a publishing analyst for raymond james amp associates 
in st petersburg fla estimated macmillan could command a price 
of 90 a share or more based on prices paid for other publishing 
companies in recent months 
wayne johnson who follows macmillan for hg wellington amp co 
in new york said he doubted the bass group expected to be able to 
buy macmillan for 64 a share i suspect it was a manuever to 
encourage others to buy at a higher price he said 
the bass group owns about 24 million macmillan shares or about 
91 percent of the companys 26 million common shares outstanding 
the analysts said foreignbased buyers benefitting from the 
decline in the dollar that has boosted their own buying power have 
shown an avid interest in us publishing companies 
french media giant hachette sa recently agreed to buy grolier 
inc and pearson plc of britain agreed to buy addisonwesley amp 
sons inc last year harper amp row was acquired by australias news 
corp 
harcourt brace jovanovich inc underwent a costly 
recapitalization last year to fend off a takeover bid by british 
publisher robert maxwell 
boksen said the bass groups proposal could force macmillan to 
find a friendly buyer or to propose a restructuring or a leveraged 
buyout under which the company would be taken private 
bass who heads robert m bass group inc in fort worth texas 
made the proposal in a letter to evans on the eve of macmillans 
annual meeting 
as the meeting convened wednesday morning evans said he had 
received the inquiry but macmillans board had not had a chance to 
discuss it 
he said management was confident about macmillans growth 
potential and added this is why the company is not for sale 
the meeting was adjourned before shareholders could ask any 
questions 
bass said the offer was conditioned upon approval by the 
macmillan board sufficient financing being obtained and macmillan 
not issuing any additional equity securities 
a proposal to authorize issuance of new preferred stock was on 
the agenda for macmillans annual meeting and the company said 
shareholders approved it 
macmillan based in new york publishes textbooks aimed at 
elementary through college grades as well as books of general 
interest it is a leader in childrens books and the fastgrowing 
computer book field 
other businesses include instructional services such as berlitz 
language training and retail operations through its gumps 
department stores 
macmillan had an aftertax profit of 707 million on revenue of 
9558 million in 1987 
publishing accounted for about 459 percent of revenue and 414 
percent of operating income in 1987 information services accounted 
for 239 percent of revenue and 401 percent of income

irving bank corp has denounced as totally 
without merit hostile suitor bank of new yorks questioning of 
preliminary results of a heated proxy battle that indicated irving 
retained control of its board of directors 
bank of new york claimed wednesday that the preliminary count 
irving released earlier this week excluded at least 650000 shares 
that holders attempted to vote in favor of bank of new yorks 
nominees 
it also claimed the holders of a preferred stock issue it is 
attempting to have invalidated provided a 318000share block 
favoring irving 
the stock was issued three months ago to 15 private investors as 
a defensive measure against the bank of new york each share 
guarantees voting rights beyond those of common shareholders 
if we got the 650000 shares counted for us and the 
preferred stock not permitted to be counted i believe that 
might be sufficient to swing the election in our favor bank of 
new york spokesman owen brady said 
brady said the company had not formally challenged the proxy 
count but simply was announcing its belief that the contest still 
was in doubt 
irving attorney robert falise called the complaints totally 
without merit and said the company was confident the final tally 
would jive with preliminary results 
irving said its shareholders at the may 6 annual meeting 
reelected the incumbent directors by 52 percent to 48 percent 
over bank of new yorks slate of 16 nominees final results were 
expected to be released at a reconvened shareholders meeting on 
may 24 
reelection of irvings board would constitute a vote of 
confidence in the companys defensive restructuring plan and 
friendly merger with the staterun banca commerciale italiana spa 
italys secondlargest bank and rejection of against bank of new 
yorks hostile buyout offer 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange irving 
closed up 125 cents to 6150 wednesday while bank of new york 
fell 75 cents to 3037 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings common shares outstanding the offer is valued at around 
64 a share or 11 billion 
bank of new york said it would be willing to raise the stock 
portion of its bid to 1675 bank of new york shares adding 320 
per share to the deal pushing its value to around 12 billion 
the offer would be amended only if irving agrees to a negotiated 
merger 
bank of new york said if irving refused to negotiate it would 
buy the irving shares tendered as of may 24 and operate the bank as 
a subsidiary for five years thereby avoiding the poison pill 
bank of new york said it owned or had been tendered about 50 
percent of irvings 185 million outstanding common shares 
banca commerciale is offering 75 a share for 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent valued at 707 million in addition 
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price 
from may 31 until the deal closes 
the banca commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that includes asset sales costcutting measures and a 
10ashare special cash dividend irving said the offer has a 
blended value of between 6520 and 7255 a share

failure to renew us steel import quotas may 
trigger a wave of trade litigation by american companies against 
foreign competitors including canada the head of the main 
domestic industry trade group says 
meanwhile the us steelmakers said wednesday the recovery that 
trade protection helped made possible in their industry may have 
peaked for the time being 
the american steel industry so hard at work to make itself 
internationally competitive will not stand idly by and watch that 
work undone by a repeat of the import abuses which threw our 
companies into a fiveyear bath of red ink said thomas c 
graham whose election to a rare third term as american iron and 
steel institute chairman was announced wednesday 
voluntary restraint agreements negotiated by the reagan 
adminisration with 31 foreign steelmaking nations expire in 
september 1989 the fiveyear quota plan was instituted partly to 
end a barrage of steelmaker lawsuits many of them aimed at the 
governmentsubsidized mills of europe 
if a vra extension is deemed unecessary by those in 
government then were prepared to flood the international trade 
commission with trade case filings if need be in numbers which 
will make what came before the vras seem trivial by comparison 
graham said in a speech at the aisis annual conference 
we do not want protection from efficient competition nor do 
we need it he said we need and expect only a climate of fair 
trade and legal trading practices 
earlier wednesday in a panel discussion graham said canada the 
united states largest trading partner and the largest steel 
exporter not covered by the voluntary quotas is vulnerable to a 
trade suit 
the aisi to which canadian mills belong wants canada included 
if the quotas are extended 
canada boosted its share of the us steel market from what 
graham said is its fair share of 24 percent to 37 percent in 
1987 the increase disadvantages europe japan and other quota 
nations he said 
john d allan chairman of the canadian steelmaker stelco inc 
said in a speech monday in toronto that us steel exports have 
surged from 45 percent and 48 percent of the canadian market in 
1985 and 1986 respectively to 55 percent last year allan also 
said canadian steel is fairly traded 
separately other industry leaders said steels recovery may 
have peaked if as they fear customers soon stop building 
inventories 
were forecasting a decrease in the production rates in the 
automobile appliance and private housing sectors so we dont see 
any driving forces for a continuation of the demand were seeing 
today said armco inc chairman robert e boni 
boni said 1988 shipments probably would tail off to 755 million 
tons roughly even with the 76 million tons shipped in 1987 and 
considerably shy of the 80 million tons talked about earlier this 
year the second year of the industrys longawaited recovery 
the shipping rate bears directly on profits and employment 
the reduction of 5 million tons obviously is going to 
reduce profits boni said without offering specific figures 
but officials said they doubted such a slowdown sales would 
force any plants to close 
the most difficult thing for us to call in this equation is 
customer inventory because no accurate surveys are available 
said ltv steel co president david hoag 
we know the customers built a lot of inventory last year we 
feel certain they built some in the first half of this year and at 
some point they will discontinue building those inventories he 
said i think that will begin to occur sometime in the second 
half

when the going got tough one oil patch company 
turned to the newspaper classifieds for help 
please send money manufacturing corporation needs cash to 
keep 50 people in jobs said the houston chronicle ad placed by 
federal flange amp fitting co 
i had hoped i would never have to place such an ad 
company president tom lyons said wednesday im not good at 
begging but i think it has come to be just that 
the ad which appeared tuesday said contributors would not 
receive stock or securities but merely a thank you from the 
company the ad included a post office box where contributions 
could be sent 
by early wednesday afternoon about 150 people had called the 
houston company since the ad appeared most asking for the 
companys address lyons said 
they just indicated they would be putting something in the 
mail lyons said 
federal flange which produces pipe flanges used in oil fields 
suffered severely in the energy downturn the company slashed its 
workforce from 160 employees to about 50 including three of lyons 
12 children and two of his nephews he said 
annual revenue has plunged to about 35 million from about 15 
million in the early 1980s 
lyons said the small ad also will appear in the chronicles 
sports section sunday he said the newspaper had delayed printing 
it by a few days to make sure there was nothing wrong in printing 
it 
lyons said he has been thinking about placing such an ad for 
months but finally decided to do so after hearing about a dallas 
radio announcer who asked for money and got it 
kvilfm announcer ron chapman asked listeners to send in 20 
without telling them why and the station received 243120 in four 
days it later gave the money to charity 
but lyons said federal flanges need for money was no joke he 
needs it to pay overdue bills and help keep him from having to file 
for bankruptcy 
i find people in the united states are very very generous 
he said i have a lot of confidence in the generosity of people 
lyons who has been battling hodgkins disease for two years 
said he also prays for his companys survival not money during 
mass 
i dont believe in praying for money he said

experts from 24 leading industrial countries met to 
discuss sharply different positions on agriculture policy but 
failed to reach accord the top trade official of the european 
economic community said today 
they made some progress but i dont dare to say that there is 
yet complete agreement said the official willy de clercq 
adding that the ministers planned to debate the issue further over 
lunch 
the experts met overnight to attempt to reach consensus on farm 
policy reform where the americans and europeans are at odds with 
each other 
trade and finance ministers from 24 countries of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development opened the 
meeting wednesday they were scheduled to issue a joint communique 
on agriculture and other economic issues at the close of todays 
meeting 
us treasury secretary james a baker iii today reiterated that 
the reagan administration was commited to ending all agricultural 
subsidies by the year 2000 but only if all other countries agreed 
to do the same 
such subsidies impose an enormous cost on consumers and 
taxpayers alike he told a breakfast meeting with reporters 
baker said washington had succeeded in reducing its farm 
subsidies from 26 billion in 1986 to a projected 175 billion for 
1988 he said the figure was expected to fall further next year 
us agriculture secretary richard e lyng called for an early 
commitment by americas trading partners to phase out government 
subsidies used to prop up domestic farm prices and help boost 
agricultural exports reagan first proposed this last june 
leaders of the 12nation eec rejected the idea as unrealistic 
they said the reform emphasis should be on shortterm measures such 
as production quotas that would reduce global surpluses 
at a reception wednesday evening president francois mitterrand 
underscored the european view that negotiations on world trade 
liberalization should not single out farm issues 
one cannot rush into negotiations while forgetting that all 
matters have to be discussed not only agriculture but also 
industry and services mitterrand said 
us officials said they also want to see tangible progress by 
december in trade negotiations being conducted by the 96 member 
countries of the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
the americans put special emphasis on reaching agreement on farm 
issues 
trade ministers from the gatt countries are to meet in montreal 
in december to review progress in the negotiations which are just 
beginning the next scheduled gatt meeting on agriculture is in 
early june 
lyng said congress would be watching closely for results from 
the montreal session 
undoubtedly if progress seems blocked the sentiment will be 
to legislate more policies and programs to offset the unfair trade 
practices of other nations lyng told wednesdays ministerial 
meeting 
de clercq told the meeting that such us attacks on unfair 
trading practices were unnecessary and worsen the climate for 
negotiation on farm issues 
he also criticized washington for cutting sugar imports 
reducing or abandoning efforts to hold some farmland out of 
production and contesting longstanding eec subsidy programs for 
farmers 
the organization for economic cooperation and development 
secretariat said in a report published on tuesday that aid to 
farmers in the 24 member countries amounted to about 245 billion 
in 198486 that is roughly double the total for 197981 it said

share prices recovered by midday thursday in 
london after opening broadly lower in a response to earlier 
declines in tokyo and in new york on wednesday 
traders said the market was steadying after its early jitters 
helped in part by neutral british economic news reported late in 
the morning 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 148 
points or 08 percent at 17628 at about 1215 pm local time 
the index had been down as much as 243 points earlier in the 
session 
volume was 2800 million shares up from 2553 million shares at 
midday wednesday 
earlier in the session the market withstood a barrage of 
economic reports which traders said appeared to paint a neutral 
picture of the uk economy 
a provisional 09 percent rise in the money supply was 
considered equal to or better than market expectations industrial 
production and earnings data also suggested the economy wasnt 
overheating unemployment which dropped to 88 percent in april 
from 9 percent in march was lower than expected 
people arent really worried about inflation as they were 
earlier in the week following the us march trade figures said a 
london trader what were waiting for is wall street 
another weak start to the new york market could unnerve london 
traders several said the dow jones industrial averages drop of 
more than 35 points on wednesday left wall street vulnerable

federal regulators provided a 2 billion 
assistance package to combine four insolvent thrifts into a 
dallasbased savings and loan as part of the federal plan to revive 
the flagging industry 
southwest savings association the states 18th largest thrift 
agreed to acquire 78 offices and branches of the four troubled sampls 
the plan announced wednesday may be the largest merger in the 
federal southwest plan designed to rescue the states ailing 
thrifts officials said 
the four thrifts to be acquired within the next year are 
stockton savings association of addison lamar savings association 
of austin the states 11th largest sampl city savings and loan 
association of san angelo and briercroft savings association of 
austin said george m barclay president of the federal home loan 
bank of dallas 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp will spend a record 
2 billion on the deal over a 10year period barclay said 
southwest is contributing 25 million of subordinated debt to 
the consolidated company as equity but no outside capital will be 
used 
the thrifts have combined assets of more than 4 billion 75 
percent of which are in commercial and nonconventional real 
estate and combined deposits of more than 44 billion barclay 
said 
theres no desire to create megathrifts barclay said 
but when you absorb four institutions youve got a lot of work 
in front of you we dont have much larger institutions so we dont 
anticipate much larger transactions 
barclay said even though the merger will begin with a large 
116branch outfit southwest will quickly begin shutting down its 
duplicated services 
within six months of the transaction southwest will make a 
substantial reduction in branches especially where there is 
duplication he said 
c todd miller chairman and chief executive of southwest 
savings said the company planned to substantially reduce the 
number of branches 
we dont know how many branches we will close miller said 
but he said customers of all the thrifts will be notified of branch 
closings by mail 
the federal home loan bank board has now resolved the problems 
of eight texas thrifts under the southwest plan which was 
announced by the board in february and initiated last week 
the southwest plan goal is to fold 109 or more insolvent sampls 
into 25 to 30 surviving institutions last year congress granted 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp authority to raise up 
to 108 billion from the industry to fund recapitalization of 
surviving thrifts 
the merger of four ailing thrifts into houstonbased coastal 
banc savings was the first consolidation under the southwest plan 
in a transaction that involved a 138 million contribution from the 
fslic that transaction included 35 million from a private 
investment group 
all of these transactions will be unique barclay said 
this one doesnt include outside capital some transactions in 
the future will have significant outside capital 
as part of its assistance in the deal the fslic will provide 
southwest savings with a 10year note worth about 483 million 
in exchange the fslic will receive warrants to purchase 50 
percent of southwests common stock the fslic will receive 90 
percent of southwest savings first 60 million in profits 
david colgren a spokesman for the fhlb said officials believe 
southwest savings will show a profit within two years 
stockton savings had total assets as of march 31 of 543 million 
with a net worth of negative 3477 million and deposits of 784 
million 
lamar savings association the object of a lawsuit filed by the 
fslic for regulatory violations has total assets of 19 billion 
a net worth of negative 3319 million and deposits of 21 billion 
city savings and loan association has assets of 6873 million 
a net worth of negative 2219 million and deposits of 8662 
million briercroft has total assets of 8681 million a net worth 
of negative 227 million and deposits of 658 million 
before wednesdays purchase southwest savings had total assets 
of 148 billion a net worth of 276 million and deposits of 998 
million 
miller said the southwest plan should be completed within the 
next 12 months

the texas banking industry may record 
its worst year ever in 1988 although the problems of texas banks 
will top out this year the chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp says 
it seems clear that the problems will peak this year 
chairman william seidman said wednesday most of the major banks 
have been dealt with or will have been handled 
more than half of texas banks reported lower earnings during the 
first three months and onethird of the states banks lost money 
he said 
among larger institutions ones with assets of more than 100 
million twofifths lost money with chargeoffs growing at twice 
1987 levels fdic officials reported 
bank failures in texas including 25 already this year should 
reach 70 by yearend seidman said in the last five years 
onethird of the banks closed were less than five years old 
seidman also said regulators are in negotiations with potential 
purchasers of first republicbank corp 
we are talking to people we hope we can arrange some 
resolution to that situation in the near future how soon only 
time will tell seidman told reporters 
the fdic is studying methods to remedy inequities in policies 
that now allow it insure all deposits in large failing banks while 
limiting exposure to the normal 100000 maximum at smaller 
institutions he confirmed 
the agency in march provided such blanket coverage for deposits 
held by first republic prompting complaints by area independent 
bankers 
regulators believe there has been no mass redistribution of 
funds to first republic as a result of the expanded guarantee 
although we have had a great number of protests about the 
inequities seidman said 
seidman said banks in the area not foreign institutions 
pulled funds from first republic triggering the companys solvency 
crisis and eventually the fdics 1 billion cash infusion in march 
comparing the earlier woes at first city bancorporation of texas 
inc which last month completed a 15 billion federally assisted 
recapitalization seidman said that bank never had the kind of 
run that developed at first republic 
the fdic did not prompt first republic to suspend interest 
payments on all debt last week raising the specter of a bankruptcy 
filing was not prompted by the fdic seidman said 
the first republic board acted on its own judgment he 
said we are in daily contact with them we have people stationed 
in the bank so we are aware of what they are doing 
seidman also said that albert v casey 68 lured out of 
retirement to run first republic has not been instructed to shrink 
the bank so that it might be more appealing to potential purchasers 
seidman blamed the continuing texas troubles on the duration of 
the states recession and lack of an established branchbanking 
system which tended to make it texas much more susceptible to 
problems 
texass oncebuoyant economy shielded bankers from the 
conservative lending practices of more recessionprone areas 
seidman said

moodys investors service inc has assigned a 
singlea3 rating to 300 million west german marks of eurobonds 
issued by china and due in 1992 moodys japanese subsidiary said 
moodys japan kk said in a statement wednesday that it was the 
first time a bond issued by china had been rated by a us 
creditrating agency the singlea3 rating indicates that the 
eurobond issue is a safe investment 
moodys rates bonds in 27 categories from singlec3 the 
highest investment risk to triplea1 the lowest risk 
the moodys statement said the rating was based on chinas 
current low level of debt the expectation that future borrowing 
will remain within a comfortable range relative to the nations 
debtservicing capacity and the progress made in stabilizing 
chinese politics since the death of chairman mao zedong in 1976 
moodys said chinas foreign debt is low by international 
standards totaling an estimated 27 billion at the end of last 
year that represents 93 percent of chinas gross national product 
and 75 percent of its current foreignexchange receipts the 
statement said 
china has adopted a conservative policy toward reliance on 
foreign debt and this policy is likely to continue the 
statement said 
however it said the scope and the nature of the changes 
underway are unprecedented with major policy contradictions yet to 
be resolved 
discontent has emerged primarily because of the dramatic 
shifts in the control of resources and in the distribution of 
benefits but also because progress on political liberalization has 
been slow the statement said

japan plans to end its voluntary limit of 
automobile exports to the united states effective next april 
according to a news report disputed by the government 
kyodo news service reported thursday that the government plans 
to end the limits however officials of the automobile department 
of the ministry of international trade and industry told the 
associated press thursday night they had not discussed the matter 
yet 
kyodo quoted unidentified miti sources as saying ministry 
officials believe there is no possibility that automobile exports 
to the united states will become an issue again because the high 
value of the yen makes japanese exports more expensive 
also japanese car makers now have production plants in the 
united states major japanese producers led by the toyota motor 
corp also are concentrating now on exporting deluxe cars to the 
untied states that compete with south korean exports it said 
japan began limiting its auto exports to the us market in 
fiscal 1981 under strong pressure from washington and the slumping 
american auto industry the limit first was set at 168 million 
vehicles but was raised to 186 million in fiscal 1984 
the united states stopped asking for the restraints in 1985 but 
japan voluntarily continued limiting car shipments to the us 
market to the 23 million vehicles exported there in fiscal 1985 
japan auto exports in fiscal 1987 were 221 million below the 
limit

the deficit in the fund that insures deposits 
in the nations savings institutions more than doubled last year 
and congressional action may well be needed to keep it 
operating the general accounting office said today 
the gao the auditing arm of congress said the federal savings 
and loan insurance corps liabilities exceeded its assets at the 
end of 1987 by 137 billion up from the deficit of 63 billion a 
year earlier 
in testimony prepared for the senate banking committee the gao 
said the fund which guarantees individual deposits up to 100000 
in 3120 sampls was in precarious financial condition 
it said the money available to the fund probably will not be 
adequate to resolve the problems of the nations 505 insolvent 
institutions 
while fslic has the resources to continue operating in the 
near future it may not have sufficient resources to effectively 
deal with the industrys current and future problems frederick 
d wolf director of the gaos accounting and financial management 
division said in the testimony 
replying to the gao m danny wall chairman of the federal home 
loan bank board which regulates federally insured sampls said the 
deficit does not mean the insurance fund lacks cash to deal with 
current problems he said it has 4 billion and sampl customers 
should be assured their deposits are fully insured 
wall said the fact that fslic may need more money down the road 
comes as a surprise to no one but he added the thing im 
sensitive to is that there not be any kind of unneccessary concern 
in the time sense we clearly have significant amounts of resources 
available to deal with the worst 200 institutions after that 
you get into predicting the future 
the gao report comes only nine months after congress authorized 
the sale of 108 billion in bonds over three years to bring the 
fund enough money to clean up the ailing industry which has been 
hard hit by the bust of oil and real estate markets in the 
southwest 
we believe that further congressional action beyond that 
already taken may well be needed to enable the fund to 
continue to meet its obligations and provide the deposit insurance 
it is mandated to provide the accounting office said 
although wolf did not explicitly say a taxpayer bailout will be 
required he said it appears unlikely that the industry would 
have the resources to provide such funding 
officials of the bank board expect the bond sales the premium 
fees it charges institutions and the proceeds from selling the 
assets of closed institutions to provide about 20 billion over the 
next three years and 28 billion over 10 years 
however wolf said we view fslics projections with 
significant reservations he said the agencys estimates of both 
the cost of the bailout and the money it will have to spend are too 
optimistic 
bank board officials last month had estimated the fslic deficit 
at 116 billion 21 billion less than the gao figure they also 
said it would cost 153 billion to take care of the worstoff 204 
thrift institutions and a total of 218 billion to rescue all 
insolvent thrifts 
however the gao said it would cost 174 billion to resolve the 
problems of the more than 200 hopelessly insolvent institutions 
and 264 billion to 364 billion to clean up all insolvent sampls 
the gao warned that this figure does not include an additional 
435 institutions which it said are barely solvent 
private analysts have estimated the total cost of restoring the 
industry to health to be as high as 60 billion 
in making its 218 billion estimate the bank board is assuming 
that interest rates will not increase significantly and that 
virtually no new problem cases will develop in the next 10 years 
a view wolf called extremely optimistic 
regulators also are assuming that insured deposits would grow by 
7 percent a year and that nearly all healthy sampls would remain in 
the insurance fund even after a law blocking their withdrawal 
expires in august growth of deposits slowed in 1985 1986 and 1987 
and has only been accelerating since last october 
also if a special insurance premium assessed sampls is continued 
as the bank board expects healthy thrifts would be encouraged to 
leave fslic to avoid the added cost that would reduce its deposit 
base and income further wolf said 
but he said without continuing the special assessment there 
is no shred of hope of resolving fslics financial plight without 
turning to the taxpayer 
bank board officials also project the interest rate on bonds 
floated to recapitalize the insurance fund will remain below 10 
percent even though rates already are edging higher 
and they assume they will take care of most ailing sampls by 
merging them with healthier institutions a cheaper alternative 
than shutting down an institution and paying off depositors 
however the gao noted that over the last five years 37 percent 
of the cases have been resolved through liquidations and of the 
remaining cases resolved by merger some have resulted in 
institutions that are still weak only bigger 
wolf also said regulators are counting on investors to take 
fslic notes rather than cash in exchange for taking over an 
ailing institution that he said remains an open question 
wall replied that because the economy has strengthened it is 
clearly not the case anymore that there is a lack of interest 
in mergers 
we have more interest in these institutions in texas than we 
ever expected we have an embarrasment of riches in that 
sense he said

the federal official who headed the white 
houses latest study of the financial market crash defended its 
recommendations today saying the recent dramatic price swings on 
the markets do not require dramatic fixes 
but members of the house telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee said they were dissatisfied with the study 
the issue of daily volatility although an expressed public 
concern is not in the category of systemic threat in my 
opinion said treasury undersecretary george d gould however 
disconcerting such volatility can be on a short term basis it is 
important not to attempt cures that can do more harm than good 
rep edward markey dmass the subcommittees chairman 
criticized goulds report saying history will judge your work 
product far more harshly than did your boss president reagan 
the white house has praised the stock market study that gould 
and his associates produced 
rep matthew rinaldo of new jersey ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said of the reports conclusions they certainly 
did not go far enough 
the working group that produced the study consisted of gould 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan securities and 
exchange commission chairman david s ruder and commodity futures 
trading commission chairwoman wendy gramm 
their report recommended that the nations stock futures and 
options markets set up a circuit breaker that would allow them 
to halt all trading on days when the dow jones industrial average 
plunges by historic levels 
the study suggested that improvements be made in the credit 
clearing and settlement systems the markets use to conduct and 
complete transactions in addition the group said it should remain 
in existence to function as a coordinating and consulting 
mechanism for intermarket issues 
the report offered no proposals for limiting computerdriven 
program trading a strategy that involves futures and stock 
transactions that critics say has helped fueled the markets 
volatility in recent months 
also absent were recommendations to change the levels of 
margins or downpayments for futures transactions a move that 
supporters say would diminish speculation 
in addition the group did not endorse a proposal advanced by an 
earlier white house panel headed by investment banker nicholas f 
brady that a single federal agency probably the fed should 
oversee issues that concern all of the markets 
instead the officials seemed to shrug off the contentions of 
many lawmakers and investors that dramatic steps need to be taken 
quickly to avoid repeats of days like last oct 19 when the dow 
plunged a record 508 points since that time many small investors 
have left the market 
when you get a shock to the system that occurred on oct 19 
people withdraw greenspan said monday its a cycle they come 
back they leave they come back they will be back 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 35 
points wednesday and was at its lowest level in more than three 
months

the head of arthur andersen amp cos domestic 
consulting operation has been dismissed for allegedly planning to 
leave andersen and take the operation with him according to a 
newspaper report 
the wall street journal in todays editions said gresham 
brebach the head of domestic consulting who is also a partner in 
andersen confirmed he had been relieved of his duties but denied 
that he was trying to take away andersens consulting business 
andersen had no immediate comment on the journal article said 
michele bondy a spokeswoman for the accounting firm 
andersen based in chicago is one of the big eight 
accounting firms which are the nations largest and best known 
its domestic consulting business is the largest in the united 
states according to the journal 
brebach acknowledged that many of andersens consulting partners 
have a major disagreement with top management over the strategic 
direction and philosophical approach of the firm the newspaper 
said 
revenues from consulting operations are generally growing at a 
faster pace than fees from auditing and tax accounting according 
to the journal 
brebach told the paper his dismissal probably resulted from a 
meeting he called of 11 other andersen consulting partners in new 
york two weeks ago to discuss opposition to a proposed amendment in 
the firms bylaws the amendment would have required a departing 
partner to wait a full year before soliciting andersen clients or 
trying to hire other andersen partners

corporate takeover artists are waging their own 
political campaigns this election year they call them proxy 
contests 
rather than merely throwing money at shareholders to buy their 
way into companies raiders are exerting new pressure on their 
targets by trying to infiltrate the boardroom 
convinced they can do more with a companys assets than 
incumbent management outsiders are asking shareholders to cast 
their lots with them by voting in a new regime often without track 
records of their own raiders promise shareholders handsome returns 
in exchange for their support of a rival slate of board candidates 
the process is not for the faint of heart or purse experts 
estimate it can cost up to 10 million to wage a fullblown proxy 
battle replete with newspaper ads mass mailings and phone 
solicitations 
while thats a steep price tag for a fight that usually favors 
management its sometimes worth the expense by testing the hinges 
on the palace gates some proxy warriors have stirred entrenched 
managers to make big changes and raise the value of their stock to 
the delight of common shareholders 
corporate gunslingers have had few dead shots with the proxy 
weapon but their aim is getting better in recent weeks 
managements at gillette co and irving bank corp came perilously 
close to losing control of their boards in heated proxy contests 
even more revealing a study of 60 proxy fights between 1978 and 
1985 conducted by the university of rochester found that in many 
cases top managers eventually resigned even after beating back 
challenges from outside 
a challengers typical tactics include painting a broadbrush 
picture of managerial inefficiency using a variety of 
easytoconvey criticisms such as poor operating profits or an 
allegedly inadequate dividend payout said harry deangelo a 
professor at the university of rochester who coauthored the study 
until recently proxy contests were not waged against corporate 
heavyweights experts say the new wave is a result of corporate 
defensive maneuvers like poison pills and state laws that make 
unwanted takeovers cumbersome 
poison pills and new legislation have become significant 
deterrents to the purchasing of a major stake in a company 
deangelo said 
aggressors believe their allies if elected can work to rescind 
poison pills that may be in place and can help push for a deal 
the proxy battles that ensue are a form of pressure on 
companies an amplification of takeover strategy said 
attorney todd lang chairman of the american bar associations 
committee on proxy fights and tender offers 
he noted that until recently raiders used proxy battles as a 
way to obtain control of a whole company without paying for it 
but now were finding a lot of these contests are connected with 
tender offers 
california investor burt sugarman sought seats for himself and 
two allies on the board of media general inc in conjunction with 
his 18 billion tender offer for the communications company 
sugarmans bid was complicated by two classes of stock one of 
which put control of the company in the hands of the bryan family 
owners of 70 percent of media generals more powerful class b 
shares 
managements main advantage in these fights is financial 
because they control the pursestrings corporate chieftains can 
spend a lot of money to make their own case 
they have all the corporte resources at their disposal and 
thats shareholder money to do as many mailings as they want 
which is tremendously expensive said james heard executive 
director of united shareholders association a shareholder rights 
organization headed by t boone pickens jr 
management also has a better idea who the major shareholders are 
and can court them quickly 
some experts estimate as much as 50 percent of a corporations 
stock is held in street name or the name of a broker or another 
nominee instead of the customer who will vote the shares 
proxy solicitors hired by outsiders spend countless hours trying 
to trace shareholders through a confusing web of surface 
organizations 
institutional shareholders who control a major portion of 
corporate america often are more inclined to side with management 
because of possible reprisals they know if they dont they will 
be punished deangelo said 
in gillettes case for example institutional investors were 
believed to hold as much as 65 percent of the 115 million 
oustanding shares 
one source involved in a recent highprofile proxy battle noted 
that management has a lot more political strings to pull than the 
people from outside who have to persuade stockholders 
difficult to document but nonetheless pervasive are management 
threats and behindthescenes armtwisting one source said 
management puts pressure on institutions with which it has business 
relationships sometimes threatening to sever those ties if 
dissatisfied with their vote 
thats a tremendous advantage and its very unfair the 
source said 
winning or losing is not so easy to judge in these affairs 
however joel reed chief financial officer of desert partners 
lp notes that it all depends on how success is measured 
desert partners which has had an outstanding tender offer for 
usg corp had sought six seats on the companys board although 
the results of the vote wont be available for some time reed 
noted that desert partners made its point even if usgs directors 
are reelected 
anytime a board is facing an election contest management 
becomes increasingly concerned about how shareholders view the job 
they are doing he said in the case of usg i question whether 
management would have ever proposed the recapitalization plan that 
they did were it not for the battle for our slate of 
candidates 
reed was referring to usgs plan to spend about 22 billion to 
pay shareholders a onetime dividend that includes cash stock and 
notes for each common share 
despite the expense and emotional wearandtear of a proxy 
battle some say raiders merely are hoping to cash out at a higher 
price reed bristled at that suggestion noting that our 
objective is to acquire the company 
you do see success in terms of what i think is a increased 
accountability to stockholders on the part of incumbent management 
and the board reed said 
despite the advantage management might have reed said the proxy 
process is a good one 
i would hate to see any barriers to free elections of 
directors i think the freeelection process has tremendous 
motivation for incumbent management and boards to be responsive to 
the wishes of their constituents

winning a proxy contest is no job guarantee for 
current managers 
according to an analysis of 60 proxy contests management 
resignations typically follow a proxy battle even when outsiders 
fail to win seats on a companys board of directors according to 
two researchers at the university of rochester 
professors harry and linda deangelo who studied the contests 
between 1978 and 1985 noted that about twothirds of the time top 
managers resigned within three years of a proxy fight with the 
majority of the changes coming within one year 
that includes managers who lost their jobs when disssident 
shareholders won control of their companies which happened about 
30 percent of the time 
perhaps even more significant the two found that only about 20 
percent of the companies they studied remained publicly held 
corporations run by the same management teams three years after the 
proxy contests 
harry deangelo pointed to two examples 
samuel b casey president and chief executive officer of 
pullman inc resigned in november 1978 even though dissident 
shareholders were defeated in a proxy fight two years later the 
company was acquired by wheelabratorfrye inc 
in the case of management assistance a group of dissident 
shareholders backed by asher edelman won four out of 10 board seats 
in an april 1984 proxy fight four months later the companys 
president and chief executive officer raymond kurshan resigned 
within a year the company was liquidated 
the deangelos say their findings raise serious questions about 
claims that proxy contests are an inefficient way to discipline 
managers of publicly held corporations 
in many cases of management resignations the new manager is 
designed to accommodate the dissidents interest harry deangelo 
said 
these findings suggest that independent of its immediate 
outcome a proxy challenge does pose a serious threat to managerial 
tenure the study said

the more proxy contests and the grizzlier the 
more business booms for proxy solicitors 
solicitors are responsible for the gritty legwork in a proxy 
battle they track down shareholders and talk to them draft 
letters and write newspaper ads send out mailings tally votes 
and serve as general handholders to whichever side they happen to 
represent 
theyve got it down to a science one observer remarked 
the carter organization one of the largest solicitors with 1987 
fee income of more than 22 million has had a hand in several 
major proxy fights recently 
donald carter the groups president said the cost of a proxy 
battle can range anywhere from 1 million to 10 million 
because a large precentage of any companys stock is held by 
institutional investors or in street names names other than the 
actual shareholder simply identifying just who owns the 
outstanding shares is a job for a firstrate sleuth 
at georgeson amp co the nations oldest proxy solicitor 
managing director john wilcox said he relies on a database that has 
been built up over time linking individuals and their securities 
holdings 
once shareholders are identified solicitors have to convince 
them to vote in a particular direction carter estimates his people 
talk by phone with 2 million shareholders a year in an attempt to 
influence voting 
some firms have even been known to hire actors to use southern 
accents in an attempt to sway shareholders in southern states 
observers say 
carter said new technology allowing shareholders to vote by 
phone has added a new dimension to solicitation when we get 
finished speaking with a shareholder we give them a tollfree 
number and ask them to call immediately if they agree with us he 
said 
within five minutes we know if theyre telling the truth that 
theyre going to vote with us 
if the shareholder doesnt call in with a vote carters people 
are back on the phone 
newspaper ads are also crucial to the proxy process but they 
are not directed toward the individual shareholder rather they 
are aimed at the investment community both large institutional 
investors as well as brokers who may be asked for advice from 
individual clients 
joel reed chief financial officer of desert partners lp said 
solicitors are totally key to the entire process they help 
identify and contact shareholders they give you their prognosis of 
how the vote is stacking up and they make sure proxies are properly 
executed so they dont get thrown out on a technicality 
desert partners sought seats on the board of usg corp in a 
recent proxy contest the partnership also launched a tender offer 
for usg shares 
as for the latest wave of proxy battles that has come to center 
on large corporations business is the busiest ever for 
solicitors wilcox said

authorities today captured the last two of seven 
men charged in a wire transfer scheme that siphoned 70 million 
from the first national bank of chicago to banks in austria 
authorities said 
however us attorney anton valukas said wednesday that the 
conspiracy was cracked before the suspects could withdraw the money 
transferred illegally from the accounts of three of first 
nationals corporate customers 
valukas said authorities had filed charges of illegal wire 
transfer of funds against two first national employees a third 
chicago man and three men from detroit he identified armand 
moore 30 of detroit as ringleader of the failed scheme 
four of the men were arrested late tuesday or early wednesday a 
fifth man bank employee gabriel taylor 27 has been charged but 
is cooperating with authorities 
assistant us attorney scott mendeloff said the arrests were 
made early today in detroit he identified the two as leonard 
strickland about age 50 and the rev ronald g carson but added 
that no further details were available immediately 
valukas said that 70 million was transferred illegally friday 
from the accounts of three of first nationals corporate customers 
chicagobased united airlines new yorkbased merrill lynch amp 
co and louisville kybased distiller brownforeman corp to 
two new york banks 
the money then was transferred to three accounts in two banks in 
vienna austria 
valukas said no money had been withdrawn from citibank and chase 
manhattan in new york or from creditanstalt and focobank in 
austria 
but you could call this sophisticated in that the money 
actually made it to the austrian banks said valukas 
first national spokesman anthony zehnder said neither the 
nations 10thlargest bank nor the three corporate customers whose 
accounts were involved in the wiretransfer scheme would lose any 
money 
valukas said authorities were attempting to determine whether 
the accounts at the viennese banks were fictitious two were in the 
names of companies lord investment inc and gtl industries and a 
third was in the name of walter newman 
our investigation into whether others are involved is 
continuing valukas said 
he said evidence would be presented to a federal grand jury as 
it considers further charges 
four of the suspects appeared for an initial bond hearing late 
wednesday before us magistrate bernard weisberg 
the four moore and neal jackson 31 both of detroit and 
herschel bailey 30 and first national employee otis wilson 30 
both of chicago were returned to the federal metropolitan 
correctional center pending another bond hearing friday 
federal agents began investigating the scheme after merrill 
lynch officials uncovered a 24 million shortfall monday and 
notified the bank which in turn notified authorities valukas said 
valukas said the detroittochicago connection involved moore 
and bailey who is moores cousin 
he said that moore recruited first national employees wilson and 
taylor both of whom allegedly participated in the scheme by 
providing confidential information such as code words and 
confirming messages for the transactions that enabled the schemers 
to circumvent the banks security procedures valukas said 
valukas said taylor agreed late tuesday to contact several other 
members of the alleged scheme and discuss the matter while wearing 
a recording device

london players several dealers said rumors of large stock sales in 
new york by japanese investors also did not bode well for the 
london market 
a large computergenerated trading program involving disposal of 
several stocks late in the london afternoon also contributed to the 
pressure some traders said 
i would say its more a case of lethargy than outright 
pessimism said one equity salesman adding that unless we get 
some more bids and corporate activity we wont have anything to 
keep the market alive 
a battery of uk economic indicators released earlier thursday 
were digested by the market without causing much of a stir dealers 
said 
a provisional rise in the money supply of 09 percent in april 
was equal to or better than market expectations march industrial 
production rose 12 percent and the annual rate of increase in 
average earnings remained unchanged at 85 percent in march 
suggesting the british economy was not immediately overheating 
unemployment which dropped to 88 percent in april from 9 percent 
in march was lower than expected

a conference of leading industrial nations ended 
thursday after the united states failed to persuade european 
governments to accept its proposal for ending public aid to farmers 
by the year 2000 
however trade and finance ministers from the 24 members of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said they 
would work together to reform global farm trading rules 
the european countries held out against us efforts to set a 
timetable for phasing out subsidies designed to prop up farm prices 
and boost exports 
these efforts already are under way with little apparent 
progress in the 96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
a genevabased body that sets and monitors world trade rules 
us officials said they would have preferred a more specific 
commitment to press ahead with farm policy reforms but that 
differences with the europeans were not insurmountable 
were basically on the same wave length said clayton 
yeutter the us special trade representative 
what we achieved in this meeting is a recognition of the fact 
that weve got to begin to develop the specifics of the 
negotiating outlines he added 
officials from other countries took a more modest view of the 
meetings outcome 
kjellolof feldt swedish finance minister and chairman of the 
meeting told reporters the americans wanted a commitment to start 
reforming farm trade rules in 1989 while others believed it 
should be a gradual process 
i wouldnt dare to say this has been resolved he said 
willy de clercq the top trade official of the european economic 
community told reporters the eec or common market would never 
accept the us idea of eliminating all farm subsidies 
for us it is a question of reduction of subsidies not 
phasing out he said 
the united states and the eec both spend about 25 billion a 
year on farm subsidies they agree that this aid has become too 
burdensome but they disagree over how to correct the problem 
bill hayden the austrialian foreign minister told reporters he 
was pleased the paris meeting had avoided an open clash over what 
he called apparently irreconcilable differences between us and 
european officials 
de clercq made a similar assessment 
the main thing was to avoid a needless clash which would 
have been a counterproductive signal de clercq said 
the paris communique said the gatt negotiations in geneva should 
achieve solid progress in all areas including rules for trading 
in services such as banking by december when a review conference 
will be held 
as they enter their more difficult phase it is vital to 
ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations the joint 
declaration said 
the trade and finance ministers in a broad review of the state 
of the world economy said economic growth was much stronger than 
had been expected in the immediate aftermath of last octobers 
stock market crash 
they said world trade was growing robustly inflation was 
holding at a low level global trade imbalances were improving and 
international cooperation on economic issues was growing 
the ministers added however that problems remain including 
protectionism or actions by governments to protect domestic 
industries from foreign competition 
the statement said the top priority for the united states should 
be to further reduce its federal budget deficit 
japan was praised for its efforts to increase imports and 
stimulate domestic consumer demand 
europe was urged to increase the flexibility of its labor and 
financial markets and to reform its agricultural policies 
the ministers also agreed the current approach to easing the 
debt burdens of poorer nations should be continued they said each 
debtors situation should be considered individually rather than 
applying an acrosstheboard formula for financial relief

media general inc executives will urge the 
board of directors to reject a proposal that would split the 
company giving california industrialist burt sugarman more than 
onefourth interest in the firms broadcast operations according 
to a published report thursday 
lawyer nicholas chimicles of haverford pa proposed the 
restructuring in a may 5 letter chimicles represents harvey m 
jasper of new york and sarah shields of florida who claim in a 
federal court lawsuit that media general officers and directors 
breached their fiduciary duty to stockholders by rejecting 
sugarmans 6150pershare offer to buy all of the companys stock 
sugarman has since increased the offer to 70 per share or 
about 2 billion he also is waging a proxy fight to have himself 
and two associates elected to media generals board of directors at 
fridays annual meeting 
the takeover proposal will not be voted on at the meeting 
james s evans president and chief executive officer of media 
general told the richmond newsleader management intends to 
recommend against pursuing chimicles proposal 
we are not recommending any form of recapitalization at this 
time he added 
chimicles said in his letter his proposal would be better than a 
clear victory by either side in court he said a sugarman defeat 
would result in a decline in media general stock 
a sugarman victory would benefit shareholders chimicles said 
but perhaps not the the degree available under his plan 
the lawyer said he retained a philadelphia investment banking 
company howard lawson amp co to formulate a plan that would boost 
stockholder value in media general divide the company into two 
units give sugarman a fair return on his investment and enable 
members of the d tennant bryan family to retain control of the 
companys newsprint and newspaper businesses which include the 
newsleader and the richmond timesdispatch 
sugarman and his associates own 101 percent of media general 
class a stock an investment of more than 111 million 
bryan family members own 70 percent of the companys class b 
stock which in effect controls the company and about 12 percent

a california gun manufacturer will make 
semiautomatic carbines similar to the israeli uzi in china under a 
contract described as the first such agreement with a communist 
country the company announced thursday 
weaver arms corp of san diego will sell the first shipments of 
its 9mm nighthawk carbines in the united states and plans to sell 
the guns to american police agencies private citizens and third 
world military said robert weaver company president 
the initial production agreement which the company said was 
approved by the state department prohibits sale of the guns to 
china but the company hopes eventually to open that market weaver 
said 
the state departments public affairs office did not immediately 
respond to a request for confirmation that it was the first time an 
american gun company had been allowed to make weapons in china 
one arms industry analyst downplayed the value of such a weapon 
to the military or police saying there are plenty of other 
semiautomatic weapons available to them 
semiautomatics fire once each time the trigger is pulled it is 
legal for civilians to own semiautomatic weapons in this country 
but fully automatic guns are illegal 
the principal value of the deal would be to give weaver a cheap 
product for sale to american collectors and others who value guns 
that look like the shortbarreled uzis they see on television said 
the analyst gregory fetter of forecast international the newtown 
conn publisher of world weapons week 
everybody wants to walk around being macho these days 
fetter said the gunloving public wants something that makes 
them look like a special forces trooper yet is legal 
weaver signed an agreement with the chinese government at a 
ceremony may 14 in beijing and expects to begin production in 90 
days with the first shipment of 10000 guns planned by january 
1989 
were very excited weaver said its an agreement thats 
never been accomplished before between a western arms company and a 
communist country 
weaver refused to divulge the value of the contract or the 
location of the factory in china saying the chinese insisted on 
secrecy for the time being 
the guns are expected to sell for 525 retail the uzi goes for 
698 in this country and the other similar gun the german hk94 
retails for 800 weaver said 
the publicly held company also has designed a 9mm pistol and an 
ultralight submachine gun but neither is yet in production weaver 
said

while us commercial and industrial electric 
users enjoyed fractionally cheaper rates in the year ended april 
30 their foreign counterparts were mostly paying more a 
consulting firm said thursday 
in its annual study national utility service inc said the 
nations 24 largest investorowned utilities charged their 
nonresidential customers an average 628 cents per kilowatthour 
over the 12month period compared with 629 cents a year earlier 
that slight decrease compared with an overall inflation rate of 
39 percent over the same period the firm said 
price reductions by some utilities could be attributed to the 
recent decline in oil prices said marvin lauterbach executive 
vice president of the park ridge njbased firm 
but lauterbach warned that the apparent stability masked an 
upward price movement by half of the utilities surveyed 
some of these increases are a direct result of having 
industrial and commercial users offset the costs incurred in the 
building of nuclear power plants he said most of these 
nuclear power plants still lack a license to operate 
looking to other countries the firm found that electricity 
costs also fell in ireland by 487 percent and belgium by 198 
percent that compared with inflation rates of 25 percent and 096 
percent respectively 
in france the average cost remained constant while inflation 
rose by 24 percent the organization said 
countries where businesses paid more for electricity with 
percentages of increases and national inflation rates were 
canada 87 percent 41 percent 
australia 59 percent 68 percent

exxon corp the nations largest oil company 
entered this year on a definite earnings upswing despite two 
years of severe oil price volatility and market disruptions 
chairman lawrence g rawl said thursday at the companys annual 
meeting 
exxons net income of 146 billion for the first quarter of 
1988 was up 36 percent over the first quarter of 1987 even though 
average crude oil prices in this years first quarter were about 2 
a barrel lower than the first quarter last year rawl said 
the effect of these declining oil prices on our exploration 
and production earnings was cushioned somewhat by increased 
production from new and existing fields rawl said of the new 
yorkbased corporation more importantly however petroleum 
product prices both here and abroad were relatively firm 
firm prices helped improve margins in exxons refining and 
marketing sectors said rawl who added that the company also 
profited from sharp production increases in its chemical operations 
after two consecutive years of record earnings chemicals 
began this year with the best quarterly earnings ever rawl said 
the company last month reported first quarter earnings of 106 
per share up 41 percent over the first quarter of 1987 
exxon spent 18 billion in 1987 to acquire producing oil and 
gas properties in the united states canada and australia and the 
company plans to continue investment in highquality attractively 
priced reserves rawl said 
in an effort to make exploratory drilling ventures more 
costeffective the company is concentrating on a select group of 
highquality prospects a policy that led to significant 
discoveries last year in the united kingdom the netherlands 
australia and columbia rawl said 
this success rawl said has encouraged us to budget an 
increase from 184 to about 240 exploratory wells this year 
exxon also invested about 524 million in overall research and 
development last year including research into new generation 
synthetic fuel technologies rawl said he said the research will 
allow exxon to take advantage of its sizeable holdings of coal oil 
shale and other resources 
continuing to operate in a very difficult and uncertain 
business environment requires us to continue improving our 
efficiency and keep a sharp eye on nearterm performance rawl 
said we must look further out and invest in those emerging 
technologies that are essential for our companys longterm growth 
and profitability

flamboyant financier paul bilzerian now 
chairman of singer co is the target of major securities and 
exchange commission and federal grand jury investigations for 
possibly violating a litany of securities laws a published report 
said thursday 
the wall street journal said that documents it obtained and 
interviews conducted with business associates show bilzerian may 
have engaged in such crimes as insider trading tax fraud filing 
false documents with the sec and parking stock in accounts that 
conceal its ownership 
the investigations stem from the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal the journal also said new details of possible securites 
law violations surfaced in the sec lawsuit filed last week against 
ohio developer edward debartolo sr 
bilzerian an eccentric high school dropout who amassed a 
fortune through real estate stock market speculation and takeover 
raids used a number of possibly illegal tactics to force large 
corporations into unwanted takeovers or liquidations that gained 
him hundreds of millions of dollars the journal said 
a spokesman at singer headquarters said bilzerian had no comment 
on the journal report 
in one case early on in his takeover career bilzerian secretly 
purchased and parked 58000 shares of hh robertson co a 
pittsburgh construction company he said he would acquire for 250 
million the journal said 
but bilzerian never followed through with a formal bid and did 
not file any documents detailing his offer with the sec as 
required by law the paper said in the process the journal said 
bilzerian alienated canadas wealthy belzberg family which owned 
17 percent of robertson 
bilzerian also reneged on an agreement to buy back the robertson 
shares he parked at jefferies amp co leaving the los angeles 
securities firm with a 250000 loss the paper said 
later however bilzerian partly reimbursed jefferies and then 
sent the firm two phony invoices for 75000 each when he leared 
the firm had recouped a good portion of the loss on its own the 
journal said 
in his next deal the paper said the florida raider secretly 
enlisted the aid of the debartolo in his bid for cluett peabody amp 
co sec documents do not reveal any links between the two but the 
journal said debartolo bought large blocks of cluett stock for 
himself and arranged for others to buy more sometimes after 
talking with bilzerian 
the journal said documents indicate debartolo lent bilzerian 
millions of dollars to purchase cluett shares bilzerian and his 
investor group walked away with 82 million after west 
pointpepperell inc surfaced as a white knight and bought 
cluett 
the paper also said bilzerian had an arrangement with jefferies 
that the firm would buy stock in hammermill paper co his next 
target and hold it for him to buy at a later date between 
jefferies and his own purchases bilzerians stake totaled more 
than 5 percent though he did not report it to the sec as required 
by law the journal said 
an hour before bilzerian launched a 900 million bid for 
hammermill he purchased an additional 17 million shares the 
paper said 
the journal noted that bilzerian did not report he was again 
working with debartolo who was amassing his own block of 
hammermill shares 
bilzerian and his group made 54 million when hammermill was 
rescued by international paper co 
the paper said bilzerian parked at least 800000 shares of armco 
with jefferies in late 1986 to realize a 500000 profit when the 
stock rose in price he sent jefferies an invoice for consulting 
services payable on jan 2 1987 in an attempt to defer the gain 
for tax purposes the paper said 
the journal noted that bilzerian and jefferies severed all 
relations shortly after nov 12 1986 when the governments 
investigation into insider trading violations swung into high gear 
in march 1987 boyd jefferies chairman of the investment firm 
agreed to settle sec charges pleaded guilty to two felonies and 
agreed to cooperate the sec then began investigating the 
transactions involving cluett hammermill and other companies that 
bilzerian had a hand in the journal said 
bilzerian acquired singer in a 106 billion hostile bid on the 
heels of the stock market crash putting him at the helm of one of 
the nations oldest corporations

bear stearns amp co one of several major wall 
street investment firms to cut back on program trading said 
thursday it will reconsider the move after a government official 
said such restrictions could destabilize the market 
bear stearns went further than four other investment firms when 
it announced last week it would not only stop index arbitrage 
trading for its own accounts but for those of customers as well 
salomon brothers inc morgan stanley amp co painewebber group 
inc and kidder peabody amp co halted index arbitrage for their own 
accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was 
at least partly responsible for the stock markets volatility 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said thursday that 
excessive restriction of index arbitrage would limit market 
liquidity and tend to destabilize the market 
in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee greenspan said that insufficient arbitrage between 
cash and futures can be a destabilizing force in a declining 
market 
in index arbitrage traders use computers to buy or sell baskets 
of stocks with offsetting trades in stockindex futures to help 
them profit from brief price discrepancies 
greenspan noted that reduced arbitrage implies less connection 
between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across 
these markets 
partly citing those comments alan greenberg bear stearns 
chairman and chief executive officer said the firm would 
reexamine its position on index arbitrage 
greenberg said bear stearns had been monitoring closely the 
action and the liquidity problems of the stock market for the past 
week 
he also pointed to other firms suspension of index arbitrage 
activity for themselves but continuation of those activities for 
customers as further reason for the firm to reevaluate its 
position 
if we do decide to reenter index arbitrage we will consider 
limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to 
sell on an uptick in the stocks involved greenberg said in a 
statement

a congressional subcommittee is trying to 
determine if 65 million northrop corp invested in a hotel 
project in korea was actually intended to influence sales of the 
companys illfated f20 jet fighter a committee aide said 
thursday 
a northrop spokesman denied any violation of the foreign corrupt 
practices act and portrayed the company a victim of fraud by its 
korean partner in the deal 
northrop has filed a fraud suit against the korean company 
which was its partner in a 5050 joint venture to build a hotel in 
seoul said tony cantafio a spokesman at the companys los angeles 
headquarters 
northrop never began commercial production of the f20 because 
it failed to win sufficient orders 
the probe by the us house energy and commerce committees 
subcommittee on investigations focuses on northrops payment of 
65 million in 1984 to asia culture travel co 
cantafio said the payment was part of a socalled offset program 
in which the company was to invest in koreas economy in return for 
receiving the fighter contract such arrangements are common among 
aerospace companies dealing with developing countries and are 
allowed by us law 
the committee chaired by rep john dingell dmich is probing 
whether the payment was intended to buy influence rather than build 
a hotel said a subcommittee staff member who refused to be 
identified it would be a violation of the corrupt practices act if 
the company meant the money as payment to individuals 
one aspect of the arrangement that aroused suspicion the 
dingell aide said was that the money intended for the development 
company was deposited in a hong kong bank account 
we were defrauded by a group of people in korea cantafio 
said we tried and tried again to get that hotel under way and 
when it became evident that the hotel wasnt going to be built we 
filed for arbitration and then we filed this suit 
the suit filed in korea in december 1987 accuses the asia 
culture travel co and 12 individuals of defrauding the company 
the committee also is probing northrops payment of 15 million 
to terminate an agreement with a korean company that was supposed 
to help it market the jet in korea the committee staff has 
questioned the size of january 1984 payment to the dong yang 
express group because the agreement didnt bring any sales the 
dingell aide said 
cantafio declined to comment on the dong yang agreement

chrysler corp is looking for ways to improve 
profits on its auto business without sacrificing sthe market share 
it gained by holding down prices and offering aggressive buyer 
incentives chairman lee iacocca told shareholders thursday 
we are in a real dog fight in this market iacoccasaid we 
intend to price as aggressively as we have to our goal is market 
share we want all the ground we can take 
chrysler increased its share of the us vehicle market to 145 
percent at the end of april from 133 percent a year ago while 
industry leader general motors corp continued to lose market share 
the no 3 us automaker pushed up its share by keeping its 
prices the lowest among the big three company and offering the 
biggest rebates and incentives the world has ever known iacocca 
said 
the pricing strategies and continuing expenses from chryslers 
august acquisition of american motors corp have pushed down 
profits a united auto workers contract ratified last week will put 
further pressure on earnings 
in addition chrysler has increased spending on new product 
research and development by 25 percent or 150 million in 1988 
a necessary expense for updating its cars and trucks with new 
engines and transmissions in the 1990s 
chryslers immediate capital spending on new products and 
facilities will be about 28 billion in 1988 nearly even with 3 
billion in 1987 iacocca said 
iacocca predicted chrysler would earn more in the second quarter 
than the 1837 million it earned in the first quarter but would 
not do as well as analysts are projecting because of costs 
including continuing incentives 
i cant tell you how long it will be before we can do 
something to improve our profit margins that is without giving 
up any of the market share weve taken he said 
bennett bidwell president of product and marketing for chrysler 
motors corp chryslers core automaking business said thursday 
chrysler is looking at increasing prices in 1989 to improve profits 
at some point in time you reach a point of diminishing 
returns selling cars and trucks by offering rebates on top of low 
prices bidwell said 
for example the dodge aries and plymouth reliant are chryslers 
bestselling cars but chrysler is selling them as part of its 
america series with a 6995 base price and more standard equipment 
than in previous years and including the cars in its rebate 
campaign 
that doesnt leave much on the table bidwell said chrysler 
will replace the kcar after 1989 with the dodge spirit and 
plymouth acclaim a bigger more modern version of the same car 
that goes on sale in january 
despite intense conflict between chrysler and its 66000 uaw 
workers in the months before and during negotiations on the new 
twoyear contract only a handful of uaw representatives other than 
president owen bieber a member of chryslers board attended the 
meeting 
mike allen an official with uaw local 624 at chryslers new 
process gear plant in syracuse was assured by iacocca chrysler 
does not plan to sell any of its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
plants beyond the four already announced three in the detroit 
area and one in van wert ohio 
chrysler wound up in early contract negotiations with the uaw 
because it entertained a 2 billion offer for acustar which 
includes the syracuse plant chrysler turned down the offer after 
workers threatened to cripple the company with plantbyplant 
strikes 
iacocca said chrysler had underestimated how strongly our 
employees felt about remaining part of this chrysler family

supply rose in early may the federal reserve board reported 
thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 cracked the 3 trillion 
mark rising 33 billion to a seasonally adjusted 30009 billion 
in the week ended may 9 from 29976 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased 45 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 37737 billion from 37692 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell 72 billion

in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is

difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures

percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 37465 billion up 81 percent while m1

has not set a specific target range for m1 since early 1987

wheat futures prices bounded higher thursday amid increasing 
fears that disease and drought could significantly reduce yields 
from the rapidly maturing winter wheat crop 
other grain futures also moved higher on the chicago board of 
trade and soybean futures finished mixed 
on other markets cattle futures were sharply lower while pork 
futures were mixed precious metals were mixed energy futures and 
stockindex futures advanced 
with the winter wheat crop in need of a good soaking to finish 
off the maturation process before harvest wheat traders were 
worried that a continuation of the recent dry weather could do 
enough damage to cut yields analysts said 
weekend weather forecasts were mixed and the national weather 
service called for normal to belownormal rainfall across the 
country for the first half of next week 
in addition to weather problems reports have surfaced of 
disease damage to wheat in kansas and nebraska said walter spilka 
an analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
although most of the wheat crop has been reported in good 
condition concerns about potential damage have become strong 
enough that the wheat market is beginning to take on a life of 
its own instead of following the corn and soybean trends spilka 
said 
indeed corn and soybean prices also ran up sharply early in the 
day but retreated on profittaking after grain contracts for may 
delivery expired at noon wheat prices remained firm right through 
the close 
the wheat is in the heading stage when it normally does need 
a good rain to finish off the crop and ensure good yields spilka 
said so the wheat may be trading on some dryness of its own 
wheat settled 8 cents to 11 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 342 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents 
higher with july at 216 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents 
higher with july at 172 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower 
to 1 cents higher with july at 768 a bushel 
the early runup in grain prices had a strong negative impact on 
cattle futures on the chicago mercantile exchange 
higher grain prices would mean higher feed prices and narrower 
profit margins for cattle producers which could ultimately lead to 
higher beef prices and a corresponding drop in demand for beef 
analysts said 
the threat of higher feed costs in the future and the 
potential for tighter supplies of feed grains certainly threw 
some indecision into the live cattle futures said dale 
durchholz market analyst for agrivisor services inc in 
bloomington ill 
in addition hot weather is drying up the western ranges which 
could force early sales of cattle to feedlots and boost supplies of 
marketready animals durchholz said 
the weakness in the cattle futures carried over into the 
neighboring pork pits but expectations of a seasonal drop in hog 
supplies limited losses and helped hog futures close on a mixed 
note he said 
live cattle were 20 cent to 87 cent lower with june at 7312 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 62 cent to 123 cents lower with 
may at 8065 cents a pound hogs were 17 cent lower to 42 cent 
higher with june at 5367 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
20 cent to 80 cent lower with may at 5305 cents a pound 
the precious metals markets also were watching grain prices 
especially soybean prices which are considered a rough indicator 
of inflation analysts said 
gold futures on new yorks commodity exchange hit their highs 
early in the day then sold off as soybean prices fell said peter 
cardillo an analyst in new york with josephthal amp co 
the profittaking was more pronounced in the silver market 
where futures prices settled sharply lower following a strong rally 
on wednesday 
gold settled 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with june at 
45820 a troy ounce silver was 73 cents to 75 cents lower with 
may at 6612 a troy ounce 
energy futures edged higher in dull trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 34 cents 
higher with june at 1745 a barrel heating oil was 08 cent lower 
to 56 cent higher with june at 4763 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 07 cent to 25 cent higher with june at 5230 cents a 
gallon 
stockindex futures posted modest gains on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for june delivery of the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled 180 points higher at 25290

stocks barely broke a twoday losing streak 
thursday in a partial recovery that traders attributed to bargain 
shopping and slightly eased tension over inflation but the outlook 
on wall street remained bleak 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 5654 points 
on tuesday and wednesday and dropped another 25 points in early 
trading rebounded and finished up 763 points to 195872 broader 
market indices were mixed 
to a large degree the dow averages behavior echoed movements 
in the bond market which in turn echoed movements in the commodity 
research bureau index a key measure of inflation that tracks 
commodity futures prices in chicago 
the crb index rose sharply in the morning heightening inflation 
fears raising yields in the bond market and depressing stock 
prices as bonds became a more attractive alternative to stocks 
the crb index later retreated when soybean futures weakened 
easing bond yields and helping the stock market rise 
the funny thing is how the market is so tuned to inflation it 
turned on the commodity price index which was turned on and off on 
soybeans said lawrence wachtel a senior vice president at 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
this shows how graphically the stock market has become a 
commodity business wachtel said were subject to the vagaries 
of traders in the pits of chicago 
some traders said eased yields in the bond market was viewed as 
a reason by some investors to buy selected wellknown stocks that 
had fallen over the previous two sessions making them potential 
bargains 
but they said any more indications of higher inflation likely 
would weaken stocks again one possibly destabilizing figure was 
the labor departments consumer price index for april to be 
released friday morning 
the market is fragile enough to react very negatively to 
almost any figure said joseph barthel strategist for the 
investment firm butcher amp singer inc the market is seeing the 
bogeyman when it comes to inflation 
others said they saw little reason to be optimistic about the 
market which has been ignoring signs of economic health that defy 
the dire predictions issued after the crash seven months ago 
what were seeing now are apathetic investors who are using 
economic news to get out of stock market said peter dapuzzo 
manager of retail equities at shearson lehman hutton inc the 
whole thing now is negative psychology

nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
843 down 640 up and 496 unchanged nyse volume totaled 16516 
million shares down from 20942 million shares in the previous

federal reserve board to reconsider the conditional approval of 
bank of new york cos hostile takeover bid in light of a proxy 
vote that retained irvings board of directors 
irving is backing a merger with the staterun banca commerciale 
italiana spa italys second largest bank 
in a letter to the fed irving said the bank of new york should 
be required to file a new application for approval due to changes 
it proposed for the takeover bid

raise the stock portion of its bid to 1675 bank of new york shares 
from 1575 shares adding 320 per share to the deal and pushing 
its value to around 12 billion 
the offer which includes 15 in cash would be amended only if 
irving agreed to a negotiated merger 
in addition irving said bank of new yorks subsequent threat 
to buy the irving shares tendered to it if negotiations failed and 
operate the bank as a subsidiary were not in keeping with the 
approval by regulators in february 
bank of new york said tuesday it would buy the shares provided 
at least twothirds of irvings 185 million outstanding stock were 
tendered but it also said it would run irving separately to avoid 
activating the companys poison pill takeover defense 
irving contends the fed did not approve a proposal by bny to 
acquire a majority of ibcs shares in the absence of a feasible 
plan for a prompt secondstep merger of the two institutions 
in a response the fed asked the bank of new york to reply to 
the issues irving raised 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said we consider the 
questions posed by the fed to be exactly what we expected 
banca commerciale is offering 75 a share for 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent of the stock outstanding for a total 
of about 707 million the bid is part of a complex restructuring 
plan that would include asset sales costcutting measures and a 
10ashare special cash dividend
