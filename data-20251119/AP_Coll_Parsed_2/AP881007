the senate on friday beat back a series of 
unrelated amendments to a catchall tax bill including one designed 
to benefit 2 million owners of home satellite dishes 
but consideration of such proposals delayed until next week 
final action on the tax bill which includes a bill of rights 
for taxpayers involved in disputes with the internal revenue 
service and special relief worth 27 billion over three years for 
various groups including farmers artists and firsttime 
homebuyers 
by nightfall an angry majority leader sen robert c byrd 
dwva counted more than 100 proposed amendments still awaiting 
action and coaxed the senate into cutting off any more 
this list is crazy nuts and getting crazier all the time 
byrd said we ought to settle down and get our senses 
within two hours byrd announced senators had agreed to drop all 
but 29 
republican leader bob dole of kansas sided with byrd noting 
amendments dealing with everything but taxes including sanctions 
against iraq aid to the nicaragua rebels and a move to halt 
commercial development of the historic manassas battlefield in 
virginia 
this is the typical tax bill dole said everybody cleans 
out their desks and their trash cans and says well put it on the 
tax bill weve reached the point that if somebody doesnt take 
the bull by the horns well never finish 
on the manassas battlefield issue the senate voted 5025 to 
approve an amendment by sen dale bumpers dark requiring the 
federal government to seize 540 acres of land to prevent further 
development on the site about 30 miles west of washington the 
house has approved the same provision but the interior secretary 
has said he will recommend that president reagan veto it 
in siding with bumpers the senate defeated a plan by sen john 
warner rva to authorize the taking of only 80 acres and allow 
development of housing on adjacent areas 
the tax bills main purpose is to correct errors in the big tax 
overhaul enacted in 1986 but since this is the only tax bill with 
a chance of becoming law this year senators view it as the last 
opportunity to have their pet amendments considered 
but there is no assurance it will become law the version 
approved by the house is considerably different and there is some 
doubt that the house and senate can negotiate a compromise before 
quitting next week 
in a long day of debate over the bill the senate considered and 
rejected amendments calling for 
an end to what sen albert gore jr dtenn called 
discrimination against owners of home satellite dishes by 
television programmers his amendment was aimed at helping the 2 
million dish owners most of them living in rural areas whose 
television and satellite dish have become prime sources of contact 
with the outside world 
gores amendment would have required that programs provided to 
cable systems be made available to dish owners and ordered the 
federal communications commission to extend network programming 
into isolated areas that cannot receive broadcast signals 
opponents led by sen daniel inouye dhawaii said the 
amendment was unnecessary that there are no unfair trade 
practices in pricing and distribution of satellite programming 
managers of the bill said gores amendment had no chances of 
becoming law as part of the tax legislation 
an 18month study of whether government workers should get 
equal pay for jobs of comparable worth sen daniel evans rwash 
proposed the study and was opposed vigorously by conservatives who 
said it would lead to new federal requirements for what any worker 
could be paid evans called the dissent blind opposition to 
knowledge 
a symbolic endorsement of the right of the district of columbia 
to finance abortions for poor women 
raising from 17 a month to 38 the maximum taxfree 
masstransit benefits that an employer could furnish workers sen 
alfonse damato rny offered the amendment in the name of 
fairness saying the government already provides a much higher 
subsidy for corporate executives to park their limousines he would 
have paid for the change by doubling to a maximum of 7700 the 
tax imposed on gasguzzling cars most of them luxury imports

giorgio armani has done it again 
no matter how much you steel yourself against the charm of the 
designer and his staff or shut your eyes to the sumptuous 
surroundings of his dowtown milan palazzo and blot out the beauty 
of past collections it is to no avail the clothes speak for 
themselves and confirm that giorgio armani is the leader of the 
milan runway 
ravishing exclaimed kal ruttenstein fashion director at 
bloomingdales after wednesday nights show which took the fashion 
crowd by surprise with evening wear that excelled the daytime 
clothes usually the armani forte 
breathtaking sighed elin saltzman of saks fifth avenue as 
she kissed a satisfied armani backstage 
but a comment by janie samet fashion editor of the french daily 
le figaro was worth a thousand adjectives il est le seul he 
is the only one she pronounced implying that only he in the 
school of italian ready to wear could pose a threat to french 
fashion 
usually armani is a step ahead of the pack showing the 
direction fashion will take the following season he was the first 
to present androgynous women and one of the earliest to send short 
skirts and lingerie tops down the runway 
this season he preferred to flow with the tide presenting a 
quiet calm springsummer 1989 collection with delicate ethnic 
touches and a romantic maiden air inspired by the avantgarde 
minimal designer romeo gigli 
it is the softness of the fabrics more than the cut of the 
clothes that give the collection its ethereal mood even armanis 
daytime suits with his new jacket rounded at the shoulder and hem 
and curved gently at the waist worn over a long slim skirt or 
wide pants are stitched in such airy tweeds they could float down 
the runway all on their own 
the blouse always a strong point at armani becomes so light 
that at times it looks like a chiffon scarf tied around the midrift 
fabrics are either checked or striped or printed in floral and 
geometric patterns his evening wear is adorned in exquisite gold 
and silver embroidery and beading reminiscent of indian fabrics 
to emphasize the softness of his collection armani takes the 
edge out of the hemline leaving it unevenly stitched and 
unironed as if it had been tucked up in a hurry this 
doityourself look spells grim days ahead for seamstresses and 
private maids 
as the day goes on fabrics get lighter and sheerer a series of 
cocktail suits were in liberty and china porcelain prints with 
matching stockings then came the negligee gowns or elongated 
slips in simple navy satin worn over a chiffon fringed shawl 
embroidery started out slowly as piping on an otherwise simple 
gown or tuxedo suit to cover increasingly large areas of cloth 
until it became the entire dress 
thus a youthful strapless gown was made up entirely of chiffon 
flowers bunched together to look like an old english porcelain 
bouquet and long skirts pants and even shorts with matching tops 
were lavished with gold and silver threading and beaded 
craftsmanship the latter was a throwback to the ornate indian 
embroidery popular in the 1960s as confirmed by the indian evening 
bags which completed the look 
when they were not dazzling with jewels his evening gowns were 
ophelia like in wispy chiffon with a crisscross bodice and long 
skirt with a dainty underskirt peering through 
chiffon in ombre pastel shades and creamy pinks was also used 
for pants and skirts alike to go with richly embroidered evening 
jackets 
to make sure the look remained innocent armani the 
perfectionist showed the flatest heels of the week more slippers 
than shoes closed in the front but strapped at the back they 
usually were made out of fabric 
armani who tried the boudoir look several years ago but didnt 
seem to like it shied away from the barebreasted nude look which 
has been the shock item on the runway this week except for a 
single black chiffon gown in which white embroidered piping served 
a double purpose it concealed bare breasts while at the same time 
it framed a bare midrift right down to the navel 
the armani price tag for the springsummer 1989 is not 
outrageous just expensive a jeweled jacket costs approximately 
3000 to 3500 depending on how elaborate is the embroidery 
while an entirely embroidered outfit can run as high as 7ooo the 
dilemma is do you buy a new car or do you dress armani and walk

its been 31 years since dem bums became 
beach bums since walter omalley moved the brooklyn dodgers to los 
angeles 
the wounds have yet to heal 
today the dodgers return to shea stadium not ebbets field 
to play the new york mets for the national league pennant but to 
many brooklynites this homecoming to the borough of queens will be 
happy only if the dodgers go down in defeat 
the old brooklyn dodgers were a very special team in a very 
special time in a very special place the los angeles dodgers are 
not really the dodgers said brooklynite frances macrillo 
they dont look like the dodgers they dont sound like the 
dodgers she continued its very easy to root for the mets 
ms macrillos cheers are echoed by the many brooklyn fans who 
swore off the dodgers on oct 23 1957 when omalley moved the 
team of jackie robinson pee wee reese and duke snider closer to 
catalina than coney island 
boxing publicist irving rudd describes dodgeritis as a 
boroughwide lethargy brought on by the shift state sen thomas 
bartosiewicz spent years trying to get support for an ebbets 
dome and a new team new york post columnist pete hamill writes 
of his vow to never forgive never forget the late omalley 
they abandoned us they left us i feel no compunction to root 
for the dodgers said marty adler founder of the brooklyn 
dodgers hall of fame when they left us i was angry when 
they left they took the soul the soul left brooklyn 
ebbets field home of brooklyns beloved bums was razed in 
1960 as far as many younger fans know the dodgers have always 
played in californias chavez ravine 
i think a lot of this is passe now and over with said new 
york knicks public relations man dennis dagostino a diehard mets 
fan who wrote a book about the teams history i dont read as 
much into this as other people do 
if you were 15 when the dodgers left youre 46 now what do 
you remember about the dodgers theyve been gone 31 years the 
mets have been playing for 26 years 
try telling that to hamill who welcomed the dodgers to the 
playoffs with a vitriolic column in which omalleys name was 
preceded each time with an epithet 
some wounds never heal wrote hamill who broke a 
threedecade boycott of dodgers home games this week to root for 
the mets who by the way have eight native californians on the 
roster 
i go to the enemy camp dodgers stadium that is as a 
hostile witness he wrote and the vow still holds never 
forgive never ever forget

three pesticideladen helicopters took off on 
an aerial spraying mission thursday night to fight the medfly 
infestation that has set up a base in beverly hills and the citys 
toney west side 
theyre currently over beverly hills said tom kenney a 
federal aviation administration controller at santa monica airport 
where the choppers departed from shortly after 8 pm 
the spraying program is the first step in an allout attack 
against the mediterranean fruit fly a pest that destroys about 250 
varieties of produce 
the national weather service again forecast coastal fog for the 
area thursday night but officials moved the starting time up 2 
hours to 8 pm hoping to beat the rolling fog bank 
the spraying was ordered because 47 medflies were found in yards 
since sept 26 a serious infestation that if allowed to spread 
would threaten fruits and vegetables that are a major part of 
californias 155 billionayear farm economy 
the thursday flight was set for a 35squaremile area of 100000 
residents that includes middleclass stucco homes mansions swank 
rodeo drive shops and luxury car dealerships all subject to the 
honeylike stickiness of the malathion spray 
along with parts of beverly hills officials are spraying 
sections of western los angeles and the adjacent cities of culver 
city and west hollywood 
at martin cadillac on the corner of olympic boulevard and bundy 
drive in west los angeles a caravan of about 100 shiny caddies 
left the sales lot wednesday night for an underground parking lot 
at a bank building six blocks away sales manager steve mitchell 
said thursday 
he said several of the cars were returned to the sales lot 
thursday morning for potential tirekickers with the luxury car 
exodus to be repeated at nightfall 
the pesticide poses no health risks health officials say but 
the sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the malathion could mess up a 
cars paint job museums in the area covered their outdoor statues 
agricultural commissioner leon spaugy said the fight to save the 
states farm industry knows no economic boundaries 
were encouraging people to cover up their rolls royces just 
like they would cover up their pintos he said on wednesday

mark twain once said there were three types of 
lies lies damned lies and statistics republicans and democrats 
are arguing about all three in the aftermath of the dan 
quaylelloyd bentsen debate 
each side accused the other vice presidential hopeful of playing 
fast and loose with the facts in wednesday nights encounter 
a republican truth squad put out a sixpage analysis of 
bentsen distortions and errors on thursday while democrats 
confined themselves to five pages on dan quayles factual 
mistakes 
in less polite parlance that means lies on such subjects as 
social security poverty and just how well quayle knows european 
leaders 
here is a look at some of the points in dispute 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
quayle said poverty hasnt gone up in this administration it 
hasnt gone down much either the census bureau says that in 
1980 13 percent of the us population or 293 million people 
were living in poverty the rate rose to 14 percent or 318 
million people in 1981 reagans first year in office peaked at 
152 percent or 353 million in 1983 then gradually dropped back 
to 135 percent or 325 million in 1987 the latest year 
available 
measured since 1980 the poverty rate is up by onehalf 
percentage point measured since 1981 it is down by that much in 
either case the actual number of poor people is up since the 
population has grown 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when bentsen charged that quayle voted eight times to cut the 
benefits on social security the republican fired back you 
know that i did not vote to cut social security benefits eight 
times what i have voted for and what senator bentsen has voted for 
is to delay the costofliving adjustments he said bentsen too 
had twice voted for freezes and that michael dukakis took a 
similar position at a governors conference 
mark gearan a dukakis spokesman did not dispute those votes 
but said quayle doesnt understand that freezing or delaying the 
cola cuts benefits the bottom line is smaller checks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bentsen asked about being the senates biggest recipient of 
political action committee money 15 million for his senate 
reelection campaign said i dont find it embarrassing at 
all he said his 10000aplace breakfast club for lobbyists 
was a real doozy of a mistake but perfectly legal and you 
have all kinds of such clubs on the hill 
but bentsens 10000aseat club was considered unusual 
although other congressional leaders do arrange regular briefings 
and entrees for favored donors 
bentsen who accepts no speaking fees charged that quayle has 
collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now 
speaking to various interest groups 
quayles camp said he donated almost 20000 of his honoraria to 
charity in 1986 and 14302 in 1987 senate rules prohibit senators 
from keeping speech fees above 30 percent of their salary

quayle apparently mixed up his cfcs and co2 when he praised 
reagan administration efforts to grapple with the ozone problem 
for the first time we are talking about the impact of c02 to the 
ozone layer he said 
but co2 carbon dioxide does not deplete the ozone layer 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs do carbon dioxide does add to the 
global warming phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect 
another environmental problem

after quayle said dukakis did virtually nothing to clean up 
boston harbor the dirtiest waterway in america bentsen 
charged that a reagan veto of a clean water bill had made it 
impossible to move ahead at that time on boston harbor 
but dukakis dragged his feet on the cleanup back in 1978 the 
final year of his first term as governor when he prepared an 
application to the environmental protection agency seeking a waiver 
from the 1972 clean water act requiring secondary treatment of 
sewage being pumped into the harbor 
his successor completed the application in 1979 by the time the 
epa rejected it in may 1983 dukakis was governor again under 
court pressure dukakis and the state legislature created a public 
authority to undertake the 6 billion cleanup without the 75 
percent federal funding available in the 1970s

quayle said ive been to geneva many times to meet with our 
negotiators as we are hammering out the inf treaty ive met with 
the western political leaders margaret thatcher chancellor kohl 
i know them they know me 
according to a visitors log kept by us officials in geneva 
quayle made only one visit to the swiss city during the nearly four 
years the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty was under 
negotiation that was in february 1987 
he also visited geneva last feb 78 and met again with us 
arms control negotiators but that was two months after the treaty 
was signed 
jeff nesbitt a quayle spokesman said he believed the senator 
met helmut kohl when the west german chancellor stopped by a dinner 
quayle had with kohls chief of staff at a conference of nato 
leaders in munich a year or so ago 
nesbitt said he knew of at least one meeting with thatcher last 
july when the british prime minister attended a dinner with 
senators on a visit to washington

elevating the veterans administration to full 
cabinet status will involve only changing a few signs outside the 
building proponents said after the house voted overwhelming 
support of the change 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss said the cost of the change 
approved thursday by the house will come to less than 1 million in 
1989 and will give the nations 27 million veterans direct access 
to the white house 
the congressional budget office has estimated that converting 
the va into a cabinet department would cost 33 million over five 
years 
the house vote sent the compromise bill making the va the 
governments 14th cabinet department to the senate which was 
expected to add its approval president reagan backs the move and 
it was his public announcement of support last summer that gave 
impetus to the legislation 
house approval came on a voice vote overriding objections from 
opponents who called the move an act of electionyear pandering 
that will result in increased future costs for veterans programs 
this is an act of great hypocrisy said rep john porter 
rill who said he had heard numerous colleagues complain 
privately that the legislation should not be adopted 
why does congress do things like that we do it because of 
special interests porter said members are in craven fear of 
retribution at the polls i think the american people are looking 
to have people of courage to govern them you cant serve every 
special interest in our country without ever adding up the bottom 
line 
the new department of veterans affairs which would go into 
effect in march would represent the fifth new cabinet department 
since 1960 opponents pointed out the irony of it receiving support 
from reagan who began his presidency promising to eliminate two 
cabinet departments education and energy an idea he later 
abandoned 
the veterans administration according to supporters of the 
legislation already has the fifthlargest budget among federal 
agencies and merits being put on par with other cabinet departments 
to ensure that the money is properly administered 
this says to the millions of men and women whove worn the 
uniform of our armed forces that we care said rep frank horton 
rny he said placing a veterans advocate at the table with the 
president and other cabinet members will give greater voice to 
their needs 
a primary sponsor of the measure rep gerald solomon rny 
noted that the va hospital system is suffering from a 600 million 
budget shortfall and that cabinet status would help it make the 
case for full financing 
this will go a long way toward guaranteeing that the veterans 
of the future are going to be taken care of solomon said 
according to the house veterans affairs committee the va 
serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors 
with a budget of 30 billion it will dispense 14 billion in 
income maintenance and 626 million for education and 
rehabilitation assistance this year 
the agency and its 240000 employees administered 90000 patient 
beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients 
this year it runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300000 
veterans this year

congress is moving to slap controls on medical 
waste from the vials of aidsinfected blood washing up on atlantic 
coast beaches to the used hypodermic needles picked out of trash 
bins by children in the midwest 
the vehicle to attack the growing problem of carelessly 
discarded medical waste is a bill that would require a sofar 
reluctant environmental protection agency to set up a system to 
track the waste from creation to disposal 
the legislation given impetus by this summers publicized cases 
of infectious materials littering ocean and great lakes shorelines 
was passed by the house on thursday by a 39028 margin 
the senate has approved a more limited control blueprint 
lawmakers in both chambers say they see no difficulty working out a 
joint product that can be sent to president reagan before congress 
adjourns next week 
rep thomas luken dohio says action is needed because the 
illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an epidemic 
across the country this waste is not just repulsive it can 
literally kill people 
according to recent federal studies as many as 18000 people 
each year may contract hepatitis b from accidental contact with 
medical waste he told the house hundreds of those infected 
will ultimately die from the infection 
the house plan would cover waste produced by hospitals clinics 
and labs in new jersey connecticut and the great lakes states of 
new york pennsylvania ohio indiana illinois michigan 
wisconsin and minnesota 
the program however could become national in scope because any 
other state could decide to have its waste covered by the plan and 
gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting the 
tracking systems requirements 
this is a national problem said rep ron wyden dore 
the medical waste system in this country is broken it is 
overloaded and in effect it is starting to regurgitate what it 
cannot keep down 
expected to form the basis for the final bill the house plan 
would apply to 10 types of medical waste including blood 
hypodermic needles scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that 
has been in contact with infectious agents 
the enumerated items would have to be segregated from other 
medical waste the tracking system would have to contain assurances 
that a generator knows the waste reached a disposal facility 
the legislation does not however set any standards for actual 
disposal such as burning or using a hazardous waste landfill 
supporters said there was no time this year to work out these 
details they add however that it already is illegal to dump such 
waste into waterways 
violators of the tracking requirements could be slapped with a 
civil fine of up to 25000 for each day of violation and a maximum 
criminal penalty of two years in prison and a fine of up to 50000 
per day of violation 
luken said the medical waste problem goes beyond the beach 
foulings that closed stretches of oceanfront in new york and new 
jersey the past two summers 
last year careless doctors in youngstown ohio and 
indianapolis put contaminated needles and vials of infected blood 
into dumpsters he said kids found the needles and blood vials 
and played doctor with them splattering blood on each other and 
giving each other injections that could have proved fatal 
house members said they believe epa already has the authority to 
act against medical trash under various hazardous waste control 
laws 
in 1978 the agency announced plans to regulate medical waste 
but six years later it said lacked evidence those wastes were 
causing enough harm to justify regulations 
instead epa released a package of advice to hospitals on 
handling and disposal since then epa has formed a task force to 
rethink the issue 
epa has dragged its feet on this matter wyden said epa 
told us that as of this summer they had budgeted exactly one staff 
position to deal with the medical waste issue that is why we need 
this legislation

a new recipe has been developed for fortifying 
mothers milk to help premature babies barely bigger than a mans 
hand survive and grow normally the agriculture department said 
the immune properties found in mothers milk are so much more 
important to preterm infants because they are subject to many more 
infections than fullterm infants said dr richard j schanler 
physician in charge of the project at the childrens nutrition 
research center at houston 
but extremely premature babies some of them weighing less than 
two pounds at birth require more concentrated nutrients than 
mothers milk provides he said 
most currently get a preemie formula based on cows milk until 
they reach about three pounds and are growing well after that 
some may be switched to mothers milk mixed with a commercial 
fortifier 
concern about the practice of feeding the formulas to the tiny 
infants during their first month of life prompted schanler and a 
former colleague dr cutberto garza now at cornell university to 
look into ways of using breast milk from birth 
their research at the center which is based at baylor college 
of medicine and is funded by usdas agricultural research service 
included tests of commercial formulas and new recipe possibilities 
the work was described in a report issued thursday by the agency 
schanler said the new recipe includes mineral salts that are 
readily absorbed by the infants and protein and energy from 
powdered skim mothers milk supplied by the centers own human milk 
bank 
although the recipe is being used for research purposes 
schanler said he doubts whether it will be feasible to produce a 
commercial fortifier made from human milk noting that there arent 
many human milk banks for this purpose 
but he said the findings from the recipe research should lead to 
better fortifiers so that very lowbirthweight infants can have 
the infection fighting factors present in breast milk when they 
most need it right after birth 
the milk would still have to be taken from the mother with a 
breast pump fortified with the forumla and fed to the baby through 
a tube 
the initial concern has been to get enough protein and energy 
into the tiny babies and we didnt pay much attention to 
minerals schanler said 
calcium and phosphorous were the main problem a lack of which 
could compromise growth impair healing of chronic lung disease 
and lead to bone malformations schanler said 
the scientists came close to matching the inthewomb 
retention levels of these minerals by adding calcium lactate and 
sodium or potassium phosphate to mothers milk 
infants averaging only 22 pounds at birth retained 86 percent 
of the calcium and 80 percent of the phosphorous they would have 
retained if still in their mothers uterus and are the best rates 
we have seen schanler said 
according to garza who now directs nutritional sciences at 
cornell the governments food and drug administration requires 
formula companies to add a minimum amount of calcium without 
sufficient regard to its form 
thats not enough for these tiny infants garza said you 
need to look at the form as well as the amount 
for example garza said the calcium salt added to commercial 
formulas is tribasic calcium phosphate which is not very soluble 
its like rock he said most of it probably doesnt get 
absorbed into the infants system but comes out in the stool 
calcium lactate is much better utilized 
although the scientists recognize that human milk has less 
calcium and phosphorous than both regular and preemie formulas 
they say the minerals are in a form more easily absorbed by the 
infants also human milk may have unknown factors that enhance 
infants absorption and retention 
formula companies have not been able to duplicate these 
conditions in commercial preparations and compensate by increasing 
the concentration of minerals the report said 
another former colleague dr steven a abrams a physician now 
at the national institutes of health said the higher 
concentrations of minerals in commercial formulas may benefit the 
very lowbirthweight infants after they leave the hospital 
after discharge the mothers either chose to continue on 
unfortified breast milk or switch to regular infant formula 
abrams who tracked the infants for a year found that the 
breastfed babies had a lower bone mineral content than those who 
got commerical formulas 
but they grew equally well on either he said body weight 
length and head measurements were the same for both groups 
abrams recommended that pediatricians regularly evaluate the 
mineral status of nursing preemies but he added that the risks 
do not outweigh the benefits of breast feeding

psychologists who studied the downing of an 
iranian civilian airliner in the persian gulf say the military 
needs to better understand stress and should spend more on 
psychological research and improve its crew training 
the judgment of the navy cruiser crew that mistakenly shot down 
the iranian plane july 3 was clouded by misconceptions caused by 
stress the psychologists said 
there is much knowledge about how decisions go wrong and how 
they can be improved that is not being put to use in military 
decisionmaking dr paul slovic a psychology professor from the 
university of oregon told a house panel thursday 
dr steven zornetzer representing the navys office of naval 
research responded that the service does try to consider stress 
and is spending 12 million a year on basic research into 
psychological questions another 18 million is being spent to 
apply the results of that research to navy programs 
while progess is being made he said it must be clearly 
recognized that these research problems are among the most 
difficult and complex in the entire research spectrum 
the hearing by the house armed services policy subcommittee was 
part of the panels examination of the destruction of iran air 
flight 655 that killed all 290 people on board it was shot down by 
the cruiser vincennes in the mistaken belief that the commercial 
jetliner was a military plane diving toward the vincennes 
a navy investigation attributed the incident to stressrelated 
mistakes made by the crew of the aegisclass cruiser one of the 
navys most sophisticated warships 
the navy said crew members under battlecaused stress after 
just finishing a firefight with iranian gunboats misread or 
misinterpreted a variety of electronic data from the aegis 
computers 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the panel said 
misinterpretations of data provided by the aegis weapon system 
and chaotic communications in the command center have pointed up 
troubles with mans ability to make fast accurate decisions in 
combat 
dr richard nisbett a psychology professor at the university of 
michigan noted that the vincennes crew was on alert for an attack 
by iranian planes the crew members interpreted the data to see 
what they expected to see he said 
expectations can color what people think they see and what 
they remember to a far greater degree than is recognized by common 
sense nisbett said 
magicians and card sharks have long made a living on this 
principle and in the last 30 years or so psychologists have 
learned a great deal about the scope of the principle in daily life 
events he said 
nisbett also noted the example of the uss stark which was hit 
by an iraqi missile in may 1987 killing 37 seamen top officers on 
the stark were disciplined for not firing their weapons against the 
iraqi plane and navy ships in the region were on a high state of 
alert after that 
the vincennes crew wanted to avoid another incident like that 
involving the stark nisbett said 
dr richard helmreich a psychology professor at the university 
of texas said the vincennes crew members didnt communicate among 
themselves well enough 
the communications problems evident in the vincennes incident 
closely parallel those uncovered in analyses of the causes of 
crashes in civilian and military air transport he said 
dr richard w pew said another risk arises from the highly 
automated computerized nature of modern warships like the 
vincennes 
research is badly needed to understand when and just how much 
automation to introduce in situations where the ultimate control 
and responsibility must rest with the human operators he said

a man claiming he had been the subject of 
government mind control experiments disrupted an appearance by 
president reagan before a republican fundraising dinner friday 
night 
the man made a long and rambling argument that he had been 
mistreated while guests at the 1000aplate event attempted to 
drown him out with applause the disruption occurred just after 
reagan concluded his address to the crowd 
reagan standing just behind the lectern hed used for his 
speech seemed puzzled as he strained to hear the man 
secret service agents on the scene made no attempt to approach 
the man who identified himself as william mcknight 58 of 
inkster mich 
but after several moments of yelling toward reagan who was 
approximately 150 feet away on the podium the president 
interrupted him 
reagan went to the microphone and said that he was having 
difficulty hearing the man although he said the protester seemed 
to feel strongly about what he was saying 
but the president showing increasing impatience and anger 
shouted that i dont think its fair to subject the people to all 
of this why dont you write it in a letter and send it to me 
the secret service had arrested the same man in 1985 when he 
tried to deliver papers about mind control to former president 
jimmy carter during a detroit appearance 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked later if reagan 
had felt endangered by the intruder said no not at all 
he just said who was that man and what did he want 
anyway fitzwater said paraphrasing the president 
secret service special agent bill corbett said late friday that 
mcknight was interviewed and released no charges were filed 
he was interviewed he made no threats against the president 
he meant no harm to him thats the main thing the secret service 
was interested in corbett said 
few incidents of this sort have plagued reagan in recent years 
as security surrounding him was tightened substantially following 
his shooting on march 30 1981 by john w hinckley jr hinckley 
remains confined to a mental hospital in washington 
after reagan told the man to be quiet the concluding part of 
the presidents portion of the program proceeded and he left 
without incident 
mcknight did not say how he had gotten into the event nor 
whether he had paid the 1000 fee but pressed on that he said 
i just walked in 
the man stood apart from the dinner tables in an area not far 
from the president occupied by a pool of reporters admitted to 
cover reagans speech 
it was apparent that secret service agents determined the man 
was not presenting any physical threat to reagan and therefore no 
attempt was made to rush him 
i was quiet and let him speak i was quiet and stood here 
mcknight told reporters 
during his tirade mcknight had asked why dont you take the 
mind control machine off of me reagan 
why dont you use it on the communists thats here in america 
and why dont you get rid of communism in america he said 
several boos emanated from the wellheeled crowd of republican 
donors many of whom were heard shouting get out and shut up 
mcknight was arrested on april 24 1985 when he tried to 
deliver to carter a threepage typewritten document saying he was 
the victim of a us government mindcontrol device 
mcknight who listed an inkster mich address on the document 
said the device injured his eyesight and muscles and his ability to 
learn and to have sex 
two secret service agents knelt beside both sides of his chair 
after carter completed his speech mcknight resisted the agents and 
was taken to the rear of the room with his arm behind his back 
mcknight told reporters friday night that he was treated for 
three weeks at a state psychiatric hospital in northville mich 
following the carter incident he produced a photocopy of what 
appeared to be a report from a northville staffer who said 
mcknight rambled about the mindcontrol device 
a woman who answered the telephone friday night at the 
northville hospital said state law prevented her from giving any 
information about current or former patients she hung up without 
giving her name 
there were two mcknights listed in the inkster telephone 
directory lula belle mcknight said neither she nor her daughter 
were related to william mcknight

the nations top business leaders today 
offered an optimistic view of economic prospects predicting growth 
will slow enough next year to avoid a severe acceleration of 
inflation 
the business council composed of 62 chief executives of the 
countrys largest corporations predicted that the economy as 
measured by the gross national product will grow 4 percent in 
1988 the best in four years 
we are living in a continued strong economy said john s 
reed chairman of citicorp the nations largest bank we are 
very close to full employment and the inflation numbers are 
generally felt to be in pretty good shape 
the new gnp prediction reflecting the consensus of the chief 
economists of about 20 member corporations is 16 percentage 
points better than the prediction last may when the executives last 
gathered for their semiannual retreat at this resort town in the 
mountains of western virginia 
some economists in the spring still were worried about lingering 
aftershocks from the stock market crash of october 1987 growth 
proved to be stronger than nearly anyone anticipated and now the 
concern is that it is too vigorous and likely to fuel inflation 
but the business councils economists are projecting gnp growth 
of 25 percent next year and less than 2 percent in 1990 in line 
with what the federal reserve board considers necessary for a 
soft landing of the economy to a sustainable noninflationary 
expansion the economists were expecting more inflation an 
increase from a 42 percent rate this year to 51 percent next 
year but no one expected a return to the high inflation rates of 
the late 1970s and early 1980s their report said 
they also foresaw a modest rise in interest rates next year 
followed by some easing in 1990 the rate on 30year treasury 
bonds which tend to run about 15 percentage points below 
fixedrate mortgages should increase from an average of 91 
percent this year peak at 102 percent over the next 18 months and 
average 95 percent in 1990 the council said 
the business executives were troubled however about the 
prospects for reducing the federal budget deficit to meet the 
targets of the grammrudman law and for shrinking the trade deficit 
without a further decline in the value of the dollar 
the business community generally remains very concerned about 
the twin deficits and of what we are afraid and convinced will be 
the undesirable price well pay for it if we dont solve it said 
edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc the health care 
company 
the economic panel saw only negligible improvement through 1990 
from the current budget gap of about 150 billion the grammrudman 
law however calls for a deficit of 136 billion in 1989 and 100 
billion in 1990 
the trade deficit is expected to shrink from 170 billion in 
1987 to 134 billion this year and to below 100 billion by 1990 
but the business executives said the dollar which fell steadily 
through 1986 and 1987 before beginning to rebound this year will 
have to start falling again a cheaper dollar makes us goods more 
affordable on overseas markets 
the economic panel predicted the dollar would be worth 120 
japanese yen and 168 german marks down from 134 yen and 188 
marks currently 
i think its unfortunate that the dollar firmed from the first 
of the year i think we were closer to the right range earlier in 
the year than we are today said willard c butcher chairman of 
chase manhattan bank 
the economic forecast was issued at the beginning of a twoday 
conference at which the executives will hear from speakers 
including albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers paul volcker former chairman of the federal reserve 
board secretary of commerce c william verity drew lewis and 
robert s strauss cochairmen of a blue ribbon commission studying 
the budget deficit and sen lawton chiles dfla and rep bill 
gray dpa chairmen of the congressional budget committees

the democraticcontrolled senate is eagerly 
lending its support to a plan already endorsed by vice president 
george bush that would help lower and middleincome families use 
us savings bonds to finance higher education 
the proposal would provide a tax exclusion for interest earned 
on a bond that is redeemed to pay for college or vocational 
education its sponsor sen edward m kennedy dmass said the 
plan is simple and riskfree giving children security in their 
future without creating a new bureaucracy or spending program 
even though it was recommended by president reagan in his 
budget endorsed by bush in his presidential campaign and passed by 
the senate on thursday on a 940 vote there is no assurance it 
will become law 
that is because the senate attached it to a catchall bill whose 
main purpose is to correct mistakes and clear up ambiguities in the 
farreaching tax overhaul package enacted in 1986 
the senate bill also includes a variety of special tax cuts 
costing about 27 billion over three years plus the tax increases 
to pay for them by comparison the version approved by the house 
has about 75 billion worth of tax cuts and increases 
the reagan administration opposes several parts of the house 
bill and house leaders are reluctant to give in to the senate on 
some of those provisions with congress pressing to adjourn next 
week for the year it may be difficult for house and senate 
negotiators to agree on a compromise 
senate leaders hoped to wrap up work on the bill today 
senators spent most of thursday debating an amendment that would 
have raised taxes on cigarettes liquor wine and beer to pay for 
part of a big antidrug bill the tax increase is likely to be 
considered again next week when the senate considers the drug 
legislation 
the amendment sponsored by sen warren rudman rnh was 
defeated on a 6033 vote a substitute by sen phil gramm rtexas 
that would have cut a handful of spending programs including 
legalservices aid and lowincome energy assistance to fight drug 
abuse failed 7222 
earlier the senate wasted little time approving kennedys 
amendment to help families pay for education the provision is not 
in the housepassed tax bill 
under the proposal which kennedy first introduced a year ago a 
family could avoid paying taxes on the interest earned on bonds 
that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational schooling the 
full exclusion would be available to families with incomes under 
60000 and would be reduced gradually as income rises 
disappearing for those whose earnings reach 80000 
present law allows the owner of a savings bond to avoid taxation 
on the interest earned until the bond is redeemed the interest is 
exempt from state and local taxes kennedys plan would simply turn 
the deferral into an exclusion if the bond is used for education 
michael dukakis the democratic presidential candidate has 
proposed a different method of helping finance higher education he 
would create a program under which students could borrow their 
tuition and repay it through payroll deductions after they graduate 
kennedy said his exclusion would not increase the federal budget 
deficit included in his amendment is a provision offsetting the 
costs of the benefit by eliminating in most cases the personal 
exemption now claimed by parents for a dependent who is 24 or older 
and a fulltime student 
the senate bill to which kennedys proposal was attached has 
dozens of special tax benefits for farmers and other offroad users 
of diesel fuel firsttime homebuyers corporate research efforts 
and workers who receive educational or legal assistance from 
employers 
the measure includes a bill of rights for taxpayers involved 
in disputes with the internal revenue service

to book unpopular movies in exchange for the right to show popular 
films

york accuses the company and an employee of violating the terms of 
a 1951 antitrust order in booking movies including the blockbuster 
aliens from 1984 to 1987 the alleged block bookings were 
made by leila j goldstein who managed foxs 
indianapolismilwaukee branch office the grand jury said 
fox a subsidiary of rupert murdochs news corp denied 
wrongdoing 
the action was brought under a consent decree settling a 
1930sera antitrust battle in which the government broke the big 
movie studios control of the nations theaters among the 
practices barred by the consent decree is block booking or 
requiring a theater to agree to show one or more movies often 
unpopular films in exchange for the right to show a successful 
movie

block booking in a 1951 consent decree the company signed that 
stemmed from the antitrust case according to an announcement by 
the us attorneys office in manhattan that was released in los 
angeles 
the indictment alleged that fox and ms goldstein improperly 
entered into distribution agreements with theater companies for 
several hit movies the announcement did not name the theater 
companies involved

two congresswomen say they will push for 
legislation next year to allow full medicare coverage for elderly 
women seeking mammography screenings the xray technique used to 
detect early signs of breast cancer 
we need to promote preventive medicine not just pay for care 
once an illness has set in rep barbara b kennelly a member of 
the house ways and means committee said thursday 
mrs kennelly said the medicare catastrophic coverage act 
enacted into law earlier this year included a 50 reimbursement 
provision for the mammograms 
a 50 mammogram is not readily available in the united 
states the congresswoman said the average cost for a 
mammogram ranges from 80 to 200 
mrs kennelly said the only place a woman can receive a 
mammogram for 50 is mobile van clinics 
most women especially older women simply will not submit to 
being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a 
shopping mall she said 
not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under 
the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable but 
doctors are more able to identify changes over time and are able 
to provide the analysis counseling and followup that are 
necessary to effectively care for patients she said 
a bill introduced by mrs kennelly would remove the 50 cap 
making medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for 
mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer 
the office of technology assessment has estimated that screening 
women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50 
percent after five years according to mrs kennelly 
breast cancer took the lives of 45000 women in 1987 of which 
28000 were over age 65 many of those lives could have been saved 
if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those 
women she told a capitol news conference 
the american cancer society recommends that women over 40 
undergo mammography screenings annually

farm lawmakers are turning political heat on 
agriculture department officials over a tobacco export program 
marked by abuses that have become the focus of a justice department 
investigation 
i think this is the worst disaster for an agriculture program 
that i have seen in my eight years in the congress rep charles 
rose dnc said thursday at a hearing of his house tobacco and 
peanuts subcommittee 
at the heart of the controversy is a program providing exporters 
with credit guarantees assuring they will get their money for 
american agricultural products they send overseas even if the 
foreign buyers fail to pay 
more than 30 million in such guarantees have been provided for 
tobacco shipments alone this year by usdas foreign agricultural 
service but farm lawmakers are upset by an array of abuses and 
other problems besetting the program 
the justice department is investigating allegations that 14 
companies obtained guarantees for exports by saying their shipments 
consisted entirely of american tobacco when they actually were a 
foreign and domestic blend 
lawmakers are irked by a foreign agriculture service policy that 
provides guarantees for exports of blended foreign and domestic 
tobacco although only for the american portion they say the 
program is supposed to help farmers by spurring exports and thus 
should be limited to 100 percent american shipments 
the foreign agricultural service also stands accused by 
lawmakers and congressional investigators of not finding fraud even 
when the service was warned specifically about it two years ago 
and rose on thursday clashed with service administrator thomas 
o kay saying his claim that guarantees always were provided for 
the american portion of blended shipments was the opposite of what 
he told the panel four months ago and at variance with 
investigative findings 
the question is a sore point with tobaccostate lawmakers who 
contend that a policy revision from kay last month opens the door 
to credit guarantees for blended shipments for the first time 
this is a coverup mr kay rose said 
i resent that kay replied 
i dont care if you resent it or not rose said you were 
covering up a fraudulent practice in the foreign agricultural 
service 
initial reports of blended shipments covered by guarantees 
emerged from iraq in 1986 bringing congressional demands for an 
investigation 
at the time the service dismissed the concern as unfounded 
followup by the inspector general however determined that tobacco 
exports consisting of blended foreign and domestic products had 
been covered by guarantees as if they were 100 percent american 
it makes my blood boil rep robin tallon dsc said 
kay said he was infuriated by the disclosures but added 
that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of exporters 
he said the iraqi report was put down to a rumor started by a rival 
exporter 
the chairman then called on witnesses from the inspector 
generals office and the general accounting office an 
investigative arm of congress who had testified earlier and were 
still among the spectators 
officials of the inspector generals office of the congressional 
general accounting office told the hearing that their investigation 
indicated guarantees were provided only for exports that were 100 
percent american they said they were told that the only exception 
was for a type of baby food that contained a small amount of oil 
not produced in the united states 
kay told the panel the baby food example indicated that the 
possibility existed that blended exports could receive credit 
guarantees

the rev jerry falwell plans a retirement 
village on his liberty mountain that will offer senior citizens 
everything but a graveyard 
no plans for a cemetery falwell quipped thursday as he 
unveiled blueprints for the 210 million liberty village which he 
hopes will house some 3000 residents on a site overlooking liberty 
university the christian school he founded 
falwell said he has already had numerous inquiries from people 
interested in paying entrance fees ranging from 59000 for a 
groundfloor studio apartment to 176000 for a threebedroom 
penthouse the residents also would pay an additional 850 to 
1600 per month as a service fee 
when they die or if they otherwise leave the apartments at 
least half of the entrance fee will go to their estate 
falwell said residents will probably be the same sort of elderly 
christians who watch his oldtime gospel hour program and make 
donations to his ministry although the development will be open to 
anyone over age 60 who can pay the entrance fee 
the venture which includes restaurants and stores will be 
funded and built by freedom liberty group inc of belleair bluffs 
fla a private developer 
the project will need city approval and falwell was careful 
thursday to indicate he was not planning to stage a repeat of any 
of his past feuding with lynchburg over taxes he refused to pay

yugoslavias complex cumbersome government structure and 
diversity of nationalities are major factors in its worsening 
ethnic and economic problems here is some background in 
questionandanswer form 
q how does the government work 
a yugoslavia is a federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces that are administrative parts of the largest 
republic serbia 
power rests in the league of communists or communist party 
each republic and province has its own party hierarchy for 
political leadership and its own government for administration 
each republic and autonomous province sends representatives to 
the federal party leadership headed by a 23member politburo and 
the nineman federal presidency 
leadership of those two bodies rotates annually only the 
premier of the federal government which is primarily responsible 
for overseeing the economy and national defense holds office for 
four years the premier can be removed by a majority vote of 
parliament 
q why is the system so complex 
a the 23 million yugoslavs include about 30 nationalities in 
an apparent attempt to prevent ethnic strife after his death 
president tito approved a 1974 constitution giving broad powers to 
each republic and province 
he decreed that all decisions on major political questions must 
be approved by the leaderships of all republics and provinces and 
national leadership posts would rotate annually to keep any 
republic from dominating 
q what happened after titos death in 1980 
a unanimity is so hard to achieve that federal decision are 
weak compromises and the largely staterun economy has 
deteriorated as a result the foreign debt is 21 billion 
unemployment 15 percent and the annual inflation rate 217 percent 
more than 1500 strikes were reported in 1987 
economic and political differences have grown between the rich 
northern region which looks to the west and the poorer more 
backward south 
q what is causing the current unrest 
a a mixture of ethnic strife economic crisis and an 
ineffective political system 
one fundamental element is the ethnic dispute in kosovo a 
backward autonomous province in south that was the heart of 
medieval serbias great empire 
kosovo now is dominated by predominantly moslem ethnic 
albanians who have the highest birthrate in europe and are 90 
percent of the provinces 2 million people minority serbs most of 
whom are christian say they are being harassed and began holding 
rallies in july 
serbs in kosovo found a supporter in the serbian communist party 
leader slobodan milosevic who is trying to impose more serbian 
control on kosovo and the other autonomous province vojvodina 
milosevics opponents accuse him of using the street protests to 
seek greater national power for himself and serbia

president miguel de la madrid says the united 
states is a difficult neighbor but living next to such a powerful 
country has made mexico more independent 
in an interview with the associated press de la madrid said 
that during his sixyear term the two countries have improved 
understanding on the thorny issue of illegal drug trafficking 
industrialized countries in general he said have begun to 
understand that developing nations foreign debt problems affect 
the entire world economy 
de la madrid 54 turns the government over to his successor 
former budget secretary carlos salinas de gortari on dec 1 after 
presiding over some of the countrys most difficult years both men 
are from the institutional revolutionary party which has not lost 
a major office since it was founded in 1929 
relations between mexico and the united states have always 
been very difficult so difficult that we lost half our territory 
in the last century de la madrid said in the interview wednesday 
but the challenge of living next to such a wealthy and 
complicated country he said has made mexicans more nationalistic 
perhaps that is one of the great advantages of being a 
neighbor of the united states our desire to continue being an 
independent and sovereign nation that rules its own destiny he 
said 
i believe the basis of the problems is a lack of knowledge of 
each other de la madrid said 
twothirds of mexicos trade tourism and investment are from 
the united states and there is a constant flow of citizens back and 
forth across the border the result is continuous problems of 
immigration trade drug trafficking and foreign policy 
differences particularly on central america 
the united states backs rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
government and supports the salvadoran governments war against 
leftist rebels there it has failed to win the support it would 
like from mexico which opposes the us intervention and has been 
more sympathetic to nicaraguas government and the salvadoran 
rebels 
there are some in the united states who think that because 
mexico is an independent country with its own foreign policy that 
it is not a friend of the united states he said i do not 
believe that is true we are friends of the united states but in 
some things we do not think alike 
illegal narcotics trafficking through mexico has been one of the 
biggest sources of conflict between the two countries during de la 
madrids term 
president reagan secretary of state george p shultz and other 
top us officials have recognized mexicos efforts to fight drug 
trafficking de la madrid said 
however he added there are lowerlevel officials who to 
avoid responsibility put the blame on mexico it seems to me an 
infantile attitude 
he said he believed us officials have recognized the 
importance of demand for illegal drugs in the problem of drug 
trafficking 
that is a great advance since you have to accept the reality 
that the united states is the biggest consumer of drugs in the 
world and that constitutes an enormous motive to promote production 
or transportation from other parts of the world he said 
he said there were slight and tenuous signs of understanding 
that the developing countries huge foreign debts have worldwide 
implications 
mexicos 104 billion foreign debt is the second highest in the 
third world after brazils 
de la madrid said both us presidential candidates vice 
president george bush and michael dukakis along with european 
leaders have recognized that ways must be found to overcome the 
problem 
what is needed now is for that recognition to be converted 
into political will and specific formulas he said 
mexico insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor 
for the debt he said 
it is not possible that in the case of the latin american 
countries we resign ourselves to the economic stagnation of a 
growing population with so many needs 
he said debtor nations must set our house in order 
internally while demanding a fair and realistic deal from 
creditors 
de la madrid has maintained mexicos commitment to keep up with 
debt service payments establishing unpopular austerity measures 
subsidies were eliminated prices went up and workers salaries 
lost more than half their buying power but my concern was to 
protect the majorities and to do that we had to defend the 
productive sectors and employment he said

drawings and cash prizes may sound like 
lets make a deal but the gimmicks have found their way into a 
pair of election races this year 
a pennsylvania congressional candidate said tuesday he is 
raffling away 10000 to a lucky taxpayer and a new yorker is 
offering 100 to reporters who can get sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny to answer a question about taxes 
the pennsylvania ploy was hatched by republican ed howard a 
former state senator who is challenging democratic rep peter 
kostmayer in the 8th congressional district of suburban 
philadelphia 
howard said he is buying fullpage newspaper ads asking voters 
to reply to 20 questions comparing kostmayers and howards 
records the ads attack kostmayers voting record on crime 
education taxes and other issues 
simply give us your opinion on twenty questions send your 
answers to us and well enter your name in a drawing the ad 
says if your name is chosen well send you the 10000 
the ads will cost howard about 20000 he said 
only registered voters can participate in the raffle and they 
have until oct 28 to clip out and mail their coupons to the howard 
campaign 
a kostmayer statement suggested howard was running for a 
hollywood game show host but howard countered that the raffle 
was meant to counter the free mailing privileges and other 
advantages that stack the election odds in favor of an incumbent 
the raffle does not run afoul of state lotterysweepstakes law 
because the contest does not require participants to make a 
contribution to qualify howard campaign manager ann brackbill said 
added federal election commission spokesman fred eiland in 
general there is nothing in the law that would deal with this type 
of thing 
the new york campaign stunt is focused more on the media than 
the public 
republican bob mcmillan first offered 100 to any new york 
reporter who successfuly reached sen daniel patrick moynihan 
himself by telephone and asked him about any issues of the 
campaign and received coherent answers 
when a reporter claimed the prize mcmillan offered a new 100 
reward to a reporter who could get moynihan to explain a series of 
votes that mcmillan claimed raised new yorkers tax burden

the executive director of a gay rights group 
says the justice department is finally catching up with legal 
reality by declaring that antidiscrimination laws extend to 
federal employees with the aids virus 
an opinion issued thursday by the office of legal counsel 
concludes that the federal rehabilitation act which protects the 
handicapped in the federal workforce or in programs receiving 
federal aid also applies to employees with the aids virus 
the opinion is in line with a supreme court ruling last year and 
the civil rights restoration act of 1987 passed by congress 
the justice department is finally catching up with legal 
reality said jeff levi executive director of the national gay 
and lesbian task force many state handicapped laws have already 
been changed to protect people infected with aids 
in view of the supreme court opinion and other court rulings 
the justice departments revised position is a little late in 
coming in fact its a lot late in coming said david barr staff 
attorney for the lambda legal defense and education fund 
the opinion says that those with the aids virus in whom the 
disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they 
pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to do 
their job 
since the available medical information shows that the risk of 
infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace 
is very low an aidsinfected employee by and large should be 
treated like any other employee assistant attorney general 
douglas kmiec head of the office of legal counsel told a news 
conference 
kmiec said an aidsinfected employee should be assessed for 
his ability to do the job like anyone else 
the legal opinion differs sharply from an opinion his 
predecessor charles cooper issued in june 1986 that employers 
may discriminate against victims of contagious diseases such as 
aids based on an irrational fear of contagion 
the supreme court rejected that argument last year extending 
the protection of the federal rehabilitation act to people 
handicapped by contagious disease including aids 
the legal opinion adheres to president reagans statement of 
last august in which he said that federal employers should treat 
those infected with the aids virus like any other employees as 
long as they dont pose health and safety dangers or performance 
problems 
attorney general dick thornburgh issued a statement with kmiecs 
opinion saying there are legitimate questions as to whether 
existing laws to protect the handicapped can adequately serve aids 
victims he noted that the rehabilitation act was passed in 1973 
well before the advent of aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that 
affects the bodys immune system rendering it incapable of 
resisting other diseases and infections the virus most often is 
spread through contact with blood blood products or semen as of 
monday 74809 people had been reported as having aids since 1981 
of whom 42142 have died no one is known to have recovered from 
aids 
sixtytwo percent of those with aids are homosexual or bisexual 
males according to the national centers for disease control as 
many as 15 million americans are infected with the aids virus the 
cdc estimates

although connie mack iii had a major 
league name the republican congressman was still viewed as a minor 
player in florida politics when he began his challenge one year ago 
for threeterm democratic sen lawton chiles seat 
today a wellfunded mack is heading into the final stretch 
against the survivor of a bruising democratic primary us rep 
kenneth buddy mackay 
since the day mack formally announced his plans oct 19 1987 
the us congressman has watched his fortunes rise with the 
decision of each potential opponent 
the 58yearold chiles chairman of the senate budget committee 
stunned his party in december by deciding not to seek reelection 
then democratic frontrunner reubin askew the former twoterm 
governor abruptly withdrew may 7 citing weariness with the amount 
of time spent raising funds 
the decisions by chiles and askew triggered a sixway democratic 
race in which mackay made a late comeback to finish second in the 
sept 6 primary then overtook bill gunter the states insurance 
commissioner since 1976 in a runoff on tuesday 
polling by the mack campaign showed mackay gaining momentum 
prior to the runoff so the republican candidate went after his 
likely opponent with an ad campaign titled hey buddy youre 
liberal 
mack describes his rival as a taxloving wildspending liberal 
while portraying himself as a conservative republican cut from the 
same cloth as president reagan 
i think that florida is a conservative state and i represent a 
conservative viewpoint said mack a former bank president and 
grandson of his namesake the famous philadelphia athletics and 
hall of fame baseball manager 
mack who was elected to the house in 1982 has one of the most 
conservative records in congress scoring 90plus percent on the 
scorecards of conservative rating groups and sometimes zero in 
marks from liberal rating organizations 
mack has criticized his rival for opposing military aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels the mx missile and the b1 bomber and for 
voting for congressional pay hikes 
there is a clear choice between conservative connie mack and 
liberal buddy mackay said mack who has stuck to a theme of 
less taxes less spending less government more freedom 
mackay an attorney from a wealthy central florida family 
generally shunned bigspending programs according to his 
congressional record but is more open to government involvement 
than mack 
while serving in congress since 1982 mackay has been active in 
deficitreduction during his tenure in the florida legislature he 
was a leader in civil rights and open government 
we need to talk about each of our records what we have 
done said mackay the issues remain the same who can do the 
best job for the state of florida i intend to talk specifics 
during the general election i dont intend to allow mr mack to 
continue talking generalities and philosophies 
mackay who has said he would consider new taxes to deal with 
the escalating national deficit also plans to make macks 
environmental record an issue 
the people of florida are concerned about the environment and 
connie macks record on the environment is one of the worst not 
just in the florida delegation where its the worst but in all of 
america said mackay thats not a republican issue or a 
democratic issue republicans care about the environment as much as 
democrats 
while the negative democratic campaign between gunter and mackay 
led to predictions of a divided party gunter quickly promised to 
work for mackay mackay had attacked gunters integrity while 
gunter had charged that mackay betrayed israel senior citizens and 
the antidrug effort with votes in congress 
mack rode the support of his partys hierarchy and a 2 million 
campaign warchest to a primary victory over former us attorney 
robert merkle 
although merkle entered the gop primary just 10 weeks before the 
sept 6 election and without any money he was able to attract 
nearly 40 percent of the vote against the telegenic mack 
mackay meanwhile was building momentum after polls in the 
final month before the primary showed him running third he slipped 
past rep dan mica to make the runoff against gunter 
the republicans have targeted florida in their hopes of 
regaining a majority in the senate a strong showing by republican 
presidential nominee george bush who is expected to win the state 
could also hurt mackay 
and then there is the money factor 
macks campaign has raised more than 4 million including 
860000 from the gops national senate campaign committee and 
spent about 35 million to maintain his media effort 
mackay raised and spent 15 million he needed to reach the 
general election the national democratic senate committee is 
expected to give mackay 700000

dan quayle missed a onceinacampaign 
opportunity to bury doubts about his competence to serve as 
president if need be several political analysts say 
quayles halting and at times unresponsive answers at the vice 
presidential debate to repeated questions about his readiness to 
lead the country left some republicans shaking their heads 
as a republican i sat there trying to pull words out of his 
mouth said gop consultant tom edmonds frankly i think there 
are a lot of family dogs that could have answered the question 
better 
i think he was so afraid of striking out that he never swung 
the bat edmonds said 
during wednesdays debate in omaha neb with senate colleague 
lloyd bentsen quayle repeatedly cited his 12 years service in 
congress as his principal qualification for the vice presidency 
when asked what he would do in the event of a presidential 
death the indiana senator said he would pray for himself and the 
country and then call a meeting of cabinet members and top 
presidential advisers he said little more though pressed by 
questioners 
among those dissatisfied with the response was conservative 
directmail fundraiser richard viguerie who said quayle did all 
right on all the questions but those concerning his qualification 
and fitness for the vice presidency 
im sympathetic to the guy because he was too coached and 
told whatever you do dont do this and dont do that 
viguerie said 
george bushs campaign chairman james a baker iii denied on 
abctvs good morning america that quayle was overprogrammed 
for the faceoff he said he believed there was a lot more 
spontaneity than in the debate between bush and democrat michael 
dukakis 
i think he did make some headway but i think that public 
opinion was so critical of him beforehand that he had nowhere to go 
but up said larry sabato a political scientist at the 
university of virginia 
patrick buchanan a conservative columnist who served for a time 
as white house communications director for president reagan said 
this whole debate was about dan quayle and i think under 
pressure he did quite well and i dont think anybody is going 
to say well gee this fellows not even qualified to be vice 
president of the united states 
but vic fingerhut a democratic pollster said i dont think 
he quayle did resolve the question regarding his qualifications 
for the office 
for the hardcore democrats and republicans this thing meant 
nothing he said it was just a reaffirmation of views they 
already held i just think that people who are in the middle 
undecided are as interested as the media are in the question 
about his fitness 
actually the people who think quayles a jerk will still vote 
the ticket if they like george bush he said

dead quail have been placed at several 
downtown locations in an effort to attract and identify an 
endangered peregrine falcon that has been spotted flying among 
office buildings 
were not sure when it showed up said joe werner an urban 
biologist for the missouri conservation department we had two 
last year december through march 
the falcon has an identification band on its leg but 
conservationists will need a closer look to determine where it came 
from one of the birds spotted last year was discovered to be from 
the yukon the other was hatched at a conservation site in 
rochester minn 
to attract the bird and determine its origin the conservation 
department is putting dead quail on a ledge on the 18th floor of 
the commerce bank building and in a nesting box atop another 
building werner said 
conservationists think the bird may have come from a falcon 
release site in omaha neb the nearest such site to kansas city 
six falcons recently were released there werner said 
if the new falcon was hatched in captivity it should be 
attracted to the quail the main meal at the release sites 
wild falcons generally dont eat killed prey feeding instead on 
live birds they snare as they swoop down at up to 200 mph from 
their perches werner said 
werner said this is the migration season for the birds which 
fly each year to south america 
workers downtown hope the birds will stick around awhile 
its really been the highlight of the fall season said tom 
noack a lawyer on the 18th floor of the commerce bank building

to invoke the name of john f kennedy is to 
enter a political realm in which the fine print of history doesnt 
count 
the kennedy lore and legend are recalled by politicians of both 
parties now 25 years after the assassination in dallas but it is 
best done carefully especially by republicans 
by the numbers sen dan quayle got his history just about right 
when he compared his experience and kennedys but he left himself 
open to the sharpest rebuff of his wednesday night debate with sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas 
it was as though bentsen had been waiting for the kennedy 
comparison one quayle has made before when questions of experience 
confront him in his republican vice presidential campaign 
he hit the trigger as soon as quayle said that hed had as much 
experience in congress as had kennedy when he sought the presidency 
senator said bentsen i served with jack kennedy i knew 
jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no 
jack kennedy 
actually quayle hadnt claimed that he was only that hed been 
in congress as long he was off by two years kennedy served 14 
years in congress quayle has been there for 12 
but the broader interpretation of quayles statement was more 
effective ammunition for the democratic vice presidential nominee 
it has ignited a barrage of democratic criticism and ridicule of 
quayle on grounds that he claimed to be an incipient jfk 
for the record kennedy was elected to the house from 
massachusetts in 1946 served three terms was elected to the 
senate in 1952 and reelected in 1958 quayle was elected to the 
house in 1976 beat democrat birch bayh to win his senate seat in 
1980 and won a second term in 1986 
bentsen served three terms in the house two while kennedy was 
there he returned to congress in 1971 this time as a senator 
defeating george bush to win the seat 
while quayle may have walked into a new campaign problem with 
the kennedy comparison there are some parallels quayle is 41 
kennedy was 43 when he ran for president 39 when he made a losing 
bid for a democratic vice presidential nomination 
quayle has been under attack for what his critics call a subpar 
congressional record kennedy faced the same kind of attacks when 
he began his presidential campaign in 1960 his opponents said hed 
accomplished little or nothing in the senate and was too often 
absent 
even after kennedy had proven himself in presidential primary 
elections detractors questioned his credentials and complained 
that his family fortune was buying his way to the nomination 
republican rep william e miller the party chairman who later 
ran for vice president said kennedy was trying to turn the white 
house into the house that jack bought 
with kennedy on the threshold of the presidential nomination 
harry s truman quit as a delegate saying the national convention 
was rigged for jfk and suggested that the senator step aside in 
favor of someone with the greatest possible maturity and 
experience 
are you certain you are quite ready for the country or that 
the country is ready for you in the role of president truman 
asked in a televised address 
kennedy said yes that it was time for a young man for vigor 
for a new generation 
while some of those accusations echo now so do the distinctions 
between the kennedy of 1960 and the quayle of 1988 
kennedy was a world war ii hero quayles candidacy got off to a 
shaky start because of controversy over his vietnamera hometown 
service in the national guard 
quayles academic credentials have been questioned kennedys 
were not kennedy had published two books hed won a pulitzer 
prize for profiles in courage 
richard goodwin a kennedy speechwriter said the people who 
questioned his experience in 1960 were on sound ground they were 
right goodwin said hed been in congress a couple of terms 
and hed just started serving his second term in the senate 
but people perceived in him qualities of intelligence and 
sympathy or understanding whatever the voters were looking for 
the experience argument was replayed in massachusetts when sen 
edward m kennedy sought the democratic nomination to succeed his 
brother in 1962 edward j mccormack the state attorney general 
ran against him 
if his name was edward moore with his qualifications with 
your qualifications teddy if it was edward moore your candidacy 
would be a joke mccormack told kennedy in a televised debate 
the observation was accurate but the backlash was fierce and the 
primary was no contest 
the name was kennedy

when it comes to the marriage 
business the rev ben jansen will tie the knot in just about any 
fashion just as long as the fashion includes clothes 
a couple called and asked if i would marry them in the buff 
jansen said i thought she said on the bus and i said sure 
i did the wedding but we all had clothes on 
what started as a way to supplement his income as pastor of the 
70member christ community congregational church seven years ago 
has become a passion for jansen and he says a very important 
part of his ministry 
it wasnt long before jansen 42 began getting requests from 
people who were turned down by other pastors in town because they 
didnt want a church ceremony 
though jansen takes the institution of marriage seriously he 
has no reservations about performing weddings in some 
notsoserious settings 
the bible talks about commitment thats the heart of 
marriage its not where you get married that matters said 
jansen who also does marriage counseling 
jansen estimates about 80 percent of the weddings he performs 
are at homes 
the rest have been in such offbeat places as the top level of a 
downtown parking ramp on a 400foot sand dune with both bride and 
groom sitting on a motorcycle on a city skateboard ramp and at a 
construction site where a couple planned to build their home 
his biggest wedding was performed two years ago on the ice 
before 5000 people at lc walker arena in muskegon just before 
the start of an international hockey league game 
jansen said he doesnt pry too much into the reasons a couple 
has for wanting to get married in an unusual place 
i learned a long time ago that you cant explain love he

shifts in soviet ideology are following the 
shakeup in the soviet power structure as mikhail gorbachev 
solidifies his rule and pursues radical change both in the economy 
and in relations with the west 
the soviet leader is stepping up momentum defying the judgment 
of some analysts in the cia and prestigious washington think tanks 
that he is running out of gas and that his colleagues in the 
kremlin are losing patience with him 
for the next us president the changes are less frightening 
than intellectually challenging the soviets new chief ideologist 
vadim a medvedev suggested in a speech published wednesday in 
pravda that conflict with the west was no longer considered 
inevitable by moscow 
presentday realities he said mean that universal 
values such as avoiding war and ecological catastrophe must 
outweigh the idea of a struggle between the classes peaceful 
coexistence as we see it today is a lengthy longterm process 
whose historic limits are difficult to determine 
the implication is that the soviets under gorbachev want to 
reduce the risks of conflict with the united states and concentrate 
on economic improvements such as expanding current experiments with 
cooperative ownership and renting property to farmers and merchants 
this could make the current us presidential debate over which 
american weapons to develop and which to scrap a little beside the 
point in dealing with the soviets beginning next january the focus 
may be on devising a strategy for dealing not with a potential 
aggressor but with a thoughtful adversary who is likely to generate 
a steady stream of proposals for arms control and an easing of 
regional tensions 
joint commitments are being developed even now to outlaw 
chemical weapons halt the proliferation of ballistic missiles 
among less advanced countries and revamp the world court 
and yet george bush michael dukakis and their running mates 
have spent little time on foreign policy and even less on how they 
would cope with gorbachev as the soviet system evolves into 
something new and unprecedented 
when the candidates venture beyond domestic issues bush 
generally hammers at dukakis for not supporting development of all 
the weapons the reagan administration is backing dukakis in turn 
tries to be reassuring about his commitment to us defenses but 
how would they deal with gorbachev 
bush and his running mate dan quayle are sounding the 
traditional conservative themes of a powerful military structure 
and keeping a wary eye on the russians 
dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen are playing down 
ideology and playing up competence 
in 1960 when richard nixon was pondering a running mate for his 
first race for the presidency he assembled 36 party elders at a 
midnight meeting in chicago the governor of illinois william 
stratton offered this advice you can say all you want about 
foreign affairs but what is really important is the price of hogs 
in chicago 
maybe stratton was right and then again maybe events in moscow 
in 1988 call for a little more attention to foreign policy

a pennsylvania congressman nabbed a startled 
intruder who hid out in the powder room of the lawmakers capitol 
hill row house while police dusted for fingerprints and completed 
their investigation without searching the home 
rep lawrence coughlin rpa said his wife susan called 
police early wednesday after the family dog began kicking up a 
fuss and he discovered that someone apparently had pried open the 
front window 
the police discovered that mrs coughlins purse was missing 
dusted the window for fingerprints and got a list of the contents 
of my wifes pocketbook coughlin said 
as they were going out the door i walked into the powder room 
and put on the light and found the gentleman with my wifes 
pocketbook on his shoulder he continued 
i dont know who was more startled said coughlin 59 i 
remember lunging at him and the next thing i knew i was on top of 
him i was so angry 
police said they found coughlin wrestling with the young man 
i guess it was my marine corps training the congressman 
said 
recco d bouknight 22 was arrested and charged with burglary

oddly enough police did not search the house coughlin 
said on reflection now i think that would be an automatic thing 
to do i guess

a proposed federal regulation to require 
regular drug testing of atomic plant workers is under attack on 
capitol hill for lacking similar standards to curb alcohol abuse 
the nuclear regulatory commission announced a proposed fitness 
for duty rule last month that would require reactor owners to 
conduct random drug tests test employees based on cause report 
drug use to the nrc and mandate personnel sanctions 
the proposal also would require utilities to submit their own 
alcohol programs providing reasonable assurance that plant 
operators are sober but leaves to the discretion of each 
licensee the specific measures to be used nrc chairman lando w 
zech jr said thursday 
it is as if the nrc is saying that it is less concerned with 
someone being drunk in the control room than it is with someone 
being high on drugs said rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman 
of the house interior and insular affairs subcommittee on oversight 
and investigations 
gejdenson and other lawmakers have long urged the nrc to impose 
strict drug and alcohol standards instead of leaving it up 
individual utilities 
zech under heavy criticism from both democrats and republicans 
on the subcommittee stressed that the fitness for duty rule 
was simply a proposal and could be changed to include specific 
alcohol standards before it is issued next year 
but he defended the commissions decision to remove strict 
alcohol provisions that were in earlier drafts of the regulation 
zech said it was more difficult to develop a consensus on 
alcohol standards than drug restrictions noting the different 
blood alcohol levels used by various states and federal agencies to 
determine inebriation 
trying to include specific alcohol requirements in the rule 
could have delayed the final regulation another few months or 
maybe longer zech said 
but lawmakers were befuddled and angered by that explanation 
youre sitting around and waiting for utility companies to 
tell you how to do it said rep george miller dcalif dont 
you have some idea what the minimum standard ought to be this is 
not a new subject 
rep denny smith of oregon a republican who is often at odds 
with the democrats criticism agreed with miller and gejdenson 
i think your judgment needs to be questioned he told the 
commissioners it just doesnt make sense not to include the 
alcohol provision he said 
gejdenson pointed to an nrc document that concluded that alcohol 
abuse and drinkingrelated problems are judged to present a 
vastly more pervasive work place problem than does drug abuse 
zech said he agreed with that statement but another 
commissioner said drug abuse presented a bigger problem than 
alcohol because he believes drug use is more difficult to notice 
commissioner kenneth carr a former submarine commander said he 
threw people out of the submarine force for a first drug 
offense when everybody else said that was the wrong thing to do i 
didnt ever throw anybody out for being drunk because i could tell 
when a guy was drunk and i didnt put him in a sensitive position 
that may be the problem gejdenson said were very 
tolerant of being intoxicated as a society

the government faced with relentless 
rocket attacks in the heart of the capital has scheduled an 
emergency meeting to discuss ways to make peace with the 
usbacked guerrillas 
government spokesmen said the central committee of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan would meet monday to discuss 
important matters including efforts to bring the guerrillas 
into talks with the government 
vice president abdul rahim hatif in an interview thursday 
during a flight from new delhi to kabul said a concerted effort 
of all mentalities and from all walks of life is urgently needed 
however he called the guerrillas irresponsible people with 
complicated weapons and accused pakistan and the united states of 
continuing to the guerrillas who are seeking to topple the 
sovietbacked marxist government 
on thursday kabul police escorted three western reporters to 
homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day a 
total of 42 rockets hit kabul in less than three hours wednesday 
morning killing 13 people and wounding 34 according to qurban 
shayrzad the citys deputy police chief 
one home shown to reporters was occupied by a soldier mohammad 
shah who said four women and one boy in his family were killed 
when a rocket hit the wall around their home on the north edge of 
kabul 
at another nearby house four girls between the ages of 2 and 9 
were killed by a rocket according to their uncle mohammad karim 
on sept 28 at least 33 people were killed and more than 130 
wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on kabul in recent 
memory 
in other attacks around the country antigovernment guerrillas 
fired rockets at the southern city of kandagar hitting a hospital 
and killing dozens of people tass reported thursday 
the soviet news agency quoting its afghan counterpart bakhtar 
said three patients and a nurse were among those killed in 
wednesdays attack 
on thursday a rocket attack killed a woman and her four 
children in their house in the city of charinkara in parvan 
province 
a mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus wednesday in 
nangarhar province twentythree passengers were killed and 13 
seriously injured tass said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters 
at a moscow news briefing that soviet troops had broken a guerrilla 
blockade of the city of paghman in kabul province he said the 
siege was ended after several days of fighting 
despite government assertions several kabul civilians speaking 
on condition of anonymity expressed belief that some of the 
rockets have been fired by soviet or afghan troops who then blamed 
the guerrillas in an effort to alienate their supporters 
the guerrillas who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors have steadfastly refused to deal with the government of 
president najib 
hatif who said he does not belong to the marxist peoples 
democratic party is one of four vice presidents named by najib 
four months ago in a show of broadening the base of his government 
however key positions in the sovietbacked government 
including the presidency are held by the party or by politicians 
closely associated with it 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to replace 
one marxist government with another and fight the nationwide 
insurgency 
the soviets agreed april 14 in geneva to withdraw their more 
than 100000 troops from afghanistan but said last week they 
suspended the pullout because of us and pakistani violations of 
the pact pakistan also supports the guerrillas 
hatif a 63yearold businessman said thursday that any 
government should have both public support and the means to defend 
itself

at massachusetts fire stations theyre talking 
about smoking not smoke 
a new state law the first of its kind in the nation forbids 
all newly hired police officers and firefighters from smoking 
cigars or cigarettes on or off the job 
the statute enacted last year took effect thursday and met 
with huffs and puffs of resentment across the state 
this is going to get jammed up in the courts probably the 
very first time they try to enforce it said lt edward m 
merrick jr a lobbyist for the 15000member massachusetts police 
association 
the association and other unions contend the law intended to 
cut disability pension costs infringes on their members private 
lives and may be unconstitutional 
state legislators agree that the law is virtually certain to be 
challenged but they maintain it can withstand constitutional 
scrutiny because it affects only new recruits 
all of the 21300 policemen and 23500 firefighters in 
massachusetts are exempt they can go on smoking as long as they 
like 
but new state and municipal officers will be told that 
abstaining from smoking is a condition of their employment if they 
violate the ban at any time in their careers they could be fired 
rankandfile officers in several communities said they did not 
object to the purpose of the law but felt it went too far 
its like the seat belt thing said patrolman paul goyette 
of the lowell police department referring to the states mandatory 
seat belt law which was repealed by voters two years ago its 
good for you but i believe in free choice i think you should be 
free to kill yourself if you want 
the answer from legislators in effect was that killing 
yourself is one thing but asking the taxpayers to pay for it is 
another 
the laws primary author rep kevin p blanchette dlawrence 
defended it as a compromise with unions to help shore up the 
massachusetts pension system 
under the states socalled heart law any heart ailment a 
policeman or firefighter develops automatically is presumed to have 
resulted from jobrelated stress 
firefighters enjoy an additional presumption for lung disease 
because they frequently inhale smoke and dangerous fumes 
the presumption makes it relatively easy for a policeman or 
firefighter to obtain a disability pension which provides 72 
percent of the officers final salary plus an annuity and an 
allowance for dependents all taxfree 
other public employees who retire with heart or lung ailments 
receive far smaller pensions unless they can prove that the 
ailments are jobrelated 
blanchette said he supports the heart and lung presumptions 
because our public safety officers are our first line of defense 
and they do have hazardous occupations 
but he said the law needed to take the risks of tobacco use 
into account 
if a firefighter comes down with emphysema its presumed to 
be jobrelated even if he has been smoking two packs a day for 20 
years blanchette said that doesnt make a lot of sense 
only a few hundred officers will be affected by the law this 
year but starting in 1989 about 1100 police recruits and 600 new 
firefighters are expected to come under the law each year 
according to the state department of personnel administration 
robert b mccarthy president of the 12000member professional 
firefighters of massachusetts said his union is unhappy with the 
smoking ban but predicted the issue will fade 
the generation coming on now is pretty much nonsmokers 
anyway he said they want to be healthy

deputy secretary of state john c whitehead 
says that in meetings next week with east european leaders he will 
offer improved economic relations with the united states in 
exchange for greater respect for human rights 
eastern europe is at an important crossroads whitehead told 
reporters thursday 
fundamentally what these soviet bloc regimes want from us 
are economic support trade ties and political recognition he 
said we have stated our willingness to be helpful provided we 
see real progress in political and economic reform and greater 
tangible respect for the human rights of the citizens in each of 
these countries 
he said he had made this point in previous meetings with east 
european officials 
the united states and its european allies must work together 
to use this historic opportunity to advance peaceful positive 
change in eastern europe for the good of all the peoples of europe 
and of the united states he said 
whitehead said he would reemphasize to the east european 
leaders the us policy of treating the eastern european 
countries not as a bloc but as individual states each with their 
own history and culture 
whitehead said his sixth trip to eastern europe starting sunday 
would take him to the capital of each of the soviet allies in the 
region east germany romania poland czechoslovakia hungary and 
bulgaria 
he plans to brief officials of the north atlantic treaty 
organization in brussels on the trip before he returns to 
washington oct 21 
he said he would meet with a wide range of people from all 
sectors of society not just government officials state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said his meetings would 
include religious leaders

researchers have discovered a way to alter the 
whooping cough bacteria genetically in order to produce a safer 
vaccine to combat the dangerous childhood disease 
dr jerry keith a national institutes of health scientist said 
thursday that his research team discovered that by merely 
substituting one amino acid for another in a single subunit of the 
whooping cough bacteria gene they could cause the bacteria to lose 
a toxic reaction that has caused troublesome side effects 
despite the development of a vaccine more than 40 years ago 
whooping cough or pertussis strikes about 60 million children a 
year worldwide about 1 million die 
most children in the united states are vaccinated against 
whooping cough during their first three years of life thus the 
disease is rarely contracted in the united states 
but pediatricians report about 70 infants a year suffer some 
side effect from the pertussis vaccine this is thought to be 
caused by a toxin that is included in the vaccine now used 
side effects can include swelling and redness around the 
injection persistent crying among infants and in severe cases 
brain damage 
keith said the goal of his research was to use genetic 
engineering to eliminate the toxic effects from the vaccine while 
retaining the portion of the bacteria that causes the patient to 
develop immunity 
the pertussis gene was cloned in 1986 by keith and his team at 
the nihs rocky mountain laboratories in hamilton mont since 
then keith said the group has been attempting to find the genetic 
source of the toxin that causes side effects in pertussis vaccine 
the idea was to go in and change the bacteria genetically so 
it is no longer toxic but still causes a very positive 
immunological response said keith it turns out that if a 
single amino acid change is made thats enough 
keith said the researchers removed the gene from the pertussis 
bacteria and placed it inside a laboratory bacteria they then 
experimented until finding which subunit of the gene was 
responsible for the toxin when that unit was found the scientist 
removed one of 234 amino acids in the subunit and implanted a new 
amino acid 
keith said it will take months of testing in test tubes and 
animals before a new whooping cough vaccine would be ready to test 
on humans 
in addition to keith other scientists conducting the research 
were w neal burnette and vernon l mar of amgen co in thousands 
oaks calif witold cieplak and kaarel t kaljot of nih and 
hiroko sato of the national institute of health in japan 
a report on the research is published in todays issue of 
science the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

syndicated columnist carl t rowan says the 
district of columbia mayor and other city officials tried to 
extort favorable newspaper columns by suggesting weapons 
charges against rowan could be dropped 
rowan claimed thursday that mayor marion barry and other senior 
city officials had suggested they could influence the 
highlypublicized weapons case against him if he stopped denouncing 
corruption in city government 
barry denied the charge 
unfortunately mr rowan made some extreme charges 
however i am too disciplined emotionally and have too much dignity 
to get into a debate with mr rowan barry said 
on wednesday the city announced it would not seek to retry 
rowan who has called in his column for tougher gun control on 
charges of illegal possession of a handgun and ammunition a 
twoday trial on the charges last week ended in a hung jury 
during a poolside press conference at his home where he had 
used the gun last june to wound a teenage intruder rowan said he 
was pleased that the city had decided not to try the case again 
he claimed however that the entire episode was a malicious 
political prosecution from day one 
but barry countered the fact of the matter is we have a very 
strong gun control law in washington if you possess an 
unregistered handgun as mr rowan did it is a case that should be 
discussed between the corporation counsel judges and juries which 
is the way this case was handled 
the columnist alleged thursday that herbert o reid one of 
barrys closest advisers had contacted rowans son carl jr 
after the shooting 
my son reported to me immediately that reid had told him that 
the mayors public posture on the gun issue would improve if i 
would lower my voice about corruption in the city rowan said 
reid flatly denied the charge thursday calling it a baldfaced 
lie 
rowan also alleged that barry who had criticized rowan 
publicly for the shooting called his son june 28 to say that 
corporation counsel frederick d cooke the citys top attorney 
could not make a decision to prosecute the case without his input 
cooke refused to comment on the matter 
in addition rowan claimed that on july 29 after the charges 
had been filed against him rep john conyers dmich called his 
wife at barrys request and left her a number where rowan could 
call barry and perhaps get him to drop the charges 
i never called barry because i feared that he would claim that 
i telephoned him trying to cut a deal rowan said 
conyers confirmed making the call but julian epstein conyers 
spokesman said the congressman was unaware of any possible 
ulterior motives by barry 
rowan frequently criticizes the district government in his 
columns 
none of us can be proud to live in a city that wallows in 
incompetence rowan said you deserve a mayor and other city 
officials whom your children can regard as inspirations to great 
achievement what you have now is venality ignorance lack of 
couth and an absence of conscience at the top

the government is dismissing worries that the flood 
of sympathy for ailing emperor hirohito will trigger new demands 
that japan revive its military might 
foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda said thursday the 
illness of the worlds longestreigning monarch will not create 
pressure to change the postwar constitution which forbids use of 
military force 
there will be no such general voices coming up towards that 
direction or to think about the constitution or a change of 
course he said 
the official sought in particular to discredit what he called 
the strange opinions of conservative author hideaki kase the 
writers remarks to the foreign correspondents club of japan last 
week were reported by some journalists as portending a surge of 
nationalism during a posthirohito transition 
rightists including some members of parliament from the 
governing liberal democratic party would like to change the 
constitution to restore some of the emperors traditional status 
and allow japan to be more of a military power 
the 87yearold emperor who took power in 1926 has been 
bedridden since internal hemorrhaging caused him to cough up blood 
sept 19 he is being fed intravenously and has received daily 
blood transfusions 
hirohito remained in stable condition today 
rightists have worked quietly behind the scenes to increase 
public sympathy for hirohito since he fell ill the effort has been 
led by shizuka kamei a member of parliament and leader of the 
liberal democratic partys fellow thinkers council on fundamental 
national issues 
kamei spearheaded the drive to set up nationwide registries for 
people to sign and wish hirohito a speedy recovery 
its not nationalism or revisionism kamei has said the 
emperor is like our father and he is sick 
kamei is in favor of revising the constitution earlier this 
year he and his group supported a cabinet minister who was forced 
to resign for saying japan was not an aggressor in world war ii but 
was simply fighting to protect itself at a time when the white 
race had turned asian into a colony 
leftists have criticized both kamei and the government saying 
they are creating an unwarranted mood of mourning with such things 
as the registries and the many cancellations of trips by cabinet 
members 
mainstream newspapers and some governing party members also have 
criticized the government for overreacting to hirohitos illness 
prime minister noboru takeshita has said government business should 
go on normally as much as possible 
asked at thursdays weekly briefing for foreign journalists if 
rightists would be able to open debate on revising the constitition 
in view of the outpouring of sympathy for the emperor matsuda 
replied absolutely not 
matsuda said the correspondents club made a very great 
mistake by inviting kase who he said represented just a 
handful of people in japan 
japans postwar constitution largely imposed by us occupation 
authorities not only forbids use of military force but also ends 
the emperors role as living god and source of all political 
authority the constitution now defines the emperor as the symbol 
of the state and of the unity of the people and gives him only 
ceremonial duties 
the militarists who ran the country before and during world war 
ii invoked hirohito as inspiration for attacks that put most of 
east asia under japanese rule 
but opinion polls consistently show the public is largely 
content with the emperors symbolic role and the low level of 
military spending in todays japan

a montgomery county circuit court jury has 
ruled that six former officials of the defunct community savings 
and loan of bethesda are liable for 112 million in damages 
stemming from the thrifts demise 
the jury returned the verdict thursday after five days of 
deliberation ruling that the officers misused deposits that 
financed an ultimately disastrous real estate venture known as 
equity programs investment corp or epic 
the 112 million was sought in compensatory damages by the 
staterun maryland deposit insurance fund which took control of 
community when its financial mismanagement contributed to the 
states 1985 savings and loan crisis 
the defendants in the longest trial in the courts history 
included tom billman who founded epic in 1975 and later acquired 
community 
attorneys for the state deposit insurance fund which filed the 
lawsuit two years ago alleged that billman and others drove 
community into insolvency by misusing its deposits to enrich 
themselves and to feed the epic machine 
prosecutors said that billman and associates lived like kings 
in palatial homes paid for from the profit of their personal 
companies which continued to grow even after community began to 
fail in 1985 
the jury held billman and his codefendants liable on six counts 
each of breaching their fiduciary duties partly in connection 
with more than 82 million in improper unsecured loans from 
community to epic in the early 1980s 
the defendants also violated their trust by engaging in numerous 
insider deals and allowing themselves lavish salaries bonuses and 
perquisites the jury found 
other defendants were james deerin jr of chevy chase and joseph 
cunningham of rockville both members of communitys board of 
directors and officers of various holding companies 
also named as defendants were clayton mccuistion of mclean va 
barbara mckinney of fairfax va and leonard meltz of atlanta ga 
billman a former fbi fingerprint clerk from rural southern 
ohio worked for real estate firms until he founded epic in 1975 
and eventually built it into a 15 billion real estate empire the 
brainchild of billman and his former college roommate clayton 
mccuistion epic acquired singlefamily homes and packaged them 
into sophisticated tax shelters for investors

the state attorney general is asking 
for ethics probes of the lawyers who advised tawana brawley after a 
grand jury concluded the black teenager concocted her story of 
abduction and rape by a gang of white men 
the girls advisers lawyers alton maddox and c vernon mason 
and the rev al sharpton told her not to cooperate with the 
investigation on the grounds it was part of a racist criminal 
justice system they also accused some public officials of 
participating in the alleged rape and others of covering up what 
happened 
with thursdays release of the 170page grand jury report 
attorney general robert abrams asked a judicial grievance committee 
and a judicial disciplinary panel to investigate mason and maddox 
for possible disciplinary action which could include suspension or 
disbarment 
their outrageous irresponsible actions have increased the 
atmosphere of tensions between the races not only in new york not 
only in dutchess county but throughout the nation because of the 
celebrated nature of this case abrams saidmr maddox and mr 
mason have made every effort to prevent the criminal justice system 
from uncovering the truth of what happened to tawana brawley 
in a 10page letter abrams detailed 19 statements he said mason 
and maddox made knowing they were false 
is there anyone left in america who believes them gov 
mario cuomo asked thursday evening 
although abrams did not formally recommend action against 
sharpton he said his actions were deplorable disgraceful 
reprehensible irresponsible and said the activist is under 
investigation by his office and possibly that of us attorney 
rudolph giuliani of manhattan 
the report summarized a sevenmonth investigation that cost the 
state at least 620000 abrams said 
we have the facts we have solved the case the allegations 
she had made are false abrams said 
the grand jury provided no reason for miss brawley to lie but 
its report noted that she was beaten by her mother after spending a 
weekend away from home in may 1986 and punished by her mothers 
livein boyfriend ralph king for coming home from a party at 5 
am shortly before her disappearance 
there was no evidence that any sexual assault occurred the 
report said microscopic examination of physical evidence 
including fibers from her jeans boots and blouse suggested that 
she had been in her familys former wappingers falls apartment the 
four days she claimed she was held captive 
the report said miss brawley apparently burned a hole in her own 
pants scrawled the word nigger on her shoe smeared dog feces 
on her body and clothing and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in 
front of the vacant apartment in the town 75 miles north of new 
york city 
miss brawley was found nov 28 in the plastic bag covered with 
dog feces and with kkk and nigger written on her body she 
told police she was abducted and raped by six white men one of 
whom showed a badge 
two officials whom the advisers accused of taking part in the 
attack assistant district attorney stephen pagones and former 
fishkill police officer harry crist jr were exonerated in the 
report 
ive been saying right along that i have nothing to do with 
tawana brawley said pagones who has threatened to sue the 
advisers 
crist killed himself shortly after miss brawley was found but 
the report said there was no evidence that the suicide had any 
connection with the case 
the advisers stuck by their version of events 
what should we expect from 21 whites from dutchess county 
said mason referring to 21 whites on the panel of 23 it is 
clear they never intended to arrest and prosecute those people who 
did this to tawana brawley 
sharpton told a rally of about 200 people outside the new york 
times on thursday night that the report contained contradictions 
and that miss brawley would give her reaction at a press conference 
saturday in chicago the times had reported on the grand jurys 
findings last week 
miss brawley refused to talk to reporters thursday as she left 
her new virginia beach va home for school

national lawmakers have passed a bill 
barring nicaraguans from accepting any assistance from the us 
government including humanitarian aid 
meanwhile opposition leaders assailed a new emergency law that 
gives president daniel ortega sweeping powers to curb civil 
liberties 
the new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian 
state and just as in the chile of president gen augusto 
pinochet the nicaraguan people should say no to the 
sandinistas said erick ramirez president of the social 
christian party chileans voted wednesday against letting pinochet 
extend his 15year rule 
ortegas leftist sandinista party controls the assembly and the 
government of nicaragua 
the antiassistance bill approved thursday by the national 
assembly prohibits all aid approved by the us congress and 
destined for opposition groups the roman catholic church labor 
unions and individuals violators face between four and 12 years 
imprisonment under the law 
a week ago president reagan signed a 27 million 6month 
humanitarian aid package for nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
the sandinistas and the contras agreed march 21 to suspend 
offensive operations but talks aimed at a permanent end to the 
7yearold war stand at an impasse they have repeatedly accused 
each other of truce violations 
the national endowment for democracy an arm of the us 
congress has provided more than 600000 for civic opposition 
groups in nicaragua 
they include la prensa the nations only opposition newspaper 
two antigovernment labor unions the superior private enterprise 
council the nicaraguan conservative party and the nicaraguan 
democratic coordinate 
this leaves opposition parties at a disadvantage including 
those that cannot prepare for future elections said clemente 
guido leader of the democratic conservative party speaking of the 
aid ban 
the emergency powers law approved wednesday by the assembly 
gives the president authority to declare a state of emergency for 
reasons of war economic crisis or national disaster 
it allows him to close news media block mail take over private 
vehicles and businesses make preventive arrests and close the 
nations borders to individuals

four americans entered laos today 
and began floating dollar bills down the mekong river to advertise 
a 24 million reward for missing us servicemen but the thai 
navy scooped up most of the money 
the americans dumped the money stamped with the reward offer 
and sealed in plastic envelopes into the river after their two 
boats moved about 220 yards into laotian waters 
they stuffed other bills into a toy boat guided by remote 
control towards the laotian shore 
however a thai naval patrol boat waved the americans back to 
the thai side of the river and retrieved 62 of about 100 packets 
tossed into the river then returned the money 
it wont work its incredibly stupid said one thai navy 
officer 
two members of the american team were arrested earlier this week 
after entering laos they are believed still held by laotian 
authorities 
the americans are offering 24 million to any laotian 
cambodian or vietnamese who brings an american out of these nations 
the americans members of a group called national steering 
committee for american war veterans say the reward money has been 
pledged by 21 us congressmen and others in the united states 
the us government lists 2393 americans as missing in action 
from fighting in cambodia laos and vietnam the three governments 
deny holding live americans and laos and vietnam are helping 
washington resolve the issue 
the four americans are ted sampley a former green beret from 
kingston nc william sullivan of jacksonville nc a marine 
corps veteran of the vietnam war lynn hampton of winter haven 
fla a nurse during the war and bruce adams a dentist from 
laramie wyo 
thai navy officials said their entry into laotian waters could 
jeopardize thailaotian relations 
we dont want this to become a problem between thailand and 
laos said one official at the naval station in khong chiam 
entering laotian waters will give our neighbors the impression 
that we endorse this activity 
the mekong forms a boundary between laos and thailand and flows 
to cambodia and vietnam although thailaotian relations are 
improving a number of clashes have occurred between the two 
countries since the 1975 communist victory in laos 
the 62 packets of money were given back to the americans who 
distributed some to local children and dropped others into the 
mekong from the thai shore about two dozen children leaped in to 
retrieve as many as they could 
the mood turned festive as ms hampton handed out ballons and 
reward stickers to excited youngsters 
the americans last saw their toy boat near the laotian side of 
the river which is about a halfmile wide at the spot 
two members of their group were captured by laotian authorities 
sunday when they hired a fishing boat dropped bills into the 
mekong and then went on to a laotian village 
thai police say donna long of jacksonville nc and james 
copp of hampstead nc have been moved from the river village to 
pakse city and possibly the laotian capital of vientiane 
the us embassy in laos said it has not been informed of their 
whereabouts or status

the united states has proposed to the soviet 
union that greater use be made of the world court to resolve 
international disputes 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said on thursday 
however that its our view that issues involving the use of 
force and national security do not belong in the international 
court of justice 
mrs oakley said the possibility of using the court more in 
resolving international disputes did not involve a change in the 
stand the administration took when it rejected the courts 
jurisdiction in a dispute with nicaragua two years ago 
she said further discussions would be held with the soviets and 
that she had no details of possible suggested changes in the 
courts operations

secretary of state george p shultz has 
sharply denied reports that washington is secretly negotiating with 
iran for release of american hostages in lebanon 
shultz said that anyone who claims to be a us envoy to such 
negotiations is lying anyone who tries to cut across our 
policies should butt out he added 
his remarks were reinforced by iranian foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati who denied categorically at a separate news 
conference thursday that the united states and iran had opened 
talks on hostages or any other subjects 
shultz made his remarks thursday at a news conference during his 
visit to new york for the fall session of the 43rd un general 
assembly he was reacting to a spate of recent reports that the 
united states is involved in secret negotiations for the release of 
hostages 
he gave no specifics about individuals who nominate 
themselves as government representatives but suggested the 
practice is widespread 
whats wrong is that these people forever seem to have it in 
their minds that some kind of deal can be struck and they want to 
be negotiators 
and we keep driving it home there is not going to be any 
deal the hostages should be released 
shultz responded to questions about statements in paris by

the iraniraq war hostages and terrorism

are exchanged with iran through governments in contact with both

four us senators are seeking an independent 
safety review of the savannah river plant after disclosures that up 
to 30 major mishaps over three decades went unreported and in the 
wake of an equipment failure that released radioactive gas into the 
air 
the escape thursday of less than 001 millirems of tritium gas 
into the atmosphere posed no health threat said plant spokeswoman 
becky craft a millirem is a measure of radiation a routine chest 
xray totals about 20 millirems according to ms craft 
workers at the us governmentowned plant the nations sole 
producer of weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium were not evacuated 
in washington sens ernest hollings dsc james mcclure 
ridaho bennett johnston dla and mark hatfield rore called 
thursday for an investigation by the advisory committee on nuclear 
facilities safety which was established by energy secretary john 
herrington to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear 
facilities 
at the state capitol in columbia 60 miles to the northeast a 
dozen people held a twohour vigil to demonstrate their concern 
but in downtown aiken most of the customers at jeff scotts 
beauty and barber shop said thursday they were unconcerned about 
problems at the nearby plant 
everybodys nonchalant who comes in the shop theyre more 
concerned about jobs than danger he said but im concerned i 
want to know if theres any danger to the environment what kind of 
danger thered be to our health 
its been there for 30 years and nobodys died yet said 
aiken mayor h odell weeks 
disclosures about problems at the sprawling plant began last 
week when two congressional committees were told that a number of 
serious reactor accidents were kept secret for 31 years 
an internal energy department report released wednesday 
concluded that the plants management undermines safety and 
deviates from practices common to wellrun nuclear plants the 
report also cited the undisclosed accidents 
the draft report criticized the energy department and du pont 
which operates the plant under contract for poor staff training 
poor communications and sloppy operating procedures that it said 
have undermined safety 
the 50page report made a host of recommendations including 
stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become 
serious 
a spokesman for du pont said company officials had not seen the 
report but already moved to correct some of the deficiencies it 
cited 
weeks who has been mayor of the town of 15000 people for half 
of his 80 years said weve felt were living in as safe a place 
as we can im not at all concerned about the townspeoples 
safety 
when aiken residents talk of the plant which they call srp 
they speak of jobs and the economic prosperity the prime employer 
has meant to the community of treelined streets and the 
surrounding area near georgia 
anne smith owner of the four generations gift and antique shop 
on the towns main plaza said the opponents to srp are raising 
questions that need to be made but there are some people who 
become very negative when you go against whats already there 
they have a secure job with great benefits people dont

the thighbaring mini skirt is gone but the 
sexy look survives on the milan runway with bare midriffs and more 
during this weeks springsummer 1989 italian readytowear 
presentations 
it is true that the overall impression of the fiveday showings 
which ended thursday is calm and relaxed with long skirts and 
loose pants replacing the hiphugging supershort items which shook 
the fashion world last fall 
but it is also true that some of the more candid abovethewaist 
shots favored by the almost allmale crew of fashion 
photographers could never appear in a us paper 
the boldest of these a fullfront of the tinybreasted 
icelandic model brynja at the gianni versace show wearing a sheer 
chiffon blouse with nothing underneath was widely published in the 
italian press including the prestigious milan daily corriere 
della sera 
but bare breasts are everyday fare in this country where 
topless sunbathers lie sidebyside with picnicking families on 
beaches television puts few veils on its dancers in variety shows 
and family magazines display nudity on the cover 
most torsos were not as boldly bared as brynjas but the nude 
look of the 1960s is certainly making a come back 
many designers including gianfranco ferre keith varty for 
byblos moschino and of course hotblooded versace champion of 
the tightest version of last years miniskirt bared the flesh 
some presented bolero jackets over a nude midriff others cut 
their tops so short that they did not cover the essential and 
others still dipped below the waist to bare the navel while they 
covered the bosom in bandeau bras 
at times the nude look passed for ethnic as in the many 
outfits which drew inspiration from the tropics at others it was 
less innocent as in the ferre and versace evening wear where it 
was very definitely intended for disco drama 
the bared midriff is sure to offer consolation to the male 
population which judging from the comments heard off the milan 
runway are bemoaning the demise of short skirts for next years 
warmer weather however whether women will be as easily seduced by 
the new look remains to be seen

here are excerpts from the grand jury report on the tawana 
brawley case 
based upon all the evidence that has been presented to the 
grand jury we conclude that tawana brawley was not the victim of a 
forcible sexual assault by multiple assailants over a fourday 
period there is no evidence that any sexual assault occurred 
the grand jury further concludes there is nothing in regard 
to tawana brawleys appearance on nov 28 that is inconsistent with 
this condition having been selfinflicted 
there is no evidence that a coverup occurred or was 
attempted in this case 
based upon our investigation the grand jury has found no 
legally sufficient evidence to charge any person with a crime or to 
establish that a crime occurred 
there may be questions that some think should be answered 
that are not dealt with by this report the grand jury however 
may not go beyond the limitations imposed upon it by law we 
believe that we have answered all those questions that we were 
lawfully permitted to address 
at some point between tuesday evening nov 24 and the time 
she was found on saturday nov 28 tawana brawley had significant 
contact with and spent a period of undetermined duration in 
apartment 19a the former brawley family apartment in wappingers 
falls ny outside of which she was found 
all the items and instrumentalities necessary to create the 
condition in which tawana brawley appeared on saturday nov 28 
were present inside of or in the immediate vicinity of apartment 
19a the razor blade found inside apartment 19a is consistent 
with the instrument used to cut the word nigger into the side 
of ms brawleys pink shoe and to cut open the white boots there 
was no blood found inside the shoe and we conclude that the shoe 
could not have been worn when cut the feces found on the pink 
blouse and shoe ms brawley was wearing when found and on the 
gloves found in the bag in which she was discovered contained 
dog hairs which were consistent with the hairs from a dog owned by 
the occupant of apartment 21a 
there is no medical or forensic evidence that a sexual 
assault was committed on tawana brawley if a 15yearold girl has 
been forcibly raped or sodomized by multiple assailants over a 
fourday period there is a high probability that medical or 
forensic evidence would have been found 
when discovered tawana brawley was not suffering from 
exposure if an individual had been outdoors continuously from 
tuesday evening nov 24 to saturday afternoon nov 28 when the 
temperature several times dropped to the freezing point there is a 
high probability the individual would have suffered from exposure 
when discovered tawana brawley was not malnourished

most demonstrations have supported the cause of serbs in kosovo 
a largely christian minority they claim harassment by 
predominantly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of 
kosovos 2 million people the southern province borders on albania 
the latest protesters sang serbian nationalist songs but also 
shouted complaints about low wages and declining standards of 
living state television said an informal poll it conducted of 
demonstrators in novi sad showed that most cited the bad economic 
situation as the main reason for demanding change 
milosevic rejected a call thursday from former defense minister 
nikola ljubicic who is a member of the nations collective 
presidency for unspecified emergency measures to quell the street 
protests 
the serbian leaders opponents suspect he is using the mass 
rallies to gain more national power for himself and for serbia the 
largest of yugoslavias six republics 
many serbs see milosevic as political heir to the late president 
josip broz tito who died in 1980 and left the nation with a 
complex system of annual rotation in the occupants of top political 
offices 
the arrangement has prevented any one republic from gaining 
dominance but it has not provided the strong leadership needed to 
deal effectively with ethnic and economic problems strikes and 
worker protests have become commonplace because of 217 percent 
annual inflation 15 percent unemployment and austerity plans 
imposed to try to repay a 21 billion foreign debt 
the failure of the federal communist government led by premier 
branko mikulic to cope with the economic crisis triggered an 
attempt to unseat him in may with a parliamentary vote of 
noconfidence mikulic staved off the effort with support from 
serbian deputies

two suburban minneapolis children were killed 
by automatic garage doors in separate accidents the same day and 
authorities say the devices probably did not meet current safety 
standards due to their age 
were interested in finding out who manufactured those 
devices who installed them and how they were maintained said 
dennis donath an investigator for the us consumer products 
safety commission 
both victims daniel louis tracy 10 and abigael j henry 9 
were asphyxiated by pressure of the doors against their chests 
according to autopsy reports both died wednesday before relatives 
discovered them 
officials believe the children were operating the devices by 
themselves when they were caught by the closing doors both devices 
were at least 10 years old officials said 
daniel apparently was knocked off his bicycle by the door on his 
parents garage and pinned to the ground the door caught him on 
his chin said sgt bill lunzer of the roseville police department 
abigael was probably running out to meet her 5yearold sister 
molly at a bus stop authorities said molly found her sister 
pinned under the garage door of their eden prairie home 
federal authorities have documented 32 garagedoor deaths of 
children under age 12 since voluntary safety standards for the 
automatic openers were last upgraded in 1982 donath said the last 
known garagedoor death occurred in 1980 
a lot of the early models with the reversible feature never 
did work properly said brian beckman owner of northern door co 
in maplewood 
he recommended that homeowners test their automatic garage doors 
simply by trying to stop them by hand if one does not stop or 
reverse he recommended installing a new unit

a new state law requiring unmarried 
minors to obtain parental consent for abortions was put on hold by 
a federal judge who ruled that the measure fell woefully short 
of constitutional requirements 
us district judge john h moore said the preliminary 
injunction he issued thursday would stand until further order of 
the court 
it prevents gov bob martinez attorney general bob butterworth 
and state attorneys from enforcing the law which requires 
unmarried teens under 18 to seek the consent of a parent custodian 
or legal guardian before obtaining an abortion 
if parents refused to give consent a pregnant teenager could 
appeal to a judge who would decide if the girl was mature enough 
to make the decision and whether an abortion was in her best 
interest 
moores ruling means that the young women of florida can do 
what they want with their bodies and exercise their constitutional 
right to have an abortion said attorney william j sheppard who 
represented a womens clinic and three physicians who challenged 
the law 
penny gardner president of the dade county chapter of the 
national organization for women called the ruling a wonderful 
victory 
the state legislature was particularly thoughtless in passing 
that bill and they responded to the antichoice people without 
really considering what it really meant to the women of this 
state she said 
but carole griffin a tallahassee antiabortion lobbyist said 
even parents who are adamantly proabortion want to be involved 
with their minor daughters decision she said she expects the 
injunction to be overturned the order followed arguments in a 
90minute hearing wednesday that the law unconstitutionally 
restricts access to abortion for pregnant girls under 18 
sheppard argued that the statute unduly burdens a minors 
right to abortion by failing to adequately prescribe procedures for 
ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of minors and that it 
fails to establish sufficient guidelines for an expeditious appeal 
of a circuit court decision 
assistant attorney general george waas argued the law is 
constitutional and said legislation is not required to address 
all variables in the vast expanse of human experience 
moore pointed out that the us supreme court has recognized a 
womans constitutional right to an abortion and that the right had 
been extended to minors 
moore said said the law when measured against supreme court 
precedent falls woefully short of constitutional requirements

overnight aerial spraying to kill a 
mediterranean fruit fly infestation left much of the citys west 
side looking like christo artwork as residents wrapped cars 
playground equipment and other belongings in plastic 
pesticideladen helicopters crisscrossed a 35squaremile area 
until early today in the first step of an allout attack against 
the medfly an agricultural pest that destroys about 250 varieties 
of produce 
the insecticide malathion poses no health risk agriculture 
officials said but they warned residents that the sticky corn 
syrup in which it was mixed to attract the flies could damage a 
cars paint 
the alert prompted a run on tarpaulins and plastic wrap at 
stores throughout the area 
people say a lot of chain stores are out of the stuff said 
allan goldman of culver city hardware 
the effect of the protective measures was especially striking at 
the los angeles county art museum where outdoor sculptures swathed 
in black plastic and tape recalled fences and bridges transformed 
into artworks through similar wrapping by christo the 
bulgarianborn artist 
the spraying was ordered because 47 medflies were found in the 
palms area since sept 26 agricultural officials said 
but aerial spraying was only the first step in the threepart 
attack against the pest said gera curry a spokeswoman for the 
california department of food and agriculture 
a quarantine against transporting fruit and vegetables from the 
area is expected to go into effect today or monday she said 
the final step will be the release of millions of sterile 
medflies later this month so that the wild medflies that survived 
the spraying will in effect breed themselves out of existence 
although agricultural production in the urbanized area is 
slight officials termed the infestation serious saying it would 
threaten the states 155 billionayear farm economy if allowed 
to spread 
along with parts of beverly hills the helicopters sprayed 
sections of west los angeles and the adjacent municipalities of 
culver city and west hollywood 
about 100000 people live in the sprayed area which includes 
middleclass homes and apartments multimilliondollar mansions 
swank shops and luxury car dealerships 
for much of the day ms curry said worried residents flooded 
hot lines set up by agriculture officials with questions about the 
spraying 
at paulee body shop president ken fleiner assigned four 
employees to cover more than 180 mostly highpriced automobiles 
parked outdoors fleiner said he spent about 500 on plastic and 
200 on masking tape for the job which took hours 
at martin cadillac in west los angeles a caravan of about 100 
shiny caddies left the sales lot wednesday night for an underground 
parking lot at a bank building six blocks away sales manager steve 
mitchell said thursday

two american human rights groups 
claimed today that filipino soldiers may be linked to the killings 
of five human rights lawyers and the harassment of a dozen others 
since last year 
a report by the lawyers committee for human rights and asia 
watch both new yorkbased groups claimed president corazon 
aquinos government has failed to respond adequately to attacks 
on human rights lawyers and that victims of abuses were afraid to 
seek legal redress 
the 28page report cited the unsolved killings of five human 
rights lawyers who were slain in separate incidents from october 
1987 until last june 
it said evidence existed that the military or militarybacked 
anticommunist vigilante groups may have been involved in the 
killings 
the report by the two groups said more than a dozen other 
lawyers have been subjected to threats harassment and surveillance 
since 1987 
it urged the aquino government to publicly and unambiguously 
express its commitment to the protection of human rights lawyers 
and its condemnation of the killings threats and harassment 
victims of abuses are often afraid to pursue legal redress 
said the report written by norman dorsen professor of law at new 
york university and nadine strossen visiting professor of law at 
new york law school 
those who do often discover that those responsible are 
shielded from prosecution by the local military detachment the 
report said 
there was no comment from the government on the charges 
mrs aquino has vowed to curb human rights abuses but last 
month she said it was unfair to blame the entire military 
establishment for abuses by a few of its members 
the report was released two days after the londonbased amnesty 
international human rights organization claimed more than 100 
leftists trade unionists and social activists were slain in the 
philippines last year because of alleged links to communist rebels 
human rights groups here claim such abuses are continuing 
despite mrs aquinos pledge to protect civil liberties after the 
1986 ouster of president ferdinand marcos 
during a human rights seminar here thursday military officials 
and civil rights workers clashed over the governments plans to 
deploy a new civilian militia the citizens armed forces 
geographical unit to help battle the rebels 
undersecretary of defense eduardo ermita said the 160000member 
armed forces alone could not contend with the 25000strong new 
peoples army moslem insurgents and rightwing extremists he said 
members of the new force would be carefully screened and would face 
courtmartial for any human rights abuses 
but mariss diokno a prominent human rights activist said the 
new force was antidemocratic and a step toward militarization 
that social activists hoped would be reversed following marcos 
ouster

foreign nations are shunning burmas 
threeweekold military government that has cracked down on a 
popular uprising for democracy diplomats said today 
the main official contacts have involved notes from several 
foreign embassies decrying the bloodshed since gen saw maung 
seized power in a coup 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said no 
nation has sent the standard message of congratulations to the new 
leader which would signify recognition of his government 
diplomats also said saw maung who also serves as the new foreign 
minister has met no heads of foreign missions 
ambassadors of the european community and japan last month 
presented protest notes citing the killing of unarmed civilians by 
troops other countries including the united states have 
expressed concern from their capitals 
meanwhile state radio reported thursday that two more 
opposition groups have registered with the government bringing to 
seven the number of opposition parties that have surfaced since saw 
maung seized power 
the newest parties to register with the election commission were 
the unity and development party led by former communist rebel 
thakin soe and the antifascist peoples freedom league headed by 
onetime member of parliament bo kya nyunt 
thakin soe 80 once led the red flag communist rebels who 
followed a radical trotskyite program but were defeated by the 
burmese military in the 1960s the peoples democratic party which 
registered earlier also is headed by a former communist figure 
the new military government which seized power in sept 18 
crushed prodemocracy demonstrations but announced that multiparty 
elections would be held in about three months 
although seven parties have registered with the commission none 
have stated clearly whether they would take part in the elections 
which also will be contested by the governments national unity 
party 
diplomats and other analysts are skeptical that fair elections 
can be held given a hardline government that has been willing to 
shoot thousands of unarmed demonstrators to stay in power 
by official count about 440 people have been killed since the 
military coup western diplomats here believe the death toll is 
much higher 
other antigovernment groups are the democracy party the 
peoples youth federation the all burma united youths organization 
and the national league for democracy 
the patron of an eighth antigovernment group the league for 
democracy is nu the former prime minister overthrown by 
strongman ne win in 1962 
western diplomats say they are convinced the national unity 
party is fully supported by saw maung and his military government 
but that the new leaders want their actions to appear legal so as 
to subdue strong antigovernment feelings among the public 
since last fall burma has been wracked by bloody protests and a 
deteriorating economy demonstrators have called for the end of 
authoritarian rule and a liberalized economy to pull one of asias 
most resourcerich nations out of poverty 
japan west germany and the united states have temporarily 
frozen aid to burma but have refrained from direct interference in 
the domestic turmoil 
in tokyo the foreign ministry announced today japan would 
provide burma with 450000 in emergency food aid through unicef 
because of serious shortages 
but foreign minister sosuke uno stressed at a news conference 
that this doesnt mean we approve of saw maungs military 
government

south korea a full democracy

five nuns remained barricaded today 
in their monastery fighting a church relocation order prompted by 
their objection to the introduction of such modern amenities as 
television and music systems 
fearing they would be evicted from the monastery because their 
conservative views clashed with the new wave of liberalization 
four nuns locked themselves in the infirmary of the monastery of 
the most blessed virgin mary of mt carmel on tuesday a fifth nun 
joined them wednesday 
the nuns are members of the order of discalced carmelites they 
say the first intrusion began just over a year ago when a new 
prioress brought in a television set 
other trappings of the outside world slowly found their way 
behind the white walls of the monastery music systems sweets and 
a modern lighting system in the chapel 
it just became a gradual breakdown of traditions said 
sister john of the cross 
these sisters are keeping a vigil they are not protesting 
doreen ercolano the sibling of one of the nuns sister maria said 
thursday 
they are fearful that if they leave the infirmary theyll be 
physically forced from the monastery 
sister eliane who has been at the monastery the longest time 
among the 13 nuns said the dispute is a conservativeliberal 
issue 
they do not agree with some changes made here she said 
they are scared to death 
tim manning a spokesman for the roman catholic diocese of 
paterson said there are no plans to physically evict the nuns but 
the church will try to talk them into ending the protest 
the conservative nuns say the diocese threatened to evict them 
from the monastery because of their adherence to their religious 
order 
we were told we are too strict sister john said thursday in 
a telephone interview from the monasterys locked infirmary we 
were always encouraged to be conservative but in the last year 
every aspect of our lives has changed 
the carmelite order was founded in 1562 by st teresa avila of 
spain its followers try to remove all intrusions of modern life 
and dedicate themselves to contemplation and prayer although there 
is no vow of silence the order is expected to keep speech to a 
minimum 
the monastery of the most blessed virgin mary of mt carmel was 
built in 1926 when this community 30 miles west of new york city 
was remote and rural today the spanish architecture stands in 
contrast to a suburban backdrop of gleaming office buildings and 
service stations 
the dispute began with the arrival of a new prioress mother 
teresa hewitt who brought television music and other modern 
conveniences to the monastery angering the more conservative nuns 
who complained to the vatican 
mother hewitt refused comment thursday vatican officials in 
washington did not return telephone calls 
the church had tried to settle the matter by offering to move 
the more conservative carmelite nuns to another monastery but the 
conservative nuns refused to move

president corazon aquino visited one 
of the countrys most historic shrines today to decide whether to 
allow an american firm continue a controversial treasure hunt there 
mrs aquino told reporters she was very pleased with the 
restoration of chambers unearthed by nearly a year of digging at 
fort santiago a 16th century spanish fortress used by japanese 
troops as a concentration camp for american and filipino prisoners 
during world war ii 
she added that she and her staff need more time to determine 
whether to renew for a third time the digging permit given the firm 
international precious metals inc of las vegas nev 
the firms head charles mcdougal and emanuel soriano mrs 
aquinos chief security adviser insist that tons of gold bullion 
are buried beneath the fort they claim core drillings have yielded 
gold particles 
the digging has been dogged by controversy since shortly after 
it began secretly in november the treasure hunt became public in 
february when two filipino workers were killed in a cavein 
last month the governments antigraft prosecutor accused 
soriano of accepting payments from the company soriano admitted he 
deposited a total 110000 of company funds in his personal bank 
account but claimed it was simply entrusted to him pending a 
company reorganization 
soriano said the funds included 40000 as a guarantee against 
damages to the fort built by spanish colonialists at the mouth of 
the pasig river to defend the city 
fort santiago served as prison to jose rizal the philippiness 
national hero who was executed in 1896 and was converted into a 
concentration camp and torture center by japanese soldiers during 
world war ii 
soriano and mcdougal told mrs aquino they had maps and at least 
two witnesses who have showed them the places where the japanese 
imperial army officers buried tons of gold silver diamonds and 
other treasures plundered by the japanese from all over southeast 
asia 
asked by reporters if she was going to renew the permit to dig 
which expired on sept 1 mrs aquino replied she was more 
interested in the restoration work on the newly unearthed portions 
of the fort 
we have not given any extension of the permit yet she 
added we are still evaluating all of the different reports that 
we have been getting so that we can evaluate later on whether 
we will grant an extension or not

following is a roundup of editorial reaction to the vice 
presidential debate from newspapers around the country 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sen lloyd bentsen accomplished three tasks with the most 
memorable line of wednesday nights vicepresidential debate when 
he told j danforth quayle senator youre no jack kennedy with 
that remark he helped establish himself as by far the better of 
the two candidates and in a close presidential election he may 
have given many reagan democrats as good a reason as they need to 
come back to the fold next month 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if quayle had only one decent answer to the question he 
faced at least three times the one about what he would do if a 
tragedy thrust him into the presidency we would have been more 
reassured but obviously he either hadnt anticipated the question 
or didnt want to answer it 
he would say a prayer for himself and the country good he 
would call together the cabinet good but then what sen quayle 
prefered to talk about his qualifications rather than give us a 
clue that he had a thoughtful plan in mind 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the debate seemed to confirm the awfulness of george bushs 
decision to choose dan quayle as running mate michael dukakis 
choice looked better lloyd bentsen was more polished more 
experienced more adept at ripostes like his nowfamous slashing of 
quayles selfcomparison with john kennedy but the erratic 
proceedings wednesday night offered little basis for solid 
comparison it was an opportunity wasted 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nothing in mr quayles performance provided reassurance that 
he is ready to stand on the verge of the presidency or that mr 
bush acted with thenunrecognized wisdom in selecting him 
mr bentsen no surprise was the cooler cannier head in 
part simply because of his greater experience 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
quayle in our view was mechanical in his responses to the 
panels questions reverting on several occasions to the same 
phraseology about his qualifications regardless of the question 
asked a reflection of briefings and rehearsals 
bentsen presented a mature and thoughtful figure drawing a 
sharp contrast with quayle on relative leadership qualities and 
experience relative ages may have been a factor perhaps depending 
upon the viewers generation but bentsens broader experience 
clearly testified to his benefit

wednesdays vice presidential debate wont be remembered for 
exchanges about social security farm subsidies or foreign policy 
the debate turned on one question is j danforth quayle iii 
qualified to be president should anything happen to george bush 
three times indianas junior senator was asked how he would handle 
such a crisis three times he faltered 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sen quayle stood up fairly well to some tough maybe even 
unfair questioning he did not fall on his face as some pundits 
had expected but he never gave a satisfactory answer to three 
questions about what he would do first if he became president but 
at the same time sen bentsen proved that he not only is a 
knowledgeable articulate officeholder who has a solid record of 
achievement but that he can be awfully tough in the clutch

here are the latest developments involving foreign hostages held 
in lebanon 
beirut lebanon lebanese kidnappers warned that two american 
hostages may be in danger if proposals to send un troops into 
lebanon to oversee presidential elections are carried out 
the revolutionary justice organization made the threat in a 
statement issued thursday the group claims to hold joseph james 
cicippio of norristown pa and edward austin tracy of burlington 
vt

saying it might improve discipline in the citys 
public schools mayor edward i koch has arranged for a clothing 
manufacturer to donate student uniforms as a tryout 
koch said he wants to try putting public school students in 
uniforms comparable to the dress codes in parochial or private 
schools with the thought that it might help in the learning process 
to have that kind of discipline 
the mayor said thursday that he has asked schools chancellor 
richard r green to pick a school of about 400 students and send 
their measurements to the manufacturer who was not identified 
an aide to green said the chancellor would try to locate an 
elementary school where the principal and parents would be willing 
to participate 
robert wagner jr president of the board of education 
expressed skepticism at the suggestion but said he was willing to 
give it a try 
the mayor disclosed the plan at a park restoration project in 
queens 
i dont tell you that just jackets and skirts and pants that 
match the jackets is a solution to our education problem but i 
believe that there are lots of things that have to be done he 
said

tests on a home that had radon 
levels about 800 times higher than the federal safety standard have 
failed to convince some neighbors that the colorless odorless gas 
could kill them officials said 
the test last week on an unidentified home may be the highest 
radon levels ever measured in a structure 
we believe its the highest that anyones ever found said 
christopher daggett acting commissioner of the department of 
environmental protection 
officials said that 59 of the 74 other nearby homes in the rural 
community about 40 miles west of new york city also showed unsafe 
radon levels 
many homes that have registered high radon readings sit above 
the reading prong a belt of uranium that stretches from 
pennsylvania across northeastern new jersey into new york 
the federal standard for structures is 4 picocuries a unit of 
measurement for radioactivity 
federal officials say exposure to high levels of the naturally 
occurring gas may cause up to 20000 lung cancer deaths a year 
essentially all those not caused from smoking 
john van nuys an investigator for the hunterdon county health 
department spent the weekend knocking on doors in the sprawling 
development urging residents to place charcoalfilled canisters in 
their basements for testing 
he said he met with some distrustful and suspicious residents 
and several slammed doors 
some were only convinced of the urgency because it was important 
enough to get a government employee working on a saturday 
when a sampling of residents were told thursday of the states 
findings some said they didnt know much about radon some said 
they didnt care much and some said they didnt care to talk about 
the levels found in their homes 
others said they have had their homes tested or are awaiting 
test results 
officials said that although a radon test only costs about 10 
and a high level is easily cured with a ventilation system for 
about 1200 apathy is the biggest challenge in fighting the 
health problem 
they also say that many residents may ignore warnings because 
they have grown immune to the constant stream of warnings about 
environmental problems 
the announcement about the clinton township home comes about two 
years after state officials discovered 105 houses with elevated 
radon levels in a nearby development 
daggett said the barrage of testing here began after a homeowner 
did a routine radon test and found a reading of about 200 
picocuries the department confirmed the results and began testing 
other homes 
daggett said the home with the highest reading registered more 
than 3000 picocuries 
the federal safety standard of 4 picocuries is the equivalent of 
smoking onehalf pack of cigarettes a day or having 200 to 300 
chest xrays per year it also is the concentration that would 
increase the chance of getting lung cancer by 1 percent for a 
lifetime resident

federal health officials have reported the first 
case of aids acquired from a transplant operation but researchers 
stressed that the operation was four years ago before the advent 
of aids testing 
transplant patients have previously been infected with the virus 
that causes aids but thursdays report from the us centers for 
disease control marked the first time aids virus has been 
associated with a bone transplant and the first case ever reported 
in which any kind of transplant has resulted in aids itself 
this is consistent with how we have found the virus to be 
transmitted previously in blood bodily fluids and body parts 
from another individual its an expected mode of 
transmission said dr john ward an aids specialist with the 
atlantabased cdc 
ward noted that the surgery in question took place before the 
advent of antibody testing for aids the donor was an intravenous 
drug user infected with aids 
its important for the lay public to understand that this case 
occurred in 1984 the donor could not be screened he said 
since then aids tests have become available and the public 
health service has recommended that all donors of tissue or organs 
be tested for aids infection 
this first aidstransplant case occurred in a woman with 
progressive spinal disease who in november 1984 underwent a 
spinal fusion using bone from her hospitals bone bank in february 
1988 she was diagnosed with aids she was a health care worker 
but there were no indications she had contracted an aids infection 
on the job the cdc reported 
the donor from whom the bone came a 52yearold man who had 
undergone a partial hip bone removal turned out to be an 
intravenous drug user and thus at high risk for aids he was 
diagnosed with aids less than two years after the womans surgery 
and died in 1987 
the public health service the cdcs parent agency recommended 
thursday that living donors of bone be tested for aids at the time 
the bone is removed and then again 90 days later to ensure that 
any aids infection is detected 
more than 74000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states with more than 42000 deaths so far according to the cdc 
some 24 cases of aids virus transmission through transplants 
have been reported worldwide in cases such as kidney liver and 
heart transplants ward said none of those patients has been 
diagnosed with aids itself but undoubtedly some will develop 
aids in the future he said

president reagan campaigning for george bush in 
a key campaign battleground state told michigan high school 
students today that this years election is a referendum on 
liberalism in america 
in a speech prepared for students and citizens of suburban 
sterling heights reagan urged every eligible voter to take part in 
the nov 8 election 
michigan has voted twice for what we stand for he said 
but the liberals are now saying that come january they will 
wipe away all that we have beeen working for 
from top to bottom the election this year is a referendum on 
liberalism said reagan who is republican presidential candidate 
george bushs bestknown campaign surrogate 
will not only the white house but the congress and the state 
legislatures be filled with people whose only pledge of allegiance 
is to more government spending he asked 
reagan flew to detroit to hammer away at the gop theme of 
peace and prosperity at a school named for the late adlai 
stevenson a prominent democrat and twotime presidential campaign 
loser 
the trip was part of a series reagan is making as he seeks to 
lure reagan democrats and independent voters to bushs side in 
the vice presidents race against massachusetts democrat michael 
dukakis 
it also was a homecoming of sorts since it was in detroits joe 
louis arena that reagan in july 1980 accepted his partys 
nomination for the first time to be its presidential candidate 
and chose bush to be his running mate 
most experts rate michigan a tossup between bush and dukakis 
reagan felt so strongly about carrying the state during his 
reelection campaign in 1984 that he appeared twice in the last 
week of the campaign the presidents last appearance in michigan 
was in september 1986 when he campaigned for bill lucas a 
republican who failed in his bid to become governor of michigan 
reagan also was speaking at a luncheon hosted by the michigan 
state chamber of commerce and the michigan chapter of the national 
federation of independent business in the northeastern detroit 
suburb of macomb county 
his appearance there comes just a week after bushs visit to 
macomb community college political experts in michigan say both 
stops are part of an organized effort to win over that areas 
bluecollar democrats who crossed party lines to support the 
president in 1980 and 1984 
reagan in recent weeks has been fond of telling campaign 
audiences that democrats abandoned the socalled misery index 
when that party found that inflation and interest rates had 
declined during his administration 
while reagan seeks to help bush broaden his electoral appeal to 
conservative democrats and people who do not describe themselves as 
either democrats or republicans the president has been raising 
millions of dollars for state gop campaign coffers 
reagan was sure to repeat this act with tonights appearance at 
a 1000aplate fundraiser for the state party and in honor of 
max fisher a prominent detroitarea gop supporter

two public opinion polls published today showed 
a tie between the dovish labor party and the hardline likud bloc 
and the two rivals swapped accusations in a series of television 
advertisements 
results of those questioned in the two polls showed labor and 
likud would win 42 seats each in the 120member parliament if the 
nov 1 election were held today the results were published in the 
yediot ahronot newspaper 
the 1984 elections ended in a stalemate with neither of the 
major political blocs able to form a coalition the result was 
shared rule in a national unity government with labor leader shimon 
peres and likud leader yitzhak shamir each serving two years as 
premier 
the likudsponsored dahaf poll predicted likud and its 
rightwing allies would win 60 seats in the knesset while labor 
and the left secured an equal number 
the laborsponsored decima poll said labor and the leftist lists 
would gain a narrow majority of 61 seats 
the dahaf poll questioned 662 voters and the decima poll 
encompassed 1000 voters the paper did not disclose the margin of 
error given and the offices of both pollsters were closed for the 
jewish sabbath 
also today americanborn rabbi meir kahane appealed to israels 
supreme court requesting it overturn a central elections committee 
decision to disqualify his antiarab party from running in the 
elections 
the parliamentary committee barred kahanes kach party from 
participating in the elections saying its platform calling for all 
arabs to be expelled from israel is racist a new law bars racist 
parties from running for government 
in a third day of televised ads that will continue nightly until 
the nov 1 vote the barbed repartee between labor and likud came 
as close to a televised debate as the campaign has seen so far 
no one in this country is against peace said benyamin 
netanyahu the former un ambassador and a rising star in likud 
but what labor wants is peace through retreat from the occupied 
territories 
he was referring to peres willingness to talk peace with the 
palestinians even though labor refuses to negotiate with the 
banned palestine liberation organization 
immediately after the likud segment ended labors nissim zvili 
appeared on the screen 
so youre scared huh they scared the heck out of us didnt 
they zvili said thats the likud system frightening people 
making personal attacks and frightening again 
labor has outlined the generals peace plan it is pushing 
socalled because it was developed with the help of highranking 
officers in israels reserve army 
the plan calls for withdrawing from certain undefined areas of 
the occupied territories but demanding those territories remain 
demilitarized in order to guarantee safe borders 
israel expanded its borders in the 1967 middle east war when it 
captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt 
shamir has pledged never to return to the pre1967 borders 
the nearly 10monthold palestinian revolt against israeli rule 
is the top issue in the tight election campaign 
more than 280 arabs and six israelis have been killed in the 
violence which erupted dec 8 
both parties oppose creation of an independent palestinian state

not trigger discussion worth the price

responsible for one of the great shakeups in our governments 
history mcauley told the boston globe 
jean graham editorinchief of the heights the independent 
student weekly newspaper at the university said it doesnt seem 
like they the student board took the opposition to heart i think 
they brought him because he would be controversial and would draw a 
lot of people but they may lose more people than they draw 
she wrote an editorial against the choice and said a group of 
students is gathering signatures to try to block norths appearance 
for 18000 i was told we could have had jimmy carter and 
hes a former president she said i dont think we can learn 
that much from oliver north 
north faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the 
government in the irancontra armsforhostages plan he has given 
more than 25 speeches in the past year to raise money for his 
defense 
last year former democratic sen gary hart of colorado and 
former us supreme court nominee robert bork lectured at the 
college for a combined charge of less than 30000 said douglas j 
whiting director of communications for the college 
the money for the appearance comes from a student activities 
fund created through a mandatory student assessment fee whiting 
said he said that in the past the fund had been used for several 
lectures but this year the board voted to spend most of it for

leaders of this weeks siege of atlanta 
begged for more people to attend todays demonstrations during the 
final day of antiabortion protests after a dramatic drop in 
attendance 
the pleas apparently paid off because about 50 people were 
arrested today in two waves of protests at the midtown hospital 
the rev joseph foreman regional director of the new yorkbased 
antiabortion group operation rescue told about 40 people at a 
rally thursday night to gather early today for a private strategy 
session 
weve gotten predictable foreman said earlier at a rally at 
st jude the apostle roman catholic church 
atlanta police first arrested 33 demonstrators early today for 
blocking clinic entrances as some patients had to be taken over 
police barricades to get inside according to witnesses later 
about 20 more demonstrators were taken into custody 
police did not show the force this morning that they have used 
this week instead asking the protesters to walk to police buses 
like gentlemen and ladies when the demonstrators refused they 
were carried but not dragged off the clinic property and into 
the buses 
several dozen supporters stood on the sidelines singing hymns 
the demonstrations part of a week of protests dubbed the 
siege of atlanta began tuesday when 343 of an estimated 800 
protesters were arrested since then participation both in the 
daytime demonstrations outside the clinics and nighttime rallies 
has fallen steadily 
only 14 people were arrested wednesday and 11 thursday the 
rallies have dwindled from 1000 people monday to fewer than 250 
thursday 
speakers at thursdays rally repeatedly begged for more people 
to attend the demonstrations either to risk arrest or provide 
prayer support 
im pleading with you before the lord to come with us tomorrow 
whether you plan to rescue or not operation rescue head 
randall terry said thursday terry and other leaders say they are 
not demonstrating but are rescuing fetuses from being killed 
before they are born 
despite the shrinking numbers protest leaders maintain they are 
shutting down clinics temporarily and preventing abortions from 
being performed clinic operators deny that claim saying the only 
disruption has been in some rescheduled abortions 
protest leaders also have complained about police brutality 
mainly during tuesdays arrests and charge that police are 
deliberately preventing protesters from from getting out of jail 
but many of those arrested have refused to give their real 
names calling themselves instead baby jane doe or baby john doe 
officials said 
that identification tactic was used in earlier protests with 
demonstrators saying they were expressing solidarity with what they 
called the anonymous victims of abortion authorities have refused 
to release protesters who dont give their real names 
of the 368 arrested during the first three days police said 
thursday that 30 had made bond which was set at 650 
to combat the demonstrations atlantas seven clinics that 
perform abortions have cooperated by shifting patients from one 
clinic to another or helping provide escorts through the 
demonstrators 
members of operation rescue first appeared in atlanta during the 
democratic national convention in july and stayed in town for much 
of the summer since the protests began more than 1100 
antiabortion protesters have been jailed mostly on trespassing 
charges 
the most rev eugene marino archbishop of atlanta has endorsed 
the groups efforts 
in san francisco a federal appeals court thursday refused to 
overturn an injunction prohibiting antiabortion activists in 
portland from physically intimidating patrons of a health clinic or 
yelling loud enough to disrupt business inside 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said that the injunction 
by a us district court magistrate in portland does not abridge 
first amendment rights of free speech and is not too vague 
advocates for life a nonprofit corporation that engages in 
abortion protests appealed the ruling

terry waite the anglican church envoy 
who has been missing in lebanon for more than 20 months will be 
freed soon two beirut publications reported today 
one of the publications the weekly magazine ashshiraa also 
said american hostages will be released before the us 
presidential election on nov 8 
both ashshiraa and the conservative daily alanwar cited 
unidentified informed sources for its report there was no way to 
confirm that waites release was imminent 
alanwar said one of its sources reported that waite has been 
moved from the bekaa valley to beiruts southern suburbs and 
predicted he will be released in 72 hours 
but the newspaper said another source claimed waite 48 will be 
freed after resumption of britishsyrian relations 
ashshiraa based in moslem west beirut said waite and two 
other british hostages will be released very soon 
the magazine said a recent decision for the restoration of full 
diplomatic relations between britain and iran provided a strong 
impetus to efforts currently underway for the release of waite and 
his countrymen 
ashshiraa also quoted an unidentified informed security source 
as saying mondays release of hostage mithileshwar singh an indian 
national and legal resident alien of the united states marked 
the beginning of the release of american hostages 
the source said american hostages would be released before the 
us presidential election the report added without further 
elaboration

gen augusto pinochet rejected demands 
that he resign as president before his term expires in 1990 and 
said the military will continue to play a key role in chiles 
future 
the 72yearold ruler spoke to the nation after police armed 
with clubs fired water cannons and tear gas at crowds who swarmed 
the streets thursday to celebrate pinochets defeat in a national 
referendum 
police said today that two people were killed in the 
demonstrations including a 14yearold boy shot by unidentified 
attackers and a 31yearold robber shot by police 
unknown assailants shot two other people who were in serious 
condition today police said eight officers were injured one 
seriously and 58 demonstrators were detained and later released 
police said 
the capital was calm this morning after street scuffles between 
roving bands of youths and police in jeeps and water trucks lasted 
until midnight 
in his first public statement since the wednesday ballot which 
he lost by a margin of more than 11 percent pinochet declared 
thursday night i recognize and accept the majority verdict 
expressed yesterday by the citizenry 
according to the terms of an 8yearold constitution pinochet 
remains in power until march 1990 when he will be succeeded by the 
winner of open elections planned for late next year 
pinohet is not barred from running in the election he has not 
indicated whether he plans to run 
reading from a text the 72yearold pinochet warned the 
opposition that its plans to amend the existing constitution to 
speed up his departure would be in vain 
no one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist 
what the people decided he said in reference to the 
constitution which was approved by voters in 1980 in a loosely 
staged vote that critics complain was rife with fraud 
wednesdays vote was wellorganized massively attended and free 
of charges of fraud or violence pinochet expressed the deep 
pride i feel at the civic maturity with which each one of you faced 
this act of singular importance 
pinochet was dressed in his white dress generals uniform for 
the taped speech broadcast nationwide on all television and radio 
stations 
triumphant opposition leaders thursday vowed to press their 
demands for pinochet to allow quick elections and step down soon 
pinochet seized power in the 1973 coup that toppled elected 
president salvador allende a marxist 
an authoritarian system has been overthrown said socialist 
ricardo lagos a director of a 16party coalition that led the 
campaign for pinochets defeat it is indispensable now to elect 
within a short period of time a president and a congress with 
powers to modify the constitution 
but the opposition faces the challenge of maintaining its unity 
potentially divisive issues such as human rights trials and the 
future of the communist party could sow dissent while opposition 
leaders negotiate with the armed forces to speed the transition to 
full democracy 
political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination 
to the presidency also is expected to influence relations among the 
parties in the coalition 
the constitution drawn up by the pinochet administration calls 
for electing a congress in a year but its provisions leave the 
legislature virtually powerless to pass amendments it also gives 
the armed forces autonomy and an influential role in national 
policymaking 
pinochet leader of the army said the military will be the 
guide in building the future chile 
early thursday small groups of government opponents descended 
on downtown to celebrate the referendum result they were quickly 
joined by tens of thousands of others mostly youths who virtually 
took control of many streets and some avenues in the citys center 
marching and chanting pinochet go away and he has fallen 
police only occasionally broke up the early demonstrations but 
the protesters later became more strident and police began using 
more force when the demonstrators began throwing rocks bottles 
and sticks at officers riotcontrol squads responded with water 
cannons and tear gas in running street battles

an israeli newspaper reported today that the 
united states struck a deal with iran to free us hostages in 
lebanon including the supply of arms and spare parts to tehran 
through south korea 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the 
report not true 
the unattributed report in the nation an englishlanguage 
weekly that began publishing last month said the us government 
agreed to pay 7 million in ransom to the lebanese shiite moslem 
extremists holding most of the hostages but refused the groups 
demands for immunity from prosecution 
the united states has denied reports it is involved in 
negotiations with iran over the release of hostages 
fitzwater today said he consulted with the national security 
adviser colin powell about the story and powell said there were 
no such weapons transfers 
there are a lot of freelancers independent operators in the 
region the spokesman said but he reiterated administration 
statements that none of these independent parties is authorized to 
speak for the us government 
the report in the nation said the us refusal to guarantee 
immunity from prosecution angered the kidnappers and prompted them 
to release indian hostage mithileshwar singh on monday instead of 
alann steen a us citizen whose release had been expected 
according to the nation among the steps taken to secure the 
release of a foreign hostage was an agreement by south korea to 
sell millions of dollars in spare parts for usmade weapons 
the newspaper said that two weeks before the release of singh 
who is a permanent us resident south korean oil minister lee 
bong signed an agreement in tehran to sell the spare parts 
including those needed for the usmade f5 aircraft used in the 
iranian air force 
the reagan administration would have had to approve such a sale 
under the standard agreement signed by countries licensed to 
manufacture usdesigned weapons the newspaper said 
todays report also said us citizens who hold iranian and 
lebanese passports visited two of the hostages in january 
including terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press anderson the longest held hostage was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
reporter giora shamis told the associated press the report in 
the nation was based on interviews with three of about 15 dual 
passport holders involved in the contacts as well as south korean 
sources who confirmed an iranian report about the spare parts deal 
shamis is an owner of the londonbased news service depth 
which sold the story to the nation 
according to the report iran agreed to put up the 7 million 
ransom for the hostages because the united states did not want to 
appear to be directly purchasing their freedom 
the newspaper said the money would be paid indirectly to the 
kidnappers by iran in the form of commissions for iranian purchases 
in the united states these are to be channeled through lebanese 
and iranian businessmen to hezbollah the radical shiite group 
believed to be holding hostages 
sixteen foreign hostages are believed held in lebanon including 
nine americans

hungarys foreign minister accused warsaw 
pact ally romania of violating the human rights of its hungarian 
minority and said moscow was not taking sides in the dispute 
in an interview with the associated press peter varkonyi 
leveled the accusation against romania by name but in a speech 
tuesday to the un general assembly he decried cultural 
oppression of minorities in neighboring countries 
it is clear that our problem in this regard is with romania 
varkonyi told the ap thursday 
hungary says romanias hungarian minority is being 
systematically mistreated romania denies the accusation 
although both sides have publicly criticized each other numerous 
times in recent months varkonyis comments were unusually candid 
criticism on a senior level of an ally within the soviet bloc 
the most recent tensions involve romanian plans to raze up to 
7000 villages including about 800 ethnic hungarian communities 
the romanian leadership says it needs the land for development 
and plans to resettle the villagers in agroindustrial centers 
hungarian officials say however that the project will destroy 
deepseated traditions of the ethnic hungarians who became 
romanian citizens after world war ii when hungary was forced to 
cede the territory to romania 
in the interview varkonyi acknowledged that the conflict was 
figuring in hungariansoviet discussions but he said the soviet 
leadership would like us to solve the question directly with 
romania 
a diplomat from a soviet bloc country who spoke on condition of 
anonymity suggested that moscow was particularly reluctant to get 
involved in the dispute because of its own problems with ethnic 
unrest in armenia and the baltic republics 
romania denies its 17 million hungarians are being mistreated 
and accuses budapest of interfering in its internal affairs 
attempts late thursday for romanian comment were unsucessful no 
one answered the telephone at romanias un mission 
the resettlement plan touched off mass protests in hungary 
including a demonstration in front of the romanian embassy in 
budapest police did not intervene in the protests 
we are all concerned about a situation where an ethnic 
minority is about to be stripped of its roots said varkonyi 
referring to the resettlement project 
the foreign minister who was interviewed in hungarian denied 
that the criticism constituted interference in romanian matters 
saying we believe that the question of minority rights is not 
strictly an internal affair 
hungary has begun to accept refugees from romania the only 
soviet bloc country to give asylum to those fleeing from an allied 
nation varkonyi said about 10000 romanian citizens have fled to 
hungary most of them ethnic hungarians 
while there are no official figures on the number of ethnic 
romanians among the refugees hungarian officials estimate they 
constitute between 10 percent to 15 percent of the total most of 
them fleeing economic hardships and political repression

attorney general dick thornburgh whose 
predecessor was under criminal investigation for 14 months called 
on justice department officials under him today to develop 
proposals that will aid our employees in maintaining the highest 
ethical standards 
in his first major speech to department employees since taking 
over from edwin meese iii in august thornburgh said he had asked 
deputy attorney general harold christensen to gather the views of 
all department managers on ethical standards 
thornburgh said that among the questions that should be 
addressed are how to avoid any appearance of personal and 
financial conflict of interest how to deal with lapses in 
behavior whether jobrelated or not how should we properly 
regulate interaction between employees and outside groups what 
perks are proper and which are out of bounds 
top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals 
lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not 
permissible conduct thornburgh said 
to do otherwise allows informal and potentially subversive 
codes of conduct to be transmitted with a wink and a nod and 
encourages an inferior ethical system based on going along to get 
along or on the notion that everybodys doing it he added 
he said he had asked christensen to gather the views of all 
senior management to help in developing proposals that will aid our 
employees in maintaining the highest ethical standards 
thornburgh did not mention meese by name and the new attorney 
general brought up the issue of ethics in the context of a new 
associated pressmedia general poll showing that seven out of 10 
americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal 
government half of those polled said the federal government is not 
honest overall 
meese came under criminal investigation in may 1987 because of 
his dealings with longtime friend e robert wallach in connection 
with scandalplagued wedtech corp a south bronx ny defense 
contractor whose top executives admitted making payoffs to numerous 
public officials in exchange for assistance in obtaining federal 
contracts 
the investigation of the attorney general eventually spread to 
his actions on behalf of the regional bell telephone companies at a 
time when he held stock in them as well as other matters 
the probe culminated in july with independent counsel james 
mckay deciding not to seek an indictment but declaring publicly 
that meese had probably broken conflictofinterest laws and tax 
laws

thousands of parents lined up at clinics 
to immunize their babies against polio today in the first stage of 
israels nationwide campaign to vaccinate all residents under the 
age of 40 
the health ministry announced the campaign following an outbreak 
of the disease that has affected at least nine people 
about 32 million people will be vaccinated over the next four 
weeks according to ministry spokesman shmuel algrabli 
the campaign does not include the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip algrabli said this is because gaza residents have been 
immunized with a highly effective combined sabinsalk vaccine in 
the west bank he said officials are testing sewage to determine 
whether to extend the campaign there 
the first stage of the campaign will encompass the towns of 
rehovot near tel aviv and acre in the north where the polio virus 
has been found in sewage 
in rehovot large yellow posters plastered on the walls informed 
residents when various age groups should report to clinics for 
vaccinations 
meanwhile the tourism ministry expressed concern that reports 
of the outbreak would keep visitors away from israel 
israel has already suffered a sharp drop in tourism this year as 
a result of the 10monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
the immunization campaign was undertaken after health officials 
received the recommendations of a team of international health 
experts called to israel after the first polio cases were 
diagnosed algrabli said 
no cases of polio were reported in israel last year and only one 
case was reported in 1986 the recent cases have been blamed on 
overflowing sewage 
polio is an infectious disease that causes muscular paralysis

republican george bush today cited crime as 
the issue on which he is most at odds with michael dukakis saying 
his democratic rival has an astounding lack of sensitivity to 
crime victims 
bush said dukakis had presided over a criminal justice system in 
massachusetts that is completely out of whack a twilight zone 
world where prisoners right to privacy had more weight than the 
citizens right to safety 
bush in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement 
officials said dukakis still clings to a discredited liberal 
idology that blinds him to the true causes of crime 
bush said dukakis only amended his states prison furlough law 
this year under the bright spotlight of the national presidential 
campaign last spring dukakis ended furloughs for convicted 
murderers serving life without parole 
bush said dukakis should have apologized to a maryland couple 
savagely attacked by convicted murderer willie horton who had been 
granted a weekend massachusetts furlough in 1986 the couple cliff 
and angi barnes have agreed to tape radio ads on behalf of bushs 
campaign 
as far as i know he has never apologized bush said 
im not faulting the governor of massachusetts for one error 
in judgment but it concerns me deeply that in all this time as 
far as i know the governor has never acknowledged that his 
furlough program was a mistake bush said 
while the governor has shown great compassion for the 
difficulties of prisoners and their families and no doubt their 
hardships are severe when it comes to the plight of the victims 
and their families there is what one can only describe as an 
astounding lack of sensitivity a lack of human compassion 
the bush campaign is seizing on the law and order issue as the 
tight race with dukakis nears election day another crimeoriented 
speech is set for monday in new jersey 
the gop ticket was eager to move beyond reverberations from the 
vice presidential debate though bush praised running mate dan 
quayle campaign manager lee atwater on thursday focused on 
comparing bush and dukakis 
youre going to see this debate wont make a difference 
atwater told reporters traveling with the campaign the focus of 
the race is going to be between two gladiators bush and dukakis 
while a cbs news poll found that 50 percent of the likely voters 
surveyed thought bentsen won the debate to 27 percent for quayle 
atwater was claiming that bush has solidified an electoral college 
base of 210 to 220 of the 270 votes needed to win 
that gives us an opportunity to really concentrate on three or 
four states in the waning days of the campaign he said 
asked to name the states atwater declined giving only a list 
of what he said are competitive states including california 
pennsylvania new york massachusetts illinois ohio michigan 
wisconsin missouri new mexico and arkansas 
while bush praised his running mate immediately after the 
debate he did not mention quayle at all in his first speech 
thursday morning in fort worth texas 
after reporters asked his aides about the omission bush opened 
two later rallies hailing quayles performance 
at the permian basin oil museum in midland bush prefaced his 
energy policy speech with a lengthy ode to texas reciting 
anecdotes about his move there from new england as a young man and 
his start in the oil business painting rigs similar to the one 
behind him 
he said he was the only candidate who shares the values of the 
people of texas my values have not changed since the 1950s 
bush strategists professed to be unconcerned about bentsens 
heavy campaigning in texas the state he represents in the us 
senate 
the problem is he cant sell michael dukakis said bush 
regional political director jim shearer lloyd bentsen is a 
popular texan theres no doubt about it but hes selling the 
wrong soap down here 
the bush campaign has been using an anticrime tv commercial in 
texas and will begin an ad focusing on defense which as an 
industry is responsible for a hefty number of jobs in texas 
shearer said 
the anticrime theme apparently will be a central one for bush 
in the waning days of the campaign with another lawandorder 
speech slated for monday in new jersey 
in his fort worth speech bush proposed doubling the nations 
spending on new prison construction with the addition of 250 
million annually over the next four years he also said he would 
set up a justice department antigang unit to work with local 
jurisdictions 
he said money seized from drug busts should be used to help fund 
the new prisons 
i say that our society can simply not afford any more liberal 
experimentation with crime its time to get serious about serious 
crime he said in a speech where he repeatedly used the word 
liberal to criticize failed anticrime policies and linked them 
to dukakis

republican vice presidential nominee 
dan quayle said today he was not worried about new television ads 
aimed at him by the dukakis campaign because they obviously dont 
have anything bad to say about george bush 
quayle was asked by reporters as he toured a technical school 
whether he had become the key issue in the campaign 
we can stand the attention we can stand the heat were going 
to stay in the kitchen quayle said george bush is going to be 
the next president of the united states the voters will vote for 
him 
quayle was greeted by a group of about 75 protesters as he 
toured chattanooga state technical community college some carried 
signs reading we will all pray if dan becomes president 
during a tour of the schools robotics lab quayle was asked by 
reporters about ads the dukakis campaign unveiled thursday aimed at 
driving home the idea that bush had picked an unqualified man as 
his running mate 
i havent seen them ive heard about them they obviously 
dont have anything bad to say about george bush and thats fine 
with me quayle said 
quayle has shrugged off polls indicating voters believe he lost 
the vice presidential debate and doubt his qualifications 
despite that rhetoric quayle acknowledged to reporters thursday 
that he could have answered more fully questions from debate 
panelists about what he would do if he became president 
but the indiana senator focused his efforts thursday on 
attacking democratic counterpart lloyd bentsen saying he 
waffled shuffled ducked and dived questions about his 
differences with ticketmate michael dukakis 
quayle was campaigning today in chattanooga atlanta and 
raleigh nc before returning to washington 
were on the march toward victory quayle told reporters who 
asked him upon arrival here how he felt a day after the debate he 
said he had had a great day 
i think you can tell the real enthusiasm that the crowds have 
generated quayle said at a pensacola fla stop 
he spent thursday refining his answer to questions he was 
repeatedly asked in wednesday nights debate about how he would 
handle the presidency 
polls all along have shown substantial skepticism among the 
voters about quayles qualifications a new cbs poll done after the 
debate found 47 percent of the likely voters surveyed felt he was 
qualified compared with 78 percent for bentsen and both cbs and 
abc polls said a resounding majority of those who viewed the debate 
thought bentsen had won 
quayle said he was not at all worried about the polls 
adding were still ahead 
as far as were concerned the important polls are those from 
the key electoral states said quayle spokesman david prosperi 
the only poll were interest in is on nov 8 
but the campaign was clearly concerned about the fallout from 
quayles response to questions about what he would do if he had to 
step into the presidency he had answered that he would first pray 
and then convene a cabinet session but did not go further electing 
to talk mostly about his congressional experience and 
qualifications 
when i was asked that question i made a judgment that the 
people of america deserved to hear me outline the level of my 
qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the 
presidency quayle said in speeches in missouri and florida 
i responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this 
there is no question that i would maintain and build on the 
excellent policies of a president george bush 
asked by reporters on his plane why he had not made that 
response during the debate quayle said it was a very narrow 
hypothetical i hadnt had that question before 
by convening a cabinet session that certainly implies that 
youre going to continue the policies of george bush i did not say 
that but thats certainly implied i think i did just fine last 
night 
one of quayles defenders was former president gerald ford who 
told a springfield mo fundraiser i think dan quayle is an 
outstanding young man and he will do a superb job as the next vice 
president 
ford himself a former michigan congressman said that on the 
issue of qualifications quayles 12 years in congress were more 
than enough 
i happen to think that people who come from the congress are 
better trained to serve in the executive branch than some 
inexperienced governor with a wildeyed leftwing liberal 
philosophy like the democratic candidates ford said 
quayle attacked bentsen in strong terms saying that he had been 
unable to defend dukakis positions 
i am proud of the man at the top of my ticket quayle said 
i am happy to support his positions and i wont run away from 
them like senator bentsen did last night

the united states has proposed to the soviet 
union that it accept decisions of the world court in 
interpretations of a host of international treaties a us 
official said today 
some of the decision deal with such technical subjects as 
patents and others with diplomatic privileges the united states is 
a party to must of the treaties but the soviets over the years have 
registered reservations that exempt them from the effects of 
many of the treaties said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the us proposals which also involve greater use of the court 
were conveyed to moscow during the summer in response to hints from 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet officials in 
united nations speeches that they were prepared to consider changes 
the united states is coordinating its approach with a number of 
western allies the official said he declined to provide further 
details saying it was a sensitive subject 
but the official said a host of multilateral treaties were 
involved 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley stressed thursday 
that its our view that issues involving the use of force and 
national security do not belong in the international court of 
justice 
she said further discussions would be held with the soviets and 
that she had no details of possible suggested changes in the 
courts operations 
two years ago in an unprecedented move the reagan 
administration rejected the courts jurisdiction in a dispute with 
nicaragua 
the marxist government in managua had sued the united states 
before the court for mining its harbors and aiding nicaraguan 
rebels 
mrs oakleys statement indicated the administration held to the 
view which was developed by abraham d sofaer a former federal 
judge who is the state department chief legal counsel 
the new york times quoted sofaer on thursday as saying the 
united states had responded in a constructive way to 
gorbachevs initiative 
sofaer said the united states had suggested the court be 
permitted to arbitrate a list of specific disputes between 
washington and moscow and agree in advance to accept its verdict 
the times reported 
if accepted by moscow and the us senate the article said the 
us proposals would bind both nations to world court verdicts in 
disputes over certain treaties 
mrs oakley said the us has made a proposal on the issue of 
greater use of the icj international court of justice to the 
soviets this summer which is wholly consistent with this 
administrations view of the appropriate role of the court in 
resolve international disputes 
she said this did not involve a change in the stand the 
administration took in the dispute with nicaragua 
sofaer did not respond to efforts to reach him by telephone for 
details

times because he had beaten and abused her for years was acquitted 
of murder 
cynthia iandola 36 was charged with firstdegree murder after 
she shot her husband jack in the kitchen of their home jan 11 
a mchenry county jury deliberated nine hours before reaching the 
verdict which was greeted by cheers in the courtroom when it was 
announced thursday 
mrs iandola contended the killing was in selfdefense because 
her husband had threatened to kill her and their two children 
she testified that in one incident a few days before the 
shooting her husband sexually abused her with the barrel of a gun 
and indicated that he might try to rape their 13yearold daughter 
much of her testimony was corroborated by witnesses at her trial 
judge roland herrmann refused to allow defense attorneys to 
present expert testimony indicating that mrs iandola was a victim 
of battered womans syndrome a phenomenon in which the wife 
submits passively to abuse from a bullying husband 
during the trial states attorney thomas f baker conceded that 
iandola was a bully who brutalized his family but said mrs 
iandola should have deserted him or sought protection from the 
police or social agencies

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen today made light of republican assertions that dan quayle 
held his own during their vice presidential debate 
i was reading the paper this morning where george bush said he 
thought dan quayle won that and yet every im sorry bentsen 
said breaking into laughter and drawing a roar from a crowd at a 
democratic breakfast 
and yet every poll showed we won and id say george as 
president reagan would say facts are very troubling things 
bentsen said 
the texas senator said the democrats were better on key issues 
to his home state including a realistic defense policy a strong 
trade policy and help for the domestic oil industry and he said 
his debate might later be seen as a turning point in this 
years campaign 
bentsen ridiculed quayle for trying to compare himself in the 
debate to president kennedy it was an incredible misfit he 
said ticking off kennedys accomplishments 
despite bentsens presence on the ticket bush leads michael 
dukakis in the lone star state by up to 10 points according to 
recent polls the democrats contend the gap isnt that big and 
bentsen is campaigning heavily in texas during the next few days in 
hopes of tightening th race for the states 29 electoral votes 
the next couple of days i think will be significant said 
joe oneill bentsens campaign chief of staff we can move these 
numbers in the next couple of weeks 
bentsen planned to continue stumping across texas today with 
events in dallas san antonio and houston after a stop in new 
mexico he planned to hit el paso on saturday and then return to 
the state for part of his campaign trip next week 
bentsen studied for the debate in texas and he returned to the 
state thursday he met up with dukakis at a rally in lone star in 
east texas 
last night the eyes of texas and the whole nation were on 
you and they liked what they saw dukakis told his running mate 
normally bentsen introduces dukakis but their roles were 
reversed as dukakis sought to show off his running mate as a 
conquering hero 
bentsen declined to praise himself but he picked up on his 
predebate pattern of criticizing quayle 
after listening to dan quayle last night i can understand why 
he kept talking about job training he said at the rally 
the polls show that those that were concerned about his 
qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the debate 
last night he told reporters 
a new cbs news poll done after the debate found 78 percent of 
the 412 debate watchers surveyed felt bentsen was qualified to be 
president if that became necessary to 47 percent for quayle 
asked who won the debate 50 percent in the survey chose bentsen 
and 27 percent said quayle the result was almost precisely the 
same as the 5127 percent split in the abc news poll done 
immediately after the debate ended wednesday night 
the campaign hopes to take advantage of the momentum from the 
perceived debate victory with the help of its new national 
television ads and phone banks assembled for the final weeks of the 
campaign 
in texas republicans have been hitting dukakis hard on the 
issues of crime and gun control and the democratic campaign was 
considering running some texasspecific ads to start fighting back 
a campaign aide said 
president reagan and other republicans contended thursday that 
bentsens admonishing of quayle during the debate that he was no 
jack kennedy was a cheap shot and a planned response bentsen 
denied both 
what happened there was quayle kept comparing himself with 
kennedy just overreaching himself and i got fed up with it 
bentsen said i deeply resented him trying to put kennedys 
mantle over himself when he didnt have a record that compared with 
kennedy 
bentsen and kennedy were elected to congress together in 1948 
bentsen served three terms in the house before dropping out of 
politics for 16 years to pursue a business career

two men who admitted setting fire to a house 
suspected of being used to deal cocaine have been acquitted by a 
jury leading city officials to warn against vigilante action 
jury foreman anthony allen said thursdays verdict was a way of 
telling city officials more has to be done to fight drugs 
i imagine the verdict does send out a message in two 
directions to the mayor and to the police department that more 
has to be done about crack houses allen said 
angelo parisi and perry kent were found innocent after a twoday 
trial they admitted setting the fire saying they feared for the 
safety of children in their neighborhood 
i hope this verdict sends no message presiding judge craig 
strong told the jurors it applies to the facts only in this 
case 
but some jurors said they cleared parisi and kent because 
detroits drug problem could cause people to take extreme measures 
i would have probably done the same thing no i would have 
been more violent juror raymond bandemer said 
the charges stemmed from fires in october and november 1987 at 
an abandoned house allegedly occupied by drug dealers who the 
defendants testified had turned their quiet workingclass 
neighborhood into a place of fear 
they were laughing at the neighborhood kent testified 
defense attorney david steingold said residents of the 
neighborhood were continually frightened by the sound of gunfire 
parisi and kent said they started the fires after police failed 
to investigate complaints filed by them and other residents 
law enforcement authorities said they dont condone vigilantism 
and will take all possible measures to prevent such activity 
wayne county prosecutor john ohair said he will not permit 
lawabiding citizens to break the law on the theory that theyre 
frustrated vigilantism simply will not be tolerated

young american indians are using smokeless 
tobacco at an alarming rate say health researchers who have found 
children as young kindergarteners chewing tobacco or taking snuff 
new studies reported thursday by the centers for disease control 
found that use of smokeless tobacco among indian teenagers on 
reservations is higher than among rural nonindian adolescents 
that indians start using it at a younger age and that boys and 
girls alike show frequent use of it on indian reservations 
as many as 21 percent of kindergarten children on reservations 
use smokeless tobacco the researchers said and by the time they 
reach high school age 37 percent already show related signs of 
mouth disease 
smokeless tobacco such as snuff and chewing tobacco causes 
mouth cancer and other oral disease and can produce nicotine 
addiction similar to that of cigarette smoking according to 
federal health officials 
the cdc did not speculate on reasons for the increased use of 
smokeless tobacco by reservation youths but said more research is 
needed 
in a 1986 survey on the rosebud sioux indian reservation in 
rural south dakota 37 percent of the students in grades 712 and 
18 percent of those in grades kindergarten6 said they regularly 
used smokeless tobacco including 21 percent of the kindergarten 
pupils 
in grades k6 boys used smokeless tobacco more often than girls 
by a margin of 21 percent to 15 percent but by grades 712 the 
margin was only 39 percent to 35 percent 
by contrast the us office on smoking and health estimates 
that 2 percent of us adult men and 05 percent of adult women use 
smokeless tobacco an estimated 22 million americans have used it 
another survey comparing nonindian children in rural minnesota 
with their indian counterparts on four rural south dakota 
reservations found the indian youth 10 times more likely to use 
smokeless tobacco 34 percent to 34 percent that was despite the 
fact that both groups lived outside urban areas and would be 
expected to share certain characteristics the cdc said 
that same survey suggested that this behavior is not 
necessarily learned from parents the cdc said indian 
adolescents reported that only 14 percent of their fathers and 3 
percent of their mothers had ever used smokeless tobacco 
smokeless tobacco use however was much lower among urban 
indians than their counterparts on reservations a survey of 
indians on montanas blackfeet reservation and in the city of great 
falls mont found that while 19 percent of the males 1524 in the 
city used smokeless tobacco on the reservation the percentage was 
57 a similar difference was reported among young women 3 percent 
to 12 percent 
that same survey found sharp differences in use among young 
indians and their parents twenty percent of the blackfeet men over 
34 and 3 percent of the women over 34 used smokeless tobacco 
compared again to 57 percent and 12 percent among the 1524 age 
groups

here is a sampling of commentary in foreign newspapers on the 
vicepresidential debate between democrat lloyd bentsen and 
republican dan quayle in omaha neb wednesday night 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jan krauze writing from washington in le monde independent 
of paris mastering his nerves right to the end quayle avoided 
the gaffe the catastrophic error that would have sealed his fate 
but one sensed too much during the last part of the debate that 
he was making a considerable effort to try to show he was up to the 
challenge the tension too strong lasted too long and deep in 
the eyes of the handsome kid one perceived clearly the shadow of 
a wounded insulted pride 
the essential was to put to the test a man whose presence 
on the republican ticket poses by all the evidence a problem 
dan quayle was neither brilliant nor ridiculous and if the problem 
remains it is not necessarily as serious as the democrats hoped 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the guardian liberal of london mr quayle managed to avoid 
any gaffe which would significantly alter the course of the 
election campaign but his presumptuous comparison of his 
congressional record with president kennedys so magisterially 
squashed by mr bentsen serves to reinforce existing doubts about 
his maturity intelligence and judgment mr quayle was 
unconvincing if not pathetic when asked three times what he would 
do first if he became president his initial response that he 
would pray was doubtless fervently echoed around the country by 
contrast the suave and courtly bentsen seen by some as the most 
convincing potential president around remained firmly in control 
 
in their television debate it was the democratic candidate 
who showed the cool intelligence and articulacy which europeans 
find reassuring his quayles view that mikhail gorbachev is 
different only in style from leonid brezhnev and that perestroika 
is nothing more than refined stalinism suggests a shaky grasp of 
international affairs 
if the republicans lose on 8 november unlikely though this 
may now seem the quayle factor will rightly be high among likely 
causes

nights televised debate us senator dan quayle proved himself to 
be everything that most people who know him say he isnt he isnt 
very bright he isnt very thoughtful and he isnt well informed 
mr quayle is not qualified to be vicepresident of the united 
states the problem is not his age 41 or even his caricatured 
conservative posturings the problem is his intellect which 
combined with a poor education and narrow work experience outside 
politics deprives him of the basic tools to do the job part of 
the job is of course assuming the presidency in the event of a

a man who spent three months in a nicaraguan prison 
after his contra supply plane was shot down has filed a 135 
million damage suit against two men and two companies linked to the 
irancontra arms deals 
eugene hasenfus federal suit accuses richard secord albert 
hakim and cialinked southern air transport and corporate air 
sevices of misrepresenting the rebel supply mission as a patriotic 
effort when in fact they were making profits off the deal 
secord and hakim had a history of profiteering in arms 
transactions and undertook participation in the contra assistance 
effort with the intent of deriving substantial profits for 
themselves the suit charges 
the suit was belittled by secords washington attorney thomas c 
green who said thursday that hasenfus knew the risks of the 
flights 
nobody put a gun to hasenfus and told him to step on the 
airplane green said this is a clasic case of a mercenary who 
knew about the risks and yet chose in his adult mind to go ahead 
with it 
hasenfus said that when he was hired in may 1986 he was told the 
operation would be a firstclass operation like air america during 
the vietnam war 
but he said the defendants failed to give the plane adequate 
defense systems such as a way to avoid heatseeking missiles 
in fact defendants intentionally refused to supply parachutes 
to hasenfus and others apparently so that there would be no 
survivors in the event of a crash charges the suit filed 
tuesday 
three fellow crewmen aboard the plane died in the crash 
he also said his employers had promised his wife they would take 
care of his defense after he was shot down in october 1986 but 
failed to do so 
as a result of the defendants promises of help hasenfus wife 
sally also a plaintiff in the suit filed tuesday never set up a 
defense committee the suit says 
although convicted of aiding the contra rebels fighting 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government hasenfus was released 
three months later 
hakim and secord a retired air force major general are accused 
with former national security council figures oliver north and john 
poindexter of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting 
proceeds from the armsforhostages deals with iran to the contras 
at a time when congress banned us military aid to the rebels

a message the opposition says was sent by 
the office of gen wojciech jaruzelski to communist party leaders 
in factories restates the authorities public stance against 
legalizing solidarity 
but the telexed message left open the possibility of changing 
the trade union law after talks this month between solidarity 
leaders and the government the message was dated sept 26 
a solidarity spokesman today said he was not concerned about the 
message and solidarity would enter the talks anyway he said it was 
significant that it was addressed to party cells and not to factory 
managers 
we are not running away from a discussion about the shape of 
the union movement but we think that it must take into account the 
fact that the union question is an element of a broader problem of 
the functioning of the political system the message said 
government spokesman ryszard straus said today he could not 
confirm or deny the authenticity of the text read over the 
telephone to western news agencies by solidarity activists late 
thursday 
but the official pap news service later ran a onesentence 
report saying the secret document quoted by western news 
agencies does not exist 
the text contained nothing new on the governments position 
regarding solidarity but it underlined the degree of concern over 
solidarity chapters springing up openly in many factories on the 
eve of the promised talks 
it urged party leaders to draw prosolidarity activists into 
officially sanctioned unions giving them proportional 
representation in official union leaderships and making the 
official unions reflect workers demands 
at the same time the message warned against allowing the 
opposition to make gains of its own on the factory floors 
the main real danger is the rebirth of solidarity 
structures as they existed in 1981 that is as a party of strikes 
and confrontation this is what we must all focus our attention 
on the message said 
the government and solidarity leader lech walesa agreed to the 
talks on polands future during a wave of strikes in august the 
talks are expected to begin around oct 17 
the opposition has stressed that the talks must result in 
recognition of solidarity suppressed by authorities since a dec 
13 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
the government has said repeatedly that it will not agree to any 
arrangement that would bring divisions on the factory floor and 
that it supports the principle of one union in one workplace 
according to the text read by solidarity the telex was from 
stanislaw domagala the head of the chancellory of the party 
central committee secretariat and was addressed to first 
secretaries of party committees at the nations factories 
solidarity spokesmen did not disclose how they received the 
document

newsweek magazine is offering early retirement 
to 100 employees or 10 percent of its work force because of 
higher costs and a shrinking advertisement base a spokesman said 
today 
the program is entirely voluntary said spokesman gary 
gerard its not draconian in any way 
gerard said 100 fulltime employees those with 25 years or more 
of service or those age 55 and older with 10 years at the magazine 
received letters detailing the offer 
he said it includes pension enhancement and continuation of some 
insurance benefits the size of the package will vary depending on 
the employees age and length of service 
the weekly magazines revenues were up 1 percent during the 
first half of 1988 and gerard said domestic circulation was at an 
all time high of 33 million 
however the number of domestic ad pages has dropped 6 percent 
from a year ago 
obviously our costs have gone up substantially primarily 
postage and paper and the advertising environment has become 
increasingly competitive said diana pearson a magazine 
spokeswoman it forces us to operate in as lean and smart a way 
as we can 
gerard said 60 percent of those offered early retirement were on 
the business side of the magazine and the rest were editorial 
employees

hurricane gilbert caused 818 million 
to 1 billion damage to jamaica less than previously estimated 
prime minister edward seaga said 
the prime minister originally estimated gilbert caused 8 
billion in damage when it slammed into the caribbean island with 
130 mph winds sept 12 
in a report to parliament on thursday seaga said jamaica 
already has raised enough money from other countries to finance 
immediate emergency needs 
he said about 515 million was received or pledged by other 
countries and international financial institutions for rebuilding 
the ravaged economy including a 125 million pledge from the 
united states 
the governments latest reports said 45 people were killed when 
the hurricane ripped the length of the island severely damaging or 
destroying half of its 500000 homes and wiping out hundreds of 
acres of banana coconut and citrus crops 
seaga noted that 1 billion is almost 80 percent of what the 
country gets in foreignexchange earnings annually 
to find up to 1 billion for hurricane emergency relief is in 
effect to embark on a program to almost double the value of 
foreignexchange earnings in one year which would normally be a 
seven or 10year goal seaga said 
this target however is required not in seven to 10 years 
but in seven to 10 days he said 
later on radio and television seaga told jamaicans he had set 
a christmas deadline to break the back of the rebuilding 
program 
by no means all the work will be completed by then he said 
but hopefully comfort will be restored to those who are 
shelterless farmers will be in the field and the lights will shine 
again 
he said the pledges from other countries and institutions such 
as the world bank and the international monetary fund will finance 
the governments emergency spending but more money will be needed 
for the private sector 
the financial picture therefore is one of good order with 
the necessary funding in place to finance the emergency and normal 
operations of the country for the entire fiscal year seaga said 
relief organizations say tons of donated food and other relief 
supplies are being distributed and consumed almost as soon as they 
arrive from abroad but much more is needed to feed and shelter 
tens of thousands of people

republican george bush renewed his attack today on 
massachusetts prisonerfurlough program saying gov michael 
dukakis lacks compassion for crime victims dukakis said he would 
keep up his criticism of dan quayle as a potential president and of 
bush for choosing him as running mate 
dukakis commenting today as he campaigned in missouri said 
there are two issues whether gop vice presidential nominee quayle 
is qualified to be president and whether bush has good judgment 
im going to hit it and hit it hard he said 
quayle himself said today he was not worried about new 
television ads questioning his worthiness for high office he said 
the democrats ads focusing on him mean they obviously dont have 
anything bad to say about george bush 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen still 
energized by what is widely seen as his debate victory over quayle 
wednesday night made fun of bushs comments that quayle had done 
well 
and yet every poll showed we won and id say george 
facts are very troubling things bentsen said 
dukakis was campaigning in missouri and north carolina today 
after telling a memphis tenn audience thursday night there 
are as we know going to be major changes in the supreme court do 
you want the man who selected dan quayle to be making those 
appointments 
when the 41st president takes office in january three of the 
justices will be over 80 william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun bush has said the next president will very 
possibly appoint two or three justices to the supreme court where 
theyll sit well into the next century 
bush was in xenia ohio concentrating on crime and declaring 
that on no other issue is my opponents philosophy so completely 
at odds with mine and i would say with the common sense attitudes 
of the american people 
while the governor has shown great compassion for the 
difficulties of prisoners and their families and no doubt their 
hardships are severe when it comes to the plight of the victims 
and their families there is what one can only describe as an 
astounding lack of sensitivity a lack of human compassion bush 
said in remarks prepared for delivery to law enforcement officials 
he said dukakis should have apologized to a maryland couple who 
were attacked by convicted murderer willie horton who had been 
granted a weekend massachusetts furlough in 1986 dukakis has 
called the incident a tragic occurrence 
quayle in chattanooga tenn was asked by reporters as he 
toured a technical school whether he had become the key issue in 
the campaign 
we can stand the attention we can stand the heat he said 
george bush is going to be the next president of the united 
states the voters will vote for him 
in dallas texas sen bentsen said his debate with quayle might 
eventually be seen as a turning point in the campaign 
bentsen renewed his criticism of quayle for trying to compare 
his experience to that of john f kennedy in 1960 bentsen listed 
kennedys prepresidency accomplishments including his war record 
and his winning of a pulitzer prize and said a comparison of 
quayle and kennedy was an incredible misfit 
dukakis pressed his direct attack on quayle and indirect 
criticism of bushs decisionmaking ability with new television 
commercials portraying the indiana senator as unfit for the vice 
presidency 
bush who barely mentioned quayle during campaign appearance 
earlier in the day thursday told an evening rally in little rock 
ark that quayle proved himself in his wednesday night debate 
he did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly pounded by 
my opponents bush said and last night last night the 
country saw what i have seen all along a young knowledgeable 
experienced american and i am proud to have put my trust in a whole 
generation of young people 
bushs best known surrogate president reagan said i 
really think that quayle actually just by the whole nature of the 
event headed off or should have headed off all this picking on 
him that has been going on 
a second poll released thursday supported the democrats 
contention that bentsen outshone quayle in their debate an cbs 
news survey of 412 debate watchers found 50 percent believe bentsen 
won the debate to 27 percent for quayle 
the result was almost precisely the 5127 percent split in an 
abc news poll taken immediately after the debate ended 
the cbs poll also found that half the voters still doubt 
quayles qualifications to serve as president if the need arose 
quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent while 
bentsen was rated as qualified by 78 percent 
in his first appearance in fort worth texas bush failed to 
mention quayles debate performance instead the republican 
nominee proposed doubling the nations spending on new prison 
construction and instituting a justice department antigang unit to 
work with local jurisdictions 
the democratic nominee described quayles performance as 
programmed beyond belief and said the indiana senator seemed 
extremely insecure dukakis told bentsen great work again 
the dukakis campaign meanwhile released a pair of television 
ads belittling quayle one commercial notes that one in five vice 
presidents have been thrust into the presidency while an announcers 
says after five months of reflection george bush made his 
personal choice j danforth quayle hopefully we will never know 
how great a lapse of judgment that really was 
in the second ad part of the packaging of george bush 
series socalled bush campaign advisers discuss the selection of 
quayle weve got a disaster on our hands says one adviser 
another wonders if the ticket can still dump quayle and bring in

democrat michael dukakis said today he would 
continue to slam republican dan quayle as unfit for the vice 
presidency and depict rival george bush as weak for selecting the 
indiana senator im going to hit it and hit it hard he said 
dukakis said the quayle issue is doubleedged is quayle 
qualified to be president and does bush have any judgment 
strong presidents look for strong vice presidents dukakis 
said thursday showering praise on lloyd bentsen and offering 
ridicule for quayle 
weak candidates look for something else 
dukakis took the attack a step further in memphis telling a 
rally in a renovated theater there are as we know going to be 
major changes in the supreme court do you want the man who 
selected dan quayle to be making those appointments 
the massachusetts governor was campaigning today in missouri and 
north carlina both regarded as closely contested states before 
returning home to boston for the evening 
dukakis belittled republican quayle in tennessee after flying in 
from tiny lone star in east texas where he joined bentsen for their 
first appearance following the vice presidential debate in omaha 
after earlier describing quayle as seeming extremely 
insecure and programmed beyond belief in his televised 
confrontation dukakis said the comparison with bentsen was hving 
an immediate effect on the democratic ticket 
i think its one of the reasons why people are switching why 
this campaign of ours is starting to win he told reporters after 
arriving in memphis 
in texas before heading off on their separate ways on the 
campaign trail dukakis looked ahead to his final remaining debate 
with bush next week in los angeles as he said goodbye to bentsen on 
an airport tarmac 
great work again dukakis told the texas senator ill 
see if i can approach it 
the dukakis campaign moved swiftly to begin airing a pair of 
television commercials belittling quayle the ads were produced 
before the debate and contain no reference to bentsens stinging 
retort to quayle senator youre no jack kennedy but the 
campaign did not air the ads until after the debate confident of 
the wide perception bentsen had done well and that quayle had not 
put to rest questions about himself 
one ad the latest in a series of mock depictions of bush 
campaign advisers has one voice saying of quayle weve got a 
disaster on our hands another suggests that bush dump quayle 
from the ticket and bring in bob dole 
a second ad hits even harder it shows photographs of harry 
truman lyndon johnson and gerald ford being sworn in as accidental 
presidents while an announcer says one in five vice presidents have 
been thrust into the presidency 
after five months of reflection george bush made his personal 
choice j danforth quayle an announcer says hopefully we 
will never know how great a lapse of judgment that really was 
dukakis senior adviser francis obrien said both were airing on 
networks nationally and would run for four or five days 
dukakiss assault on quayle reflects democratic hopes that 
reservations about the 41yearold indiana senators 
qualifications depth and fitness for the job are so great they 
will overcome historical indicators that suggest a candidates 
running mate has little effect on voters decisions 
in memphis dukakis southern coordinator larry harrington said 
the ads and the quayle issue could be important in states where 
dukakis and bentsen are running extremely close with bush 
campaigning with dukakis tennessee sen albert gore a former 
presidential candidate himself described tennessee as just such a 
neckandneck state 
its never going to be a killer issue but as long as its 
something theyve got to deal with in a state thats within one or 
two percentage points it can make a difference harrington 
said

beneath the surface of the northern 
russian landscape a few miles from ancient churches and grazing 
cattle lies the blunt white tip of nuclear destruction 
the ss11 intercontinental missile has not intruded on the 
outside world in the 15 years or more since it was placed in its 
silo 150 miles northeast of moscow 
but it retains the power to destroy new york los angeles or any 
other american city in minutes 
this missile is on full military standby its fully armed 
major gen ivan vershkov said thursday on a trip sponsored by the 
soviet foreign ministry and defense ministry the soviet decision 
to show the missile to foreign reporters was unprecedented 
your presence here is indeed a step toward trust he said 
if someone five years ago told me a group of correspondents 
including foreign correspondents would meet me by a missile silo 
i wouldnt have believed it the singlewarhead ss11 is among 
the oldest of the soviet strategic forces western military 
references list three types of ss11s and estimate the soviets have 
deployed about 440 
the us defense department says their range is 6600 to 8000 
miles putting any intercontinental target within their reach 
the missile is based at what western analysts call the teykovo 
missile range surrounded by the historic towns of suzdal rostov 
yaroslavl whose ancient churches remind one of life centuries 
before nuclear weapons 
vershkov said residents know only that a military installation 
is in the area 
soviet military officers said the decision to show the missile 
was made by the general staff of marshal sergei f akhromeyev the 
soviet military chief within days of a reporters query the 
officers said they learned of the visit six days before it began 
akhromeyev was shown a us minuteman ii missile in the united 
states this summer vershkov a 49yearold veteran of soviet 
rocket forces said reporters were shown an ss11 because it is 
analogous to the minuteman ii 
us officials have visited more than 100 missile sites while 
monitoring soviet compliance with the treaty eliminating mediumand 
shorterrange missiles which was ratified in may 
i wouldnt have thought we would have gone through 115 
inspections poking into sensitive areas without some kind of 
minor tension gen roland lajoie director of the us arms 
control inspection agency said tuesday i find the soviets 
uncommonly flexible and supportive 
but vershkov made clear that many questions about the ss11 
missile the command center and the soldiers who man it were 
forbidden 
reporters were taken to the top of one silo whose dark green 
lid about 20 feet square was rolled to one side to uncover the 
white ss11 inside and to an empty silo about nine miles away 
they saw the top of the 60foot missile but not the command 
center which vershkov said was several miles away they saw no 
soldiers except for a small group of top officers 
even officers in the control center dont know where the 
missiles are targeted he said 
vershkov a communist party member who lavished praise on soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs foreign policy refused to detail his 
responsibilities except to say he was a representative of the 
military command 
when a television reporter asked how close a nuclear missile 
would have to land to destroy the site he responded why do your 
viewers need such details 
western references say the first ss11s were deployed in 1966 
and that only about 20 remain the rest are two later variations 
one with a single warhead and one with three warheads deployed 
betweeen 1973 and 1975 
us and soviet negotiators are making slow progress in 
negotiations to halve their arsenals of longrange nuclear weapons 
the general said he and his soldiers would not be upset if the 
ss11s were destroyed under a new treaty 
ill find work i have an engineering degree and the country 
needs working hands he said 
we dont intend to attack or threaten anyone he said i 
am sure the remaining missiles would ensure defense sufficiency 
but the fewer of them the better

the nations business leaders enjoying 
high profits from the strongest economic growth in four years said 
friday they expect a slowdown in 1989 
executives ranging from citicorp chairman john s reed to 
general motors corp chairman roger b smith said their industries 
are generating very strong earnings 
nevertheless members of the business council composed of 62 
chief executives of large us corporations say they would prefer 
less robust growth and a soft landing next year to the 
alternative higher inflation rising interest rates and finally a 
recession or a hard landing 
reed delivering a consensus report of about 20 economists from 
member corporations told executives gathered for their 
twiceayear retreat at this mountain resort town to expect growth 
as measured by the gross national product of 4 percent this year 
the best since 1984 
the panel expects the current economic expansion now in its 
70th month to continue well into next year but at a slower rate 
it predicted gnp growth of 25 percent in 1989 and less than 2 
percent in 1990 about in line with what the federal reserve 
considers noninflationary 
i think probably the general consensus would be 25 to 3 in 
the longer term may be more healthy and more sustainable reed 
said 
too much growth according to economists leads to shortages of 
both labor and factory capacity which in turn leads to higher 
wages and prices 
the sector of the economy expected to slow the most is consumer 
spending increasing sales of us goods abroad and more spending 
on new machinery by manufacturers striving to meet the export boom 
should replace consumption as the engine of the economy 
even executives who depend most heavily on consumer spending 
such as philip m hawley chairman of carter hawley hale stores 
inc a major department store chain welcome the shift because it 
means fewer foreign imports 
retailers have as large a stake in the longterm health of the 
economy as the manufacturing side hawley said soaring personal 
consumption earlier in the 1980s clearly had longrange 
implications for the economy that were not good 
retail management simply needs to plan for slower growth he 
said 
the executives however continue to be troubled about the 
prospects for reducing the trade and budget deficits 
their economic advisers expect almost no progress through 1990 
in shrinking the budget deficit from the 1987 level and expected a 
1988 mark of about 150 billion 
they forsee the trade gap declining from 170 billion last year 
to 134 billion this year and to below 100 billion in 1990 but 
they say that will happen only with further declines in the value 
of the dollar from the current level of 133 japanese yen to 120 yen 
over the next two years 
edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc a health care 
company said only the continuing confidence of foreigners in the 
united states based on the past rather than the present has kept 
the value of the dollar artificially high 
im persuaded that our trading partners and our creditors 
will not tolerate forever the financial situation were in 
other countries wouldnt have gotten away this long without their 
currency weakening a lot more than ours has he said 
in other predictions the business councils economists saw 
unemployment staying at 6 percent or below through 1990 the 
rate was 54 percent last month nearly the lowest in 14 years 
consumer prices rising 42 percent this year and 51 percent 
next year but no return to the doubledigit inflation of the late 
1970s and early 1980s 
average interest rates rising by a bit more than 1 percentage 
point next year and then easing in 1990 
the business council formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the 
department of commerce selected smith of general motors to serve 
as its chairman in 1989 and 1990 he replaces sd bechtel jr 
chairman of bechtel group inc a worldwide construction firm

sudan said friday it has stopped trying 
to control a locust plague along the ethiopian border because of 
military attacks 
the defense minister says no one has been hurt in the assaults 
on villages and spray planes but he said vehicles were burned in 
an air attack on a convoy near kassala 260 miles east of khartoum 
he said the government has asked the ethiopian government to stop 
the attacks 
the episode appeared to be a major setback to khartoums efforts 
to deal with one of sudans worst locust infestations in years 
in addis ababa the ethiopian capital officials refused comment 
on the situation 
relations between sudan and ethiopia have been strained for 
several years especially since a rebellion broke out in southern 
sudan in 1983 
sudan accuses ethiopia of arming financing and harboring the 
rebels addis ababa alleges that khartoum allows several 
antiethiopian guerrilla groups to maintain official open presence 
in the sudanese capital 
the official sudan news agency said syd ali mohamed ali 
director of the agriculture ministrys plant protection department 
in eastern sudan announced the decision to abandon the frontier 
spraying operation 
all locust control operations along the sudaneseethiopian 
borders were completely halted due to the shelling of the pest 
control areas by the ethiopian air force the news agency said 
it quoted ali as saying that sprayers and others involved with 
the program already were withdrawn 
swarms of the cropdevouring insects appeared in several african 
countries in recent weeks after heavy rains created perfect 
breeding conditions 
in sudan swarms have occurred mainly in the eastern and western 
regions but one massive swarm hit crops in the khartoum area and 
others are expected the government committed 22 planes to the 
spraying operation but officials say three wont fly and one 
crashed in the western sector 
ahmed mahmoud issa minister of state at the agriculture 
ministry told the newspaper alayam that two ethiopian mig jet 
fighters attacked vehicles assigned to the cropdusting operation 
in villages along the border he said spray planes had come under 
fire from within ethiopia 
the armed forces newspaper alguwat almusalaha confirmed the 
reports on thursday 
the ethiopian air force intercepted a locust spray convoy last 
week in the eastern region and hit some cars working in the

several thousand demonstrators chanted 
islamic slogans after moslem prayer services today and authorities 
reported 900 arrests and an unspecified number of deaths in three 
days of rioting 
police and troops were blocking the demonstrators estimated by 
reporters to number at least 6000 in the belcourt district in 
eastern algiers 
they chanted god is great and other slogans and called for 
establishment of an islamic republic 
earlier today algerians formed long lines for bread after an 
overnight curfew that was almost universally obeyed on thursday 
the government declared a national state of emergency and put all 
police and administrative authorities under the military 
occasional gunshots broke the early morning silence it was not 
clear whether the shots were fired at protesters or were warnings 
to chase away the few people in the streets 
protesters this week have included youths protesting an 
austerity program that has sharply increased prices islamic 
fundamentalists who oppose the governments secular orientation and 
rioters whose political stance was not known 
the military command said 900 people were arrested in the three 
previous days and were caught redhanded in pillage and 
vandalism in a separate statement the command said street 
battles caused losses of human life among the demonstrators as 
well as in the ranks of the forces of order 
it said the deaths occurred thursday during the day and night 
it did not say where in algiers they happened 
more than 30 people seriously injured in the clashes were 
admitted to mustapha hospital in algiers medical sources said 
today on condition of anonymity they said the worst injuries 
occurred wednesday night 
president chadli bendjadid proclaimed a state of emergency on 
thursday and ordered a curfew from midnight to 6 am 
the army was given responsibility for public order for the first 
time since algeria won independence from france 26 years ago 
bakeries were among the few shops open today as other food 
stores remained closed either for lack of supplies or for fear of 
renewed violence while prices of meats and other goods have 
soared bread remains heavily subsidized by the government

the morning to assure supplies

concerns along with security an army officer on one of the 
escorts told the associated press he declined to give his name

today the moslem day of prayer 
former president ahmed ben bella who lives in exile in geneva 
was quoted in the paris daily le figaro as saying some people were 
killed in the disturbances without specifying how many or

corruption the bad management and the total lack of freedom ben 
bella who was president from independence in 1962 until he was 
overthrown in a military coup in 1965 was quoted as saying 
the french news agency agence francepresse reported that two

this is not a stunt to me i think that its the best 
thing that i can do right now for my country for nasa for our 
space effort for our people and for the planet the rocky 
mountain high singer said thursday 
however denver said the soviets insistence that he pay 10 
million for the flight would likely prompt him to drop the project 
ive told them that im opposed to paying 10 million that i 
think its inappropriate that i think its negative and that its 
not the way i want to pursue this endeavor he said 
among the soviet requirements that denver said he has fulfilled 
is obtaining permission from the us government and passing a 
physical for space flight with nasa

sen quentin burdick used to offer a 
karate chop for anyone saying the 80yearold senator was too old 
to run for reelection the karate line is gone but burdick still 
argues hes fit despite his advancing age and a recent cancer 
operation 
the 28year democratic senate veteran maintains a comfortable 
lead over republican opponent earl strinden who argues that the 
issue is burdicks ability to be a vigorous us senator for the 
next six years 
im in good shape counters burdick im surprising 
myself 
a university of north dakota poll taken in late september gave 
burdick a 57 percent to 32 percent lead over strinden but indicated 
that 35 percent of eligible voters were concerned about his mental 
and physical fitness 
part of strindens problem appears to be his personality even 
people who like the 56yearold house majority leader say hes 
abrasive some 37 percent of north dakotans view strinden 
unfavorably according to an earlier poll 
ive taken many stands over the years that have at that moment 
in time been unpopular said strinden im a fighter ive 
always been a fighter 
a series of television commercials intended to soften strindens 
image as an overbearing leader made little difference and now 
burdick has started a series of attacks on the republicans record 
on farm and social service issues 
strinden accuses burdick of dodging facetoface meetings with 
him and says a pair of debates later this month when the senator 
must speak extemporaneously will demonstrate whether he has the 
stamina for another sixyear term 
so far though burdick has kept his distance saying his work 
in the senate where he is chairman of the environment and public 
works committee is taking up his time 
ive got to finish my job down there burdick said in a 
recent interview at the bismarck airport i cant leave 
burdick has limited his campaigning primarily to television and 
has turned down numerous invitations for joint appearances with his 
challenger 
when the two candidates were asked to speak at a meeting of the 
states broadcasters strinden showed up but burdick sent his 
press secretary and a videotaped speech 
burdick has been hospitalized twice in the last year once for a 
concussion when he slipped on ice last winter and hit his head and 
again last summer when doctors removed 18 inches of his intestine 
after a cancerous polyp was discovered 
several leading democrats first raised the age issue last year 
in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to retire and republicans 
have picked up where burdicks democratic critics left off 
strinden is pinning his hopes on winning over democrats and 
independents who have doubts about burdicks fitness theres a 
sizable number of people out there supporting him who really dont 
think he should run again said strinden 
some 26 percent of democrats and 34 percent of independents 
polled in late september were concerned about his age 
it still could be an issue but not the kind of issue that the 
strinden campaign hoped that people would hook onto said phil 
harmeson who conducts the und surveys after all this is a state 
that reelected 77yearold milton young in 1974 young finally 
retired at 83 
to highlight his own good health strinden once held a news 
conference with his doctor who told reporters that the republican 
candidate has gained a little weight and drinks too much coffee 
strinden has just 120000 left in the bank after wasting he 
says a similar amount on preoctober commercials including an 
8000 antidrunken driving campaign 
with so little money left strinden cannot afford to counter the 
blitz of burdick ads for which he is bracing he said 
burdick has raised more than 1 million for his campaign and 
still has about 400000 left says carolyn nelson his campaign 
treasurer 
strinden maintains that his campaign was right on track until 
burdicks surgery the operation from which burdick appeared to 
recover quickly won the sympathy of voters and gave him a boost in 
the polls strinden said 
burdick who has challenged political opponents to spar with him 
in a karate match if they doubt his health started running a 
vigorous media campaign soon after the 1986 election gave democrats 
control of the senate and elevated him to the committee 
chairmanship 
burdick says he will convince voters of his vigor when he gets 
back to north dakota congress was scheduled to adjourn this 
weekend 
theyll see me on tv theyll see me in person they can 
see for themselves what shape im in he said

because of the needles 
the oneliter bags of a type used to hold blood taken for

negotiators concluded another round of 
talks on us military bases in greece without discussing a greek 
demand for the closure of an air force base at athens airport a 
government spokesman said friday 
the negotiators will meet again next month in washington he 
said 
the spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said american defense aid to 
greece was among issues discussed but that greeces demand to close 
the air force base wasnt especially touched upon 
greece is insisting that hellenikon base where 1400 americans 
are stationed must be shut after the current bases agreement 
expires in december 
different aspects were discussed such as defense aid and 
the issue of principles to be included in the preamble to the 
expected agreement kostopoulos said 
greece gets more than 430 million in us military credits as a 
form of rent for the bases 
the government also is eager to maintain a longstanding 
agreement under which greece receives 7 in us aid for every 10 
that goes to turkey 
the issues of principle mentioned by kostopoulos are 
understood to involve a greek request for the agreement to include 
backing for greek positions in disputes with fellow natomember 
turkey over control of the aegean sea 
the united states operates four bases in greece and about 20 
smaller communications facilities around the country

the new televisionad offensive by democrat 
michael dukakis against an already aggressive george bush is weeks 
late campaign watchers say 
still in a campaign as in life better late than never 
said larry sabato an author and campaign specialist at the 
university of virginia 
dukakis running slightly behind republican bush in most polls 
started a clutch of negative ads this week including two that 
question both the qualifications of gop vice presidential nominee 
dan quayle and bushs judgment in choosing him 
each campaign is reported to be spending more than 1 million a 
week on national network television time and more than twice that 
much for ads on local stations and cable television bush is 
planning a halfhour program on election eve dukakis is still 
weighing options 
sabato and other analysts say dukakis should have been on the 
attack coming out of the democratic convention last july when bush 
first started airing ads criticizing the massachusetts governors 
crime and environmental records 
its always easier to shape attitudes than to reshape them 
said kathleen hall jamieson a university of texas professor and 
author of three books on presidential campaigns in the tv age 
these ads would have been much more effective if they had gone on 
the air six weeks ago 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said dukakis wanted to keep this 
campaign on a positive note talking about the issues regrettably 
because of the nasty campaign theyve been running weve had to 
go negative 
sig rogich bushs ad director countered that the dukakis team 
is groping for ideas their ad team probably could be equated 
with the same group given the task of selling the edsel the 
american people just arent going to buy it 
jamieson and others have compared the dukakis ad effort 
unfavorably to the hardhitting bush strategy devised by roger 
ailes the bush campaign has recently introduced tough ads 
attacking dukakis prison furlough program tax policies and other 
aspects of his record as governor 
gearan indicated the dukakis camps remaining advertising would 
build on the new gettough attitude there is definitely a 
unified ad campaign that is planned he said so fasten your 
seat belts its going to be a bumpy ride 
the new approach apparently bears the stamp of the candidate 
asked in st louis if he had seen the new antiquayle ads his 
campaign is running dukakis replied are you kidding me nothing 
goes on around here without me knowing 
the dukakis team kicked into high gear early this week with a 
nationally aired packaging of george bush series in which 
actors playing cynical bush handlers moan about how to disguise 
their candidates alleged weaknesses on the environment drugs 
crime and health matters 
the packaging series was joined several days later by a set 
of four ads hitting the vice presidents record on drugs the 
environment social security and education a narrator derides 
bushs record on each issue and asks viewers if they really believe 
he has converted to the cause 
one of the quayle ads shows scenes of vice presidents harry 
truman lyndon johnson and gerald ford taking their presidential 
oaths as a narrator says one in five vice presidents has risen 
directly to the presidency 
for this job after five months of reflection george bush 
made his personal choice j danforth quayle the ad says 
hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that 
really was 
the other ad part of the packaging series shows the 
actorhandlers depressed about the indiana senators debate showing 
against the democratic vice presidential nominee texas sen lloyd 
bentsen 
weve got a disaster on our hands one handler says 
suddenly the words president quayle even make me nervous 
says another 
is it too late to drop him asks a third bring in bob 
dole 
bush went on national television this week with an ad 
reiterating his softoncriminals charge against dukakis the spot 
says dukakis vetoed the death penalty and mandatory sentences for 
drug dealers and charges a revolving door prison furlough 
program let out murderers who are still at large 
another in spot markets around the country accuses dukakis of 
imposing the largest tax increase in massachusetts history and 
spending at a greater per capita rate than any other governor in 
america 
both spots end and now he wants to do for america what hes 
done for massachusetts america cant afford that risk 
another spot ad features complaints about dukakis from 
massachusetts residents according to bush advertising aide janet 
mullins we got them off the street literally she said 
michael dukakis should be called michael taxakakis a man 
says im a democrat ive never voted republican before but 
this time im voting for george bush says a woman 
the bush campaign wont discuss its tv spending but the 
opposition reports that bush has bought or plans to spend 12 
million to 15 million on national network time for each week up 
to the election and spent 25 million on local and cable outlets 
this week the dukakis campaign says its spending is comparable to 
the gop outlay

the nations groundwater will appear more 
contaminated in coming years simply because more people are looking 
for contamination the us geological survey said friday 
although evidence is insufficient to show whether contamination 
is getting worse groundwater quality is generally good the agency 
said 
groundwater provides drinking water for 53 percent of the us 
population 97 percent in rural areas and accounts for 40 
percent of the flow in the nations streams 
contamination has attracted increasing concern in recent years 
and the survey devoted its annual water report for 1986 released 
only friday to groundwater quality survey spokesman don finley 
said printing problems had delayed the report 
all states reported contamination from both natural and human 
sources 
in its report for 1984 the survey reported worrisome 
contamination of groundwater by nitrate compounds with nearly 20 
percent of sampled wells showing evidence of nitrate additions from 
human activity and 6 percent exceeding recommended maximum 
concentrations 
the data came not from a statistical sample but rather a search 
of files for the previous 25 years and the percentages would not 
necessarily apply to the nations groundwater supply as a whole 
a special study ofencies the extent of groundwater 
contamination is likely to appear to increase over the next few 
years because more agencies will be searching for evidence of 
contamination and they will be using increasingly sensitive 
analytical procedures 
groundwater moves slowly only a few feet per year at most so 
contamination can take years to show up in wells near a pollution 
site 
in some instances officials said remedial measures may be 
cleaning the shallower parts of an aquifer even while contamination 
is still penetrating to the deeper parts

aids is not exploding among the nations 
heterosexuals public health experts said in a report friday but 
one researcher warned its going to be a bigger problem for the 
general public than many think 
the report in the journal of the american medical association 
said the number of reported heterosexual aids cases is doubling 
every 14 to 16 months keeping pace with infection rates among 
homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers 
although aids is not exploding into the heterosexual 
population relative to other risk groups the increase in the 
number of heterosexual cases is proportional to increases in other 
risk groups the report said 
heterosexual spread of the deadly disease appears to be more of 
a problem among blacks than whites the researchers noted 
about 4 percent of the 59287 cases of aids reported in the 
united states between june 1981 and april 11 1988 are listed as 
heterosexually transmitted according to the report 
blacks accounted for 69 percent of the 2392 aids cases 
attributed to heterosexual contact whites accounted for 17 percent 
and hispanics 14 percent the report said 
a coauthor dr harry w haverkos of the national institute on 
drug abuse in bethesda md said a higher rate of drug abuse among 
blacks might be a major factor in the increased frequency of 
heterosexually transmitted aids among blacks 
the report said intravenous drug abuse is an important link 
in the heterosexual spread of aids with 61 percent of usborn 
heterosexual aids patients reporting sexual contact with an iv drug 
abuser 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which cripples the immune 
system is spread through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring 
heterosexual spread of aids is going to be a bigger problem 
than many people in this country up until now have suggested 
haverkos cautioned the medical community and the public should 
be aware of this and start developing ways to minimize 
transmission 
the report reiterated that condoms offer the best protection 
outside of abstinence to prevent the spread of aids and it 
recommended counseling for people infected with the virus to keep 
them from spreading it to sex partners 
dr h hunter handsfield director of the sexually transmitted 
disease control program for the seattleking county department of 
public health in washington said he basically agreed with the 
reports findings but felt the authors somewhat overstated the 
potential problem of heterosexual aids cases 
we clearly should prepare for the worst but at the same time 
the average heterosexual who is not being sexually active in an 
environment of drug abuse is currently at a very low risk of 
becoming infected handsfield said 
a letter from three doctors at the wisconsin division of health 
in madison appearing in the jama issue criticized a method used in 
illinois to control heterosexual transmission mandatory 
premarital testing for the aids or hiv virus as ineffective 
the mandatory illinois testing program spotted only five 
hivpositive people after testing nearly 45000 marriage license 
applicants during the first four months of 1988 according to dr 
edward belongia and his colleagues

hirohitos fever declined slightly but reports said there was 
danger that an infection in his digestive system would spread 
although he showed no outward signs of further internal

stopped palace officials said

a package of family bills offering child care 
assistance and parental job leaves died friday in the senate a 
casualty of political pressures and the ticking clock of the 100th 
congress 
with adjournment expected next week and at least two major bills 
still pending sponsors of the legislation failed to get the 60 
votes they needed to restrict debate and get on with their bill 
the vote was 5046 
the triplepronged package which also included a crackdown on 
child pornographers was on the senate floor for the better part 
of two weeks amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering 
democrats repeatedly termed the package an opportunity to back 
up election campaign rhetoric with a solid commitment republicans 
said there were more pressing matters to deal with such as drug 
and tax bills and they refused to offer amendments or strike a 
compromise on the family measures 
their filibuster was successful they have won today and 
americas families have lost senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva said after the vote 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said the senate had acted 
prudently what weve done in effect is say slow down he said 
this isnt an urgent measure that needs to be passed in the 
waning days of the 100th congress 
sen christopher dodd dconn who led the drive for the 
package accused republicans of waging a filibuster by silence 
nine days of stalling nine days of total inertia 
never in the history of american politics has there been a 
constituency so popular but with so little political clout as the 
american family said dodd chairman of the senate subcommittee 
on children family drugs and alcoholism he said he would 
reintroduce the parental leave and child care bills on the first 
day of the 101st congress in january 
the three elements of the family package included 
dodds original bill requiring employers of over 50 people to 
offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave when 
they have newborn newly adopted or sick children or have serious 
medical problems themselves 
an antipornography measure sponsored by sen strom thurmond 
rsc making it a federal crime to possess sell or distribute 
child pornography or obscene materials it was added to the 
parental leave bill on a unanimous vote 
the 25 billion act for better child care services also 
sponsored by dodd aimed at helping lowincome parents pay for 
child care at centers or homes it was presented as a compromise 
between dodd and sen orrin hatch rutah and was to have included 
a tax credit for poor families in its final form 
there remains considerable controversy over the bills treatment 
of religious groups providing day care and over a requirement that 
day care providers receiving federal money meet minimum federal 
standards of health and safety staff training and 
stafftochildren ratios 
the parentalleave section was fought vigorously by business and 
conservative groups 
the senate debate focused on whether the private sector 
rather than congress is best equipped to decide and manage benefit 
policy it wasnt a debate on whether or not parental or medical 
leave is a good benefit said mary tavenner founder of a group 
called the concerned alliance of responsible employers 
groups that back the dodd bills representing unions churches 
women children and medical personnel vowed to press ahead next 
year 
were going to be back early so were first on the agenda 
instead of last in the next congress said judith lichtman 
executive director of the womens legal defense fund 
people are going to be angry that theres been such a high 
level of rhetoric and so little produced said rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo sponsor of the parental leave bill in the 
house well be back stronger its not the end its the 
beginning

oakland community college has declared 
a band of masked suspects innocent in the failure of a computer 
system 
raccoons on the highland lakes campus initially were accused of 
damaging the system aug 31 by entering tunnels and vandalizing a 
computer cable 
the preliminary diagnosis was that animals chewed through the 
cable because it had happened before college spokesman george 
cartsonis said we knew from the droppings and chew marks they 
had been there 
but an investigation found that maintenance workers had allowed 
the cable to slip against hotwater pipes that melted part of the 
cable cartsonis said 
just because raccoons wear masks doesnt mean they are always 
the bad guys he said they got blamed for something they 
didnt do

nearly 100 homeowners with leaky pipes have been 
awarded up to 7 million in damages from the four companies that 
made and installed the plumbing ending a marathon trial that 
produced a 4465page verdict 
the state jury thursday sided with 94 la porte homeowners who 
had sued general homes corp which built the houses shell oil co 
us brass corp and hoechstcelanese corp which produced and 
marketed the plumbing materials 
ending a trial that began in june the jury found that the four 
companies were negligent and misrepresented the quality of the 
plumbing 
the plumbing apparently failed in many of the fairmount park 
subdivision homes after about four years because of contact with 
chemicals primarily chlorine found in water said james r 
moriarty an attorney for the homeowners 
moriarty said the verdict which addressed each claim on a 
separate sheet of paper was the first against the companies 
responsible for the polybutylene plumbing system six similar suits 
are pending in harris county courts he said 
moriarty said the jury awarded each homeowner about 40000 to 
70000 in damages interest and fees but the final amount depends 
on whether judge alice oliver trevathan affirms the panels finding 
of deceptive trade practices 
he said the plumbing system was taken off the market in 1986

hundreds of children were vaccinated 
against polio friday in the first stage of a nationwide campaign to 
immunize all israelis up to the age of 40 against the disease 
the health ministry ordered the campaign after nine israelis 
were infected by polio which causes muscular paralysis 
in the next four weeks about 32 million people will be 
vaccinated said ministry spokesman shmuel algrabli 
israelis are immunized as children and the current vaccination 
is a booster 
the first stage of the campaign centered on the tel aviv suburb 
of rehovot and the northern coastal town of acco polio viruses 
were found in the sewage systems of both areas 
in rehovot hundreds of parents lined up at clinics with their 
infants large yellow wall posters informed residents when 
different age groups should report for vaccinations 
the tourism ministry expressed concern that reports of the 
disease would keep visitors away from israel 
tourism has dropped dramatically since the palestinian uprising 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip began dec 8 
but health ministry officials have stressed visitors do not need 
extra vaccinations before visiting the country because the outbreak 
is limited 
no cases of polio were reported in israel last year and the 
recent cases have been blamed on overflowing sewage 
the government initially decided to give booster vaccinations 
only to residents of affected areas but changed its policy 
thursday following recommendations by a team of international 
health experts 
military officials said they would decide sunday whether to 
administer booster shots to palestinians in the west bank no such 
program is considered in the gaza strip 
palestinians in the occupied lands have routinely received the 
combined sabinsalk vaccine which is more effective than the 
single vaccination administered in israel 
the stronger vaccine was given to counter often substandard 
sanitary conditions in the occupied territories such as open 
sewage systems 
the general situation in the west bank is very good but since 
the vaccinations are being done in israel we may administer 
boosters said olivier rafowicz a spokesman for the west bank 
military government

candidate michael dukakis will join celebrities saturday reading 
the names of aids victims memorialized in a 750by500foot quilt 
to be laid out on the elipse behind the white house 
chris minor an atlanta native who made 20 of the quilts 8288 
panels in memory of friends who died of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome said mrs dukakis has helped the antiaids movement in 
san francisco where the quilt project is based and participated in 
a program to take meals to aids victims 
others among the 495 people scheduled to read names of victims 
are actresses shirley mcclaine sigourney weaver and elizabeth 
mcgovern and rep gerry studds dmass 
the framework for the display complete with 16 miles of canvas 
walkway to allow an expected 250000 spectators a closer view of 
the quilts panels was laid out friday each panel is 3feet by 
6feet 
saturdays program scheduled to begin at sunrise with the 
reading of the first set of 32 names as the panels are being laid 
out is expected to last 11 hours according to names project

many of the volunteers became involved with the project after a 
friend died of the disease one group from boston is selling 
travel kits of aspirin condoms safe sex pamphlets and combs 
the travel kits tshirts posters and a book about the life 
stories behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the 
costs of bringing the massive display to the capital 
panels not on the elipse will be on display around the city at 
various aids support group centers american red cross 
headquarters across the street from the quilt has an exhibit of 
photographs of aids victims 
debra resnik who managed a 20city tour for the quilt expected 
the reaction to the display which is now the size of four football 
fields to be similar to what it received on the tour 
it was incredible she said there was such an outpouring 
of relief of pain especially when we went to cities like kansas 
city new orleans baltimore the really sheltered places where 
friends and relatives of aids victims are so alone you have a 
place to go to carry your grief 
former actor barry singer who has aids agreed that the quilt 
offers a chance to humanize the statistics but he said it provokes 
a number of emotions including anger 
there wouldnt have to be a quilt if there would have been 
government intervention he said it is now up to the people to 
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the a 
gay community dying from aids

the nations unemployment rate in september 
fell back to julys level of 54 percent but with the loss of 
37000 factory jobs in the meantime the government said friday 
employers added 255000 new jobs to their payrolls last month 
sending the number of unemployed workers down by a like figure to 
6596000 the labor department said the unemployment total was 
the lowest it has been since june when the jobless rate hit a 
14yearlow 53 percent 
but more than 100000 of the new jobs were an unusually high 
number of teachers returning to the classroom payroll growth in 
the private sector has averaged only 120000 new jobs in each of 
the past two months compared with average monthly gains of 300000 
in the first half of 1988 
the 02 percentage point drop in the september jobless rate 
directly offset an increase of the same size to 56 percent in 
august 
analysts said the figures indicate a continuing trend of slower 
economic growth just what financial markets nervous about an 
overheating economy and inflation wanted going into next months 
presidential election 
if you were republican nominee george bush i dont think 
you could have written a better set of numbers said david wyss 
chief financial economist for data resources inc in lexington 
mass 
wyss called the loss of 18000 factory jobs last month following 
a similar drop of 19000 in august a concern but added if youre 
a republican you avoid the details and look at the big picture 
thats just what president reagan did citing the figures in a 
campaign rally for bush in michigan as evidence that americas 
economy is a grand prix racer 
however there was other evidence in fridays report that the 
job picture is not as rosey as it appears at first glance 
construction employment was flat and oil and gas industry 
rosters fell for the second month in a row together with 
assemblyline employment growth they had been providing an average 
65000 new jobs a month from january through july 
employment growth in business services such as data processing 
that has provided a large chunk of the job gains in the 6yearlong 
economic recovery also has slowed to a trickle the past two months 
the government said 
janet l norwood commissioner of labor statistics told the 
congressional joint economic committee that as many industries lost 
jobs last month as gained them the first time that has occurred in 
more than two years 
citing an unusual monthly drop of 107000 people in the labor 
force larry mishel an economist of the economic policy institute 
a liberal think tank financed largely by labor unions said reagan 
and bush are getting lucky on the demographics 
the whole reason why reagan has been able to achieve low 
unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third 
in the 1980s mishel said president carter had the baby boom 
coming into the labor market and had to create a lot more jobs 
reagan has enjoyed the effects of the baby bust 
economists said they did not expect government economic reports 
due to be released before the nov 8 election to help democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a consulting 
firm based in bala cynwyd pa predicted that the employment 
inflation and trade figures all will paint a rosy economy 
hes not going to get any help from the raw employment 
figures chimerine said of dukakis if hes going to win on 
economics its going to have to come from convincing people 
theres a problem ahead of us 
bush repeatedly has focused on the creation of some 15 million 
new jobs under the reagan administration since the end of the 
198182 recession which had sent the jobless rate into double 
digits 
dukakis has countered that the issue is not the number of new 
jobs being created but the quality of those jobs he has 
emphasized that hourly wages after adjustments for inflation have 
fallen since reagan assumed office in 1981 
august figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that 
argument the labor department reported that real hourly earnings 
in terms of purchasing power dropped 13 percent during the month 
the worst decline since the government began collecting such 
figures in 1964 
the department said average hourly wages rose onehalf 
percentage point or five cents in september to 937 after 
remaining flat in july and august 
over the past year nominal hourly wages have risen at an annual 
rate of 33 percent compared with an inflation rate of 4 percent 
as measured by consumer prices

the us postal service said friday that it 
has suspended recognition equipment inc from bidding on contracts 
pending outcome of a criminal case against the company and two of 
its top executives 
rei chairman william g moore jr and vice president robert w 
reedy were indicted thursday by a federal grand jury in connection 
with an unsuccessful plot to rig bids on 400 million worth of 
postal automation contracts 
assistant postmaster general jack davin in charge of 
procurement announced the suspension which bans the company and 
its subsidiaries from bidding on postal contracts for 120 days and 
can be extended pending resolution of the charges against the 
company 
several relatively small contracts the company and its 
subsidiaries currently have with the postal service will not be 
affected but cannot be expanded or renewed 
according to the indictment the texas companys unsuccessful 
effort was allegedly engineered in 1986 with the help of peter e 
voss vicechairman of the postal services board of governors 
the indictment charged that voss an unindicted coconspirator 
manipulated a postal service decision over procuring sophisticated 
opticalcharacter scanning equipment for sorting mail 
after the procurement scheme came to light in 1986 with voss 
guilty plea to kickback and embezzlement charges the postal 
service suspended the competition and ultimately gave the contract 
to another company 
if rei had won that contract it would have been in a position 
to obtain contracts worth 46 billion over five years

pope john paul ii will use the pulpit of 
three international institutions to advance his view of western 
europe at a time when the region is divided about its future 
political identity 
on a fourday trip to france that starts saturday the pope will 
speak to the council of europe the european court of human rights 
and the european parliament all in strasbourg 
the agreement by common market countries to fully integrate 
their economies in 1992 has touched off widespread debate about 
whether western europe should move toward becoming a single 
political unit 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain raised a storm of 
protest last month when she declared that a usstyle european 
union would be highly damaging to the individual states 
several european countries and common market organs charged that 
her comments were a roadblock to a longdesired goal of unity 
against the backdrop of this debate the polishborn pope is 
expected to elaborate on his own vision of europe one united by 
christianity and stretching from the atlantic to the urals 
a vatican official said the pope wanted to address the three 
international institutions because they pondered the direction of 
europe 
i think he the pope feels very strongly that in the process 
of reflection on the future of europe the churchs voice should be 
there he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
john paul has expounded on the theme several times 
in spain in 1982 john paul called on europe to return to the 
christian principles that tied it together as in medieval days 
you can still be the beacon of civilization and stimulate 
progress throughout the world he said 
in austria the next year he said christianity had formed the 
basis for political systems built on respect for human rights 
the pope felt so strongly about a common european heritage that 
he released an encyclical in 1985 honoring two ninth century saints 
who brought christianity to the slavs in john pauls view saints 
cyril and methodius forged a link between the eastern orthodox and 
western roman catholic traditions 
part of his reflection on the christian roots of europe is to 
encourage a revival of christianity the vatican official said 
the pope has expressed particular concern about the church in 
france although over 80 percent of french citizens are roman 
catholics less than 20 percent attend mass according to french 
public opinion polls 
this trip the popes fourth to france will include visits to 
the dioceses of metz nancy and mulhouse in the northeast near west 
germany 
in addition john paul will salute strasbourg on its 2000th 
birthday 
the city which changed hands between france and germany for 
centuries has a blend of cultures that has attracted groups 
promoting european unity 
the council of europe composed of 21 parliamentary democracies 
aims to coordinate european legislation through accords the 
european court of human rights hears alleged violations of the 
council of europes main treaty the european convention of human 
rights 
the european parliament is the parliamentary assembly of the 
european economic community

seventyfive years ago friday in a small 
factory in highland park henry ford put in motion an industrial 
revolution on that day the first model t moved through an 
assembly line towed by a rope 
although the technology has been updated the assembly line 
lives on 
indeed what happened in detroit transformed the entire nature 
of the 20th century perhaps more than any other development except 
the atomic bomb said david hounshell a history professor at the 
university of delaware 
the revolution was the installation and elaboration of the 
moving assembly line he said friday at a ceremony at fords 
wayne assembly plant 20 miles from the factory where henry ford 
made and history 
actually use of an assembly line began a few months before oct 
7 1913 hounshell said someone in fords flywheelmagneto 
assembly area decided to keep workers stationary and the product 
moving the technique spread to other component operations 
this was the granddaddy of all assembly lines the line one 
imagines when one hears the words assembly line hounshell 
said its success raising the productivity of final assembly 
was overwhelming 
by the early 1920s many household appliances such as vacuum 
cleaners and even radios were assembled on an assembly line 
on friday another model t rolled off an assembly line this one 
with fords greatgrandson edsel ford ii at the wheel 
at ford motor co many of our goals today are the same as 
they were in my greatgrandfathers time to meet consumers needs 
by producing affordable highquality vehicles that represent good 
value for the money ford said 
not all workers were enamored with the assembly line in late 
1913 there was high employee turnover and talk of work stoppages 
until henry ford in 1914 announced he would pay workers the 
thenincredible sum of 5 per day 
within a year the winchandrope system that drew the first 
model t through the plant was replaced by a chain with other 
manufacturing improvements production time continued to drop as 
did the cost of the vehicle

a federal appeals court on friday struck down 
an environmental protection agency policy not to list used oil 
collected for recyling as hazardous waste 
at issue was epas decision in 1986 that a hazardouswaste 
designation would only create a stigma and discourage many 
locations such as gasoline stations from collecting used oil for 
recycling 
but a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here said that factor cannot be taken into account particularly 
when epa had already concluded that a broad category of used oils 
were hazardous wastes 
the epa erroneously based its decision not to list recycled 
oils as hazardous wastes on the stigmatic effects of such a 
listing a factor not permitted by the statute the court said 
it ordered epa to determine if recycled oils meet the 
technical criteria for listing as hazardous wastes 
i would consider this a major victory to clean up billions 
of gallons of used oil said jane l bloom an attorney for the 
natural resources defense council 
she predicted that the courts decision will force epa to 
declare broad categories of used oil hazardous wastes because the 
agencys own studies have documented that it contains many toxic 
chemicals 
the courts action should force epa to stop the dumping of 
waste oil into municipal landfills and lead to better treatment an 
reclamation of the oil said david r case general counsel of 
the hazardous waste treatment council 
the decision means epa should be more concerned about the 
stigma of harm to the environment than the stigma of calling 
recycled oil a hazardous waste said case whose organization 
represents large wastedisposal companies 
lisa friedman an epa attorney said the court ruling arguably 
leaves a lot of discretion to the agency to determine whether 
certain oils are hazardous she said the agency was studying the 
ruling and had not decided how to proceed 
in 1985 epa proposed to list a broad category of used 
automotive and industrial oils as hazardous wastes but it backed 
off in 1986 after receiving nearly 800 comments from gasoline 
dealers and other recyclers 
the agency deferred any decision on used oil generally but 
decided not to list oil collected for recycling as hazardous waste 
the effect of listing would create such a stigma in the used 
oil recycling industry that many recycling sources woudl simply 
refuse to take used oil friedman said 
epa decided that the used oil might then be diverted to less 
environmentally sound management options such as throwing it down 
the sewer she said 
the appeals court said epas concern over the possible adverse 
environmental consequences of listing used oil may well be 
warranted but such views cannot override the intent of 
congress clearly expressed in the language and structure of the 
statute 
it is the agencys obligation to comply with the dictates of 
congress and ours to enforce them a threejudge panel said in an 
opinion by circuit judge james l buckley that was joined by judges 
stephen williams and edward d re 
congress carefully separated the listing decision from the 
resultant regulatory decisions buckley wrote and a 1985 law 
enacted to prod epa to take action simply requires the agency to 
determine whether to list used oil as hazardous 
only after the epa decides to list does the statute permit it 
to consider the effect of its regulations on recycling he wrote 
the epa estimates that 12 billion gallons of used oil is 
produced annually but only half is recycled said jacqueline 
warren another attorney for the natural resources defense council 
the laundry list of substances that have been found in used 
oil is alarming she said these include benzene pcb and heavy 
metals such as lead cadmium and chromium 
in a separate opinion issued friday the appeals court panel 
upheld epas rules governing the burning of hazardous waste and 
used oil

veteran politicians who rose to 
prominence before gen augusto pinochet seized power 15 years ago 
dominate the field of potential candidates for a presidential 
election next year 
in the opposition which includes parties from the left to the 
centerright a few younger leaders who made important 
contributions to the fight against the authoritarian president also 
are among possible nominees 
pinochet 72 would be the top contender on the right if he 
decides to run the constitution allows him to be a candidate but 
he has not announced his plans 
on wednesday chileans voted in a referendum to reject 
pinochets bid to extend his rule until 1997 clearing the way for 
an election in december 1989 
patricio aylwin and ricardo lagos moderate politicians who led 
the opposition campaign for the referendum are the strongest 
contenders in the opposition 
aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic party 
the countrys largest is a seasoned politican and former senator 
who played a key role in the tumultuous days before the 1973 coup 
in which pinochet toppled the elected government of salvador 
allende 
aylwin was the main spokesman for the 16party coalition that 
campaigned against pinochet in the referendum and he received more 
publicity than most of his peers in a massively attended final 
campaign rally he delivered a forceful and eloquent speech that 
showed his oratory skills 
aylwin a 67yearold law professor is more widely accepted by 
conservative sectors than lagos and other prominent opposition 
leaders 
lagos 50 a moderate socialist economist and lawyer is a 
relative newcomer to politics he was catapulted to national 
prominence by his dramatic performance in a campaign television 
debate 
in the debate the charismatic toughtalking lagos challenged 
pinochet personally staring into the camera and shaking his 
finger never before during pinochets rule had television shown 
such a scene 
but many consider lagos socialist ideas and his connections 
with the allende government offensive to centerright groups in the 
opposition lagos was a middleranking official for the allende 
administration 
aylwin and lagos have denied any presidential ambitions and said 
the opposition needs an allout effort to agree on a single 
candidate to lead a government of national unity after pinochet 
its too early to talk about candidates aylwin said 
thursday in his first news conference after the opposition victory 
lagos asked friday about his possible presidential candidacy 
replied is there going to be an election now as far as i know 
augusto pinochet is still pretty much alive and well 
many observers think aylwin would have a better chance at 
nomination especially if the opposition succeeds with plans to 
create a fouryear transition government lagos comparative youth 
gives him the option of waiting until a later election 
other dissident figures mentioned as potential candidates 
include christian democrats gabriel valdes 66 and andres 
zaldivar 52 both held cabinet posts in the government of former 
president eduardo frei in the 1960s but they gained additional 
prominence in the years of opposition to pinochet 
the only civilian with prominence anywhere near pinochets is 
sergio onofre jarpa a 67yearold landowner and former senator 
with a reputation of being as fiercily anticommunist as pinochet 
few doubt that pinochet himself could be nominated despite his 
defeat in the referendum he still won 43 percent of the vote 
he is the most important political figure in the country 
said interior minister sergio fernandez few leaders in the world 
would be able to get such an extrordinary vote after 15 years in 
power

rallies to gain more national power for himself and for serbia the 
largest of yugoslavias six republics

a mercenary shot down in nicaragua flying supplies 
to the contras is suing irancontra figures richard secord and 
albert hakim for 135 million saying they misled the crew and 
abandoned him during three months of captivity 
eugene hasenfus of marinette wis also sued southern air 
transport a shadowy cialinked cargo airline and corporate air 
services which he identified as a shell company owned by southern 
air and controlled by secord and hakim 
southern air spokesman jack thale denied friday any connection 
with hasenfus the suit claimed the company paid his expenses 
hasenfus filed a similar suit in washington federal court in 
may but jurisdiction questions are pending there because the 
planes allegedly flew out of miami where southern air and 
corporate air are based 
hasenfus plane was shot down over nicaragua in 1986 he 
parachuted to safety but three crewmen died hasenfus was tried by 
the sandinistas and sentenced to 30 years in prison then sent back 
to the united states after three months 
hasenfus and his wife sally said they were told the supply 
operation was a patriotic mission but later found out secord and 
hakim were profiting from the deal 
he also said secord hakim and the state department promised 
help when he was captured but never delivered 
this guy was captured by the sandinistas said secords 
attorney thomas c green what did he expect that the us 
military would step in and save him 
the suit filed tuesday in federal court says that hasenfus was 
recruited in 1986 through corporate air and william cooper a 
southern air pilot 
cooper who later died in the crash led hasenfus to believe 
the contra resupply operation was being run right out of the 
back door of the white house by oliver north secord hakim and 
southern air the suit said 
hakim and secord a retired air force major general are accused 
with former national security council figures oliver north and john 
poindexter of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting 
proceeds from iran arms sales to the contras at a time when 
congress banned us military aid to the rebels 
thale denied any relationship between southern air and corporate 
air although federal aviation administration records in 1986 
listed them at the same address

the director general of unesco pledged friday to 
revamp the organizations communications programs so the united 
states and britain will return to the world body they accused of 
being antiwestern 
federico mayor said unescos role as a forum for attitudes such 
as restrictions on press freedom prompted the two countries to 
resign from the un educational scientific and cultural 
organization 
the united states left at the end of 1984 and britain left in 
1985 they accused mayors predecessor amadou mahtar mbow of 
senegal of an antiwestern bias 
frankly i consider that the problem was not mismanagement 
and the other reasons given but was mainly related to programs 
particularly the communications program mayor said 
the spanish biochemist who took over as head of unesco 11 
months ago told a news conference that a new communications 
program he was preparing would try to overcome controversies that 
have dogged the organization for more than a decade 
this is a house of freedom and we can never go against our 
constitution which says we guarantee a free flow of information 
mayor said he said he rejected the concept of a new world 
information order promoted by third world and soviet bloc nations 
mayor also said he could not accept proposals made in the past 
at unesco that critics said could lead to licensing of journalists 
asked whether he was retreating from unesco resolutions that 
call for a better balance in the flow of information between 
industrialized nations and the third world mayor said providing 
equipment and training for people in communications and not just 
journalists was the best way to arrive at a more balanced 
situation 
he has proposed that unesco establish a satellite network for 
education report on the state of the environment annually and 
educate youths on the dangers of using drugs to improve athletic 
performance 
third world countries have long complained that the 
industralized nations dominate the flow of information under mbow 
they joined up with the soviet bloc to seek ways to control the 
press by establishing the new information order 
mayor said the new communications program will be submitted to 
the governing executive board which meets next week to plan for 
the 1990s 
mayor said he was working hard to get the united states and 
britain to rejoin because without them the organization was 
mutilated singapore also has withdrawn from unesco 
both the united states and britain have said it will be at least 
1990 before they will consider returning to unesco between them 
they provided 30 percent of the budget for the 158nation body 
mayor was in britain earlier in the week lobbying for its return 
and plans a similar trip to the united states in december

a group of 501 kurdish refugees returned 
to iraq voluntarily on friday two months after they fled and 
claimed that iraqi forces dropped chemical bombs on their 
settlements 
regional gov hayri kozakcioglu said in a telephone interview 
that the kurdish refugees the second group to return were 
transferred to iraq from a southeastern border post in habur 
a group of 969 kurdish refugees returned to iraq on wednesday 
the two groups were among 60000 kurds who were settled in five 
tent cities in southeastern turkey in august after they left iraq 
at the urging of turkey iraq proclaimed an amnesty for the 
kurds before the first group returned only two kurds had taken 
advantage of the amnesty 
the second group of kurds was granted special status because the 
amnesty expired thursday night a turkish government official said 
on condition of anonymity 
kozakcioglu said some of the refugees at diyarbakir tent city 
threw stones at the returnees friday and tried to keep them from 
leaving he said they called the returnees traitors and spies of 
the iraqi regime 
police fired in the air and firefighters shot water to disperse 
the crowd kozakcioglu said two policemen and four kurds were 
slightly injured 
the kurds traveled for 20 hours on buses and open trucks to the 
border the government said iraq gave assurances that the refugees 
would be safely settled in their villages 
turkey initially asked the international red cross to supervise 
the return but the red cross declined after iraq refused to grant 
its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees 
the kurds 20 million people living in a region where borders of 
turkey iran and iraq converge have been fighting for independence 
for the past century 
iraq stepped up attacks on the kurds soon after iran agreed to a 
ceasefire in their eightyear war on aug 20 
security forces in the southeastern township of uludere killed 
two kurdish guerrillas in a clash the regional governors office 
said 
the statement carried by the semiofficial anatolia news 
agency said authorities told rebels to surrender and the 
guerrillas opened fire on thursday it said one guerrilla was 
captured 
the suspects were responsible for killing a policeman and a 
village guard and wounding three soldiers in three different 
attacks 
the guerrillas were believed to be members of the outlawed 
kurdish labor party which wants to set up a marxist state in parts 
of eastern and southeastern turkey 
more than 900 civilians and security personnel and an equal 
number of insurgents have been killed since the rebels started 
hitandrun attacks in 1984 official reports say 
kurds make up about onefifth of turkeys population of 52 
million

time before the higher court ruled the appeals court restored the 
higher payments

such a request even though hundreds of her decisions were appealed 
during the six years he worked for her 
previously leventhal testified that in june 1983 mrs gabel 
ordered capasso to pay his wife 1850 a week but reduced that to 
680 a week in september

stephen j mernick the orthodox jewish 
businessman who wants to purchase the assets of the ptl christian 
ministry said friday he is keeping all options open about their 
future use 
he said he is willing to talk to jim and tammy bakker about 
their possible activities at heritage usa a christian retreat and 
theme park in york county sc and the other assets to be 
purchased for 115 million 
i have made no decision whatsoever as to the utilization of 
the heritage assets mernick 34 said at a news conference at 
his lawyers office in the toronto suburb of north york 
over the next several weeks i will be engaged in an intensive 
analysis of the property in order to determine their best possible 
use from a business and financial standpoint he said 
mernick said he was interested primarily in the assets for their 
real estate potential especially the 1700 undeveloped acres 
adjacent to the 500acre heritage park 
he did not rule out negotiating with the bakkers about their 
lease of any of the properties or the satellite television 
facilities 
im a very openminded person im prepared to speak to them 
and anyone mernick said 
bakker stepped down as leader of ptl after admitting to a sexual 
encounter in march 1987 but has since been trying to regain control 
of the ministry 
mernick clarified in an opening statement that he was purchasing

excellent potential for condominiums retail and office development

cuba angola and south africa held 
informal talks friday on plans for south africa to end its rule 
over neighboring southwest africa and for cuba to withdraw about 
50000 troopers from angola 
chester crocker us undersecretary of state for african 
affairs mediated the talks continuing the role he played in 
meetings earlier this year in brazzaville the congo according to 
american and south african officials 
aubry dwyer a spokesman for south africas un mission 
confirmed the talks were being held he said the south african 
delegation was led by neil van heerden directorgeneral of 
political affairs 
no announcement was expected at the conclusion of the talks and 
officials did not say where the negotiations were being held other 
than they were in new york 
dwyer said the talks dealt with a timetable for the withdrawal 
of the cuban military personnel in line with the nov 1 deadline 
south africa accepted for beginning a plan for independence for 
southwest africa also known as namibia 
south africa insists the cubans should be removed from 
marxistruled angola in about a year 
in earlier rounds of talks cuba and angola first said the 
withdrawal would take four years then lowered that to three and 
last month reportedly accepted a proposal for a twoyear phased 
withdrawal 
officials involved in the talks have expressed confidence a 
mutually acceptable timetable will be worked out during the next 
formal meeting of the four parties in brazzaville 
no date has been set for those talks but they presumably would 
be held before the nov 1 date for south africa to begin 
implementing un resolution 435 passed 10 years ago calling for 
independence for namibia 
the united nations plans to send a peacekeeping force of 7500 
military personnel and 2000 members of a civilian support staff to 
oversee elections for a national assembly in namibia 
a un advance team is now in namibia checking on housing 
airports and other facilities the peacekeepers will need un 
officials have estimated the peacekeeping force to be called the 
un transition assistance group will cost 600 million to 700 
million 
south africa has administered namibia under a mandate from the 
defunct league of nations since the end of world war i 
the un general assembly and security council have revoked the 
mandate and declared south africas administration illegal 
namibia is located between south africa and angola which 
received independence from portugal in 1975 marxist forces 
defeated prowestern groups in a civil war following independence 
but rebels of the union for total independence for angola 
supported by south africa and the united states have waged 
guerrilla warfare against the government and cuba sent troops into 
angola to help battle the rebels

attorney general dick thornburgh moved friday 
to develop programs that maintain the highest ethical standards 
in a department previously run by edwin meese iii who was for 14 
months under criminal investigation 
subordinates cannot be left to speculate as to the values of 
the organization thornburgh said in his first major speech to 
justice department employees as attorney general 
top leadership must give forth clear and explicit signals 
lest any confusion or uncertainty exist over what is and is not 
permissible conduct thornburgh added 
he said that to do otherwise allows informal and potentially 
subversive codes of conduct to be transmitted with a wink and a 
nod and encourages an inferior ethical system based on going 
along to get along or on the notion that everybodys doing it 
the attorney general in his remarks made no reference to meese 
who left the department in august thornburgh introduced the 
subject of ethics by quoting the results of a newly released 
associated pressmedia general poll showing that seven out of 10 
americans think illegal payoffs are common in the federal 
government 
thornburgh also raised the issue of how close the relationship 
should be between an attorney general and the president saying 
that how their relationship can be both as close as it should be 
and as correct as it ought to be is a difficult question and one 
that is worthy of study thornburgh said there is a need to look 
analytically at the relationship 
a thornburgh assistant david runkel later said thornburgh 
wasnt referring to any specific relationship such as the 
particularly close one between president reagan and meese runkel 
said that thornburgh was expressing a general feeling that the 
matter should be examined as a subject of scholarly study outside 
the justice department and that the comment wasnt meant as a 
criticism of anyone 
the criminal investigation of meese stemmed from his ties to 
longtime friend e robert wallach and culminated in july with no 
indictment but a finding by independent counsel james mckay that 
meese had probably twice broken conflictofinterest laws and tax 
laws 
thornburgh said he has requested deputy attorney general harold 
christensen to gather the views of all senior management to help 
in developing proposals that will aid our employees in maintaining 
the highest ethical standards 
he said the questions that should be addressed include how to 
avoid any appearance of personal and financial conflict of 
interest how to deal with lapses in behavior how to properly 
regulate interaction between employees and outside groups and what 
perks are proper and which are out of bounds 
the overall goal is not to put shackles on a department whose 
honesty and integrity are beyond any serious dispute said 
thornburgh the goal is to put our ideals and our principles 
on the record and to say to the public these are our standards 
and we mean to live up to them watch us do it 
a section of the code of federal regulations sets out standards 
of conduct for justice department employees dealing with such 
questions as potential conflicts of interest 
but what the attorney general asked christensen to do is to 
review that code in light of current concerns and current issues 
runkel said after the speech he said ethics are a subject of 
increasing concern in business politics and the religious 
community as well 
because something was written 10 years ago doesnt mean it 
applies to all situatons today said runkel who said the result 
of the justice department effort may mean some clarifications 
not a massive rewrite of the justice department portion of the 
code of federal regulations pertaining to ethics 
the new attorney general also said that department employees 
should close ranks following internal debate so that the 
justice department speaks with one voice to do otherwise he 
said would only give aid and comfort to our adversaries 
in addition thornburgh said that his management style is no 
surprises that he wants to hear bad news directly from employees 
and that i dont want to find out about it first by the backdoor 
or from our friends in the news media

president reagan telephoned syndicated 
columnist carl t rowan on friday to offer congratulations on the 
district of columbias decision to drop its weaponspossession case 
against him rowan said 
the president said it was an outrage that they prosecuted 
me said rowan who had lashed out on thursday at city officials 
calling their case against him a malicious political 
prosecution 
reagan made the call because he considers rowan a friend and was 
concerned about him according to a white house official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the 63yearold columnist had been charged with using an 
unregistered weapon and ammunition to wound a teenager who 
intruded in his back yard in june if he had been convicted on the 
misdemeanor charges he would have faced a maximum penalty of two 
years in prison and a 2000 fine 
when a jury hearing the case remained deadlocked after more than 
eight hours district of columbia superior court judge arthur l 
burnett sr declared a mistrial the city decided wednesday not to 
retry the case 
rowan who has advocated strict handgun control in columns and 
speeches has stressed that he also had the right to take whatever 
means necessary to protect himself and his family the columnist 
said reagan agreed 
he reagan reiterated his stance that hes in favor of a 
waiting period so that criminals and nuts cannot buy guns rowan 
said but he does not favor a situation where robbers and rapists 
can sit assured that they can have a gun 
rowan who has dined privately with the reagans said he and the 
president talked about his legal ordeal and other matters for four 
or five minutes 
rowan and nancy reagan were guests of washington redskins owner 
jack kent cooke for last sundays contest against the new york 
giants where mrs reagan delivered an antidrug message 
when rowan mentioned that he had seen mrs reagan at the 
football contest the president responded you know that lady 
had a lot to do with my calling according to rowan 
more than 200 other wellwishers have telephoned him in the last 
two days rowan said 
i dont think it will quiet down for another 200 calls he 
said

the atomic safety and licensing appeal board 
vacated on friday another nuclear regulatory commission panels 
decision to go forward with a fullpower license for the shoreham 
nuclear power plant on long island ny 
the appeal board found that the atomic safety and licensing 
board did not have the authority to remove state and local 
governments as intevenors in a case before a different panel said 
nrc spokesman john kopeck 
fridays ruling reverses that and at the same time says all 
outstanding emergency planning issues have not been resolved 
kopeck said 
thus the fullpower license authorization does not exist and 
that authorization must be vacated he said 
in a 20page decision the threejudge appeals panel agreed with 
shorehams owners that the state and local governments had 
obstructed the discovery process and failed to obey certain 
licensing board orders and that the only appropriate sanction 
is dismissal 
however the licensing board only had authority to dismiss the 
governments in the case it was hearing according to the appeals 
board 
jim lois a spokesman for the long island lighting co which 
owns the embattled 53 billion plant said the company will fight 
fridays ruling 
todays decision by the appeals board did not overrule the 
licensing board decision on the merits of emergency planning nor 
did the appeals court overrule the findings that the intervening 
new york governments had indeed acted willfully and in bad faith by 
obstructing the judicial process lois said we will appeal 
todays decision directly to the nuclear regulatory commission 
francis sheehan a spokesman for new york gov mario cuomo said 
the governor was studying the decision and would have no immediate 
comment 
the atomic safety and licensing board in a ruling sept 23 
elimiminated new york state suffolk county and the town of 
southampton as intervenors in a case involving an emergency 
evacuation drill conducted earlier this year the panel also found 
that there was reasonable assurance that the publics safety could 
be protected in the event of an accident at the reactor 
by a 21 decision the panel agreed with long island lightings 
argument that realism dictated that in case of an actual 
accident state and local authorities would in fact cooperate 
with emergency measures planned by the company even if they didnt 
have their own plan 
current federal regulation prevents the nrc from issuing a 
fullpower license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency 
plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be safe if an 
accident occurs

michael dukakis attacked the republicans 
friday for standing by while foreigners are buying up america 
but he mistakenly told workers at a plant owned by italians that 
they were survivors in the international trade battles 
the democratic presidential nominee used the moog automotive co 
plant as the backdrop for a speech blasting gop vice presidential 
candidate dan quayles statement wednesday that he welcomed foreign 
investment in us factories business and real estate 
if anyone asks you whats at stake in this election just 
remind them of that moment in the debate wednesday night when sen 
quayle said hes happy that foreign owners are buying up america 
dukakis said 
maybe the republican ticket wants our children to work for 
foreign owners pay rent to foreign owners and owe their future to 
foreign owners but thats not the kind of future lloyd bentsen 
and i and missouri rep dick gephardt want for america he 
continued 
dukakis comments caused one executive at the plant to ask 
another whether the democratic presidential candidate realized who 
the plants owners were 
the moog family sold the company more than 10 years ago to ifint 
usa the american subsidiary of ifi of turin italy ifi is owned 
by the agnelli family which also owns the automaker fiat 
dukakis adviser kirk odonnell said that officials at the 
campaign headquarters were aware of the ownership prior to the 
event another adviser thomas herman said that dukakis himself 
was not aware of the companys italian owners 
the bush campaign took delight in what spokesman mark goodin 
called dukakis gaffe 
it occurs to me that that tank ride he took a few weeks ago 
may have done more damage than i first suspected even with his 
protective head gear goodin said referring to dukakis ride in 
an army tank during a campaign visit to a defense plant 
the bottom line is america is competing better overseas we 
are opening access to foreign markets we are better controlling 
the foreign trade deficit while the us economy continues to 
expand as usual the governor is out in left field somewhere 
goodin said 
odonnell herman and other dukakis aides moved quickly in an 
effort to convince reporters that dukakis was not criticizing moog 
or its owners but was opposed to the growing trend of foreign 
investment in the united states 
if youre going to talk about foreign invesment thats the 
kind of place to do it odonnell said 
but in his speech dukakis referred to the company as one of the 
few survivors of the auto parts industrys battle with foreign 
competitors 
here at moog automotive you know as well as anyone that 
american businesses and american products and american jobs are 
fighting for survival in the world marketplace dukakis said in 
the speech whether or not we win that battle will determine 
whether our children and grandchildren and generations to come 
continue to enjoy an american standard of living 
dukakis then departed from the text of his speech to tell the 
workers he realized that they understood that message telling the 
workers you are one of the few survivors 
odonnell said that dukakis was not outrightly opposed to 
foreign investment in the united states and noted that the company 
had american management and was an exporter 
in the speech dukakis told the union workers that quayle is 
happy to hand a for sale sign on america and that bush has 
spent the last eight years with a do not disturb sign on his 
office door 
in constrast dukakis said he and running mate lloyd bentsen 
work aggressively to win access for us products to foreign 
markets and would offer protection to certain american industries 
provided those companies agreed to modernize their plants and 
retrain their workers to become more competitive 
dukakis denounced reagan administration officials he said had 
sought foreign help in fighting the recently passed trade bill and 
also chided a former reagan administration official who was seeking 
a loobying job with japanese auto parts manufactuers at the same 
time he was representing the united states in trade negotiations 
with japanese auto parts makers 
while bush has been a summer soldier in the battle for 
americas economic future some of his colleagues in this 
adminstration have been trying to enlist on the other side 
dukakis said in a dukakis white house my friends were going 
to fight for americas economic future and well pledge allegiance 
to only one flag old glory 
from missouri dukakis was headed to north carolina another key 
swing state where the democratic ticket believes it has a good 
chance to defeat bush and quayle on saturday the massachusetts 
governor was campaigning in maine

a felony court acquitted a greek 
businessman of espionage friday although he admitted giving 
details of the usbuilt stinger antiaircraft missile to the 
soviet union 
the threemember court said michalis megaloconomou was innocent 
on the ground the material handed over was not secret 
megaloconomou took unclassified materials for a wellknown 
weapons system the soviet union wasnt going to build anything 
from material it already had obtained from other people 
prosecutor constantinos androulikakis said in his summing up 
the 40yearold businessman told the court he gave 400 
microfiche cards to a soviet intelligence agent in april 1984 but 
didnt know they contained information on the shoulderfired 
stingers trigger system 
i thought they contained information on a telephone system 
he said 
megaloconomou also told the court he traveled to the soviet 
union in 1984 on a false passport and was given a miniature camera 
decoding pads and a radio receiver by a soviet agent 
the case was linked with the may 1985 defection in athens of 
soviet agent sergei bokhane whose revelations cast doubts on 
greeces capacity to safeguard nato secrets and delayed the sale of 
40 usmade jet fighters to greece 
brig ioannis alexakis a former head of counterintelligence 
for the greek central intelligence service told the court 
wednesday megaloconomou had been a soviet spy for 10 years when he 
was arrested in september 1985 
but the prosecutor addressing only the stinger case said we 
cant say he gave secrets to a foreign power and endangered the 
security of greece or its allies espionage is taking state secrets 
with the intent of harming the nation 
megaloconomou is a former deputy director at standard electric 
hellas or seh a greek company affiliated with the american 
international telephone amp telegraph corp itt 
also acquitted were two seh employees commercial director 
constantinos libousakis and secretary artmenis tzirozidou who were 
tried on misdemeanor charges in the same court for violating state 
secrets through negligence 
seh was among firms in six western european countries that 
manufactured stinger components under license 
megaloconomou was arrested on the basis of information given to 
the american cia by bokhane who served as deputy head of the 
soviet military intelligence agency gru in athens 
bokhane said megaloconomou was recruited by the gru in 1975 and 
began selling them information in 1977 according to alexakis 
in a 1986 trial a greek navy officer and a greek businessman 
accused of selling information and telecommunications equipment to 
moscow were acquitted on the ground that greek intelligence 
services couldnt confirm bokhanes allegations 
the united states delayed approving the sale of the f16 
jetfighters to greece until premier andreas papandreous socialist 
government signed an agreement in 1986 pledging to prevent advanced 
western technology from reaching the soviet union

trade will not include military products

said would benefit both sides 
south korea a us ally has improved its trade and other 
relations with other communist nations such as china 
rha listed coal iron ore and corn as probable import items from 
north korea and steel and textiles as likely south korean exports 
to the north 
any trade either direct or through third nations would depend 
on north korean consent there are no indications the north would 
accept trade with the south and past efforts at improving 
relations have had little success 
the countries do not have any contacts or ties beyond a single 
hotline the border is sealed and both nations have been locked in 
a bitter confrontation for 40 years

a beirut magazine said friday the captors 
of anglican church envoy terry waite will free him very soon 
and american hostages will be released before the us presidential 
election nov 8 
ashshiraa said two other british hostages will be freed with 
waite who has been missing since january 1987 alanwar a 
conservative daily newspaper based in christian east beirut said 
waite would be freed within 72 hours 
an israeli newpaper said the united states made a deal with iran 
to free american hostages in exchange for delivery of arms and 
spare parts through south korea us officials denied the report 
lebanese police said two unidentified foreigners kidnapped in 
moslem west beirut 21 months ago were czechoslovak businessmen held 
only a few days 
that leaves 14 foreigners missing in lebanon including nine 
americans 
the anglican church and british government said they had no 
information about waite 
both beirut publications have been inaccurate in recent reports 
about hostages but ashshiraa based in moslem west beirut 
correctly revealed in november 1986 that the united states had 
secretly delivered arms to iran 
the report about arms in the nation a new englishlanguage 
israeli weekly was not attributed it said the us government 
also agreed to pay 7 million ransom to shiite moslem extremists 
holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from 
prosecution 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied the report but 
said there were a lot of freelancers independent operators in 
the region on thursday secretary of state george p shultz said 
washington was not dealing with iran and that anyone who tries to 
cut across our policies should butt out 
president reagan refused questions about the reports as he left 
for a speaking engagement in detroit fitzwater traveling with 
him said there was nothing new on any hostages 
the british foreign office said of the waite story we have 
nothing that would indicate this is anything different from all the 
hundreds of previous reports 
lambeth palace london headquarters of the archbishop of 
canterbury said we have not heard anything here and in view of 
the sort of relationships we have established we would be likely 
to hear something 
waite personal emissary of archbishop robert runcie 
disappeared after leaving his west beirut hotel to meet with a 
group holding hostages including american terry anderson 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 and is the foreigner held 
longest 
britains recent decision to restore full diplomatic relations 
with iran provided efforts currently under way to release waite 
and his countrymen with a strong impetus ashshiraa reported 
the other british hostages are journalist alec collett 
kidnapped march 25 1985 and television news producer john 
mccarthy seized april 17 1986 hostage brian keenan held since 
april 11 1986 is irish but also holds a british passport 
on april 23 1986 a group calling itself the revolutionary 
organization of socialist moslems said it had killed collett a 
videotape purporting to show him hanged was made public but no 
body was found 
ashshiraa quoted a security source it did not name as saying 
the release monday of mithileshwar singh an indian who is a 
resident us alien marked the beginning of the release of more 
american hostages 
the source said american hostages would be released before the 
us presidential elections it said without further elaboration 
fitzwater asked whether the us government was involved in 
negotiations or deals for singhs release replied thats not 
true 
singh was kidnapped jan 24 1987 by a proiranian group 
calling itself islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine taken 
with him from the campus of the usaffiliated beirut university 
college were american teachers alann steen robert polhill and 
jesse turner 
 
the nation report said that two weeks before singhs release 
south korean oil minister lee bong signed an agreement in tehran to 
sell to iran millions of dollars in spare parts for irans 
usmade armaments 
it also said iran agreed to provide the 7 million ransom 
demanded by the kidnappers because the united states did not want 
to appear to be purchasing their freedom 
the money would be paid indirectly to the kidnappers by iran in 
the form of commissions for iranian purchases in the united states 
according to the nation 
it said the deal was struck after a group of us citizens who 
hold iranian and lebanese passports were permitted to visit 
anderson and one other american hostage in january 
giora shamis owner of the news service that sold the story to 
the nation told the associated press the report was based on 
interviews with three of about 15 dualpassport holders involved in 
the contacts as well as south korean sources shamiss news 
service depth is based in london 
alanwar quoted two sources it did not identify in the report on 
waite 
it said one reported waite has been moved from the bekaa

the government has denied amnesty 
internationals reports of political assassinations and political 
prisoners in mexico saying they deform reality 
the londonbased human rights organization said wednesday in its 
annual report that it continued to receive complaints from mexico 
of arbitrary arrests and assassinations of members of groups 
frequently related to land disputes 
many assassinations were attributed to civilian gunmen linked 
to landowners but seemed to have the consent of the authorities 
the report said 
the interior ministry released a communique thursday saying the 
government expressed its absolute rejection of the allegations 
amnesty internationals mention of the existence of political 
prisoners in mexico is unfounded it said 
it also said the government made a detailed check of cases 
mentioned by amnesty and found the cases were properly described by 
mexican police and judicial authorities as involving common crimes 
without the influence of any kind of political situation 
the ministry said amnesty distributes reports without checking 
the facts and without an opportune presentation to the government 
of our country 
amnesty international said it was in communication with the 
government by letter and visits by government representatives to 
the organization 
its annual report said at least 23 people adopted as prisoners 
of conscience by the organization remain in jail some of the 
prisoners have been sentenced for crimes such as robbery assault 
and homicide the report said but it added it seems these charges 
were imposed for political motives for legal peaceful activities 
as campesino or community leaders

four americans sailed into laotian 
waters friday and floated dollar bills stamped with a 24 million 
reward offer for missing us servicemen 
thai navy boats waved the group back to shore and retrieved the 
money but the americans said they threw it back into the mekong 
river 
the americans tossed sealed plastic envelopes containing a total 
of about 1000 into the river after their two rented fishing boats 
moved about 220 yards into laotian waters the mekong forms a 
boundary between laos and thailand and flows to cambodia and 
vietnam 
they also stuffed us and soviet currency into a toy boat 
guided by remote control toward laos 
we are really encouraged we had a great day said bruce 
adams of laramie wyo 
adams and the other three belong to a private lobbying group 
called the national steering committee for american war veterans 
they believe americans taken prisoner during the indochina war are 
still held in communist laos cambodia and vietnam 
those three governments deny holding any americans 
adams is convinced his brother stephen remains captive in laos 
since he was reported missing 22 years ago 
laotian authorities captured two other members of the group 
sunday after they sailed into the same general area tossed the 
same reward offers into the river then apparently landed at a 
laotian village 
the us embassy in vientiene said it has received no response 
to its inquiry about the americans donna long of jacksonville 
nc and james copp of hampstead nc 
rep frank mccloskey dind was quoted by the linton ind 
daily citizen newspaper as saying friday the state department told 
him the two are held in a compound in vientiene capital of laos 
the state department is confident they will be out in a short 
time mccloskey was quoted as saying im very optimistic they 
will be released in a short time 
the thai navy boat asked the americans to stop tossing the 
packets waved them back to thai shores then began retrieving the 
money 
it wont work its incredibly stupid one thai officer told 
reporters 
the navy boat then escorted ted sampley the group leader to a 
navy station where he was told the groups actions were not 
allowed an officer returned 90 packets of dollar bills to sampley 
and the former green beret from kingston nc said he would have 
to toss them back into the river 
so we tossed them into the river from the thai side and all 
the kids enjoyed plunging into the mekong to get them said 
sampley 
lynn hampton of winter haven fla handed out balloons and 
reward stickers to youngsters ms hampton was a nurse during the 
vietnam war 
the other member of the group william sullivan of jacksonville 
nc was in the marine corps during the war 
the 24 million is being offered to any laotian cambodian or 
vietnamese who brings out an american war prisoner the money was 
pledged by 21 us congressmen and citizens 
about 58000 americans died before us forces withdrew from the 
vietnam war in 1973 and the us government still lists 2393 
americans as missing in action in vietnam laos and cambodia 
thai navy officials said the groups entry into laotian waters 
could jeopardize thailaotian relations 
the us government also has criticized the reward offer as an 
impediment to official contacts with the indochinese governments to 
account for the missing servicemen

friday was the last day on the air for radio 
station wnbc for 62 years the flagship of the nbc radio network 
that was home to jack benny bob hope fred allen and the nbc 
symphony conducted by arturo toscanini 
its spot at 660 on the am dial a clearchannel signal that 
could be picked up in as many as 35 states at night is going to an 
allsports station 
wnbc was descended from the station that was the first to 
broadcast a world series the first to run a commercial the first 
with a coasttocoast hookup and the first to broadcast a national 
political convention 
at the end of the show everyone in the studio counted down from 
10 but the power was turned off before nbcs distinctive 
threegong chime could sound for the last time the switch was 
thrown at 530 pm 
the end of an era came as a result of the 6 billion deal in 
1985 in which general electric co bought rca corp the nbcs 
parent company 
a federal communications commission regulation prevents a new 
owner from keeping both a tv and radio station in the same market 
so ge decided to sell its new radio properties and keep the more 
profitable wnbctv 
the nbc radio network went to westwood one for 55 million and 
five stations including wnbc were sold to emmis broadcasting 
corp for 1215 million ge has one station left knbr in san 
francisco which is for sale 
emmis decided to ditch wnbcs call letters and format and move 
in its wfan a local allsports station that held the less 
desirable frequency of 1050 
the new station signed on from its studios in queens at 530 
pm with the words sports radio 66 wfan 
about 50 wnbc employees including its onair personalities 
have known since february they would be out of jobs but none 
jumped ship ahead of time said general manager peg kelly 
people sort of want to be here for the end she said no 
ones thrilled about it no one even likes it but its kind of a 
piece of history and people want to be here for it 
wnbc said goodbye with a 90minute retrospective program friday 
featuring clips from programs with benny hope allen and fibber 
mcgee and molly 
nbc also had such classic shows as amos n andy your hit 
parade and information please there were also the original 
soap operas like ma perkins and mary noble backstage wife 
the station then owned by atampt went on the air in april 1922 
as w2xy it became wbay in july that year and was changed to weaf 
the next month 
rca bought the station from atampt for 1 million in 1926 when it 
formed nbc to help sell the radios it was making but it didnt 
change the call letters to wnbc until 1946 
the first radio commercial was broadcast on weaf on aug 28 
1922 when a real estate developer paid 100 for a 10minute 
announcement to advertise apartments 
up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were 
still thinking of ways to make money with it said wnbc program 
director dale parsons one of those losing a job 
weafs other firsts included the first world series broadcast 
yankees vs giants in 1923 the first coasttocoast hookup in 
1924 and the first broadcast of the national political 
conventions in 1924 in 1925 it broadcast a presidential 
inaugural address calvin coolidges for the first time

president reagan came to dan quayles defense on 
friday portraying the embattled vice presidential candidate as a 
man who shares reagans conservative beliefs and should help carry 
on his policies 
in a series of speeches designed to win support for vice 
president george bush and his running mate among middleclass and 
bluecollar voters reagan mentioned quayle more than he usually 
does on campaign trips 
he praised quayles performance in his faceoff against the 
democratic vice presidential candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
one things even clearer to me after watching the debate 
wednesday night the bushquayle ticket will continue the policies 
of peace and prosperity that have as dan said made this great 
nation the envy of the world reagan told a cheering group of 
several hundred business leaders 
to a screaming flagwaving crowd of 10000 students and 
residents in nearby sterling heights earlier in the day reagan 
said with a grin americas economy is a grand prix racer and 
the way to keep it on track is to give george bush and dan quayle a 
checkered flag in their race in november 
late friday the president spoke at a 1000perplate gop 
fundraiser and attempted to counter the idea that quayles 
performance had cost votes 
the other night the washington establishment was betting 
against him reagan said but i tell you the smart money was 
riding on a great senator by the name of dan quayle he got my 
vote how about yours 
reagan then predicted that in november the american people 
will be investing in a new option for the american engine i call 
it the george bush turbocharger and when that happens all i can 
say is put the pedal to the metal and watch america go 
reagans references to quayle came amid an apparent republican 
damagecontrol effort to blunt criticism of quayles performance in 
the omaha neb debate instant polls conducted after the event 
showed the public by a wide margin believed bentsen had handily 
beaten quayle in the debate 
the president said the liberals are saying they want to help 
the american middle class and what theyre planning to do is 
to tax them and tax them and tax them some more if you ask me the 
liberals are selling the middle class short 
he said the nation had enjoyed economic good times during his 
eight years in office and suggested that the economic hardship the 
state endured as the auto industry suffered might return under a 
democratic administration 
and you may have heard that i kind of like what george bush 
said about this election when you have to change horses in 
midstream doesnt it make sense to switch to one whos going the 
same way he said 
after reagan ended his speech a man claiming he had been the 
subject of government mind control experiments disrupted the event 
making a long and rambling argument that he had been mistreated 
secret service agents apparently determining that he was not a 
physical threat to reagan made no attempt to approach the man who 
identified himself as william mcknight 58 he gave no address or 
hometown 
reagan angered by what he called an unfair disruption of 
the dinner guests finally shouted into the microphone that if the 
man had a complaint he should put it in a letter and send it to 
me 
reagans visit was a homecoming of sorts since it was in 
detroits joe louis arena in july 1980 that the former california 
governor accepted his partys nomination for the first time and 
chose bush to be his running mate 
reagan recalled the time as a magical moment and one of 
the proudest moments of my life 
most experts rate michigan a tossup though bush campaign 
adviser lee atwater said earlier this week that bush campaign 
figures showed the vice president ahead in the state by seven to 
eight points the state went to reagan 59 percent to 40 percent 
in 1984

an outboardmotor manufacturer has agreed to pay 
for a 20 million cleanup of toxic pcbs in lake michigans waukegan 
harbor ending years of bitter haggling over the superfund site 
officials announced friday 
under a consent decree signed by outboard marine corp and 
federal and state officials thousands of pounds of toxic 
polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed treated and safely 
stored state attorney general neil hartigan said 
this is a major environmental victory hartigan said noting 
that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the cleanup 
waukegan harbor an important great lakes port at waukegan 25 
miles north of chicago has been listed on the federal superfund 
list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered 
illinois worst pollution problem 
contamination of the harbor began in 1961 when hydraulic fluid 
containing pcbs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the companys 
waukegan plant into waste waters which were dumped into lake 
michigan and onto plant property 
public health officials have advised against eating fish from 
the harbor pcbs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory 
animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans 
we obviously believe that its time to get this matter 
resolved said company spokesman laurin baker in a telephone 
interview from outboard marines waukegan headquarters 
while saying it is hard to be happy over spending 20 million 
in company assets baker called the decree the best settlement 
possible 
the case became entangled in the legal system as company 
officials first argued pcbs posed no threat to humans then barred 
from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to 
determine the extent of the pollution said us environmental 
protection agency spokesman john perrecone 
after changes in the federal superfund law in 1986 allowed the 
epa such access the company agreed to negotiate with state and 
federal authorities perrecone said 
under terms of fridays consent decree outboard marine will 
begin cleaning up the pcbs next spring and should complete the task 
by 1992 the company will remove and treat contaminated material 
from both the harbor and its property 
the agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and 
soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate 
the remaining lowlevel soils and sediments in three areas baker 
said 
outboard marine is a 13 billion manufacturer of recreational 
marine products and other recreational materials

republican george bush accused democratic 
rival michael dukakis on friday of being soft on criminals while 
displaying an astounding lack of insensitivity a lack of human 
compassion for the victims of crime 
he assailed the prisonerfurlough program in massachusetts as a 
stupid law and charged that dukakis as governor had presided 
over a criminaljustice system completely out of whack and 
certainly out of touch with id say what are the grassroots 
values of the american people a twilight zone world where 
prisoners right of privacy has more weight than citizens right to 
safety 
bush said dukakis in his first year as governor vetoed a bill 
to repeal furloughs for firstdegree murderers moreover he said 
dukakis has never apologized to a maryland couple that was 
terrorized in 1987 by a massachusetts prisoner a convicted 
murderer who was released on a weekend leave 
lending weight to bushs attack the maryland man who was 
assaulted cliff barnes was in california on friday taping radio 
ads for bushs campaign 
with three dozen uniformed police officers on stage with him 
bush made his charge in a speech before a supportive audience of 
nearly 1000 people a large spillover crowd waited outside and 
cheered bush as he departed 
the attack was part of a determined strategy to win the support 
of undecided swing voters mostly bluecollar catholic 
democrats by accentuating issues such as crime the death 
penalty abortion and taxes while portraying dukakis as a liberal 
who is out of step with mainstream america bushs advisers believe 
the swing voters could tilt the balance in a close election 
campaigning in a key battleground state where 23 electoral votes 
are at stake bush spoke first in xenia and then flew to cleveland 
for a courthouse rally in nearby medina where he got a tumultuous 
welcome from a crowd of thousands 
bush didnt mention his running mate sen dan quayle in any of 
his three speeches but in answer to a question from a reporter 
expressed renewed confidence in quayle 
closing out a week of appearances bush spoke at a rally in 
lees summit mo and then went to kansas city mo where he 
received the endorsement of former fbi chief clarence kelley a 
fellow republican 
while saying he did not know dukakis kelley told reporters 
im tired of reading accounts of the inadequacies or derogatory 
statements made about george bush 
kelley said bush had served as chief of the cia while he was 
head of the fbi and that on many occasions he took a very firm 
stand regardless of what the consequences might be to him 
personally 
while sharpening his assault on dukakis bush defended himself 
against charges he is waging a negative campaign i dont believe 
it is negative to try to clarify honestly and hopefully fairly the 
distinctions with ones opponents that is the business of 
political campaigns 
in great detail bush recounted the story of willie horton a 
convicted murderer who went on a crime spree in maryland after he 
escaped during a weekend prison furlough from massachusetts bush 
has talked about horton before but never before in as much depth 
bush said horton a coldblooded killer broke into the home 
of a maryland couple cliff and angi barnes sadistically torturing 
the man raping and torturing his fiancee and repeatedly 
threatening to kill them both 
in boston dukakis spokesman leslie dach responded to bush he 
said michael dukakis is not going to play politics with the 
victims of crime he said it was a tragedy and the law has been 
changed 
bush said that when people tried to look into the furlough 
program the governors administration stonewalled citing and 
this is no joke the prisoners right to privacy 
moreover bush said about dukakis though he had met with the 
families of prisoners he now refused to meet the victims and their 
families 
families of crime victims collected more than 52000 signatures 
in a petition drive to put a repeal referendum on the ballot bush 
said that under the bright spotlight of the presidential 
campaign the governor finally relented and signed the repeal 
bush said in all this time as far as i know the governor 
has never acknowledged that his furlough program was a tragic 
mistake 
he said while the governor has shown great compassion for the 
difficulties of prisoners and their families and no doubt their 
hardships are severe when it comes to the plights of the victims 
and their families there is what one can only describe as an 
astounding lack of sensitivity a lack of human compassionbush 
said i hope im wrong about this but i dont think so in the 
year since it happened the governor of massachusetts has never 
aplogized to the barnes for their ordeal 
in medina bush said the federal government does not furlough 
murderers who have not served enough time to be eligible for a 
parole 
even so craig fuller bushs chief of staff said the vice 
president feels the federal furlough program should be reviewed 
for possible changes fuller said bush was satisfied it was 
fundamentally different than the former massachussetts program

a group of boston college students say 
oliver north isnt worth the 25000 the student government is 
paying him to speak at the school and stepped up a petition drive 
friday to get the invitation withdrawn 
the disgruntled students who gathered 550 signatures by friday 
afternoon say norths fee for the nov 2 appearance is too steep 
and the retired marine lieutenant colonel wont inspire discussion 
worth the price 
its a mistake that brings profound embarrassment to the 
entire boston college community said carter wilkie 22 a senior 
english major from wilmington del who helped organize the 
petition drive this whole episode shows that crime kind of does 
pay 
but david mcauley executive vice president of the student 
government board called north one of the most popular figures of 
the decade and said the 90minute lecture will attract a broad 
range of students 
overall this is a great opportunity to listen to a man 
responsible for one of the great shakeups in our governments 
history mcauley said 
north faces trial on 16 charges of conspiracy to defraud the 
government in the irancontra armsforhostages scheme he has 
given more than 25 speeches in the last year to raise money for his 
defense 
jean graham editorinchief of the heights an independent 
student weekly newspaper at the school said many students were 
dissatified about not being included in the decision 
the decision without the approval of anyone else other than 
the cabinet members is unfair she said 
she wrote an editorial against the choice of north 
the money for the lecture would come from a student activities 
fund for the schools 8500 undergraduates through a mandatory 41 
student assessment said douglas j whiting the colleges director 
of communications the money can be spent at the discretion of the 
student government board 
whiting said that in the past the fund had been used for 
several lectures but this year the board voted to spend most of 
it for norths appearance 
last year former sen gary hart of colorado and former us 
supreme court nominee robert bork lectured at at the school for a 
combined charge of less than 30000 whiting said

an underground coal fire discovered by 
children when sticks they poked into the ground caught fire has 
been extinguished by firefighters with water and synthetic foam 
into holes bored into the earth 
no houses in the southeast ohio city of 5000 people were 
damaged by the fire which had covered a 40by40foot area but it 
had threatened as many as 30 homes 
we were lucky to get to it in its infancy fire chief tim 
baden said friday 
the burning material waste coal believed to have come from an 
unmapped mine abandoned in the 1920s was 4 feet deep it was 
discovered sept 30 
on wednesday and thursday firefighters drilled holes about the 
size of fire extinguishers into the ground to determine the area of 
the fire baden said once isolated additional holes were dug 
throughout the area and water was poured into them 
that is a quenching effect the quenching essentially would 
take away the heat the chief said 
after another dousing of water firefighters capped the holes 
with a synthetic material which baden described as a type of 
firefighting foam used to fight oil fires by smothering them 
what that essentially does is knock out the oxygen that way 
we keep all the oxygen out of it baden said 
officials determined after additional core samples taken friday 
that the fire died out 
baden said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned 
indefinitely had it not been extinguished immediately

shoulders tapered waistline and long loose hemlines there is 
frequent use of rose and creamcolored shades 
pants out during the miniskirt craze but reinstated in march as 
the dominant winter look continued their popularity mainly they 
are ample and often cropped at the calf another favorite is the 
highwaisted sailor pant 
nautical themes pop up throughout the collections from the 
profuse use of navy blue and blue and white striping to sailorsuit 
collars on white blouses and jackets

parliament adopted a government report 
friday recommending continuation of a controversial dam project on 
the danube river following a heated eighthour debate broadcast 
live on hungarian television 
the vote to adopt was 317 for 19 against with 31 abstaining 
hungary is building the gabcikovonagymaros hydroelectric power 
plant and dam jointly with czechoslovakia with austria financing 
part of the hungarian side of the project in return for electric 
power 
the project has run into heavy opposition in hungary dozens of 
independent environmental interest groups and others are demanding 
construction be halted claiming it will cause irreparable 
ecological damage to wetland and wildlife along the danube and 
pollute large drinking water reserves 
environment minister laszlo marothy argued thursday that halting 
the project would put a burden of 140 million to 200 milliion a 
year on the economy until the mid1990s he said that would include 
investing in substitute energy sources restoring the landscape 
and compensation payments to austria and czechoslovakia 
officials estimated this year that the cost of completing the 
dam would be about 108 billion while stopping construction would 
cost about 11 billion environmentalists contend inflation will 
push costs to 26 billion 
janos szentagothai former president of the academy of sciences 
on friday told parliament the academy adopted a unanimous decision 
in 1983 proposing the government halt work on the project but this 
was never made public 
the deputies argued at length over conflicting motions one for 
a rollcall vote and the other for a vote behind closed doors 
istvan avar a prominent actor and member of parliament broke 
the deadlock finally by proposing that both groups withdraw their 
motions and that the vote be taken by standing up 
a rollcall vote is rare in communist hungarys legislature 
traditionally accustomed to giving rubberstamp approval to 
government decisions by a show of hands the public wrangle was 
another indication of the increasing openness in hungary

author tadeusz konwicki wants polands 
tallest building named in honor of soviet dictator josef stalin 
to be turned into a symbol to honor the victims of stalinism a 
newspaper reported friday 
the kurier polski said konwicki made the suggestion in an 
interview after the paper asked people how poland might best honor 
victims of stalinist repression 
i think the best symbolic mausoleum for the victims would be 
our warsaw palace of culture and science which in fact was built 
by stalin and his supporters konwicki was quoted as saying 
the weddingcake style building that towers above warsaw was a 
gift to communist poland from stalin completed in 1955 it is 
officially named the josef stalin palace of culture and science 
konwicki said a neon sign that partially obstructs the name of 
stalin etched into the facade of the 772foottall building should 
be taken down so stalins name can be seen clearly 
that would be a symbol of the whole matter konwicki said 
a konwicki novel a minor apocalypse published in 1979 
used the image of the building deteriorating to symbolize corrosion 
of the communist system 
other poles interviewed suggested erecting monuments to 
stalinist victims 
a history teacher said publishing a history book with no blank 
spots would be a fitting tribute

doubt his qualifications and think he lost the confrontation with 
the texas senator 
at one point friday quayle was asked to justify his postdebate 
assertions this week that michael dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee looks down on america 
he does look down on america hes got an idea that america 
somehow is not a growthoriented country quayle said the 
governor himself looks down and takes a very liberal viewpoint 
towards america and that is looking down on america 
quayle earlier said he was not concerned about the new dukakis 
ads one of which notes that bush had chosen quayle to replace him 
should tragedy occur and says hopefully we will never know how 
great a lapse of judgment that really was 
i havent seen them ive heard about them they obviously 
dont have anything bad to say about george bush and thats fine 
with me quayle told reporters as he toured a chattanooga tenn 
technical school 
when he was asked at the atlanta appearance to elaborate quayle 
said i think that is the new role that im going to take all 
the heat and the criticism

his decision to take on the role of lightning rod 
i assigned the role to myself im going to be taking all 
the heat and thats just fine well let george bush have a free 
ride he said 
quayle asserted that dukakis was pulling much of his 
organization out of the south because theyve lost the south 
dukakis campaign officials have denied any such pullout 
at etowah high school in woodstock quayle was greeted by 
students waving small us flags and cheering the school presented 
him with a ceramic quail 
he took questions from the students who wanted to know how he 
would safeguard womens rights social security and care for the 
elderly 
jan lee a spanish teacher said quayle was a real charismatic 
type of person however his comments all from his stump 
campaign speeches didnt satisfy everybody 
he avoided the questions all of them said carrie amerson 
17 another student kelly helms 15 also thought he went around 
the questions 
at the tour of the chattanooga technical school quayle helped 
demonstrate a computercontrolled robot paint sprayer the sprayer

antiabortion demonstrators besieging womens 
clinics here called in reinforcements to continue their week of 
protests saying fridays 53 arrests had nearly exhausted their 
pool of people willing to go to jail 
more than 400 people have been arrested since tuesday for trying 
to block clinics as part of a campaign by operation rescue the 
group that organized protests during the democratic national 
convention in july 
about 500 people attended operation rescues nightly rally 
friday night at a suburban atlanta church rally leaders said that 
in addition to the usual activity at abortion clinics a 
demonstration would be held saturday outside the city jail where 
the arrested protesters are being held 
operation rescue spokesman bob nolte predicted saturday could be 
the biggest day of the siege of atlanta 
those arrested friday had blocked two driveway entrances to the 
midtown clinic police appeared to treat them more gently than 
those arrested earlier this week 
on previous days police roughly dragged demonstrators who 
refused to walk to waiting vans and buses bound for jail they also 
dragged those arrested friday but more carefully with only the 
demonstrators feet touching the ground 
i believe the public would rather see us take more time and be 
more gentle said maj kenneth burnette 
during the arrests of one group burnette asked demonstrators 
leaning against a clinic gate in the early morning chill if they 
would walk to the buses like gentlemen and ladies few did 
the picketing followed what demonstrators called an end run 
by clinic operators the day before in which patients were whisked 
inside before demonstrators arrived 
midtown administrator ignatius deblasi said about 80 percent of 
the patients with appointments friday showed up the clinic usually 
handles 2530 women daily 
as one woman was escorted through protesters trying to block the 
back gate they said to her have mercy on your son or daughter 
after the arrests small groups held hands during bible readings 
or sang hymns on the sidewalk outside the clinic 
prochoice advocates who say the decision on abortion should be 
the mothers not the states have escorted patients to clinics 
but decided against counterdemonstrations to avoid making the 
situation more difficult they said 
some prochoice supporters were on hand at midtown one carrying 
a sign denouncing coathanger therapy a reference to 
oftenfatal backalley abortions that they say women would be 
forced into if abortion were outlawed 
its like this rail here said an abortion opponent to a 
prochoice advocate you are on one side or the other 
as of friday afternoon 38 of the 421 people arrested this week 
had been released on bail usually set at 650 
operation rescue officials complained that their sympathizers 
were being denied release on bail 
theres no truth to it at all said sgt willie cotton at 
the jail where many of the protesters are being held they may 
have requested bond but they havent finished the processing

three days of marathon contract negotiations 
ended friday night without a resolution to the 3monthold strike 
at the electric boat shipyard in groton conn a manufacturer of 
navy nuclear submarines 
labor and company negotiators met with federal mediators in 
washington for about 30 hours since wednesday but could not reach 
an accord to end the wage dispute friday was day 99 of the strike 
officials at the federal mediation and conciliation service said 
they would be in contact with both parties but no further 
negotiating sessions were set 
representatives from the subbuilding division of general 
dynamics corp said they reoffered their previous proposal a 
fouryear contract with bonuses and a onetime 3 percent wage 
increase 
the metal trades council an umbrella group representing all the 
striking unions had said it wanted a threeyear contract with 4 
percent raises in at least the second and third years 
in a prepared statement the company said it appears that 
this unnecessary and illegal strike will continue indefinitely as 
will the hiring of permanent replacements 
the bargaining sessions with the mediation service were the 
first major negotiations since another round of federally mediated 
talks broke off in august without an agreement 
hopes were high that the strike would be settled this week as 
pressure mounted on the union 
more than 1500 of the original 10000 striking workers have 
crossed picket lines and returned to work 
and a key union the boilermakers international told the metal 
trades council that it wanted the strike settled immediately 
fearing the job action may be declared illegal electric boat could 
fire striking workers if the strike is found to be illegal 
a national labor relations board official has questioned the 
strikes legality because it did not receive a strike notification 
30 days in advance from the metal trades council as required by 
law the union sent the notification to the wrong address 
mtc officials have said they believe the strike is legal because 
they notified federal officials orally of the strike plan 
electric boat is the navys sole producer of the giant trident 
nuclear submarines and competes annually with the newport news 
va shipbuilding amp drydock co for contracts to build the 
smaller ssn688 fast attack subs 
the company said it needs to hold down labor costs to remain 
competitive for navy submarine contracts 
electric boat one of new englands largest employers normally 
has 18000 workers at the groton plant and another 6000 at its 
north kingstown ri facility the rhode island workers did not 
strike

floridas supreme court for only the 
second time in its history publicly reprimanded a judge friday 
rebuking him for 14 judicial indiscretions that included waving a 
gun from the bench 
circuit judge wallace e sturgis jr of marion county was 
summoned before the court and accused by chief justice raymond 
ehrlich of sullying his reputation and his family name 
this is probably one of the most distateful chores that i have 
had to perform ehrlich told sturgis and a courtroom audience of 
about 50 people 
the judicial qualifications commission found sturgis guilty of 
the 14 counts of misconduct 
the commission said that besides waving a handgun twice in 
hearings sturgis failed for 19 years to keep adequate records of a 
20000 estate he managed for a blind and incompetent family friend 
it said he should have transferred the account when he became a 
judge in 1973 
sturgis whose father wallace edwin sturgis was senate 
president in 195153 and an appeals judge listened with downcast 
eyes to the reprimand 
for more than 15 years you in the exercise of your judicial 
duties have stood in judgment of others today you are the one 
being judged said ehrlich adding that it was a lack of 
corrupt motives and the absence of moral turpitude that kept the 
commission from recommending sturgis removal 
sturgis said nothing to the court and left without comment 
in earlier hearings an attorney for sturgis said he pulled the 
gun because of a startle reflex he said the judge had been the 
victim of an attack and was nervous about courthouse security 
the last judge ordered to appear before the court for reprimand 
was circuit judge jack block of miami who was rebuked two years 
ago for violating legal ethics before he joined the bench said sid 
white clerk of the court 
usually the court issues reprimands in writing

actress robin givens filed for divorce friday 
from heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson after a turbulent 
eightmonth marriage she called a continuous horror story of 
destruction drinking and domestic violence 
in filing for the divorce the actress also won a court order to 
keep him away from her and the burbank studios set where her abc 
series head of the class is taped 
the divorce petition filed in superior court cited 
irreconcilable differences as miss givens reason to end the 
marriage to tyson 22 whose wealth is estimated at 40 million 
in an attached declaration miss givens 23 recounts an alleged 
attack last sunday in the couples mansion in bernardsville nj 
i was awakened by michaels hitting about my body and my head 
with his closed fist and open hand 
michael appeared by his actions and by his breath to be 
intoxicated and i discovered that he had been drinking champagne 
early in the morning the declaration continued i was 
frightened for my life and terrorized 
tyson retained highpowered local attorney howard weitzman for 
the divorce battle weitzman successfully defended automaker john 
delorean against cocaine trafficking charges 
i think michael is disappointed given the circumstances that 
the relationship has resolved itself in the manner it has in a 
sense he is relieved that he could put his life back in order and 
could go on with his life weitzman said 
he declined comment on the divorce action until he and tyson see 
it 
i think there has been a lot of press about mike and his 
relationship with robin i think mike would just like to go back to 
being the champion of the world weitzman said 
miss givens who is in town working on the tv series didnt 
appear at a courthouse news conference at which marvin michelson 
the celebrity divorce lawyer announced the divorce action 
mitchelson who filed the petition for miss givens said 
superior court judge hugh e macbeth jr issued a restraining order 
barring the fighter from approaching the actress 
other orders require him to move from miss givens hollywood 
hills home without removing any possessions and to to stay at 
least 1000 feet from the actress her home and her work place 
mitchelson said he wasnt ready to say how much of tysons 
fortune the actress would seek californias community property law 
entitles a spouse to 50 percent of a couples earnings during their 
marriage

continuous horror story for me michael has repeatedly hit me 
threw things at me threatened to kill me and also threatened to 
kill her mother her sister stephanie givens and an employee

despite the alleged violence which the actress has previously 
described in a televised interview 
she loves mike tyson she tried to protect mike tyson and 
nurture him she wishes him every good thing in life mitchelson 
said but theres continued violence and she fears for her 
safety

lawyer in a landmark palimony decision against the late actor 
lee marvin 
in an interview with barbara walters on abcs 2020 a week 
ago miss givens said her husband has an extremely volatile 
temper and that life with him was torture pure hell she 
said shes become very afraid of him but gave no indication she 
wanted to end the marriage 
tyson the youngest heavyweight champion ever told miss walters 
that he loves his wife and would not stand in her way if she chose 
to leave 
my wife would just have to ask for it and she has every penny 
i have said tyson 
miss givens told miss walters that tyson is a manicdepressive 
but a doctor who examined the heavyweight champ said this week he 
is not 
friends of tyson have accused miss givens and her mother ruth 
roper of manipulating tyson in order to gain control of his 40 
million fortune 
days after the interview police went to the couples new jersey 
mansion to try to calm tyson at the request of miss givens and her 
mother because the champ reportedly had flown into a rage and 
hurled furniture through the windows 
it was another incident in a stormy year for tyson 
he gave away a 100000 automobile after a minor accident 
cracked a bone in his hand in a latenight fight on a harlem street 
and was reported to have threatened suicide before slamming his car 
into a tree last month in new york

and chased miss givens and her mother in a moscow hotel when the 
actress was there filming an episode of the series last month 
the couple was married feb 7 in chicago after the national 
basketball association allstar game which tyson attended but 
because the couple did not have an illinois license they were 
remarried two days later in new york

a woman whose brothers killer escaped from 
massachusetts prison furlough program and attacked a couple in 
maryland took her criticism of massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
to california on friday in a trip financed by george bush 
supporters 
i think its at a point in this country where the prisoners 
rights have superseded and taken over said donna fournier cuomo 
of lawrence mass whose 17yearold brother joey fournier was 
murdered in 1974 by willie horton 
the victims are not heard she added saying gov 
dukakis i dont feel would address this issue 
mrs cuomo endorsed republican vice president bush for the 
presidency but the maryland man who was attacked by horton after 
his escape refused to endorse anyone at the news conference 
this isnt political to my wife and i said cliff barnes a 
former resident of oxon hill md explaining his nonpartisan 
position 
both barnes and mrs cuomo said their expenses for their trip to 
los angeles and sacramento on friday and to texas next week were 
being paid by the committee for the presidency a group formed to 
support bushs candidacy 
but barnes said he wanted to address only the massachusetts 
furlough program saying its not a successful program 
horton had been serving a life sentence without parole in 
massachusetts for fourniers murder when he walked away from his 
10th release on weekend furlough 
he broke into the barnes home in april 1987 cliff barnes was 
slashed 22 times and then tied up by horton his thenfiancee and 
now wife angi was beaten and raped twice 
the democrats response to republican attacks on the program 
have consisted of a bunch of misleading statistics that hide the 
faces and the lives of the real victims said barnes 
i will never understand it mrs cuomo said of a program 
allowing the weekend furlough of a firstdegree murderer to me 
it does not make sense 
barnes and mrs cuomo also said that as governor dukakis has 
refused to meet with them about crimes committed by massachusetts 
convicts while on weekend furloughs or workrelease programs 
they also asserted that dukakis resisted efforts to prohibit 
firstdegree murderers from participating in the state furlough 
program 
in april dukakis signed legislation to enact just such a change 
in the massachusetts program 
when bush began pressing the furlough issue the dukakis 
campaign fired back with statistics showing that the furlough 
escape rate in massachusetts has been below the national average 
dukakis officials also contend that more than 40 states have 
furlough programs for convicted felons and at least 23 states make 
firstdegree murderers eligible for furloughs 
the democrats also invoked the record of ronald reagan who 
supported the furlough program in california even after two 
convicts killed people while on furlough in late 1971 and early 
1972 
at the time of the murders in california former los angeles 
police chief ed davis now a republican state senator complained 
to thengov reagan that about 40 percent of our serious and 
violent offenders are on active parole from your department of 
corrections 
both reagan and dukakis inherited their respective state 
furlough programs and both defended the programs from political 
attacks that arose following crimes committed by convicts on 
furlough

president george vassiliou of cyprus on 
thursday called for demilitarization of his mediterranean island 
nation where a un peacekeeping force separates the hostile 
turkish and greek cypriot communities 
we propose to dismantle the military forces of the republic 
of cyprus if all turkish troops and settlers withdraw and if the 
armed elements they have fostered are disbanded vassiliou told 
delegates to the 43rd general assembly 
in 1974 greeces military junta sponsored a coup on cyprus that 
failed turkey invaded to protect the turkish cypriot minority and 
still occupies about 40 percent of the northern part of cyprus 
the northern part of cyprus declared itself to be the turkish 
republic of northern cyprus in 1975 a breakaway state recognized 
only by turkey about 200000 greek cypriots fled the northern 
section during the invasion and tens of thousands of turks have 
since come to cyprus to settle there 
we undertake to use the funds which will be saved through 
demilitarization for the development of areas of cyprus which have 
fallen behind economically and primarily for projects which will 
benefit mainly the turkish cypriots vassiliou proposed 
part of the savings could also be used for financing the 
international peace force to be established he added the 
current 2300member un peacekeeping force in cyprus is funded by 
voluntary contributions of un members 
vassiliou first suggested this plan in june at the general 
assemblys special session on disarmament 
he said the solution of the cyprus problem is defined in un 
resolutions that call for all foreign troops and settlers to leave 
the island that call for respect for human rights and that say no 
other nation has a right to intervene in cypriot internal affairs 
we believe that in the future federal republic of cyprus that 
we envision all cypriots whether greek or turkish should enjoy 
equality of opportunity and fundamental freedoms including the 
right to develop their distinctive cultural heritages he said 
vassiliou has met with rauf denktash president of the breakaway 
turkish republic on northen cyprus to discuss reunification of the 
island the talks were held at the invitation of secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
the target is to achieve a just and lasting solution of the 
cyprus problem by june 1989 vassiliou said 
in his speech to the general asssembly vassiliou also called 
for worldwide military cutbacks with the major lending nations 
using the savings to establish national funds to buy at the present 
discounted market rates the outstanding loans owed to their 
commercial banks by developing nations 
the cost of these national debt relief programs would be 
minimal if they are coupled with an imaginative use of tax 
credits he said

the environment minister said thursday 
that government failure to consult the public about a planned dam 
project generated opposition to the project but he still backed 
construction of the dam 
we can now see clearly that the absence of openness has 
done a lot of damage laszlo marothy said in parliament of a 
government report on the dam and hydroelectric power plant 
communist hungary and czechoslovakia are building on the danube 
leaving out of consideration indications of public opinion has 
produced mistrust and in fact raised antipathy 
dozens of parliamentarians have asked to speak on the report and 
several are likely to vote against it however government 
officials and parliamentarians say it will probably be adopted 
friday 
the joint gabcikovonagymaros project has met considerable 
opposition in hungary and dozens of independent environmental and 
other interest groups have publicly called for a halt in 
construction 
the groups claim it will cause irreparable ecological damage to 
wetland and wildlife along the danube and pollute large drinking 
water reserves 
marothy however told parliament the barrage system must be 
built in keeping with the original concept 
the government must take responsibility for society as a 
whole even if the price of this is that it must act against the 
opinions of some groups marothy said 
marothy argued the issue has become largely symbolic in hungary 
for other social problems 
what has become superimposed on these disputes is the sum of 
tensions social problems and contradictions emerging 
including claims for remedying grievances that have nothing to do 
with the dam he said 
on sept 12 about 20000 people gathered in front of parliament 
to protest the project calling for democracy a multiparty system 
and a referendum 
marothy rejected the conclusions of an ad hoc committee of the 
academy of sciences which presented its findings to the government 
oct 1 charging they were inaccurate 
the academy report as quoted by marothy said stopping or 
delaying construction posed a realistic alternative and 
postponing work could reduce economic burdens and entail fewer 
environmental risks 
he said a total cost to hungary of finishing the project would 
amount to about 700 million net revenue from the project by the 
year 2015 would amount to the same marothy said 
austria is financing part of the hungarian side of the project 
in return for electric power 
in another development hungarys foreign minister said at the 
united nations on thursday that romania its warsaw pact ally is 
guilty of human rights violations but said moscow was not taking 
sides in the hungarianromanian dispute 
the conflict revolves around romanias ethnic hungarian 
minority which hungary says is being systematically mistreated in 
a resettlement program 
foreign minister peter varkonyi avoided naming romania in a 
speech tuesday to the general assembly limiting himself to 
decrying cultural oppression of minorities in neighboring 
countries 
but in an interview thursday he said it is clear that our 
problem in this regard is with romania

physician in charge of the project at the childrens nutrition

14 to 16 months according to the report in the journal of the 
american medical association although aids is not exploding 
into the heterosexual population relative to other risk groups the 
increase in the number of heterosexual cases is proportional to 
increases in other risk groups the report said

the mind an ambitious and emotionally 
charged pbs series starting wednesday is in many ways the ultimate 
behindthescenes television program 
aided by computers and xray scanners the ninepart series goes 
inside the brain to see the formation of thoughts and feelings that 
surge behind human acts whether mundane or deeply disturbing 
the shows popularize theories that have emerged in the brain and 
mind sciences in two decades when the cost of direct treatment of 
severe mental illness is estimated to have reached 25 billion a 
year 
the most eloquent moments come in vivid interviews with people 
who try to explain sometimes in tears anger or bewilderment 
what was happening in their mind when mental disease devasted their 
lives and families 
these case studies go a long way toward helping the series 
achieve one of its goals to erase the stigma of mental illness 
lurking in the back of the mind are controversial questions 
which the series implies but does not answer should brain and mind 
be probed chemically or by computer to find out how people will 
act when and how much should chemicals cells or genes in humans 
be altered to change the functions of the mind and who should make 
those decisions 
but the shows six years in the making at the cost of 8 
million do not shirk controversy 
the series starts with a controversial statement the mind is 
what the brain does a lot of people dont necessarily think that 
even today there are still dualists who think that the mind and the 
brain may be separate said richard hutton who created the 
series and is executive editor 
in our aging show im very optimistic about the newest work 
that indicates that aging is less of a deterioration than was 
thought i think there is controversy also in our addiction show 
which really debunks the notion just say no and in our pain and 
healing show which i think is a responsible report on where we 
stand in looking at how the mind heals the body hutton said in 
an interview 
other onehour segments examine consciousness development 
depression language and thought 90 minutes is devoted to the 
violent mind each has interviews with about a dozen specialists 
mostly from medical schools in the united states and abroad the 
program follows the 1984 series the brain and has an advisory 
board of 10 experts 
one of the more dramatic behindthescenes techniques 
displays how groups of brain cells are activated while a volunteer 
with a mild radioactive injection is strapped in a scanner and 
speaks or reads such experiments help researchers understand 
language development and offer hope for the treatment of complex 
mental diseases 
the shows use computergenerated visual effects to detail 
mechanisms behind the spark of an idea or the shift of a mood 
pacmanlike graphics which trace chemical paths that transmit pain 
or pleasure also illustrate theories on how the mind can be 
derailed by drugs chemicals in the workplace stress or illness 
the series also asks why one person becomes a genius musician 
another a psychopathic murderer are states of mind influenced more 
by environment biochemicals or genes is the brain hardwired 
to sway moods or patterns of thought 
narrator george page exuding rational optimism points to some 
answers that hint at possible profound changes in the treatment of 
mental disease and the handling of criminals some changes he 
cautions may be decades away 
while the mind is encyclopedic it has shortcomings chief 
among these is its avoidance of some darker implications of 
research mind control brainwashing or mass media manipulation 
and although one show has an interview with a survivor of a soviet 
prison camp the series does not examine abuses of psychiatric 
treatment on political dissidents 
we didnt go into brainwashing its something im kind of 
interested in and it didnt happen hutton said we thought 
about it a lot we decided for a lot of reasons not to do it but 
we certainly considered that notion 
the tv version also suffers from some historical 
absentmindedness 
theres a brief clip of hitler and cheering masses but the only 
identification of one of historys most brutal madmen is in a 
caption in the companion book by richard m restak 
hiroshima comes up in radiation studies on fetal brain cells 
but the only explanation that it was the us bombing that hastened 
the end of world war ii is in the series educational supplement 
produced with funding from control data corp and distributed to 
7000 high schools

producer nicolas noxon acknowledges that 
telling the story of 100 years of the national geographic society 
presented a few sticky problems 
first of all how do you get a century of exploration around the 
world and in recent years out of this world into a 90minute 
documentary 
we adopted a pretty pragmatic attitude said noxon whose 
production of the explorers a century of discovery is his 
latest for national geographic the formula i worked out was that 
we would put in film on all the important things from the past 100 
years and leave everything else out 
once i resigned myself to the coffeetable concept once we 
got comfortable with that it worked out pretty well if we applied 
too rigid a test wed leave out things we wanted in we came up 
with the explorers for the title if we strayed too far from that 
we werent true to the theme 
noxon also faced the problem of keeping it from becoming just a 
cutandpaste job 
one of our dilemmas was that after all the musts we didnt 
have much time for electives he said certain things just had 
to go in we wanted to add some new film but it was very 
limiting 
new film for the 100th anniversary documentary includes a 
sequence on mapping the sky at mount palomar and a look at the nova 
scotia home of geographic founder alexander graham bell 
appropriately the explorers will be telecast on columbus 
day wednesday on pbs 
the show is largely told with archival photographs and film 
much of it never before seen on television associate editor terry 
koenig an emmy winner for secrets of the titanic worked 
closely with noxon in putting the film together among the 
highlights 
conquest of the north pole by robert peary and richard byrds 
flight over the south pole 
exploration of alaskas valley of 10000 smokes in 1917 the 
first geographic expedition to be documented in motion pictures 
william beebes descent a halfmile into the ocean depths in a 
bathysphere 
harrowing exploration of the stratosphere in a hydrogenfilled 
balloon by army air corps officers in 1934 and 
a 1931 french motor expedition from beirut to peking including 
an attempt to drive across the himalayas 
i came here in 1960 after doing some educational and 
institutional films in washington noxon said i went to work 
for david wolper in 1965 when he was doing documentaries i 
fancied myself a documentarian and wolper was like a rocket then 
i started doing the geographic specials with wolper the first one 
i did was voyage of the brigantine yankee the next one i did was 
dr leakey and the dawn of man 
noxon left wolper after six years but then returned to do more 
geographic specials in later years he produced the specials for 
wqedtv in pittsburgh noxon recently joined abckane productions 
founded by dennis kane former head of television for the national 
geographic society in association with abc 
he has made documentaries on wildlife early hollywood diving 
for spanish treasure transatlantic liners and many other subjects 
its amazing what televisions been willing to deal with he 
said those of us in the west have rarely succeeded in placing 
newsoriented shows with the networks we were able to get in with 
the wildlife shows in 1966 i was able to talk about ecology 
which was certainly an unknown word then in a show about the 
grizzly bear we were able to offer the hard idea that the 
grizzlies were disappearing and were worth saving 
i got thrown out of kenya for a show on the vanishing 
elephant that was another unpopular idea elephants eat the same 
food as people and people kill the elephants what can we do i 
dont think weve answered that yet 
but i think by protecting their monopoly on documentaries the 
networks have missed a lot dennis company is the first 
semiautonomous documentary production group started by a network in 
many years

whenever homeowners feel frustrated by tales of 
huge profits in the stock market they should remind themselves that 
they have the best investment of all 
securities prices collapse every now and then but housing 
prices generally hold their own you store stocks in a safedeposit 
box but you can live in a house you pay big taxes on securities 
gains on houses you can defer them 
the advantages dont end there you may pay for your house in 
easy monthly installments but payments for stocks are up front 
you can fix up your house and increase the value but you have 
little say in a corporate investment 
but perhaps the greatest security of a housing investment 
after providing shelter for a family is the stability of the 
investment year in and year out houses generally appreciate even 
when you think theyre not 
in 1981 the median sale price of existing singlefamily homes 
measured by the national association of realtors was 66400 in 
1987 the figure was 85400 and through august of this year it 
had risen to 91300 
national figures can hide regional discrepancies of course but 
all four sections of the country participated in the the 
housingprice advance 
from 1981 through august prices in the northeast jumped from 
63700 to 144800 in spite of a manufacturing recession and 
various farm problems they rose in the midwest from 54300 to 
70500 in the south from 64400 to 84300 and in the west 
from 96200 to 122000 
in no year since 1981 has the median price failed to gain in the 
midwest and south the price did fall in the northeast from 1981 to 
1982 but by only 200 in the west it declined in both 1982 and 
1985 but quickly recovered 
such stability is unknown in most other markets true the stock 
market may have risen at a sharper rate but the comparison isnt 
entirely valid you can have 50 percent margin in stocks but in 
housing you might have 90 percent 
in effect a homeowner who puts up 10 percent of a homes price 
the rest coming from the bank participates in any price 
increase as if he or she owned 100 percent it is a degree of 
leverage almost unknown in securities 
leverage and compounding produce financial miracles an owner 
who makes a 10000 downpayment on a 100000 house earns 50 
percent if that house rises 5 percent to 105000 in one year 
as with the purchase of anything there may be drawbacks in 
owning a house generally housing is less liquid than stocks 
while prices might not collapse markets become inactive every few 
years selling means legal expenses too 
but if you do sell and buy a more expensive dwelling you 
generally can defer capital gains taxes your entire housing equity 
can be protected from any taxes so long as the more recently 
acquired house remains your property 
if you attempt to do that with your stock profits youll invite 
the internal revenue service into your affairs when you sell 
stocks you pay taxes on the profits even if you reinvest in other 
stocks there is no deferment 
whenever you have the feeling that your pals are making a 
killing in the securities markets therefore you should sit back 
and count your blessings 
and dwell on the very real probability that their latest winning 
effort in the market didnt even offset their losses

if all goes as expected the nations stock 
markets will soon embark on an experiment they hope never gets put 
to the test 
the plan now awaiting approval by the securities and exchange 
commission calls for circuit breakers that would halt all 
trading for set periods of time if stock prices fall by specified 
amounts on any given day 
for example the new york stock exchange would stop trading for 
one hour if the dow jones industrial average dropped 250 points 
after that if the dow fell 150 points more in the same session 
trading would be halted for two hours 
the system developed by the nyse and the chicago mercantile 
exchange would also provide that the prices of stock index futures 
traded on the merc would be effectively frozen for 30 minutes if 
they declined by an amount roughly equivalent to 100 dow points 
the proposal was made contingent on adoption by all domestic 
markets nyse officials have said the plan might hit a snag 
because of opposition from the national association of securities 
dealers which operates the overthecounter market 
the nasd does indeed regard the plan as a bad solution to 
the issues raised by the market crash last october joseph 
hardiman the organizations president said in an interview 
but he indicated his group would go along with whatever the sec 
decides and said he would be surprised if the commission did not 
approve the circuitbreaker plan in some form soon 
the circuit breakers along with a series of other measures 
proposed by the nyse and the merc are designed to supersede the 
collar adopted by the big board early this year 
the collar closed the exchanges main computer trading 
facilities to orders from professionals engaged in multiple 
transactions known as index arbitrage whenever the dow rose or fell 
50 points in a day 
other trading including manual index arbitrage was not 
affected by the collar 
in its brief existence the collar has drawn mixed reviews and 
the circuit breaker system has attracted divergent comments as well 
to its proponents it provides a system for everyone involved in 
the trading process to stop and evaluate the situation if a selling 
panic hits 
also they say it helps answer the call from the presidential 
commission headed by nicholas brady now secretary of the treasury 
for a recognition that activity in stocks and stockindex options 
and futures be recognized as one market 
of course the hope is that the system will help restore 
investor confidence to the extent that the circuit breakers never 
actually have to be activated 
on the other side of the debate hardiman says circuit 
breakers are likely to increase market volatility rather than curb 
it the closer a market gets to a circuit breaker level the more 
likely it is to reach it as sellers rush to execute orders under 
the wire 
a similar contention that the limit would tend to become a 
magnet was made when the collar was adopted experience with the 
collar has neither proved nor refuted that point 
hardiman also cites academic studies that show markets as most 
volatile when a security is opening or reopening after a trading 
halt 
industry organizations should be striving to keep the markets 
open he maintains 
if the circuit breakers as proposed by the big board had been in 
effect for 50 years they never would have been activated until 
last fall 
so the statistical chances are not great that the system will be 
tested during the oneyear pilot program the exchange is 
calling for 
presumably the plans workability would be demonstrated by a 
healthier performance by stock prices and increases in measures of 
investor confidence such as priceearnings ratios 
but some wall streeters do not buy that idea the proposed 
circuit breakers are no protection at all says raymond f devoe 
jr an analyst at legg mason wood walker inc 
stopping trading for an hour when the dow industrials are down 
250 points means youve done nothing until the markets plunged 12 
percent thanks a lot

for the past few months the ohio lottery has 
been flashing an ad on the scoreboard of cleveland stadium 
reminding fans that a 3 million lottery jackpot isnt chicken 
feed or chopped liver 
during an era when jackpots around the country are regularly 
topping 20 million the stadium ad is part of a campaign to stir 
up interest in super lotto prizes that a decade ago would have 
made newspaper front pages 
we are looking for an expanded base of players said anne 
bloomberg ohio lottery spokeswoman we want the players to 
understand that 3 million is a lot of money while the giant 
jackpots get a lot of focus 150000 annual earnings for 20 years 
in a 3 million prize is a lot of money 
the explosion in the size of lottery jackpots may hinder play 
around the country on games with relatively smaller prizes by 
dampening enthusiasm about winning a few million dollars said paul 
dworin publisher of gaming and wagering business magazine in new 
york 
florida awards a 55 million jackpot and a lot of people are 
not going to get excited by lower numbers dworin said why 
play when its 10 million if it could be 50 million 
floridas 55 million prize awarded after a sept 3 drawing is 
the nations largest lottery jackpot to date six of the 10 largest 
jackpots have been awarded this year records show 
many state lotteries say it takes a bigger jackpot today to 
trigger lotto mania described as the point when sales increase 
dramatically and the news media become interested in a prize in 
most lotto contests participants try to guess a series of 
numbers to be drawn and the prize grows if nobody gets the correct 
match 
in illinois the attitude of players has changed since the state 
started its lottery in 1974 and introduced a highpayoff lotto game 
in 1983 said kathy rem lottery communication director 
after a lottery has been around a number of years people get 
used to it our players have gotten more sophisticated ms rem 
said 
asked when lotto mania begins she added if you wanted a 
number id say 20 million 
new york recently changed its lottery advertising strategy to 
attract upscale casual players said russell gladieux acting 
director of the new york state lottery 
weve completely restructured our advertising to get the 
person who wouldnt play for 4 million but would play for 20 
million gladieux said weve begun featuring welldressed 
welleducated real people who share their dream of winning on 
television 
new hampshire vermont and maine operate a tristate lotto but 
with a combined population of less than 3 million and a top jackpot 
of 96 million the contest may never generate lotto mania 
said rick wisler games manager for the new hampshire sweepstakes 
commission 
blaine lewis jr president of the north american association of 
state and provincial lotteries said newspaper coverage illustrates 
how interest has waned in jackpots of a few million dollars 
in 1983 with a 14 million winner in connecticut we got a 
front page story in the hartford courant said lewis who tracks 
lotteries in 28 states the district of columbia puerto rico the 
virgin islands and five canadian provinces he said the same 
lottery story in 1988 probably wouldnt make the front section of 
the newspaper 
people and the press are getting jaded but most people still 
realize a million dollars is a lot of money he said 
dworin said one way to increase ticket sales and jackpots is for 
lotteries to increase the odds of winning 
if you increase the choice of numbers the odds are much 
longer and therefore even if more people play theres a higher 
chance of rollover and a higher chance of larger jackpots dworin 
said 
in ohio where buyers select six numbers from a pool of 44 the 
odds are one in 7 million and the largest prize to date has been 
32 million ms bloomberg said there are several points when sales 
increase 
ten million dollars is the first breaking point where some 
casual players come in said ms bloomberg at 13 million to 
15 million about 80 percent come in 
she said once the jackpot exceeds 15 billion just about 
everyone in the state starts to play except lottery officials who 
cant by law 
when we get the big jackpots the attention heightens 
visibility which heightens sales which heightens the jackpot and 
it just keeps going she said

during 11 years as vice president to jomo 
kenyatta daniel arap moi says his job was to sing the tune of 
kenyas first president 
a decade after kenyattas death and mois emergence from an 
understudy to the mzee old man to the starring role in kenyan 
politics the schoolteacherturnedpresident has taught all 
wouldbe challengers to dance to his drums 
through shrewd political maneuvering the churchgoing 
teetotaling moi a member of the minority kalengin tribe has 
amassed power that rivals even the lionized kenyattas 
kenya is by law a oneparty state and moi is boss of the ruling 
kenyan african national union a body he says is supreme to the 
government 
parliament is essentially a rubber stamp to the presidents 
wishes and recent constitutional changes have brought the 
judiciary more under the executives control 
kenyatta too ran kenya with a tight rein and tolerated no 
dissent so pervasive was his rule that many doomsayers predicted 
kenya would be torn apart by tribal warfare after the death of 
kenyatta who was a member of the predominant kikuyu tribe 
but when the mzee died on aug 22 1978 moi the third and 
longestserving of kenyattas vice presidents peacefully succeeded 
him within 90 days as specified by the constitution moi called a 
presidential election he won it unopposed and was sworn in as 
kenyas second president oct 14 1978 the date he observes as the 
beginning of his presidency 
in the following months government officials released details 
of what they said had been a plot during kenyattas waning days to 
kill moi rather than allow the presidency to fall into the hands of 
a nonkikuyu 
though there were no arrests officials privately linked the 
plot to unidentified kenyatta aides and relatives who months before 
had tried unsuccessfully to thwart the constitutional transfer of 
power to moi 
moi retained many of kenyattas political allies although some 
were his political enemies it was only in september that he 
succeeded in ridding the party of the last vestiges of kenyattas 
power clique 
in a week of party elections beginning with grassroots 
balloting and ending with selection of national officers moi 
retained the party presidency kenyas supreme political job but 
the eight officers under him changed cementing mois power base 
during his 15 years of rule after independence from britain 
kenyatta would wave a flywisk his symbol of office and lead 
cheering crowds in kiswahili chants of harambee lets pull 
together 
moi saying he and the nation would be guided by the course 
kenyatta had charted adopted as his symbol of office and poer a 
gold and ivory baton and proclaimed a new slogan nayo 
footstep 
in his first days in office moi emptied the jails of political 
detainees but began his own detentions after junior officers of 
the air force unsuccessfully tried to overthrow him on aug 1 1982 
five people are now detained under a security law that allows 
the government to jail people indefinitely without trial about 100 
other people including journalists lawyers academics and civil 
servants have been jailed in the past 30 months after confessing 
links with several groups accused of plotting to overthrow moi 
the campaign against purported dissidents brought unaccustomed 
criticism of moi and kenya from human rights groups and others who 
charged confessions were coerced and that civil liberties were 
being trampled 
president moi has presided over a steady deteroriation of the 
rule of law rose styron chairwoman of the judges panel of the 
robert f kennedy human rights award said in september when 
announcing that the kenyan lawyer and former political detainee 
gibson kamau kuria was the 1988 winner 
kenya today is a land where only the animals are truly free 
she said 
moi is popular with kenyas masses and enjoys the reputaton with 
western governments as a moderate he has cordial ties with most of 
his african peers but is cool to military rulers 
he has made kenya the wests best friend in africa western 
governments in turn hold kenya up to other african nations as an 
example citing its robust capitalist economy and cooperation among 
the races 
mois kenya remains a mecca for tourists its able to feed 
itself a rarity in africa and is one of the few countries in the 
region not troubled with civil war 
kenyas economy is one of africas success stories but has 
started to stagger under the burden of the worlds fastestgrowning 
population a nearly 4 percent pace that is expected to double the 
22 million population by the beginning of the century 
the population includes 300000 nonblacks most of them 
asians the collective name for people from the indian 
subcontinent there are about 60000 europeans the name 
africans assign to all whites 
on the eve of kenyas independence in 1963 and despite his armed 
maumau revolt in 195256 against british rule kenyatta appealed 
to whites and other nonafricans to stay put and to help build 
blackled kenya most did and many continue to prosper under moi 
minorities especially the asians still control a 
disproportionate amount of kenyas economy from groceries and 
clothing stores to major factories 
but whites have no political clout 
philip leakey son of anthropologists louis and mary leakey is 
the only nonblack member of parliament and serves as an assistant 
minister of tourism and wildlife his brother richard is director 
of kenyas museums 
moi 64 years old and divorced is a private person he does not 
give interviews most of his comments are gleaned from his frequent 
appearances at public rallies where he staunchly defends kenya and 
his government 
we are a sovereign state and can stand on our feet he said 
recently in at attack on foreign critics we are not under 
anyones feet 
the kenyan press one of the most sophisticated in africa is 
assailed by a chorus of protests often led by moi when it 
publishes stories that are not to the governments liking a 
churchrun magazine beyond was banned earlier this year after 
publishing an article alleging fraud during primary elections 
nowadays clergymen and the law society of kenya are the only 
public critics of government and even their protests are presented 
so as not to offend or even mention the head of state 
we are conscious of a certain inadequacy of dialogue in the 
country the roman catholic bishops of kenya said in a letter to 
moi in november 1986 
at present discussion is precluded by allegation of powerful 
party officials that any questioning of the system is tantamout to 
disloyalty the bishops added already the party is assuming a 
totalitarian role

watching the new movie imagine john 
lennon was very painful for the late beatles wife yoko ono 
the only reason why i did watch it to the end is because im 
responsible for it even though somebody else made it she said 
cassettes film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie 
were collected by ono 
she also took cassettes of interviews by lennon which were 
edited in such a way that he narrates the picture andrew solt 
this is elvis directed solt and david l wolper produced and 
solt and sam egan wrote it 
i think this is really the definitive documentary of john 
lennons life ono said in an interview what john was really 
about is depicted in this film very accurately and without 
whitewashing 
i did view it i didnt have them take any footage out 
i wanted the truth in the sense you had to put a 40year life 
into an hour and a half balance is a very serious consideration i 
think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so 
there is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments 
primarily by lennon tied in with the film and using the same title

imagine is more than a lennon elegy though it fails to 
delve too deeply into the darker side of lennon and the beatles 
drug use abusive tempers manager brian epsteins death it does 
capture the music and the times in which lennon lived 
one intriguing episode in imagine shows cartoonist al capp 
lil abner being antagonistic toward the lennons during their 
bedin when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their 
concern for peace 
we were naive ono said a lot of things happened because 
we were naive maybe that was our strength to us al capp was just 
a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal with 
a sense of humor we didnt expect hostility 
al capp is one incident that was filmed in those days we did 
numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace there 
were some very rough interviews the hostility that was shown to us 
bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible each time i 
think we were hurt 
ono said lennon wrote the song imagine in 1969 or 70 we 
did the bedin the toronto peace festival the wars over 
billboard he was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept 
of world peace i think its one of the songs that will really go 
on forever in peoples minds

imagine theres no countries 
it isnt hard to do 
nothing to kill or die for

lennon was born oct 9 1940 he was shot and killed outside his 
manhattan apartment on dec 8 1980 
ono was a painter when lennon met her she later joined him in 
music and in public demonstrations for peace 
i think that for somebody like me because i feel that im an 
artist and a creative artist that it is a very strange turn of 
events that im known as a widow she said 
but it is stranger to me that im not that disturbed by it i 
think that john promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow 
it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a 
context of a partnership with him i think it is my turn to 
promote him he promoted me 
when albert goldmans the lives of john lennon was published 
in september depicting the former beatle as riddled with vices 
faults and neuroses ono called it totally fiction 
since then shes received a tremendous amount of support from 
friends and fans i was very touched and thankful that people 
sent letters to me and extended hands at this time very warmly i 
really appreciate that i was also surprised that so many people 
stood up against it the goldman book i didnt expect that ono 
said 
lennons half sister julia baird also has written a new book 
john lennon my brother she has no idea how many books have 
been written about lennon shes been sent some of them but hasnt 
read them i know the life and it is too painful to read somebody 
elses version 
theres still enough footage ono said for another movie 
perhaps a music or political or art film and theres another big 
john lennon project on her horizon 
its from unpublished songs which were written for a broadway 
musical i dont know if it would have gotten to broadway you aim 
for the stars you know the songs might be strung together they 
might become a record might eventually become a musical there are 
enough finished songs they were never recorded in the studio 
theyre on cassettes 
their son sean 13 like his older halfbrother julian has 
become interested in music and started playing guitar 
i had reservations about sean going into the music field i 
still do but i kind of gave up on it ono said 
he is into guitar now a session musician a very good one 
was teaching him according to this teacher it seems like he is 
very good he is just totally involved in it listening to eric 
clapton jimi hendrix his dads songs only for guitar playing i 
think 
he is into it so much good luck to him

building products giant manville corp nearly 
brought to ruin in 1982 by billions of dollars in asbestosrelated 
lawsuits is a changed company on the verge of shedding its chapter 
11 protection 
the us supreme courts rejection this past week of the last 
challenge to manvilles reorganization plan virtually assures its 
emergence from the wind tunnel as tom stephens chief 
executive officer describes the companys sixyear chapter 11 
odyssey 
without explanation the supreme court turned down the challenge 
by macarthur co a minneapolis company that for years distributed 
manville asbestos products 
macarthur has 25 days to seek a second supreme court review but 
has not indicated whether it will if the company waives a second 
review manville would have just 30 days of legal requirements 
before it could emerge from chapter 11 reorganization 
its a day weve worked for for a long long time said 
stephens who has guided manville through the last two years of 
reorganization 
when manville filed for chapter 11 protection on aug 26 1982 
it was being deluged with asbestos injury and propertydamage 
lawsuits at a rate of 400 a month by 1986 property damage claims 
alone had come to a staggering 85 billion or about 40 times the 
companys total assets the company also faced more than 17000 
personal injury claims in the billions of dollars 
the chapter 11 filing allowed manville to operate in an 
interestfree environment safe from the mounting injury and damage 
claims and to draft a more than 25 billion trustfund plan to pay 
asbestos victims 
the us bankruptcy court approved manvilles reorganization 
claims payment plan in december 1986 but challenges have delayed 
its implementation 
now with the last hurdle nearly behind it a refitted manville 
is poised to begin operation free of court protection and 
supervision 
the reorganization plan has been praised and pilloried 
phillip schaeffer a bankruptcy specialist with the investment 
firm cowen amp co described it as a work of art a stunningly 
magnificent document 
calvert crary a litigation analyst with martin simpson amp co a 
new york investment research firm said manville shareholders will 
be big losers they will see their stake diluted winding up with 
one share of new manville stock for every eight shares they hold 
today 
basically they wiped out their shareholders said crary 
im disgusted with the way manville conducted itself its been 
guilty of a gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility to 
shareholders 
stephens however said the plan protects shareholders while at 
the same time addressing the asbestos claims problem 
to all those who said the filing was inappropriate i think 
the 26 billion is testimony to the fact that manville has dealt 
effectively with the problem he said following the supreme court 
ruling 
schaeffer said the plan will help manville remain a financially 
and operationally healthy company 
even assuming a mild recession the recent costcutting 
measures that manville has undertaken the elimination of 
lowprofit or noprofit businesses and the acquisition of 
highprofit businesses will allow manville significant cash flow 
and profitability in the future he said 
the reorganization plan calls for establishment of a personal 
injury settlement trust to settle claims of asbestos health 
victims for the next 25 years manville already has paid 150 
million into the trust and its insurers will pay another 615 
million immediately beginning in 1991 manville will make annual 
payments to the trust of 75 million until 2012 
a second trust called the property damage settlement trust 
would settle asbestosrelated property claims manville is 
obligated to pay 100 million cash immediately to this trust and 
the companys insurance carriers also will contribute millions of 
dollars 
in addition manville faces immediate cash obligations of 2475 
million to commercial creditors once it emerges from bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the supreme courts ruling brings the plan closer to 
implementation for thousands of asbestos victims around the nation 
i am praying that this is the end of the road for us said 
heather maurer executive director of asbestos victims of america 
based in soquel calif the group has more than 13000 members 
across the country 
while some analysts question whether the trust payments will 
drain the companys cash flow and profits over the next quarter 
century others say the payments are arranged so that manville may 
juggle its trustpayment obligations while continuing to expand 
manville which made a 164 million profit on 206 billion in 
sales last year today consists of three parts a fiber glass 
group which produces insulation products and glass fibers a 
forest products group producing wood and paper products and a 
specialty products group making diverse goods ranging from 
commercialindustrial lighting to filter materials for the beer and 
wine industries 
the fascinating part of the bankruptcy is that weve designed 
a 2 billion company from scratch said stephens 
he said the reorganized manville is a blend of mature 
businesses such as fiberglass and forest products and growth 
businesses in its specialty products group 
to optimize the value for shareholders what you like to do is 
have growth and maturity he said if you just have growth with 
no cash flow then you tend to leverage and then when things go 
bad negative leverage will kill you 
so its like a sonata its a carefully orchestrated 
balance

no matter how good the statistics on the economy 
get these days they dont seem to be good enough to quell fears on 
wall street of an approaching recession 
by most standards the figures on the pace of business activity 
and growth have been very upbeat of late 
the latest case in point the labor departments report friday 
of a drop in the unemployment rate from 56 percent in august to 
54 percent in september 
while job growth continued it occurred at a relatively subdued 
rate which suggested that the economy was neither getting too hot 
nor catching a chill 
analysts said the federal reserve board probably would like the 
figures enough to decide against any further credittightening in 
its battle against inflation 
meanwhile the passage of time has made it increasingly apparent 
that last years stock market crash was not the immediate precursor 
of a corresponding plunge for the economy 
the stock market has been holding its ground lately because of 
a total absence of any sign of a recession in the words of 
henry gailliot president of federated investment counseling a 
pittsburghbased money management firm 
yet gailliot like a good many other observers believes the 
gains recorded by stock prices this year have represented nothing 
more than a bear market rally and argues that a recession is 
likely by next year 
if this business cycle is to move toward recession in the 
standard sequence which involves capacity strains in finance 
industrial output and employment the recession will occur in 
1989 he maintains 
the overextended consumer will stop in a not very different 
fashion from the overextended stock market which stopped in august 
of 1987 
not everyone shares this view of course for the nearly six 
years since the current period expansion began the optimists have 
been right and the frequent warnings from the pessimists have 
proved wrong 
we do not anticipate a recession soon said jim mccamant 
editor of the medical technology stock letter in the latest issue 
of that investment advisory publication 
it is important to look at the economy sector by sector 
rather than always concentrating on the aggregate numbers 
during this long period of prosperity we have had some 
serious recessions in a number of different industries the oil 
supply industry is still in its recession 
the rust belt companies are now in the early stages of an 
economic recovery helped by strong exports in this sector the 
recovery is still very young and is far short of previous cyclical 
peaks 
the optimistic camp got a lift late in the past week when the 
stock and bond markets responded enthusiastically to the employment 
report 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed friday at 
215025 up 3734 points from the week before and not far from the 
postcrash closing high of 215861 it reached on july 5 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 324 to 15681 
and the american stock exchange market value index gained 219 to 
30382 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
weighed down by selling in hightechnology issues dropped 204 to 
38567 
volume on the big board averaged 16665 million shares a day 
against 13494 million the week before 
edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities argues 
that forecasting a recession based on traditional economiccycle 
reasoning is misguided because economic circumstances have changed 
he says market capitalism and intense global competition now 
exert forces of discipline on the economy that in effect regulate 
activity much more effectively than government policymakers used to 
severe busts will no longer be necessary to unwind the 
excesses caused by booms he contends excesses wont be 
allowed to build in the first place

the federal aviation administration 
should be freed of bureaucratic red tape and made an independent 
government corporation similar to amtrak us secretary of 
transportation james burnley said thursday 
burnley said regulation of aviation safety should remain in the 
transportation department but he told the aircraft owners and 
pilots association the faa needs independence to do a much better 
job of modernizing air traffic control and keeping pace with 
growth 
the aopa represents private aircraft owners and pilots 
the faa is a unique federal agency because it combines three 
distinct and somewhat contradictory missions burnley said he 
said the faa is charged with establishing and enforcing aviation 
safety regulations providing air traffic control service and 
encouraging development of civil aeronautics and air commerce 
burnley said he wanted to retain control of aircraft safety 
because aviation will do much better in the annual budget battles 
with the office of management and budget and congress with a 
cabinet secretary as its spokesman 
burnley also called on congress to act on a tort liability 
crisis in general aviation manufacturing that has resulted in 
insurance costs rising fivefold since 1981 while sales have 
dropped from 17000 planes in 1979 to 1500 in 1986 
while congress procrastinates on the resolution of this urgent 
issue general aviation manufacturers in europe are poised to 
invade us markets burnley said 
burnley also said 
he was concerned by alcohol and drug abuse among pilots noting 
that indictments were handed down in tampa fla last week 
against some two dozen pilots for failing to disclose convictions 
for drug and alcohol related offenses on the airman medical 
certificates they provided to the faa 
nationally there is a dire need for airport expansion and 
improvement a major airport has not been constructed in the united 
states since dallasfort worth opened in the mid70s although he 
noted that adams county colo residents voted in may to permit 
denver to annex land for a new hub airport

oil futures prices have wilted following a

contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 06 cent to settle at 
3950 cents a gallon while home heating oil slipped 052 cent to

traders said a technical rally gripped the market pushing 
prices higher by midday but broke down shortly thereafter on a 
dearth of encouraging news 
the market still looks sick said chris mccormack a trader 
at drexel burnham lambert inc he said participants were continuing 
to focus on saudi arabias production levels 
earlier this week saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter threatened not to restrain its own production if other 
members of the 13nation opec cartel continued to pump beyond their 
quotas 
thats old news but its still the focus of the market and 
theres a feeling that saudi arabia has not yet achieved its goals 
and will continue to pressure prices mccormack said 
the saudis have indicated they want to punish other members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries for overproducing 
and driving down the price of oil 
traders also remained concerned about a report that surfaced 
wednesday that said exxon corp chartered a number of tankers to

september reports from the nations largest general retailers 
have given no indication that the companies 19monthold sales 
slump will end soon but industry analysts say storeowners have 
taken steps to protect their profits 
sales for the early part of the month through midmonth 
recorded a nice uptick but retailers were unable to sustain that 
improvement the rest of september jeffrey edelman an analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc said after reviewing thursdays 
reports 
retailers hoped september would end the sluggish sales trend 
that began a year and a half ago but last months numbers 
werent quite as good as expected said karen sack an analyst 
with standard amp poors corp 
it doesnt look like the turnaround that people expected will 
be here ms sack said predicting retailers would see only 
modest sales increases for the rest of 1988 
but retailers have kept inventories lean and pared expenses 
steps that should help their thirdquarter earnings said jeffrey 
feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
ms sack agreed saying were not going to see the kind of 
pressure on their margins as in recent quarters 
i think its safe to say the worst is over for retailers 
she said 
the analysts said softness in retail sales was not necessarily a 
sign of weakness in consumer spending which is watched closely as 
an economic indicator because it accounts for twothirds of the 
gross national product 
consumers are spending at a very high rate theyve just been 
moving to other areas like durables said monroe h greenstein 
an analyst with the investment firm bear stearns amp co inc 
ms sack noted consumers also have been spending more for 
services such as utilities and medical care leaving them less 
money for general merchandise and apparel 
apparel sales which have been in a yearlong slump of their 
own improved slightly last month but analysts still described 
them as weak 
several retailers recorded sales increases of 3 percent or less 
meaning they continued to lose ground to inflation which has run 
at an annual rate of 46 percent so far this year 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said its 
overall sales rose 66 percent in september and 57 percent for the 
first 35 weeks of the fiscal year sales from sears stores open at 
least a year known in the trade as samestore or comparable sales 
were up 16 percent last month and 2 percent for the year to date 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate yardstick of a companys performance than figures 
which include sales from new stores but not all retailers report 
both overall and samestore results 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 71 percent last month 
and 56 percent for the cumulative 35week period samestore sales 
were up 3 percent for september and 2 percent for the year to date 
walmart stores inc said its sales were up 25 percent overall 
last month while climbing 30 percent so far this year samestore 
sales meanwhile were up 10 percent in september and 11 percent 
for the year to date 
jc penney co inc said its overall sales rose 13 percent in 
september and 17 percent for the year to date penneys 
samestore sales were up 07 percent for the month and 06 percent 
so far this year 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales rose 151 percent 
last month and 169 percent for the year to date samestore sales 
picked up 29 percent in september and 17 percent so far this year 
may department stores co said its overall sales rose 21 percent 
in september while picking up 146 percent so far this year 
samestore sales were up 3 percent for the month and 16 percent 
for the year to date 
fw woolworth co said its september sales rose 137 percent 
while yeartodate sales rose 122 percent samestore sales rose 
72 percent for the month and 59 percent for the first 35 weeks 
montgomery ward amp co said its sales were up 35 percent in 
september and 31 percent so far this year 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
said its overall sales rose 11 percent last month and 6 percent for 
the year to date limiteds samestore sales were up 7 percent in 
september an improvement over the companys performance in recent 
months while falling 1 percent over the cumulative 35week period 
apparel sales began slumping in august 1987 when many women 
turned away from shorter skirts and fashions they considered boring 
the results reported thursday were from general merchandise and 
apparel retailers unlike monthly retail sales figures released by 
the federal government they do not include sales at auto dealers

digital equipment corp struck out the first time 
it tried to manufacture personal computers so in its second 
venture into the market it is relying on a specialist 
tandy corp will make personal computers to digitals 
specifications which digital will market and sell under its brand 
geoffrey burr a digital group manager for strategic relations 
said thursday 
the personal computer market has moved more and more into a 
commodity orientation digital doesnt feel that we should be 
using our resources to try and compete in manufacturing that kind 
of product burr said so we cut out and made an agreement with 
a company which is 
the agreement comes two days after digital announced its first 
licensing agreement ever to allow an outside firm to manufacture 
its computers on tuesday digital and allenbradley co of 
cleveland announced an alliance designed to strengthen digitals 
hold in the manufacturing automation market 
its desirable for dec to be able to provide the complete 
computing needs to any major customer from the personal level to 
the superminicomputer level said bruce watts an analyst and 
managing director of needham amp co 
most analysts would agree that dec is making the right 
decision in augmenting their product line through outside 
suppliers watts said 
watts said digital missed the boat with its first attempt at a 
personal computer line five or six years ago 
dec had a major false start in personal computers when they 
introduced a number of products including a product called rainbow 
and they didnt meet with a great deal of success watts 
said for one reason or another the personal computer was not 
their focus at that time 
burr said the arrangement with tandy was in response to customer 
demand 
digital has been asked to provide support for a range of 
different vendors and we have concluded agreements with several of 
those companies to provide full service and support he said 
digital agreed to service and certify certain tandy personal 
computers to operate in digital networks company officials refused 
to describe the computers in detail 
dean burran the marketing manager for digitals personal 
computer group said the new machines would differ from tandys own 
line in extra features that will make them fit easily into 
digitals networking system 
tandy spokesman mark yamagata said he was not able to reveal a 
product line were their manufacturing source we will work to 
develop the computers to their specifications he said 
sonny monosson an independent analyst who has followed digital 
for 20 years said digital has created systems in the past to 
interface with software from other companies but he said this was 
digitals first marketing agreement with another company 
i wonder how apple compaq olivetti are going to feel about 
this new arrangement monosson said this is the first product 
that they are offering to distribute through their sales 
operation

a new study provides ammunition for companies 
that want the united states to extend soontoexpire steel import 
quotas with the european community japan and other nations 
according to one steelstate senator 
the study released thursday by three washington attorneys and 
economist william noellert says conditions that led to negotiation 
of steel import barriers by the reagan administration in 1984 
namely intervention by foreign governments to help their 
steelmakers compete in world markets have not changed 
the study will help steel makers convince the public the 
fiveyear quotas which expire in the fall of 1989 should be 
continued said sen john heinz rpa 
the american public will have the facts about the extent to 
which foreign governments have rigged the worlds steel supply and 
about the failure of the us government to do anything about it 
until the eleventh hour heinz said 
noellert and attorneys thomas howell jesse krier and alan wm 
wolff all work for the washington firm of dewey ballantine 
bushby palmer and wood their research was financed partly by six 
american steel companies that are on record as favoring 
continuation of the quotas 
in conjunction with the release of the study those six 
companies released their own statement on import ceilings during a 
press conference thursday 
the united states should not dismantle this system until the 
international distortions which give rise to the policy in the 
first place have been eliminated said the statement by armco 
inc bethlehem steel corp inland steel industries inc ltv 
steel co national steel corp and usx corp 
congressional pressure and a finding by the us international 
trade commission that the steel industry was being harmed by 
imports led the reagan administration to negotiate fiveyear import 
agreements with japan south korea the european community and 
other leading steel exporters in 1984 the agreements placed 
productbyproduct caps on the amount of steel than can be imported 
into the united states each year 
since the quotas took effect the foreign share of the american 
steel market has dropped from 264 percent in 1984 to 213 percent 
in 1987 according to thursdays study called steel and the 
state 
the steel industry which cut its workforce from 500000 in 1973 
to 163000 in 1987 was profitable last year for the first time 
since 1981 
given continuing government subsidies of foreign steel 
operations the study said it would be imprudent if not 
foolhardy to permit completely open access to the us market 
the study said that even with the quotas the united states has 
permitted a much higher level of steel imports than japan or europe 
would consider acceptable

kroger co has announced a round of layoffs 
under a 46 billion restructuring aimed at thwarting an unwanted 
takeover with 300 corporate headquarters workers from vice 
presidents to secretaries getting their walking papers 
kroger officials said thursday that the firings of 300 of its 
800 corporate employees would enable it to save 13 million a year 
and defend the company from takeover attempts 
the workers were told only hours earlier that they would be let 
go although rumors of mass layoffs had circulated all week all 
were covered by severance packages that provided up to nine months 
pay plus insurance and other benefits kroger said 
theyre not finished yet said scott hatch who still has 
his job in the management information systems department its 
like watching a horror film and knowing its coming but you dont 
know when 
seeing your friends go is the hardest part there are a lot of 
depressed people right now said sharon hillenbrand who was 
fired from her job in the transportation department it was not a 
surprise 
as part of the restructuring kroger also plans to pay 
shareholders a special 48 a share dividend 40 in cash and a 
bond it values at 8 
the supermarket company also has plans to sell certain 
businesses in order to help cut costs and streamline operations 
kroger last month proposed the restructuring to fend off 
unwanted takeover offers from kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a new 
york investment firm and the haft family which controls retailer 
dart group inc 
kohlbeg kravis on tuesday raised its offer to 503 billion or 
64 a share in cash and securities and proposed to buy kroger 
whether or not it restructured kroger had not responded publicly 
to kohlbergs offer by late thursday 
dart group which last month began the bidding competition for 
kroger stated wednesday it was interested in working with kroger 
to enhance the restructuring by providing more equity a statement 
some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance to help kroger 
fend off kohlberg kravis 
the hafts of landover md opened the kroger bidding sept 19 
with an unsolicited offer of 55 per share or 432 billion the 
hafts have not increased their offer

spokeswoman said friday 
speaking on the condition of anonymity the spokeswoman said the 
eec was confident its policy conformed with international trade 
rules we are utterly serene about the formation of the panel 
said the official 
japan has contended that the eecs imposition of antidumping 
duties on locallyassembled japanese electronic typewriters and 
other products violates international trade rules 
specifically the japanese government believes that the eec is 
violating a rule of the general agreement on tariffs and trade that 
requires locally based foreign manufacturers to be treated in the 
same manner as their domestic counterparts 
a decision to form the panel likely will be made at a meeting on 
oct 19 of the gatt council the international trade body the 
spokeswoman said 
earlier this week the european court of justice rejected a 
complaint by a number of japanese companies that the commission 
used faulty accounting methods in antidumping cases

a us justice department attorney siding 
with the soviet union told a federal appeals court that 
ussoviet relations will suffer unless an american businessmans 
unusual lawsuit is dismissed 
douglas letter said thursday that the government takes no 
position on whether raphael gregorian is right or wrong in his 
contention that the soviets libeled him but he joined an attorney 
for the soviets in arguing that the case should not be tried in 
us courts 
gregorian a palo alto calif businessman sued the soviets 
after they revoked his license to do business in moscow where he 
had been selling medical equipment for 14 years he was expelled 
and branded a spy in an article in the official soviet newspaper 
izvestia 
his attorney gerald kroll told a panel of the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals in the oneday hearing that gregorian deserves a 
trial 
however letter argued we have been working very closely with 
the soviets and we have made wonderful progress its important 
that this progress not be set back 
it is our position that under the foreign sovereign immunities 
act you cannot sue a foreign entity for libel letter said 
and even if you can you cant do it on the facts of this case 
kroll ridiculed letters contention that the fate of ussoviet 
relations depends on gregorian 
i personally think they have bigger people to fry than my 
client he told the court 
reached by telephone gregorian expressed amazement at the 
statements about his role in international affairs 
if being fair to me affects our relations with the soviet 
union then we dont have any relations he said the question 
is why have they the us government turned against me im 
really too small a guy were talking about two superpowers 
this is infantile sophomoric and unfair 
one of the appellate judges stephen reinhardt bristled at the 
mention of foreign relations saying isnt that something were 
supposed to ignore the political considerations in reaching our 
decision 
john mage a new york attorney representing the soviets 
insisted that us courts do not have jurisdiction because the 
incidents in question did not occur in the united states he also 
said the soviet union is immune from a lawsuit as a foreign 
sovereign 
kroll argued that the soviets libeled gregorian in connection 
with a commercial enterprise and that such an action is exempt from 
the immunities act 
gregorians problems date back to 1984 when the soviets said he 
could no longer sell medical equipment such as kidney dialysis and 
heartlung machines the soviet newspaper then printed a story 
denouncing gregorian as a duplicitous negotiator accusing him 
of bribery and smuggling and intimating that he was a us spy 
gregorian adamant about his innocence sued for libel and 
demanded payment for medical equipment still in moscow the soviets 
dispute his contention that he still has equipment there 
the soviet defendants ignored the suit until 1985 when us 
district judge david kenyon entered a default judgment against 
them awarding gregorian total damages of 413000 of that amount 
250000 was for libel 
the soviets refused to pay kroll said he would seize soviet 
assets and even took custody of a typewriter at an izvestia 
correspondents washington dc home as partial payment 
the soviets and the us state department went to court and 
asserted immunity from suit under the immunities act 
last year kenyon reversed his own libel judgment ruling that he 
did not have jurisdiction because of immunity considerations but 
he let stand his ruling the soviets should pay for the medical 
supplies 
kroll appealed the libel ruling to the 9th circuit the soviets 
appealed the contractual award as well as disputing the libel claim

civilian unemployment fell 02 percentage 
point to 54 percent last month as payrolls grew by 255000 jobs 
100000 of them in education with the opening of the fall school 
term the government said today 
the decline erased an august gain and returned joblessness to 
julys level 
with only one more jobless rate to come before the nov 8 
election economists said they did not expect the reports for 
september and october to help democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis the october jobless figures will be reported only 
four days before the election 
across private industry the job gain was just 142000 it was 
the second straight month of little expansion after average monthly 
increases of 300000 over the first seven months of 1988 the labor 
department said 
assemblyline manufacturing jobs fell by 19000 atop a loss of 
18000 jobs in august that reversed an upward trend that had 
persisted for 1 years oil and gas industry employment also fell 
for the second month in a row after edging up gradually across the 
previous 12 months 
together those industries had averaged a monthly job gain of 
65000 from january through july 
adult men accounted for nearly all of the decline in the overall 
rate last month with joblessness falling from 49 percent in 
august to 45 percent last month 
except for hispanics whose rate fell from 84 percent to 74 
percent there was little change among the various population 
groups tracked 
the september figures show that the number of unemployed 
americans fell by 255000 to 66 million 
the number of discouraged workers those who have given up 
the hunt for a job in the belief that they could not find one rose 
from 910000 to 930000 in the third quarter of 1988 more than 
half of the discouraged workers were women and onethird were 
blacks 
monthly increases in total payroll employment have slowed in 
the third quarter averaging only a little more than 200000 per 
month compared with 340000 in the first half of the year said 
janet l norwood the commissioner of labor statistics in 
congressional testimony 
excluding teachers and other government workers health services 
was the biggest source of new jobs last month with such payrolls 
growing by 62000 in contrast the government said business 
services one of the strongest job sources across the sixyear 
expansion showed little growth 
wholesale trade added 25000 jobs in september continuing a 
pattern of consistent growth brought about largely through rising 
exports caused by the fallen value of the dollar 
on the eve of todays report economists said they had expected 
the rate to decline last month 
even if the unemployment rate went up dukakis would not get 
any help because the financial markets would react positively 
said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co a private 
consulting house 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a consulting 
firm based in bala cynwyd pa predicted that employment 
inflation and trade figures between now and the election all will 
paint a rosy economy 
hes not going to get any help from the raw employment 
figures chimerine said of dukakis if hes going to win on 
economics its going to have to come from convincing people 
theres a problem ahead of us 
vice president and republican presidential nominee george bush 
has repeatedly focused on the creation of some 15 million new jobs 
under the reagan administration since the end of the 198182 
recession which had sent the jobless rate into double digits 
making much the same point president reagan told reporters this 
morning 
we talk about the record 70 months of economic expansion but 
these figures tell the real story that people can understand they 
mean paychecks school clothes and families that can plan a 
brighter future 
thats what george bush and dan quayle stand for and thats 
what the administration has worked for in the last eight years 
dukakis has countered that the issue is not the number of new 
jobs being created but the quality of those jobs saying hourly 
wages after adjustments for inflation have fallen since president 
reagan assumed office in 1981 
august figures on inflation and average wages bolstered that 
argument the labor department reported that real hourly earnings 
in terms of purchasing power dropped 13 percent during the month 
the worst decline since the government began collecting figures on 
them in 1964 
the labor department said today that average hourly wages rose 
05 percentage point last month to 937 after declining by two 
cents an hour from may through august 
chimerine said private surveys show wages beginning to 
accelerate but very very slowly at an annual rate of between 
35 percent to 4 percent 
there have be some large increases for entrylevel jobs but 
they have not spread throughout the society he said large 
companies in particular have been successful in resisting them 
an alternate jobless rate including the 17 million members of 
the armed forces stationed in the united states also fell 02 
percentage point last month to 53 percent

talks about texas air corps possible sale of 
its eastern airlines subsidiary to rival trans world airlines inc 
bring together two former bitter adversaries 
texas air apparently has put eastern on the auction block just 
a few months after chairman frank lorenzo vowed to shareholders 
that the ailing unit was not for sale 
sources said thursday that takeover strategist carl icahn twas 
chairman was talking with lorenzo about acquiring miamibased 
eastern 
that report came a day after new york developer donald trump 
confirmed he was negotiating with texas air about a possible 
purchase of easterns air shuttle operation and said a contract 
could be signed by next week 
icahn was in contact thursday with trump exploring ways in 
which the two might buy separate pieces of eastern according to a 
report in todays editions of the wall street journal 
lorenzo wants to divest himself of eastern airlines one way or 
another said robert decker an airline analyst for duff amp phelps 
inc in chicago 
trump reportedly would pay more than 300 million cash for the 
shuttle which serves new york boston and washington and is 
easterns most profitable operation some analysts said trump might 
use the shuttle to help draw people to his hotel and casino 
properties in atlantic city nj 
airline analysts suggested icahn might be willing to acquire all 
of eastern except the shuttle 
icahn and lorenzo are wily and tenacious executives who dueled 
over control of twa three years ago a lot has changed since then 
for both men and for the deregulated airline business 
lorenzo whose texas air empire went on to acquire eastern for 
676 million after his twa bid failed apparently has decided that 
running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much 
trouble 
eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering 
financial losses before and since lorenzo took over eastern lost 
120 million in the first half of the year and recently laid off 
about 3000 union employees 
texas air also owns houstonbased continental airlines a 
nonunion carrier that recently has started to stem its losses 
for icahn who has chased giant companies ranging from usx corp 
to texaco inc in recent years the acquisition of eastern would 
make twa the largest us airline in terms of revenue passenger 
miles an industry measurement of capacity 
icahn is said to be interested in easterns northsouth routes 
especially between new york and miami as possible feeders into 
twas transatlantic routes easterns latin american and caribbean 
routes also reportedly piqued icahns interest 
easterns militant workers who characterize lorenzo as a union 
buster have been included in talks with icahn on the possible sale 
of the airline to him sources familiar with the situation said 
such a situation recalls the move by twas workers in 1985 to 
talk with icahn about possibly buying that airline which lorenzo 
was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his other 
carrier continental 
at that time twas pilots and machinists promised icahn 
hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took 
control largely because they feared lorenzo would gut twa and 
replace them with lowerpaid workers a strategy lorenzo had used 
earlier at continental 
now the eastern unions favor a sale of the entire airline as a 
going concern to a friendly acquirer while they are opposed to the 
sale of individual assets such as the shuttle 
at a texas air shareholders meeting in early june lorenzo said 
eastern airlines is not for sale he said a study estimated 
easterns netasset value at more than 2 billion or nearly 50 
for each texas air share 
but financial analysts have put easterns value at closer to 
500 million 
icahn might be willing to pay more if easterns unions agreed to 
labor concessions as part of the deal analysts and union sources 
said 
since the twa takeover icahn has faced his own labor problems 
beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986 
the strike failed but the flight attendants union has continued 
challenging icahn it petitioned the department of transportion to 
review his fitness to run the airline earlier this year 
icahn also has incurred the wrath of twas pilots who claim he 
broke promises to them when he initially acquired control of the 
airline the pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing 
against the airlines properties without making crucial longterm 
investments in equipment 
icahn has denied the charges of both unions

while pillsbury co has not rejected grand 
metropolitan plcs 52 billion takeover offer it has become 
increasingly hostile toward the british company warning 
shareholders not to be fooled by its blitz campaign 
in his first major public response to the unsolicited 
60ashare bid launched tuesday pillsbury chairman philip smith 
grand met was trying to stampede shareholders and others into 
believing the offer was good for all our constituents 
we should not accept grand mets words at face value he 
said thursday 
smith also told pillsbury employees to treat the british food 
and liquor conglomerate with skepticism when it claims that a 
successful takeover would not result in major job cuts 
separately pillsbury said late thursday that a michigan state 
judge had upheld a restraining order barring grand metropolitan 
from buying any pillsbury stock because of questions over whether a 
buyout would violate liquor laws in a number of states 
smith and two other pillsbury officials met privately late in 
the day with gov rudy perpich at the capitol to brief the governor 
on the takeover in terms of pillsburys perspective ray bohn 
perpichs communications director confirmed today 
bohn said the pillsbury officials requested the meeting and 
spent between 30 and 45 minutes with the governor 
they know that in terms of legislative prerogatives theres 
not much that can be done because theyre a delaware corporation 
bohn said 
he said the pillsbury officials asked the governor to check 
whether grand metropolitan may be violating an old state law 
prohibiting companies which produce or distill liquor from owning 
retail liquor outlets such as pillsburys steak and ale restaurants 
bohn said perpich agreed to check with the attorney generals 
office and with state public safety commissioner paul tschida and 
expects to have a response within a few days 
the chicago tribune in its editions today quoted smith as 
saying thursday were not going to be taken over by grand 
metropolitan the newspaper said smith made the comment to the 
tribune after a hastily arranged meeting with perpich 
smith made his remarks in a letter to employees of the 
minneapolisbased food and restaurant business the letter also was 
distributed to the news media 
pillsburys board of directors is studying the 523 billion 
buyout offer to shareholders and will make a recommendation in 
due course smith said 
larry haeg a pillsbury spokesman said pillsbury has not 
discussed the takeover bid with grand met a major wine and spirits 
maker which also owns hotels betting offices in england and 
ireland alpo pet food and pearle vision centers 
grand met officials have indicated they would not engage in 
wholesale job reductions at pillsbury but grand mets history is 
filled with just the opposite kind of corporate behavior smith 
said in his letter which did not cite examples 
walter montgomery a spokesman for grand met in new york 
disputed smiths remark about job reductions 
the letter is what it is montgomery said it has a 
purpose you figure it out 
smith also disputed assertions by security analysts grand met 
and some newspapers that pillsbury has few choices in dealing with 
the takeover bid 
they have no idea what programs ive been working on to 
add value to this company smith said but i think there are 
significant opportunities to improve the value 
some analysts have said pillsbury shareholders might have a hard 
time rejecting the allcash offer before grand met offered 60 a 
share the stock was trading in the range of 39 
pillsburys stock closed down 25 cents to 5787 thursday on 
the new york stock exchange 
the michigan court ruling stemmed from pillsburys attempt to 
block grand met by suing the company in 14 states on the grounds a 
takeover would violate tiedhouse statutes prohibiting liquor 
manufacturers from owning retail liquor outlets 
the decision by judge frederick zeim in oakland county circuit 
court marked the second time that such a restraining order has 
withstood a challenge by grand met said johnny thompson a 
pillsbury spokesman 
of the 14 lawsuits filed seven have resulted in restraining 
orders against grand met thompson said 
grand met wants an exemption from the statutes saying it would 
sell the pillsburys retail liquor outlets if it bought the company 
grand met also announced thursday that it had lined up an 
additional 225 billion in financing for the proposed buyout 
combined with 375 billion in financing already in place the 
revolving line of credit supplied by six european banks gives grand 
met 6 billion in available funds montgomery said

chinese officials have announced tough new 
measures to halt construction projects targeted in an upcoming 
nationwide crackdown on what the government considers excessive 
capital investment which officials blame for high inflation 
after dec 1 authorities will withhold bank loans energy and 
building supplies and construction licenses from targeted projects 
to force them to close down the official peoples daily reported 
friday 
the newspaper quoted senior official chen guangjian newly 
appointed by premier li peng to spearhead efforts to curb capital 
construction 
he said projects slated for cancellation include those that rely 
on imported or scarce domestic raw materials are underfinanced 
will produce highenergyconsuming goods or goods that are already 
made in excess 
aside from a handful of projects already approved by the state 
planning commission construction will be halted on all office 
buildings auditoriums and hotels begun this year no new building 
will be allowed for two to three years he said 
according to a china daily report chen said projects which use 
imported technology and foreign funding are expected to escape 
cutting 
capital investment has grown at a rate of 188 percent over the 
past three years far outstripping the 164 percent rate of 
increase in national income during the same period the toorapid 
rate of investment has helped fuel an inflation rate currently 
about 20 percent 
chen said blind emphasis on shortterm profits in enterprises as 
well as the failure of local banks to abide by state loan quotas 
and policies were responsible for investment inflation 
the central committee of the communist party launched an attack 
on inflation and confusion in the economy in its plenary session 
last week criticizing party members and local officials for lax 
discipline in carrying out its economic policies 
the central government has led repeated drives with little 
success against excessive capital investment including a partial 
halt on hotel and theater construction earlier this year 
leaders intend the current campaign to be allinclusive in 
scope subjecting all capital investment nationwide to close 
scrutiny

farmers across the midwest are examining their corn while 
traders keep a watchful eye on the market as the discovery of a 
cancercausing toxic mold a byproduct of this summers drought 
threatens to curb an already reduced crop 
early indications are that aflatoxin though found already in 
several states will not pose a serious problem experts say but 
concerns that the progressing harvest will reveal the mold is 
widespread have lent support to corn prices at the chicago board of 
trade analysts say 
and aflatoxin is in the back of the minds of traders at the 
chicago mercantile exchange where prices of hogs a major corn 
consumer and especially vulnerable to the toxin would feel the 
effects of an outbreak 
one thought is that its going to reduce the corn supply 
said thomas morgan a livestock analyst and president of sterling 
research corp in arlington heights ill 
the other concern is that if the contamination becomes too 
widespread it will hurt our exports countries would not want to 
buy us corn out of fear of contamination so it could have a 
bullish or bearish impact morgan said 
but with only about onethird of the nations corn crop in the 
bin its too soon to tell he said 
the toxin is a metabolic byproduct of the fungus aspergillus 
flavus which primarily affects corn and peanut crops said walker 
kirby a plant pathologist at the university of illinois 
the fungus appears on corn kernels in hot dry weather and 
thrives in conditions like this past summers drought followed by 
the wet fall 
ordinarily the fungus can only be detected through a series of 
tests but on a severely affected ear of corn it shows up as an 
olivegreen colored mold visible to the naked eye he said 
after tainted corn is harvested the fungus will spread in 
storage unless the crop is kept cool and dry kirby said neither 
heat treatment nor fungicides destroy the toxin 
animals generally begin showing symptoms such as loss of 
appetite and weight if fed corn tainted with about 200 to 300 parts 
per billion for a period of two months or more kirby said 
in extremely large doses the toxin can cause liver cancer in 
humans but it is highly unlikely that humans will be affected 
by the outbreak said dan faulkner an animal sciences professor at 
the university of illinois 
this year like the last aflatoxin outbreak in 1983 another 
drought year the toxin has been discovered in corn crops 
throughout the midwest 
a statewide survey in illinois of 327 corn samples has found 
358 percent contained toxin levels of above 20 parts per billion 
the state agriculture department said 
under us food and drug administration guidelines corn 
destined for humans or dairy cattle must contain less than 20 parts 
per billion of the toxin corn for breeding cattle or swine must 
contain below 100 parts per billion 
the fda this past week revised its standards for corn shipped 
interstate allowing up to 100 parts per billion if the feed is 
given only to mature animals 
the board of trade recently announced that no corn could be 
delivered on our contracts that contained more than the 20 
partsperbillion limit from the fda guidelines said spokesman 
mark prout 
despite the fda revision our limit stays the same to assure 
the users of our markets of the quality of the grain being 
traded prout said 
indiana officials estimate that 10 percent to 14 percent of 
indiana corn contains some amounts of the toxin 
milk containing unacceptable levels of aflatoxin has been traced 
to several texas dairies 
the toxin has appeared in iowa and south dakota and testing is 
being done in those states as well as in minnesota and wisconsin 
if we find out that a lot of the corn is affected and is toxic 
it will affect our costs of production down the road said 
livestock analyst chuck levitt of shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago 
were not feeding a lot of the new crop corn yet were still 
feeding a lot of the old crop corn but if it really cuts into the 
availabilty of corn supplies next year it could stimulate some 
liquidation of hogs levitt said the nearterm effect would 
likely be a decline in hog futures prices but the longterm impact 
of a diminished corn supply would be bullish 
tight corn supplies will eventually lead to tighter meat 
supplies you can bet your bottom dollar levitt said 
since the 1983 drought rapid screening tests have been devised 
that can detect the toxin in minutes kirby said at grain 
elevators inspectors first put corn samples under an ultraviolet 
light if kernels glow the fungus is present and a rapid 
antibodyantigen test is then performed to determine presence and 
amount of toxin 
the elevators tell me theyre turning away about 5 to 10 
percent average corn for having more than 20 parts per billion 
kirby said 
if i were a farmer he said i would be sampling my grain 
purchasing a rapidscreening test kit i would screen my grain 
and i would also be sure that i was storing my grain at a 
lowmoisture level at lower than 70 degrees 
i would definitely be concerned kirby said but not be 
overly concerned its a management problem that can be dealt 
with

a 43member chinese delegation came away from 
its tour of geneva steel of utah this week so impressed that 
members said they intend to borrow some of the management ideas 
they found at the central utah plant 
i think we have already learned valuable management 
practices said cai zhe shi deputy director of the liaoning 
provincial department of metallurgical industry there are some 
steel factories in china whose production is not good we are very 
interested in how to effectively manage factories 
the delegation made up of steel industry and government 
officials from the peoples republic of china were in utah for 
management and operational training at geneva steel 
the group plans to spend two months in the united states to take 
a closer look at american steel operations on saturday the 
delegation was scheduled to fly to new york city 
geneva spokesman barry bartlett said geneva originally built 
during world war ii to supplement military steel production was 
of special interest to the chinese 
geneva steel has a unique distinction of being an older 
integrated steel mill that is continually upgraded with new 
technology bartlett said the chinese have a similar situation 
with older steel plants and older manufacturing that they need to 
upgrade rather than replace 
bartlett said the chinese are interested in learning how to stay 
competitive without investing in brand new technology 
chen shihuan senior engineer and vice chief of the works at 
chengdu iron and steel works in sichuan china said the utah plant 
is similar to those in china 
we have learned more here about how to use modernization in 
the controls of a plant which allows a plant that is relatively 
old with outofdate equipment to be very productive he 
explained 
chen operates a steel plant in the southwest region of china 
with 7000 employees who produce 300000 tons of steel a year all 
steel plants in china are governmentowned 
bartlett said utah stands to benefit from the visit as well 
exporting to china is certainly another possible outcome in 
this interaction in some regions there is a deficit of the steel 
industry bartlett said 
china huayang technology and trade corp is the delegations 
sponsoring agency host from china

wnbc nbcs radio flagship for 62 years and once 
home to jack benny bob hope fred allen and the nbc symphony 
conducted by arturo toscanini goes off the air today as a result 
of a corporate takeover 
the new owner is changing the talk and music station a 
clearchannel spot on the dial at 660 that can be heard in 35 
states at night to an allsports format 
the stations forerunner was a pioneer with a string of firsts 
including such things as the first broadcast of a world series and 
the first broadcast of the national political conventions it also 
had the first broadcast commercial 
wnbcs signoff announced feb 18 is the result of a 6 billion 
deal in 1985 in which general electric co bought rca corp the 
parent company of nbc 
a federal communications commission regulation prevents a new 
owner from keeping both a television and a radio station in the 
same market ge decided to sell its new radio properties and keep 
the more profitable wnbctv 
ge sold the nbc radio network to westwood one for 55 million 
and sold five stations to emmis broadcasting corp for 1215 
million one station is still up for sale knbr in san francisco 
wnbc signs off at 530 pm today and turns into wfan emmis 
sports format station previously heard at 1050 on the dial wnbcs 
frequency 660 is more desirable from an engineering standpoint 
the change means about 50 wnbc employees are out of jobs 
the station went on the air in april 1922 as w2xy then owned by 
atampt it became wbay in july that year and changed to weaf in 
august rca bought the station from atampt for 1 million in 1926 
when it formed nbc to help sell the radios it was building but the 
call letters werent changed to wnbc until 1946 
the format has changed the personalities have changed the 
call letters have changed change is inevitable said wnbc 
program director dale parsons one of those losing a job 
weaf had the first world series broadcast yankees vs giants 
in 1923 the first coasttocoast hookup in 1924 and the first 
broadcast of the national political conventions in 1924 in 1925 
it broadcast a presidential inaugural address by calvin coolidge 
for the first time 
the first radio commercial was aired on weaf on aug 28 1922 
when a real estate developer from across the east river in queens 
paid 100 for a 10minute announcement to advertise apartments 
up to that point radio was for experimenters and people were 
still thinking of ways to make money with it parsons said

irving bank corps board of directors approved 
friday a managementbacked 148 billion merger with hostile suitor 
bank of new york co ending one of the nations lengthiest and 
most bitter takeover battles 
the merger will nearly double bank of new yorks size vaulting 
it close to the top 10 of the nations largest banking companies 
the two had a combined 478 billion in assets as of june 30 
the board vote friday came two days after irving chairman joseph 
a rice announced he would abandon his yearlong resistance to the 
proposed acquisition and drop all pending lawsuits and 
antitakeover defenses aimed at stopping bank of new york 
rice also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave 
after the deal was completed 
in return bank of new york sweetened its previous hostile offer 
by about 200 million by slightly increasing the stock portion of 
the bid and adding stock warrants 
bank of new york has a tender offer scheduled to expire oct 
21 under way for irving shares as of sept 30 nearly 1046 
million of irvings 189 million outstanding shares had been 
tendered to bank of new york said owen brady a bank of new york 
spokesman 
neither side has commented publicly on the turn of events 
leading to the tentative pact but banking analysts agreed irving 
was forced to negotiate in the absence of any white knight 
takeover partner and after an appeals court invalidated irvings 
antitakeover poison pill defense 
the appellate division of new york state supreme court on 
tuesday struck down a provision allowing all irving shareholders 
except a hostile suitor to buy 400 worth of irving shares for 
200 if any suitor bought more than 20 percent of irving stock 
without irving management support such devices are intended to 
make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive 
irving had vowed to appeal the ruling to the states highest 
court the court of appeals but some legal experts questioned 
whether that court would have considered the case since the 
appellate divisions decision was unanimous 
last spring milanbased banca commerciale italiana spa offered 
to merge with irving as part of a major restructuring of the new 
york bank but it recently withdrew the bid after the federal 
reserve board ruled the italian government agency that owned most 
of banca commerciale had to supply separate financial imformation 
the fed already has given conditional approval for an 
irvingbank of new york merger 
under its revised bid bank of new york which owns 49 percent 
of irving would pay 15 in cash and 1675 shares of its own stock 
for each of irvings common shares outstanding it also included 
warrants valued at 5 toward the purchase of bank of new york stock 
the entire deal was worth about 7842 a share or about 148 
billion according to bank of new york figures 
irving stock was trading at 7475 a share on the new york stock 
exchange friday afternoon up 112 from late thursday 
all present directors of irving would be invited to join bank of 
new yorks board of directors under the proposed plan and all key 
personnel decisions would be made by a committee of directors made 
up of three directors of the bank of new york and two current 
irving directors 
when bank of new york first made its bid on sept 25 1987 it 
had the distinction of being the firstever hostile takeover fight 
between two big american banks it then became the lengthiest such 
battle among major us corporations

soybean futures prices plunged friday at the 
chicago board of trade pressured by a lack of export business and 
expections of higher government crop estimates 
the negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit sparking 
a selling wave that kept prices down analysts said wheat prices 
rallied on ongoing expectations that china and the soviet union 
plan big purchases said analyst joel karlin of research department 
inc 
anticipation that updated us department of agriculture 
estimates to be released next wednesday will show higher soybean 
harvest yields helped trigger the selloff in beans he said 
good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a 
negative tone to corn and soybean prices analysts said 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december 435 corn was 1 cent to 3 
cents lower with december at 294 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
to 3 cents lower with december at 243 a bushel and soybeans

jay grandy is busy dodging swarms of 
forklifts around snokist growers apple warehouses 
the company president is trying to stay out of the way of 1400 
employees who clean sort pack and ship up to 1 million apples per 
day as the nations largest apple crop moves into peak harvest 
the receiving crews are working from 6 in the morning to 9 at 
night grandy said this week we had 50000 cartons packed last 
week 
the forklifts are moving 700pound bins of red delicious apples 
from trucks to sorting lines or stacking them 11 high in 
refrigerated warehouses 
and so it will go at 300 warehouses across central washington 
for the next month as crews move 57 billion apples handpicked by 
over 40000 farmworkers from a crop the industry hopes is a major 
improvement over 1987 
plagued by a record production poor quality weather damage 
falling prices and a european economic community boycott the 1987 
apple crop was a major disaster for the states 4500 growers 
although the 68 million boxes of supermarket apples were 13 
million above the previous state record prices remained below the 
cost of production nearly the entire year 
as a result the 3124 million growers received for apples was 
177 million less than the year before 
things were so bad that snokist a cooperative with 380 member 
growers failed to pay a dividend for only the second time in its 
80year history grandy said the first time was in 1985 when frost 
wiped out 60 percent of the crop 
this years harvest is projected at only 572 million boxes and 
quality is looking much better growers say 
this crop is a vintage crop said charles st john 
spokesman for the washington apple commission an industry trade 
group its remarkably good in color size and inner quality 
there is awfully high confidence this year he said 
part of that optimism is based on national estimates of a crop 
of just 111 million boxes 22 million boxes less than last year 
that should keep prices up for apples which trail only potatoes 
and lettuce in national produce sales 
early market prices of 14 to 16 per 42pound box are well 
above the 950 per box growers need to break even last year 
prices dropped as low as 5 per box 
although 35 states grow apples commercially washington produces 
about half the nations supermarket apples each year and accounts 
for over 80 percent of apple exports 
michigan ranked second last year with 92 million boxes 
followed by new york with 9 million and california with 54 million 
boxes the commission said 
exports were one of the few bright spots for the 1987 crop 
setting a record despite the spring boycott by the eec washington 
growers blamed the boycott on the desire of the european 
governments to protect their local growers from competition the 
boycott has been lifted now 
this year the industry is taking steps to ensure that consumers 
will get a crisper apple 
for the first time the industry has instituted a firmness 
standard that is designed to ensure that top grade apples stay 
crisp at least two weeks after they are shipped to supermarkets 
apples too soft to meet that requirement will be diverted to juice 
and applesauce processors 
st john said the firmness standard adopted this summer by the 
state department of agriculture cannot guarantee proper handling 
by supermarkets but is designed to ensure a better shelf life for 
the fruit 
we lose control once we slam the door on the trucks he said

they all hail from queens and their egos are 
kingsized 
corporate raider carl icahn airline costslasher frank lorenzo 
and glitzy real estate mogul donald trump speak the language of the 
workingclass new york borough 
they have made millions from their brash megadeals they live 
in luxury now each is keenly interested in eastern airlines 
the similarities are startling but their unyielding tycoon 
styles raise the question of whether this ego trio ultimately can 
agree on a way to divvy up financially troubled eastern part of 
lorenzos texas air corp 
lorenzo is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of 
miamibased eastern which has been fraught with labor conflict and 
staggering losses before and since he took over 
the question is whether theres a negotiating table big 
enough to get all three around chuckled one wall street 
investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity its very 
difficult to do any threeparty deal and when you have the likes 
of those three it increases the degree of difficulty 
exponentially 
icahn who heads trans world airlines inc has met with lorenzo 
in the past to discuss the possibility of buying some eastern 
assets but he reemerged this week reportedly interested in 
acquiring all of eastern except for its lucrative shuttle service 
enter trump of atlantic city nj hotel and casino fame he 
has his eye on the shuttle which serves new york boston and 
washington 
despite the trading floor jokes one wall street source noted 
that what youve got is three very sharp deal people and theres 
a feeling they can probably come up with something very creative if 
they want to achieve the end result 
icahn has retained the quick reflexes of his trader days in 
typical raider fashion icahn buys into companies whose assets are 
worth more than their stock price and then makes money selling the 
companies later whole or in pieces unless the companies offer 
to buy him out at a premium 
his target list ranges from usx corp to texaco inc the only 
deterrent icahn has said is a companys stock price a most 
telling report card 
a princeton university graduate and medical school dropout 
icahn resides in a verdant new york suburb and has designed the 
gardens that skirt his mansion but he is said to be more intensely 
interested in business than in indulging in the pleasures of wealth 
posing beside him in a photograph that appeared in business week 
magazine recently was a majestic german shepherd but his interest 
in animals doesnt stop there within his business empire are 
partnerships that bear the names gnu corp buffalo investors 
corp wolf investors and stork associates 
francisco lorenzo is a harvard man his parents emigrated from 
spain and ran a hairdressing salon in midtown manhattan but their 
business he once said was hit hard by the advent of the 
doitathome permanent wave 
his goal has been to run businesses that are as lean as his 
distancerunners frame he shocked the industry in 1983 by filing 
to reorganize continental airlines under federal bankruptcy laws 
firing all 12000 employees in the process he hired back only 
4000 at tremendous wage cuts 
often projecting a cold toughguy persona lorenzo threatened 
several times to have beefy security guards eject shareholders from 
the texas air annual meeting in june because they continued their 
questioning after he had asked them to refrain 
beaming proudly this week when lorenzo announced a 50 million 
deal with scandinavian airlines system was his neatly coiffed 
mother who often attends his business functions 
trump a product of military school and the wharton school 
followed in his fathers footsteps when he embarked upon a career 
as a developer but he made his bailiwick manhattan rather than 
the less tony outer boroughs 
success came before he was even 30 and trump was eager to 
accumulate the riches his money could provide he seems driven to 
have his name emblazoned on highprofile properties like 
skyscrapers milliondollar condos casinos and helicopters 
in the 1970s he offered to build a 170 million convention 
center for the city of new york if his fathers name could appear 
on it the city declined 
among his recent purchases is the plaza hotel a french 
renaissance landmark adjacent to central park which he purchased 
for about 400 million the 808room hotel is being run by his 
czechborn wife ivana for 1 a year and all the dresses she can 
buy under her tutelage employees have been instructed to 
regularly stamp the sand in the hotels ashtrays with the plaza

cartel members by stepping up its own oil output and industry 
analysts predict the tactic will work 
the strategy which has forced the price of oil dramatically 
lower will enable the saudis and other members of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to stake out 
positions prior to key meetings expected to be held this month and 
next the analysts said 
the lower prices get the better it is said lucy mullins 
an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london it will force 
the opec nations to realize they have to take some kind of 
definite action 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased oil publication 
petrostrategies agreed 
the way things are being done is excellent he said 
unless there is enough pressure on the market the cheaters 
in opec will never learn their lesson 
world oil prices have plunged recently amid reports of 
burgeoning supplies and persistent discord in opec prices have 
been running more than 5 a barrel below the cartels benchmark of 
18 for a 42gallon barrel 
in new york trading friday the benchmark us crude west texas 
intermediate closed at 1294 a 42gallon barrel up 28 cents from 
thursday 
oil prices took a steep dive early in the week after saudi 
arabia the worlds largest oil exporter warned it will continue 
producing more than its opecset limit unless other cartel members 
stick to their quotas 
analysts estimated saudi arabia has recently pumped some 57 
million barrels a day topping its 43 millionbarrel quota 
its an attempt by saudi arabia to crack the whip said nick 
antill an oil analyst with the london brokerage county natwest 
added terzian if the saudis continue the pressure on the 
market thats the only way an agreement can be reached 
opec secretary general subroto warned recently prices could 
plummet to 5 a barrel if the saudis exploited their production 
capacity to force other cartel members to observe their quotas 
the bickering in the cartel precedes a joint meeting of two opec 
committees opec has not yet announced the date or place but 
analysts say oct 20 is likely possibly in madrid 
the talks will bring officials of iran and iraq to their first 
opec meeting since an august ceasefire in their nearly 8yearold 
war 
with the former enemies at the bargaining table the officials 
will likely discuss ways to shape a pact on production limits that 
will bring iraq back into the quota system and discourage cheating 
among other members 
both iran and iraq want to export more oil to pay for enormous 
projects needed to rebuild their wardamaged economies 
iraq refused to go along with its quota of 15 million barrels a 
day during the war and demanded a share equal to irans 24 million 
but analysts said iraq has been pumping well above that level 
averaging about 27 million barrels a day and could reach 37 
million by mid1989 with completion of a new pipeline through saudi 
arabia to the red sea 
irans output has been estimated at less than 2 million barrels 
a day 
the united arab emirates also has exceeded its ceiling of 
948000 barrels oil minister mana saeed otaiba has set the limit 
at 15 million barrels 
analysts said the upcoming discussions will lay the groundwork 
for a meeting of all 13 oil ministers scheduled to begin nov 21 in 
vienna austria 
antill suggested the oil producers might settle on a production 
package that would set a cartel ceiling of about 185 million 
barrels a day the current level is a bit more than 15 million 
barrels without iraq 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that opec production including iraq soared to 20 
million barrels a day in september up from 198 million in august 
under antills scenario iran and iraq each would be assigned a 
quota of 27 million barrels a day and the united arab emirates 
would be given several hundred thousand barrels a day more 
ms mullins said the ministers also may consider lowering their 
benchmark price from 18 a barrel to 15 the current target she 
said is completely impossible 
but terzian noted the desire of both iran and iraq for more 
money and argued that keeping a fairly high target would help opec 
write a new production accord 
the price evolution committee one of the two panels meeting 
later this month is made up of algeria saudi arabia nigeria 
indonesia and venezuela 
the other panel the longterm strategy committee includes 
iraq iran kuwait saudi arabia algeria and venezuela 
the other members of opec are ecuador gabon libya qatar and 
the united arab emirates

first fridays are proving to be full of mostly 
pleasant surprises for the bond market but some analysts see 
turbulence ahead 
for the past two months the first friday has meant reassurance 
for bondholders worried that the economy may be growing so fast 
that inflation will accelerate and take a heavy toll on the value 
of their fixedincome securities 
the first friday of each month is when the government reports on 
the employment situation in the previous month providing the most 
current official glimpse of the state of the economy 
the reports for august and september have indicated to many 
analysts that the economy is growing at a moderate yet still 
healthy pace 
more important each of the reports was viewed as reducing 
chances that the federal reserve would feel compelled to encourage 
higher interest rates 
this past friday the government reported that the september 
unemployment rate slipped to 54 percent from 56 percent the 
previous month most bond traders focused on payroll employment 
growth though and the september increase of 255000 jobs fell 
45000 short of expectations 
the reaction was immediate prices jumped and trading volume 
swelled after slowing to a trickle in the past few days in 
anticipation of the report 
by midafternoon the price of the 30year treasury bond was up 
more than 15 for every 1000 in face value and its yield was at 
880 percent its lowest level since midapril 
the rally was not quite as strong as the one that followed the 
release of the august unemployment figures which saw the 
unemployment rate rise to 56 percent from 54 percent in july and 
payroll growth of 219000 
bonds staged one of their biggest advances of the year that day 
with some 30year treasury issues rising more than 25 for every 
1000 in face value 
some analysts said the latest report confirmed the conclusion 
suggested by the unemployment report a month ago that the economy 
was moderating 
it belied the notion that the august figures were an 
aberration said elliott platt fixedincome research director 
for the investment firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities 
corp it appears they were the beginning of a new moderate growth 
trend for the economy 
but other analysts said economy continues to grow at a fairly 
strong pace and warned that higher interest rates may lie ahead 
leonard santow managing director for griggs amp santow inc a 
financial consulting firm said the market was so fearful of 
huge increases that the number was greeted with a sigh of relief 
he said the markets sharp rise friday may also have reflected a 
delayed response to sharp declines in oil prices earlier in the 
week 
crude oil prices plunged below 13 a barrel to twoyear lows at 
midweek a plus for the inflation outlook but the bond market 
barely moved as traders refused to budge before the unemployment 
report 
on the other hand some economists said the market may have 
ignored in its euphoria the wage data released with the 
unemployment report 
it said for instance that real hourly earnings dropped 13 
percent during the month while average hourly wages rose 05 
percentage point 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for 
dean witter reynolds inc said the wage measurements provide a 
modest hint that there could be some pickup in wage inflation 
can the bond market extend fridays advance 
steven a wood money market economist for bankamerica capital 
markets group in san francisco noted that the big rally following 
the august unemployment report lasted only a day 
it wouldnt surprise me to see the same kind of reaction this 
go around he said noting that the market runs into some 
important producer price and trade balance reports due to be 
released in the coming week

the stock market rose sharply today inspired by 
news of smallerthanexpected employment growth last month 
before the opening the labor department reported that the 
unemployment rate dropped to 54 percent in september from 56 
percent the month before 
but at the same time the agency said nonfarm payroll employment 
grew by 255000 jobs a bit less than the consensus estimate on 
wall street the employment growth figure for august was revised 
downward 
wall street took the news as an indication that a widely 
discussed resurgence of strong economic growth might not be taking 
place leaving the federal reserve in a position to hold off on any 
further tightening of credit 
interest rates fell in the credit markets prices of longterm 
government bonds rose by about 15 for each 1000 in face value 
putting their yields as low as 88 percent

usa petroleum can sue the atlantic 
richfield co for allegedly conspiring with retail service stations 
to fix prices at belowmarket levels a federal court ruled friday 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals reversed a district court 
ruling that dismissed usas lawsuit because the independent 
gasoline marketer failed to prove antitrust injury 
in its lawsuit usa said more than a dozen large independent 
gasoline companies have sold out liquidated or drastically 
curtailed operations and many independent retail stations have 
closed as a result of arco pricefixing that involved discontinuing 
credit cards and offering lower gas prices 
usa a direct competitor of arco at the retail level also said 
that it has suffered financial losses because of the pricefixing 
and is being driven out of the market as a result 
arco contended usas alleged harm was not an antitrust injury 
because it resulted only from nonpredatory verticle price 
competition 
but the appeals court disagreed 
in the present case plaintiffs injuries result directly from 
pricing practices that defendants admit for the purpose of this 
appeal are forbidden by the antitrust laws and are therefore 
illegal the circuit court said in its 21 decision 
the court rejected arcos argument that usas injuries resulted 
from increased rather than decreased competition 
the removal of some elements of price competition distorts the 
markets and harms all the participants those retailers which have 
lost their ability to set prices the other retailers in the same 
market who are harmed by the distorted market and the consumers 
said the decision written by judge stephen reinhardt 
even if we were to analyze the question at the more specific 
level of maximum resale price fixing given the longterm 
consequences of that practice we would reach the same result for 
similar reasons the opinion said 
judge arthur alarcon dissented and said usa failed to show it 
was hurt by antitrust practices 
he said the essence of usas claim is that one of the major 
oil companies arco intruded upon the independent retailers 
market niche by underpricing the independent retailers the result 
is lower prices to consumers but less profit for usa 
alarcon concluded that the majority decision ignores the fact 
that consumers are not injured by maximum vertical pricefixing 
and retail competitors are not injured and cannot complain about 
minimum verticle price fixing

chemical may be its middle name but dow 
chemical co is thinking of dropping the word to reflect the 
increasing breadth of its business a company official said friday 
a consultant and a small study group at dow are reviewing the 
idea but have reached no conclusions said tom henderson manager 
of public communications 
henderson said if there is a change it will be to show that 
dows business has expanded beyond basic chemicals to include 
products as diverse as insulation and household goods such as food 
wrap and bathroom cleaner 
the move would follow a trend of several years at dow said mary 
oneill chemical industry analyst at duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
their strategy over the last seven years has been focused on 
diversifying out of commodity chemicals to help lure investors 
wary of the cyclical nature of the basic chemical industry oneill 
said 
they want to show that they are not cyclical theyre 
diversified she said 
dow sales comprise about 55 percent basic chemicals and 45 
percent specialty goods such as its styrofoam building insulation 
and its household products oneill said 
chemical is part of the name but to describe the business 
henderson said the word doesnt do anybody much good these days 
we are trying to tell the public that we are more than just a 
chemical company 
henderson said no recommendations have been made to top 
management if we make a change its going to be months and 
months away he said

the kroger co on friday rejected two buyout 
proposals by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and reaffirmed its 
intent to go ahead with a 46 billion corporate restructuring plan 
the realignment prompted the firing of 300 headquarters 
employees announced thursday 
the supermarket giant said its board of directors unanimously 
rejected both of the latest unsolicited proposals made by the new 
york citybased kohlberg kravis in an oct 4 letter to kroger 
in new york spokeswoman ruth pachman said kohlberg kravis had 
no comment on krogers response 
kohlbergs more lucrative buyout offer of 503 billion or 
64pershare represented a sweetened offer from a 
5850pershare pitch kkr made after entering the bidding last 
month 
dart group inc of landover md started the bidding sept 19 
with a 432 billion 55pershare offer dart has not made 
another buyout offer 
kroger chairman lyle everingham said the board again decided 
that krogers restructuring is preferable to selling the company 
because it gives shareholders immediate cash dividends along with 
equity in a continuing company although it would be smaller and 
more highly leveraged as envisioned the restructuring would leave 
kroger independent and publicly owned 
our program will permit shareholders to realize substantial 
immediate values on their common stock while retaining the 
controlling equity interest in a company with a bright future 
everingham said 
kroger shareholders have filed at least four lawsuits 
challenging managements decision not to sell kroger 
kohlberg kravis latest proposals included the 503 billion 
buyout offer and a separate proposal to buy kroger even after it 
completes the restructuring kroger has said its restructuring 
would require the layoffs announced thursday and selling some real 
estate supermarkets and convenience stores as well as 
distribution and foodprocessing centers 
krogers board concluded that both these latest kkr proposals 
were inadequate and not in the best interests of the company its 
shareholders and other constituents kroger said in a statement 
in making its determination krogers board considered various 
factors including the opinion of the companys financial adviser 
goldman sachs amp co that both kkr proposals are inadequate 
the kroger board said it also was concerned about possible 
regulatory antitrust problems and whether kohlberg kravis could 
obtain the necessary financing kohlberg kravis owns other food 
retailing companies including stop amp shop cos safeway stores and 
beatrice cos 
kroger said thursdays mass firing which gives employees up to 
nine months salary and other benefits for up to a year will save 
the company at least 13 million annually the firing does not 
affect supermarket employees 
some analysts say krogers staff reductions which leave 500 
employees at it headquarters still isnt likely to discourage 
takeoverminded outsiders 
this is throwing bleeding hunks of meat over the bow of the 
boat hoping the shark will slow down said ryan mathews senior 
associate editor of grocery marketing a trade publication the 
shark wants a whole dinner not just an appetizer

soybean futures prices plunged for the second consecutive day 
friday at the chicago board of trade pressured by a lack of export 
business expectations of higher government crop estimates and good 
harvesting weather 
in other markets wheat prices rallied corn prices dipped 
cocoa prices surged oil prices advanced gold declined silver 
prices were higher cattle and hog prices were mixed and frozen 
pork bellies were sharply lower 
anticipation that updated us department of agriculture 
estimates to be released next wednesday will show higher soybean 
harvest yields helped trigger the selloff in beans said analyst 
joel karlin of research department inc in chicago 
the november contract fell 22 cents and settled at 790 a 
bushel the lowest level since late july 
the negative sentiment spilled over into the corn pit sparking 
a selling wave that kept prices down analysts said wheat prices 
rallied on ongoing expectations that china and the soviet union 
plan big purchases 
good harvesting weather forecast for the weekend also added a 
negative tone to corn and soybean prices analysts said 
wheat settled unchanged to 1 cents higher with december at 
434 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with december at 
294 a bushel oats were cent to 3 cents lower with december 
at 244 a bushel and soybeans were 7 cents to 22 cents lower 
with november at 790 a bushel 
cocoa prices advanced at the coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange in 
new york on the ivory coasts announcement that it will not cut the 
price it pays cocoa farmers 
the news thursday from the worlds largest cocoa producer 
indicates that the ivory coast likely will try to keep prices 
very highly valued into the season said analyst sandra kaul of 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
cocoa prices settled 18 to 39 higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 1278 a ton 
the rally in oil prices after a weeklong slide was due mostly 
to technical factors as traders squared their positions before the 
weekend analysts said 
but overproduction which has sparked strong declines in recent 
days remained the underlying influence on the market they said 
crude oil was 25 cents to 28 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in november at 1294 a barrel heating oil was 22 cent 
to 57 cent higher with november at 3746 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 21 cent to 80 cent higher with november at 4013 
cents a gallon 
trading was quiet in the gold and silver pits at the new york 
commodity exchange where stronger oil prices and a softer us 
dollar encouraged some buying but gains were offset by strong 
treasury bond prices analysts said 
gold prices settled 60 cents to 180 lower with the october 
contract at 40320 a troy ounce silver was 25 cents to 37 cents 
higher with october at 6325 a troy ounce 
light boxedbeef sales kept the lid on live cattle prices at the 
chicago mercantile exchange while cheaper corn prices buoyed 
feeder cattle prices said tom morgan president of sterling 
research corp in arlington heights ill 
pork belly prices were down on mostly technical factors and the 
negative sentiment spilled over into the hog pit he said 
live cattled settled 15 cent lower to 05 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in october at 7232 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 20 cent to 55 cent higher with october at 8230

departments release of september unemployment figures 
gold prices were little changed republic national bank of new 
york quoted a late bid of 40330 for a troy ounce of gold down 20 
cents from late thursdays 40350 
analysts said the dollar fell after the government report which 
included news that the nations nonfarm payroll grew by 255000 
jobs last month the labor department said the unemployment rate 
fell 02 percent to 54 percent 
foreign exchange traders had expected a payroll increase of 
about 300000 so the labor departments numbers came as a 
disappointment 
investors interpreted the payroll figures as a sign of weakness 
in the economy but after further consideration they realized 
the economy is growing steadily said peter frick foreign 
exchange economist at union bank of switzerland in new york 
in addition dollar traders seeing the stock and bond markets 
improve on the unemployment data were heartened by the demand for 
us investments said ronald holzer chief dealer with harris

earlier 
dealers expected mondays columbus day bank holiday in new york 
and a holiday in japan to produce quiet trading early next week

americans took out consumer credit at an 
annual rate of 101 percent in august up substantially from the 
july borrowing pace the government reported friday 
the federal reserve said consumers took out 544 billion more 
in credit than they paid off in august as auto loans and credit 
card debt grew more rapidly 
consumer debt had risen 362 billion in july a 67 percent 
annual rate as the pace of borrowing slowed momentarily following 
several months of rapid gains 
in august auto loans grew by 229 billion a 97 percent rate 
of increase following a 47 percent pace in july 
michael penzer an economist with bank of america in san 
francisco said the august increase was somewhat higher than many 
economists had been looking for and in part represented a reaction 
to the sluggish july increase 
penzer noted that consumer debt has risen by 9 percent in the 
last 12 months while personal incomes have gone up by 75 percent 
annual rate indicating that americans were still willing to take 
debt at a faster pace than their incomes were rising 
even though a lot of private economists are looking for 
consumers to moderate their spending this report doesnt suggest 
they are doing that he said anybody looking for a slowdown in 
the economy in the second half of the year wont find it in these 
numbers 
the federal reserve began a series of credittightening steps in 
late march in an effort to dampen demand and cool off inflationary 
pressures many analysts believe the central bank will resume 
pushing interest rates higher after the nov 8 election 
the category that includes credit card debt rose by 262 
billion in august a hefty 18 percent annual rate of gain 
following a sizable 212 billion rise in july 
together the gains in auto and credit card debt accounted for 
90 percent of the overall rise in consumer borrowing 
the category that includes bank and credit union loans not 
secured by real estate rose by 498 million a 36 percent rate of 
increase while loans for mobile homes rose 30 million a 14 
percent annual rate 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 65343 billion 
up 92 percent from a year earlier

bond prices surged friday bolstered by a 
government report showing a smallerthanexpected rise in payroll 
employment in september 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped about 1 1116 
points or 1687 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves in the opposite direction from price and is an indicator of 
interest rate trends tumbled to 879 percent from 894 percent 
late thursday 
the labor department reported that the september unemployment 
rate fell 02 percentage point to 54 percent but the bond market 
was more intent on a companion report that said payrolls grew by 
255000 jobs slightly below the 300000 that many analysts had 
expected 
the figures were considered fresh evidence of moderation in the 
economy 
basically they were good for the market said kevin 
flanagan a moneymarket economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
he said the report touched off a buying wave that was sort of 
like a snowball effect 
steven a wood moneymarket economist for bankamerica capital 
markets group said the data provided further evidence that the 
economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the 
first half of the year 
payroll employment had been growing at a pace of about 340000 a 
month in the first six months of the year but that has slowed to 
an average of just over 200000 in each of the past three months 
a slower economy means credit demands may abate somewhat easing 
upward pressure on interest rates it also would reduce 
inflationary pressures which erode bond values 
in the secondary market prices of shortterm treasury issues 
rose to between 932 point and 916 point intermediate maturities 
advanced between 1116 point and a full point and 20year issues 
gained 1 316 point according to figures provided by telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton composite treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer jumped 792 to 115553

an outboardmotor manufacturer has agreed to 
finance a 20 million cleanup of pcbs in lake michigans waukegan 
harbor effectively ending years of bitter haggling over the 
superfund site state and federal officials announced friday 
under a consent decree signed by outboard marine corp and 
federal and state officials thousands of pounds of toxic 
polychlorinated biphenyls will be removed treated and safely 
stored illinois attorney general neil hartigan said 
this is a major environmental victory hartigan said noting 
that no taxpayer dollars will be used in the cleanup i think 
its a sensational day 
waukegan harbor an important great lakes port at waukegan 25 
miles north of chicago has been listed on the federal superfund 
list of environmental hazards and at one time was considered 
illinois worst pollution problem 
public health officials have advised against eating fish from 
the harbor pcbs have been shown to cause tumors in laboratory 
animals and are suspected to cause cancer in humans 
we obviously believe that its time to get this matter 
resolved said company spokesman laurin baker in a telephone 
interview from omcs waukegan headquarters 
while acknowledging it is hard to be happy over spending 20 
million in company assets he said the decree is the best 
settlement possible 
contamination of the harbor began in 1961 when hydraulic fluid 
containing pcbs leaked from the hydraulic systems at the companys 
waukegan plant into waste waters which were dumped into lake 
michigan and onto outboard marine property 
the case became entangled in the legal system as company 
officials first argued pcbs posed no threat to humans then barred 
from their facilities federal environmental officials seeking to 
determine how bad the pollution was said us environmental 
protection agency spokesman john perrecone 
after 1986 changes in federal superfund law allowed the epa such 
access the company agreed to negotiate with state and federal 
authorities perrecone said 
under terms of fridays consent decree outboard marine will 
begin cleaning up the pcbs next spring and should complete the task 
by 1992 the company will remove and treat contaminated material 
from both the harbor and its property 
the agreement called for us to remove and treat sediments and 
soils that have the highest levels of contamination and encapsulate 
the remaining lowlevel soils and sediments in three areas baker 
said 
outboard marine is a 13 billion manufacturer of recreational 
marine products and other recreational materials

friday to settle most of the legal battle over the amount the oil 
company owes in state income taxes for 1978 through 1981 the state 
revenue department announced 
los angelesbased arco and the department resolved 14 major

issues involving a potential tax liability of 573 million weller

pipeline system and a dispute over how federal entitlement 
regulations are to be applied under the states oil and gas 
corporate income tax weller said 
arcos 1988 profits will not be affected by the settlement 
because the companys financial reserves are sufficient to cover 
the issues in dispute the news release said

settlement avoided a costly and protracted legal fight 
the agreement reached with the state of alaska is a reasonable 
resolution of complex and difficult issues wade said

dispute she said this settlement reflects a reasonble 
assessment of what we would have recovered and serves the best

us district judge robert g doumar who 
was told by the justice department he illegally sentenced a 
pepsicola bottling company to prison for price fixing refused 
friday to reconsider his sentence 
in a sixpage opinion doumar said he derived his sentence 
against allegheny pepsicola bottling co from the basic 
principle that to the extent possible the law treats all persons 
whether natural or corporate equally 
any other treatment would belie that basic principle and 
create a special class of persons which this court is unwilling to 
foster he wrote 
in a sept 30 letter the justice department asked doumar to 
reconsider his novel sentence because prosecutors would be unable 
to defend the sentence on appeal 
last month doumar sentenced allegheny to three years in prison 
and fined the company 1 million for fixing its soft drink prices 
in collusion with midatlantic cocacola bottling co the scheme 
cost customers in norfolk richmond and baltimore more than 10 
million 
doumar warned attorneys and executives of the pepsi bottler that 
the corporation was treated as an individual under the law and he 
would not hesitate to have federal marshals shut down the plant 
he then suspended the sentence and 50000 of the fine on the 
condition that the company provide four highranking executives to 
perform one year each of fulltime free community service in each 
of the three cities victimized 
doumar said a 1 million fine the maximum penalty for antitrust 
violations was no deterrent since the scheme netted the company 
more than 10 million its just considered a cost of doing 
business he said 
david c jordan a justice department attorney who prosecuted 
the case agreed with doumars reasoning but said in his letter 
the sherman antitrust law allows only the imprisonment of 
executives not corporations 
we are not persuaded that congress intended to authorize 
courts to imprison corporations jordan wrote indeed 
imprisoning a corporation by having a marshal seize its assets or 
otherwise limit its operations could adversely affect competition 
and further injure consumers 
in response doumar said this court cannot ascribe to 
congress an intent to incur the costs asociated with effectively 
enforcing the sherman act when violated by individuals but not when 
violated by corporations 
when told of doumars opinion james h walsh defense attorney 
for alleghany said he would proceed with his appeal to the 4th 
us circuit court of appeals and use the justice department letter 
to bolster his case 
i certainly would hope that the letter is beneficial he 
said 
midatlantic and allegheny conspired to set prices from 1982 to 
1984 wholesale prices were inflated 25 percent and the cost was 
passed on to consumers according to court records 
midatlantic pleaded guilty to the charge and paid fines of 1 
million in both richmond and washington dc six top officials of 
the two companies received fines and prison terms 
the justice department has said 14 grand juries in 12 states are 
continuing their investigation of price fixing in the soft drink 
industry

freight companies hauling iron ore coal and 
other heavy cargo through the great lakes say the summer drought 
pulled the plug on their shipping season by lowering water levels 
but a us army corps of engineers official said friday the 
firms shouldnt blame the hot weather for failing to keep up with 
heavy demands 
the clevelandbased lake carriers association will ask the 
corps to give them an extra month to haul cargo through locks at 
sault ste marie in michigans upper peninsula 
the four locks which link lake superior to lake michigan and 
the industrylined st lawrence seaway normally close from dec 
15 until april 1 when ice clogs the lakes 
shipping giants such as american steamship co say evaporation 
from the drought lowered water levels forcing ships to lighten 
their cargoes they want to use the sault ste marie locks until at 
least jan 15 lake carriers association spokesman glen nekvasil 
said friday 
the extension would give american steamship and the groups 13 
other shipping firms time to make extra trips and catch up with an 
increasing demand for raw materials nekvasil said 
fleets have been hard pressed to meet current demand he 
said adding that increased steel production has boosted 1988 
shipments by more than 13 percent 
freight companies may need more time to keep pace with 
shipments but they shouldnt blame the drought for their problems 
corps spokesman donald billmaier said 
i dont think they hurt much from the drought i just think 
theyve got more business said billmaier chief of operations 
and maintenance for the corps detroit district 
billmaier confirmed that water levels have dropped over the past 
year but said shipping companies compensated earlier by hauling 
heavier loads when the water was deeper 
they cant haul loads as big as they could two years ago 
thats true he said maybe they cant make as much money but 
they can still work the lakes 
billmaier said the corps which controls the upper peninsula 
locks also restricts winter shipping in an effort to minimize 
environmental damage 
ships maneuvering through ice jams cause extra water turbulence 
that kills fish damages docks and shoreline and disturbs the 
bottom of the great lakes he said 
billmaier said the corps chicago bureau probably will agree to 
extend the shipping season by at least two weeks if carriers can 
prove they need the extra time he could not predict when a final 
ruling will be made

mcorp texas secondlargest bankholding company 
and the last of the states major banks to avoid seeking outside 
help said friday it is seeking a federal bailout in its proposed 
recapitalization 
the bank said it could not predict when or how much aid it would 
request 
at this time it is not possible to determine the ultimate 
likelihood amount nature or timing of any fdic federal deposit 
insurance corp assistance for any recapitalization nor is it 
possible to predict the impact of the transaction on mcorps 
stockholders and creditors the bank said in a statement 
attributed to gene h bishop chairman and chief executive officer 
and john t cater president and chief operating officer 
steve katsanos a spokesman for the fdic in washington said the 
agency would not have any comment on the matter 
our standard practice is that we dont comment on requests for 
assistance he said 
the banks thirdquarter results due out by tuesday are 
expected to show a bigger jump in nonperforming assets than the 
158 million increase posted in the second quarter according to a 
report in the wall street journal 
mcorp also said it expects to have a net loss of 525 million 
for the third period compared with a net loss of 737 million in 
the yearago quarter the company said it expects to record a 
provision for possible loan losses of about 370 million making 
its allowance for bad loans approximately 690 million 
mcorps stock had dropped a half dollar to hit a new low of 75 
cents a share tuesday but bounced back to 112 on wednesday and 
thursday fridays announcement pushed it down to 87 cents 
the request to be filed with the fdic will suggest that mcorp 
raise new capital from private investors including current 
stockholders to accompany the fdic assistance the statement said 
mcorp continues to maintain adequate funding to meet the needs 
of its customers even though the recent economic challenges in our 
region have put enormous pressures on our situation bishop said 
we believe that an early resolution by the fdic of our assistance 
proposal will be the most costeffective alternative for the fdic 
mcorp has 26 banks and 86 banking offices throughout the state 
the company had assets of 201 billion as of june 30 total 
deposits were 161 billion and total loans were 122 billion 36 
percent of that in real estate loans 
it was the only major texas bank not to have resorted to a 
federal bailout or purchase by an outofstate banking company 
earlier this year dallasbased first republicbank corp the 
states largest bankholding company sought federal assistance and 
ultimately was acquired by ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
houstonbased first city bancorporation of texas was rescued by the 
fdic and chicago banker a robert abboud 
a federal review of mcorps loan portfolio is expected to be 
made public soon observers have been saying the review by us 
comptroller of the currency examiners will force mcorp to 
significantly increase reserves for loan losses in the third 
quarter 
j michael shepherd a senior deputy comptroller said the 
report is complete but he has declined to elaborate on its 
findings 
the journal reported that the governments examination 
discovered worsethanexpected weakness in mcorps loan portfolio 
quoting unidentified regulators and officials close to the 
company the journal said the review apparently had turned up more 
shaky real estate and commercial loans 
mcorps thirdquarter financial results are expected to show a 
bigger jump in nonperforming assets than the 158 million increase 
it posted in the second quarter the newspaper said 
mcorp was formed in october 1984 by the merger of mercantile 
texas corp of dallas and southwest bancshares inc of houston 
mcorp had 69 member banks and total assets of 20 billion 
since its formation it raised 247 million of private capital 
in 1985 has raised 653 million in cash and securities through the 
sale of its mnet and mtech subsidiaries and has cut costs 
mcorp ranked 35th among the nations largest banking 
organizations in terms of total assets on june 30

advanced micro devices inc said it 
earned 71 million in the third quarter in contrast to a loss of 
70 million in the same period a year earlier 
however results were not as strong as in this years second 
quarter when the company made 261 million 
revenue in the third quarter was 2855 million up from 261 
million a year earlier but down from 308 million in this years 
second quarter 
chairman and chief executive officer wj sanders iii blamed the 
decline from the spring figures on a drop in orders for 
microprocessors from personal computer manufacturers he predicted 
a continued slump 
we believe that a period of digestion of component inventories 
on the part of our customers will keep a lid on new orders and 
hence our sales growth for the next several quarters sanders 
continued 
amd announced it will continue with plans to close its oldest 
operating silicon wafer factory in december and reduce its 
workforce in malaysia and the philippines by 1400 the company 
said it plans to take a charge against fourthquarter earnings as a 
result of those plans

technical market problems incited the panic last 
october on wall street not nervousness about the economy the head 
of the new york stock exchange said in defending proposed trading 
halts to escape another crisis 
in a friday interview with reporters to assess what has happened 
since the crisis nearly a year ago john phelan conceded the 
circuit breakers proposal for coordinated trading halts with 
other exchanges is an artificial restraint on the freetrading 
system which he dislikes in theory 
i think all of us in general dont like to shut markets down 
because it ruins liquidity the chairman of the biggest us 
securities market said but there are a few points in time when 
you need to shut it down 
the nyse and the chicago mercantile exchange jointly proposed 
the circuit breaker plan in july the proposal under review by 
federal regulatory agencies and contingent on approval by other 
exchanges calls for a oneyear test in which predetermined price 
drops would trigger temporary trading halts 
nyse trading would stop for an hour if the dow jones industrial 
average fell 250 points and for two hours if the average fell an 
additional 150 points the same day 
at the chicago exchange the nations largest futures market 
trading would stop for an hour if the standard amp poors 500 stock 
index futures contract fell 30 points and for two hours if it fell 
a further 20 points the same day the new york and chicago markets 
would coordinate the exact timing of the halts 
it was frantic selling of large amounts of stock in new york 
coupled with plunging stockindex futures in chicago that were 
scrutinized as important catalysts in the oct 1920 panic 
lack of coordination between the two trading centers increased 
the panic because investors had no idea what prices should be this 
market alienation was singled out as an important weakness by 
government investigations 
in the months since phelan said it has become clear that the 
crash was caused by technical reasons within the market and not 
because of fundamental shifts in the economy 
while he said the chances of a similar rout seemed more remote 
now at some point in time well go off through a fundamental 
shift in the economy and so then if it the dow average does go 
down 250 points theres no guarantee that its not going to go 
down another 500 points 
under the circuitbreaker remedy he said if you take it down 
in steps so that everybody knows what its doing youre probably 
better socially and politically to do it that way than to just let 
it go through its extremes and then find its equilibrium 
critics of the circuitbreaker strategy say it could drive 
investors overseas to less restrictive markets moreover they say 
it could hasten a market panic if investors decide to sell their 
stocks at the same time hoping to get out of the market before a 
trading halt takes effect 
phelan and other defenders of the proposal argue that such halts 
can have a calming effect on the market giving everybody an 
opportunity to think rationally rather than sell in a blind panic 
anyway i think its worth a try phelan said hopefully 
you dont have to use it very much

the latest government report on the unemployment picture has 
drawn raves on wall street 
the nations jobless rate fell to 54 percent in september 
nearing its lowest point since the early 1970s but that wasnt the 
good news for investors 
rather stockholders and bondholders were encouraged that 
details of th report indicated the economy and employment are 
growing more slowly than expected toostrong growth raises fears 
of inflation 
the jobless rates decline from 56 percent in august left it at 
the same level as july and only one tick above the 14yearlow of 
53 percent in june when many people feared the economy was 
growing too quickly 
however there were other signs that the economys growth was 
not so fast the total number of factory jobs was down by 37000 
out of the total of 255000 new jobs overall more than 100000 
were teachers returning to the classroom 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 4250 points to 
215025 on friday falling only a few points short of the 1988 
closing high of 215861 it reached on july 5 
if you were republican nominee george bush i dont think 
you could have written a better set of numbers said david wyss 
chief financial economist for data resources inc in lexington 
mass 
the jobless report also helped the bond market friday which is 
highly sensitive to inflation the treasurys closely watched 
30year bond jumped about 1 1116 points or 1687 for every 
1000 in face value its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction from price and is an indicator of interest rate trends 
tumbled to 879 percent from 894 percent late thursday 
the dollar finished the day slightly lower 
steven a wood moneymarket economist for bankamerica capital 
markets group said the data provided further evidence that the 
economy is slowing down from the robust pace of expansion in the 
first half of the year 
in another report friday the nations business leaders 
enjoying high profits from the strongest economic growth in four 
years predicted a slowdown in 1989 
executives ranging from citicorp chairman john s reed to 
general motors corp chairman roger b smith said their industries 
are generating very strong earnings 
nevertheless members of the business council composed of 62 
chief executives of large us corporations said they would prefer 
less robust growth and a soft landing next year to the 
alternative higher inflation rising interest rates and finally a 
recession or a hard landing 
one reason for the drop in the jobless rate is that there were 
fewer people in the labor force said mishel an economist of the 
economic policy institute a liberal think tank financed largely by 
labor unions 
the whole reason why reagan has been able to achieve low 
unemployment rates is that the population growth slowed by a third 
in the 1980s mishel said 
president carter had the baby boom coming into the labor 
market and had to create a lot more jobs reagan has enjoyed the 
effects of the baby bust

oil futures prices have risen in what analysts 
said was a technical rally inspired by the expiration of november 
options and efforts to square trading positions before the weekend 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate rose 28 cents friday to settle at 1294 a 
barrel 
among refined products traded on the exchange the november 
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 063 cent to settle 
at 4013 cents a gallon while home heating oil rose 022 cent to 
3746 cents a gallon 
prices moved erratically in a narrow range during the day said 
william byers of the oil futures research department at bear 
stearns amp co 
but he said shortcovering in which traders who have sold 
borrowed contracts buy contracts to square their positions drove 
prices higher 
richard redoglia vice president at merrill lynch energy 
futures said there was also some buying connected with the 
expiration of november options 
the pressure on the market is still there overproduction is 
still there he said 
earlier in the week crude oil prices tumbled below 13 a barrel 
to their lowest level in two years as saudi arabia the worlds 
largest oil exporter threatened to produce more than its quota if 
other members of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries continued to pump beyond their quotas 
the saudis have indicated they want to punish other opec members 
for overproducing and driving down the price of oil
