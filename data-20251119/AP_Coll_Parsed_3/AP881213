a woman who forcefed her 4yearold daughter a 
fatal dose of salt as punishment was convicted of seconddegree 
murder tuesday but a charge against the father was dismissed 
this child died of salt poisoning commonwealths attorney 
skip burkart said were talking about a massive amount of salt 
this child was forced to eat 
roanoke county circuit judge kenneth trabue found beth michelle 
riggs 36 guilty in the may 17 death of her daughter heather 
after accepting a plea agreement mrs riggs had agreed to plead no 
contest to the murder charge and guilty to involuntary manslaughter 
with the understanding she would be convicted on only one of the 
charges 
the judge found her guilty of the murder charge but threw out 
charges of murder and willful child neglect against the father jack 
francis riggs 39 after finding there was no evidence he 
participated in the fatal punishment 
mrs riggs who wept at times throughout the daylong hearing 
embraced her husband briefly before deputies led her to jail 
trabue set sentencing for february she faces up to 20 years in 
prison 
the prosecutor said the couple routinely kept heather a 
colombian child they had adopted locked in her room while they were 
gone during the day to keep her from eating sweets 
on may 16 one of the girls four brothers told his mother that 
heather had eaten sugar burkart said mrs riggs took the bowl 
dumped salt in it and forcefed her daughter up to 20 spoonfuls of 
salt as punishment he said 
after the girl began vomiting mrs riggs ordered her to clean up 
the mess the prosecutor said 
the girl was taken to a hospital in a coma and died the next day 
burkhart said mrs riggs failed to tell doctors how much salt the 
girl had ingested and doctors testified they did not treat the case 
as a poisoning 
defense attorney james swanson argued for an involuntary 
manslaughter conviction which would have carried up to 10 years in 
prison by saying mrs riggs never intended to harm her daughter 
were dealing with table salt he said were dealing with 
a substance available on every table in this country she had no 
idea of the lethal effect 
the prosecutor said riggs probably will regain custody of the 
couples four sons who have been living with their grandparents 
authorities got their initial clues about the saltpoisoning from 
statements the boys made to their schoolteachers

the late gwendolyn cafritz philanthropist and 
famed washington partygiver reportedly has asked in her will that 
her landmark home become the secretary of states official residence 
the washington post reported in wednesdays editions that the 
request was confirmed by former secretary of state william rogers 
an executor of mrs cafritzs will and by martin atlas executive 
vice president of the morris and gwendolyn d cafritz foundation 
mrs cafritz died nov 29 at age 78 and her husband died in 1964 
a december 1987 appropriations bill for the state department 
prohibits the federal agency from acquiring an official residence 
for the secretary of state 
however secretary of state george shultz has said repeatedly 
that an official residence should be established for the secretary 
of state because of the security requirements for protecting the 
secretary as well as foreign guests 
shultz has said the government could save money by establishing 
an official secretarys house because the department has estimated 
it costs 500000 to make each private house secure for the 
secretary 
the post reported that mrs cafritz left her 14608squarefoot 
1938 art moderne house and its property to the cafritz foundation 
which is charged with carrying out her wishes 
rogers was quoted as saying that if the house cannot be used for 
the secretary of state mrs cafritz had suggested it could be used 
as an annex to blair house for visiting heads of state or for art 
scholars 
mrs cafritz was known for decades as one of washingtons premier 
partygivers hosting lavish gatherings for guests ranging from the 
duke and duchess of windsor to supreme court justices

italys hottest anchorwoman hikes her skirt on the 
evening news gets sozzled on champagne from male admirers and 
before signing off invites men to call her on a special line 
it happens in a television spoof of television written and 
directed by women but real life is getting closer one of the women 
news readers now on state television has become the subject of 
magazine articles and according to a survey highly popular among 
male viewers 
when you feel secure you can poke fun at yourself said 
serena dandini one of three authors of the new weekly show tivu 
delle ragazze the girls television 
an increasing number of prime time newscasts feature women and 
italian women are becoming prominent in many other fields once 
closed to them 
women drive romes orangecolored buses in bumpertobumper 
traffic ever more frequently directed by female traffic officers 
policewomen wave automatic rifles out the windows of squad cars 
as they escort ministers and dignitaries until 1981 the national 
police force assigned women only to cases involving prostitution or 
children 
sunday afternoon soccer that ultimate male bastion now has a 
woman as one of the playbyplay radio commentators the games are 
not televised live 
when the first woman justice was named to the supreme court in 
september she was asked what it meant to enter a world previously 
reserved for men 
it signifies that women are present that theyre doing their 
job maria gabriella luccioli said she began her judicial career 
in 1963 when women were permitted to become magistrates 
marisa occhionero a rome university sociologist who has done 
studies for the government on the future of women said the movement 
into top positions is increasing and remains merely a question of 
time 
professors at universities engineers businesswomen 
architects she enumerated theyre not content to stay in civil 
service jobs the woman is changing she has changed its the man 
who hasnt changed 
women in fields ranging from politics to banking echoed her 
comment in interviews they reported tremendous gains at work but 
much less success in persuading men to help mind the house and 
children 
a survey of city families with both spouses working found the men 
put in an average of 35 hours a week at such chores as home repairs 
and cleaning the car while women did 3335 hours of housework 
carole beebe tarantelli an american who serves in the 
parliament said changing sex roles are difficult for an italian man 
whose mother would respond to every whim 
newly married italian men often are dismayed to discover that 
their wives working or not will not iron their underwear like 
their mothers did 
the italian womans struggle is especially hard because of 
the importance placed on the family and the concept of the mother as 
its pillar ms occhionero said 
it often is difficult to run an italian family given the 
structure of italian society especially for working mothers 
mrs tarantelli a mother noted that public schools dont have 
team sports or other extracurricular activities that means 
babysitters for children who finish classes at 1 pm five or six 
hours before parents finish work 
stores close three hours for lunch and only a few stay open past 
8 pm in the tuscan hilltown of arezzo complaints by factory 
workers that the only day care center shut down before the factory 
did prompted the town to open another with more suitable hours 
gioia longo a cultural anthropologist who founded a hotline for 
abused women said a survey she did of 700 teenagers in an adriatic 
resort town indicated girls see no limits on possible achievement 
but boys are confused about their changing roles 
ms occhionero said stereotypical latin males are afraid of 
these women they want to protect them but dont understand to what 
point and they are threatened 
stefania zappanico a journalist in her 20s says many women 
dont help their cause 
italian women are still different from northern european or 
american women said ms zappanico who has spent time in britain 
and the united states theyre not mentally independent even 
women who work think they have to depend on men they dont value 
independence that much in itself 
in a nationwide study of womens lot in the 1870s the first 
years of a unified italy an official in bari said an ass an ox 
a sheep are always worth more than a wife to the peasant and the 
wife obeys her husband like a slave 
a simple rendezvous could get a wife convicted of adultery a 
brief generation ago but a husband could be prosecuted only if he 
brought his lover to live in the house a 1969 supreme court 
decision led to adultery being abolished as a crime for either sex 
birth control pills were legalized in the early 1970s and 
abortion in 1978 
children of an italian man who marries a foreigner always have 
qualified for citizenship automatically but those of a woman in the 
same situation did not qualify until 1984 
dictator benito mussolini thought a womans place was home making 
babies but some historians feel his policy of getting women out of 
the workplace helped them in the long run because many enrolled in 
universities when they could not get jobs 
as more and more italian women enter politics their issues are 
certain to get more attention ms occhionero said women are ever 
more present in the field but still scarce in proportion to 
their effort

the writer an ap correspondent in moscow for 
four years visited the shattered town of spitak and found the 
residents had the armeniaazerbaijan dispute on their minds almost 
as much as the devastating earthquake 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
exhausted and griefstricken armenians 
who have come to help their brothers in this devastated city are 
stirred to passion when talk of their suffering touches on the 
conflict with azerbaijan 
despite the earthquake that has killed more than 50000 
armenians the simmering ethnic conflict between the neighboring 
republics appears unabated 
spitak virtually destroyed by the dec 7 quake was one of the 
cities of refuge for armenians who fled homes in azerbaijan after 
the longsuppressed dispute between christian armenians and moslem 
azerbaijanis burst into violent confrontation in february 
destruction of the refugees homes by the earthquake has fueled 
the hatred of some armenians in this mountainous backward 
heartland as well as the yearlong campaign for annexation of the 
azerbaijangoverned region of nagornokarabakh 
spitak has no means of communicating with the outside world yet 
rumors of azerbaijani callousness in the wake of the disaster have 
spread among the dispirited salvage workers and volunteers 
the azerbaijanis living in armenia have been feasting and 
celebrating for two days said edik boganyan driving his shovel 
deeper into the powdery rubble of former housing with an impassioned 
kick they are rejoicing in our suffering 
the armenianazerbaijani conflict boiled to the surface of 
conversation among a dozen armenian villagers who spoke with a 
reporter as they picked away at the piles of concrete and twisted 
metal that is all that is left of spitak other armenians working 
within earshot put down their tools and raced to add their own 
denunciations 
we have received aid from every corner of the world but not 
from azerbaijan said varchik azaryan the georgians have been 
wonderful theyve done everything possible to help us but not the 
azerbaijanis they are jubilant 
armenians in the capital of yerevan contended azerbaijanis had 
sent leaflets congratulating armenia on the occasion of its 
worstever natural disaster 
the armenian claims about the azerbaijanis could not be 
confirmed but they were spreading and infuriating the 
earthquakestricken populace 
yerevan activists over the weekend staged demonstrations pressing 
for reunification with nagornokarabakh resulting in five arrests 
and denunciations from top kremlin officials 
this is a present from soviet president mikhail gorbachev on 
our day of mourning activist rafael popoyan said of the 
denunciations reflecting a growing antikremlin sentiment among 
armenians over nagornokarabakh 
mayor arzumanyan fled to spitak from the azerbaijani port of 
sumgait in march after extremists rampaged feb 28 killing 26 
armenians in the industrial city 
i brought my family here after the riots because we couldnt 
live there anymore arzumanyan said standing amid the ruined 
apartment he moved into only a month ago 
the armenians are the friendliest and most peaceloving people 
in the world and better relations with the azerbaijanis is not up 
to us its up to them he said i dont expect much to change 
because of this tragedy 
such outbursts have angered the kremlin which sees continued 
attention on the ethnic dispute as unpatriotic singlemindedness 
that cannot be tolerated in a time of crisis 
we have to constantly put out fires these people are 
starting soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said monday 
denouncing nationalist activity in yerevan 
while many russians and other soviets likely share the official 
view their reaction illustrates a broad lack of understanding of 
what drives the armenianazerbaijani confrontation 
the battle for nagornokarabakh is not seen by armenians as a 
nationalist action or a divergence from the tenuous unity that holds 
the 15 republics and 100 peoples of the soviet union together 
rather they view reunification as an imperative for ethnic and 
social justice 
nagornokarabakh enclosed by azerbaijani territory was part of 
armenia until 1923 when the kremlin gave it to azerbaijan when the 
latter became a republic within the soviet union 
armenians have complained since josef stalins death in 1953 that 
azerbaijani authorities discriminate against the armenian majority 
by closing churches armenianlanguage schools libraries and 
cultural centers 
the issue has heated up as the influx of azerbaijani workers to 
nagornokarabakh reduced the armenian majority from 95 percent to 
less than 75 percent 
growing fears the region would be lost to the armenian motherland 
forever and new opportunities for public activism opened by glasnost 
unleashed longstifled hostilities this year in a broad campaign to 
reclaim nagornokarabakh for armenia 
the sentiments expressed by those leading protests in yerevan run 
even deeper in distant regions like spitak where armenian refugees 
from azerbaijan had sought and found solidarity 
armenians place their tragedies on equal rungs when speaking of 
recovering from the earthquake armenians often mention the 1915 
turkish massacre of 15 million armenians and the loss of 
nagornokarabakh 65 years ago as examples of their tragic history 
recovery from the earthquake will be carried out with stubborn 
resolve reunification with armenians in nagornokarabakh will 
continue to be a goal 
some armenians like lev akopian take a pragmatic view of the 
conflict and call for unity for the sake of survival 
what is this lunacy of killing each other dont we have enough 
problems the armenian who makes his home in the georgian capital 
of tbilisi asked with frustration 
yasmina akupyan a yerevan linguist helping foreign rescuers in 
spitak said some of her countrymen will see the earthquake as a 
sign from god that the violence must stop weve been fighting for 
nine months weve had all these problems and maybe now they will 
be resolved with one tragic blow 
but the lesseducated and more strident armenians in the 
underdeveloped regions of armenia see continued conflict 
artur tovmasyan blamed the azerbaijanis for the deaths of 
armenians who sought refuge in spitak from the ethnic clash 
they were forced out of azerbaijan they didnt leave of their 
own free will he said gesturing to piles of concrete where some 
refugees were believed to have been buried by the quake look what 
has happened to them we will never get along with the 
azerbaijanis

county grand jury on state charges stemming from the feb 1 takeover 
of the robesonian newspaper in lumberton 
eddie hatcher 31 who was indicted on the same charges was 
arrested on the day the indictments were returned he has been 
released on 25000 bond 
a federal jury in october acquitted hatcher and jacobs of federal 
hostagetaking and firearms charges during the threeweek trial 
the two tuscarora indians had argued that they had no other choice 
but to take over the newspaper to save their lives 
the pair said they had evidence linking county officials and law 
enforcement officers to drug trafficking and that evidence had put 
their lives in jeopardy 
lewis pitts the founder of the christic institute south a civil 
rights law firm in carrboro nc that is representing jacobs said 
jacobs had found a job and delivering a load of arts and crafts 
material when he was stopped by the trooper 
what flashed in front of his eyes was the absolute danger 
of returning to robeson county so he decided to flee lewis said 
authorities in north carolina said jacobs will be held in the new 
york jail awaiting extradition proceedings pitts said jacobs would 
fight extradition to north carolina rather than face what he called 
blatantly badfaith prosecution

better medical care and housing more resources to help the 
disadvantaged better fishing in the chesapeake bay and a 
professional football team 
the governor also said he wouldnt mind winning the maryland

if a country needs enemies to retain its 
identity the united states could be in big trouble 
ten years have passed since the united states officially 
recognized china making this an appropriate time to dwell on a 
contemporary phenomenon americans have fewer people to loathe these 
days 
china has been transformed from the totalitarian expansionist 
yellow peril into a gang of capitalist roaders a billion 
strong who see nothing wrong with making a buck and cutting deals 
with washington 
friendship with china seems so normal these days that people have 
forgotten the shock that president carter caused on dec 15 1978 
when he announced that the united states was dropping taiwan for the 
peoples republic 
even more remarkable is the transformation in relations with the 
soviet union five years ago president reagan was engaging in his 
evil empire rhetoric about the soviets and americans were 
pouring russian vodka down the drain to protest the shooting down of 
a korean air lines passenger plane by a soviet missile 
nowadays president mikhail gorbachev gets uniformly high marks 
in us public opinion polls and americans are sending relief 
packages to earthquake victims in soviet armenia us government 
and private donations as of monday totaled 32 million 
state department spokesman charles redman said monday the 
response merely reflects the magnitude of the disaster in armenia 
but it seems improbable that a comparable level of generosity would 
have been in evidence if the tragedy had occurred in that vintage 
cold war year 1983 
who today are the men we love to hate asked charles paul 
freund of the washington post 
he recalled that georgi arbatov moscows leading us expert 
once said facetiously that the soviet show of friendship was really 
an antiamerican plot 
well deprive america of its enemy arbatov reportedly said 
forcing the united states to focus on internal problems heretofore 
american attention had been diverted by the need to contain the 
communist menace 
i dont know what we will do former cia official graham 
fuller said last week without the soviet union as a touchstone 
for third world policy 
the soviet union and china are not the only nations that have 
disappeared from the american pantheon of evildoers latin america 
for example is running low on military dictators long a favorite 
target of democrats 
even chiles military president augusto pinochet has quieted 
his myriad critics by holding a free and fair election he even had 
the decency to lose it 
in africa ugandas idi amin has been reduced to irrelevant 
exile libyas moammar gadhafi doesnt seem to arouse as much 
indignation as he did before the us air force bombed him 
remember opec hatred for that group disappeared with the gas 
lines 
the nicaraguan contras americas least favorite anticommunist 
guerrilla group have won a measure of sympathy lately as word has 
spread that they have been leading a deprived existence at pathetic 
camps along the honduran border 
to be sure there are people abroad against whom americans can 
rally ayatollah ruhollah khomeini still rules iran under a death 
to america banner and his friends in lebanon who continue to hold 
americans hostage are viewed almost universally by americans as 
perhaps the worlds least congenial people 
finally there is fidel castro who in two weeks will celebrate 
30 years of nonstop antiamericanism 
speaking before a crowd of half a million last week castro said 
the united states will never forgive cuba for the revolution it 
has carried out 
not only did it aggravate the pride of the empire castro 
said it also delivered a profound wound to its imperial 
interests 
castro is one adversary who wont let down americans who have a 
psychic need for a foreign devil whether real or imagined he 
hasnt changed in three decades and next month george bush will 
become the eighth american president with whom castro has been 
unable to get along

interest rates which have been rising since 
the election will be headed still higher in the months ahead as the 
federal reserve steps up its inflationfighting efforts many 
economists believe 
these analysts are predicting rising mortgage rates and another 
boost in banks prime lending rate the benchmark rate for many 
consumer and business loans 
this forecast if it proves accurate would likely put the 
central bank on a collision course with the bush administration 
which is counting on strong economic growth and falling interest 
rates to help it trim the federal deficit without resorting to new 
taxes 
many economists believe the fed has already started tightening 
credit conditions and they expect further efforts along that line 
when fed policymakers meet behind closed doors today and wednesday 
to review the performance of the economy and make revisions to 
monetary strategy 
the federal open market committee headed by federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan meets eight times a year to set guidelines 
for monetary policy consistent with the banks job of promoting 
noninflationary growth 
while the economy is now in its seventh year of expansion without 
a downturn fed officials have expressed concerns that tight labor 
markets and high factory operating rates could spur a new 
inflationary spiral 
recent signs of economic strength including a strong 
unemployment report for november have many analysts convinced that 
fed policymakers believe the economy may be overheating 
from an economic standpoint the fed clearly should tighten 
said michael evans head of a washington consulting firm bearing his 
name the economy is strong and all sorts of inflationary signs 
are cropping up 
many analysts say they have detected signs that the fed is 
tightening credit behind the scenes they note that the federal 
funds rate the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans has been rising it averaged 859 percent last week the 
highest weekly average in two years and up from 844 percent the 
week before 
this rate often serves as an earlywarning signal that the fed is 
making moves to restrict the amount of reserves banks have on hand 
to make loans 
i think the fed believes we are at full employment and we cant 
tolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit the 
brakes said david wyss chief financial economist of data 
resources inc of lexington mass 
but the feds efforts will make bushs goal of reducing the 
budget deficit that much harder because it means economic growth 
will be slower and the governments tax take lower and interest 
rates on the 26 trillion national debt will be higher 
the fed is projecting economic growth as measured by the gross 
national product of around 2 percent to 25 percent far below the 
reagan administrations forecast of 35 percent gnp growth next year 
but economists detect no signals that the fed will back off its 
view that the economy cant afford to grow at those rates without 
rekindling inflation 
if the fed has its way the bush administration will not have 
its way and that means government revenues will be lower and the 
budget deficit higher said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co 
many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to move 
up to 11 percent by late january with similar increases in other 
interest rates major banks boosted the prime rate by onehalf 
percentage point just two weeks ago to 105 percent the highest 
since mid1985 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said he expects mortgage rates now 
averaging around 1046 percent for fixedrate mortgages will start 
climbing as well 
by early next year i would look for mortgage rates to be 
around 11 percent to 1125 percent and rising he said mortgage 
borrowers should borrow now instead of waiting 
many economists said they were looking for an increase in the 
feds discount rate the interest the central bank charges on loans 
to member commercial banks by the end of january 
the last increase in the discount rate the most dramatic signal 
the fed can send of its intention to push interest rates higher 
occurred on aug 9 when the rate was increased to 65 percent 
capping a series of credittightening moves the central bank had 
begun in late march 
the federal open market committee is composed of members of the 
federal reserve board and presidents of its regional banks it meets 
in private every six to eight weeks decisions are not disclosed 
until after the next meeting is held

major obstacles to an irancontra trial of 
oliver l north were removed when the judge in the case sharply 
restricted the number of classified documents the former white house 
aide may use for his defense 
by deciding to bar as evidence more than 90 percent of the 
classified documents north wanted to disclose us district judge 
gerhard a gesell greatly increased the chances that the case will 
go to trial possibly late next month 
gesells ruling diminishes the possibility that president 
reagans refusal to release virtually all the secrets sought by 
north would force dismissal of charges on the ground that the former 
national security council aide couldnt get a fair trial 
the judge harshly rebuked north for demanding disclosure of 
masses of classified material which under no conceivable version of 
a defense could have any utility whatsoever 
north as a tactical matter has taken an obdurate stand 
gesell said in an order issued monday if this tactic were 
permitted there would be no trial 
gesell rejected a nov 14 list of 3500 documents covering 30000 
pages of secrets that north had proposed as evidence under a 
provision of the classified information procedures act 
but the judge denied independent counsel lawrence e walshs 
request to bar north completely from disclosing any secrets saying 
a blanket prohibition would too severely restrict the defense 
instead gesell gave north until jan 3 to pick 300 documents 
from the nov 14 list that he wants to use as evidence the 
documents will be censored for sensitive references to secret 
information by an interagency task force that reviewed walshs 
exhibits 
the defense will be required to show the relevancy and 
materiality of each item and generalities will not be accepted 
gesell said 
gesell granted walshs request to censor some of the 300 
documents the independent prosecutor wants to use as evidence to 
prove that north conspired to divert usiran armssale profits to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
north had objected to virtually all of the deletions of sensitive 
information but gesell approved many of the changes such as 
censoring the names of cia agents foreign officials and the sources 
of us intelligence 
he also approved walshs proposal to remove sensitive information 
from the orders by president reagan approving the armsforhostage 
initiatives 
but the judge made clear that he wants public disclosure of as 
much evidence as possible denying requests to delete the names of 
central american countries israel and iran from documents in the 
case 
gesell noted that an earlier evidence proposal by north on aug 
1 also was rejected after a check of some of the documents listed 
showed it was obviously submitted in bad faith 
since then the court has repeatedly reminded north that he must 
provide specific information about how a document would help his 
case 
despite those warnings the nov 14 notice contains ample 
evidence of norths attempt to frustrate the prosecution the 
judge said 
norths unwillingness to pay token respect to the courts 
requirement to provide detail appears to reflect his mistaken view 
that he is entitled to use classified materials at trial without 
indicating in any way the significance of that material to the 
prosecution and the court gesell said 
this trial does not concern the reaction of various central 
american countries to congressional legislation the life history of 
a potential defector the precise distribution of sandinista forces 
at a particular time among various villages gesell said listing 
the type of secrets north proposed to disclose 
this is a case charging fraud and deceit on the united states 
its chief executive and congress involving the use of arms profits 
in a manner allegedly unauthorized by the president the judge 
said it must remain focused on these issues rather than be 
derailed by the myriad unrelated issues raised by north 
north still has until dec 19 to submit an additional list of 
secrets he wants to disclose in testimony or from other documents 
not covered in the nov 14 notice 
but gesells order made clear that he would reject a list that 
was similar to those previously filed 
norths lawyers meanwhile sought a onemonth delay in filing 
the next notice and argued that disclosing defense testimony will 
violate the former white house aides right to a fair trial 
never before in the history of american criminal law has a 
court granted the prosecution such a onesided bonanza of 
information about the defense case lawyers brendan v sullivan 
jr and barry s simon said in the pleading filed monday

union officials say steelworkers could gain up 
to 10 million in back pay as a result of an arbitration boards 
ruling against usx corp 
the boards ruling released by the united steelworkers of 
america on monday compels usx to reimburse workers at overtime 
rates in instances totaling as many as 1100 where work was lost 
because of outside hiring that violated the steelworkers contract 
union officials said 
its an enormous victory for the union that shows that what 
weve said about contracting out is true steelworkers union 
president lynn williams told reporters 
the arbitration board examined 24 grievances at the companys 
fairless works outside philadelphia the union and the company 
selected those cases because they were said to represent some 1100 
pending complaints by workers 
the board held that back pay was entitled in all but five of the 
24 cases no award was granted in three and the remaining two were 
returned to the parties for more information before a final decision 
is rendered 
the union studied the back pay awards and found one to be worth 
about 700000 
another of the 24 test cases involved 9001000 hours and 
several involved 200300 hours if these are typical of the 1100 
pending cases the companys liability should easily reach 8 
million to 10 million union leaders said in a memorandum to 
members 
the document urged workers to guard against wheeling and 
dealing aimed at selling your jobs to outside contractors or buying 
the right to do so the issue of outside hiring had been central 
to a sixmonth walkout by usx workers in 1987 
in his decision arbitration board chairman alfred dybeck also 
said that after one year a cease and desist order will be in 
effect barring outside hiring for specified types of work 
maintenance repair and service work were all at issue in the 
case usx conceded that it hired from outside but argued that no 
remedy should be imposed because fairless workers were already fully 
employed and many were working overtime 
the union countered that employees could have worked more 
overtime than what was offered 
fairless is one of the last plants to use openhearth 
steelmaking which dominated the industry for years it is the 
oldest steelmaking technology in use in the country 
our recent contracting out procedures there have been affected 
by the severe shortage of skilled labor in the area around the 
plant usx spokesman tom farrell said in a telephone interview 
from pittsburgh we have encountered some difficulty in hiring 
qualified people for certain crafts he said 
farrell said the company was still interpreting the ruling and 
had no immediate comment on it

american indian leaders say they are generally 
pleased with their meeting with president reagan but say they hope 
white house invitations will be more frequent in the bush 
administration 
indian leaders had been seeking a meeting with reagan for more 
than six months ever since he said us officials might have erred 
in allowing indians to continue to live in their primitive ways 
he made the comment during a questionandanswer session with 
students at moscow state university last may 
reagan told reporters monday i dont recall saying that 
the presidents spokesman quoted the president as telling the 16 
indian leaders from 11 states indians should have the right to 
choose their own life the right to have a say in what happens in 
indian country 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration had trouble 
arranging mondays meeting because of difficulty in deciding which 
indian representatives to invite there are more than 500 american 
indian tribes 
but ivan sidney chairman of the hopi tribe of kykotsmovi ariz 
told reporters after the cabinet room session that reagans comments 
in moscow last may indicated that there needed to be a contact by 
the native people directly with the white house 
reagan in moscow for his summit with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev had said he was willing to meet any time with indians 
seeking to air grievances 
that demand was heightened after he went on to tell his soviet 
audience that the us government may have made a mistake in 
allowing indians to pursue their primitive lifestyle rather than 
becoming citizens with the rest of us 
discussing the primitive lifestyle statement reagan told 
reporters during a picturetaking session that i dont recall 
saying that i tried in response to a question to explain that 
theirs was a freedom as with all the people of america a freedom 
that is quite different from the situation in the soviet union 
edgar l french jr of anadarko okla president of the delaware 
tribes of western oklahoma said that he had signed a letter to the 
president from oklahoma tribal leaders stating that he was very 
wrong 
however said french its been said and weve said what we 
wanted to say against it and let it go we need to look to the 
future not to whats behind us the number one problem is economic 
development on the reservations 
eddie l tullis of atmore ala tribal chairman of the poarch 
band of creek indians said the presidents remarks served a very 
useful purpose of raising his consciousness of the need for us to 
communicate on a governmenttogovernment basis 
it could serve a very great purpose if the new administration 
builds on what has been started here today tullis said 
when the president was asked why it took so long to arrange the 
meeting he said because i was never apprised that a meeting was 
being sought presidential aides including fitzwater met in 
california last august with one indian group seeking an audience 
with the president 
secretary of the interior donald hodel meeting with reporters 
after the meeting said we want to strengthen the ability of the 
tribes to help themselves while maintaining the special 
relationship 
ross o swimmer assistant secretary of the interior for indian 
affairs asked who selected the indian leaders to be invited said 
we shared that responsibility with the white house

rep dan coats of indiana will succeed vice 
presidentelect dan quayle in the senate once again following his 
mentor into a congressional job 
a conservative in quayles mold coats got his start in politics 
as an aide to quayle and went on to win quayles old house seat when 
the vice presidentelect moved up to the senate in 1980 
indiana gov robert d orr announcing the senate appointment on 
monday said coats represents values near and dear to the people 
of indiana 
quayle praised the republican congressman as a dedicated family 
man and trusted friend coats was known to be quayles choice for 
the job but the vice presidentelect turned aside suggestions that 
coats was his handpicked successor 
this was a oneman vote the governor made the decision i 
did not make any specific recommendation quayle said 
coats promised to work hard for his indiana constituents 
i realize im not their elected senator im their appointed 
senator i hope over the next two years to work my very hardest to 
earn their respect and support he said 
his selection makes no change in the democraticrepublican split 
in the senate where democrats hold a 5545 majority in the new 
congress 
coats will serve until a special election is held in 1990 for the 
remaining two years of quayles term an election for a full 
sixyear senate term will be held in 1992 
coats house seat will be filled through a special election with 
democratic and republican caucuses nominating candidates to succeed 
him 
coats was born in jackson mich graduated from wheaton college 
and then served in the army like quayle he obtained his law degree 
from indiana university 
he worked in quayles congressional office in fort wayne ind 
from 1976 to 1980 when quayle decided to run for the senate in 
1980 coats won the 4th congressional district seat 
in the house coats compiled a conservative record that drew an 
82 percent approval rating in 1986 from the american conservative 
union 
he is a supporter of aid to the nicaraguan contras and to the 
angolan rebels in 1984 he attempted to attach to an education bill 
an amendment to cut off federal aid to schools and states banning 
voluntary school prayer the amendment was defeated 
senate republican leader bob dole said coats will represent 
hoosiers in the senate with vigor and commitment to their 
heartland values 
quayle has announced he will resign probably effective jan 2 
to allow his successor to gain seniority by being sworn in before 
the rest of the senate on jan 3 however coats said he expects to 
be sworn in with his colleagues 
because of rule changes in 1980 a senator sworn in before others 
does not necessarily gain a head start in committee assignments or 
other advantages but coats will have some seniority over most other 
new senators because of his eight years house service

the 1988 cotton crop mostly escaped the ravages 
of drought and is expected to total a sevenyear high of 152 
million bales up 3 percent from last years harvest and 2 percent 
more than forecast a month ago the agriculture department says 
based on field conditions as of dec 1 the departments 
agricultural statistics board said monday cotton production would 
be the largest since 156 million bales were harvested in 1981 
counting almost 58 million bales left over from earlier 
harvests the total us cotton supply in the 198889 marketing year 
is expected to be about 21 million bales the most in 20 years 
analysts said in a related supplyanddemand report 
exports may require only 69 million bales in 198889 down from 
more than 76 million last marketing year reflecting fierce 
competition in the world cotton trade the report said 
the increased 1988 cotton harvest resulted from a larger acreage 
up 16 percent from 1987 while average yields per acre declined from 
last year 
as a result of the cotton outlook usda on oct 31 announced that 
farmers will have to reduce their acreage 25 percent next year to 
qualify for the price support program 
the report also indicated dry edible bean production this year at 
191 million hundredweight down 26 percent from last year and 
burley tobacco production at 459 million pounds up 9 percent from 
the 1987 harvest 
orange production at 215 million boxes is up 9 percent from 
last season 
the report did not include new 1988 production figures for other 
major crops such as wheat corn and soybeans production totals for 
those crops will be released jan 13 
planting of winter wheat for the 1989 harvest was 95 percent 
completed by nov 1 about 5 percentage points ahead of average the 
report said but lack of moisture hampered development in much of 
the major growing areas 
near the end of the month rain and snow provided needed 
moisture in portions of the plains and pacific northwest the 
report said greenbugs continued to be a problem in kansas and 
texas in texas central and southern areas remained dry and showed 
little or no growth

timber harvesting in certain parts of national 
forests in oregon and washington will be barred in order to broaden 
habitat protection for the spotted owl says the agriculture 
department 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said monday that 
most of the new habitat areas will range from 1000 to 2000 acres 
in size and will serve as protection for nesting owls as well as 
providing stepping stones between larger areas totaling more 
than 16 million acres already protected as owl habitats 
in the olympic national forest the new habitat areas may be as 
large as 3000 acres each he said 
in all the special habitat areas are expected to reduce the 
annual timber harvest on national forests in oregon and washington 
by about 180 million board feet 
each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in the 
linkage system the exact number will not be determined until the 
forests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owl 
populations will be maintained 
this has been an extremely difficult decision to make but i 
believe it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflicting 
goals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timber 
supplies that are vital to the economies of oregon and washington 
robertson said 
the forest service a usda agency has been embroiled in 
controversy concerning its management plans for spotted owl 
habitats notably in the pacific northwest where some people are 
concerned that protection of the birds could adversely affect the 
timber industry 
however robertson said the controversy has not been confined to 
his agency noting that a lawsuit against interiors bureau of land 
management has resulted in an injunction prohibiting the bureau from 
harvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers in 
oregon 
also the fish and wildlife service is being challenged in court 
over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or 
endangered species

the agriculture department has formally adopted 
a rule allowing processors to use certain acidic substances to keep 
supermarket pork chops looking pink and appetizing 
the rule takes effect jan 11 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food safety 
and inspection service said the agency has permitted use of the 
additives since september 1986 but it held off making a final 
decision until public comments had been submitted 
the substances are ascorbic acid erythorbic acid citric acid 
sodium ascorbate and sodium citrate which are used in fresh cuts of 
pork to maintain the meats color 
the use of these substances in the product does not pose a 
health risk crawford said fresh pork loses its color long 
before it becomes unsafe the color change makes the product 
unappealing 
product labels will identify the added substances and the reason 
for their use he said for example sprayed with a solution of 
water ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color

the federal communications commission will 
examine on a casebycase basis requests to waive its rule 
prohibiting direct ownership operation or control of both a radio 
and television station in the same market 
although the panel stresses it is retaining the 
onetoamarket rule mondays decision drastically relaxes the 
restriction on common ownership of commercial television and radio 
stations in the same market 
the onetoamarket rule prohibits ownership of a radio and vhf 
television station or any broadcast operation and a daily newspaper 
in the same market exceptions to the 1970 rule are considered only 
when it involves a uhf television station and radio stations in the 
same community 
although we would retain the current radiotv cross ownership 
rule we would entertain waivers of the rule on a casebycasebasis 
if certain specified criteria were met said fcc staffer michele 
farquhar primary author of the proposal 
the change means the commission will consider exceptions to the 
onetoa market rule in any circumstances where its waiver criteria 
are met and the public interest benefits would outweigh the costs of 
broadcast combinations but it focused on the nations top 25 
television markets 
the fcc will look favorably upon the grant of waiver 
applications where those applications involve radio and television 
stations located in the top 25 markets where at least 30 separately 
owned or operated voices would remain after the proposed 
combination the panel said in a statement 
i think we have a moderate approach said commissioner james 
quello in voting for the proposal he said the exclusion of several

immigration officials gearing up for a crush 
of nicaraguans seeking asylum in the united states are proposing 
changes that might make it more difficult for them to work here 
legally 
one change would require that asylum applications be reviewed by 
immigration officers before the asylumseeker is allowed to work in 
this country according to an internal document prepared at the us 
immigration and naturalization service and obtained by the 
associated press 
under another change asylum applicants would have to make a 
stronger case for receiving a work permit than they do now 
according to the document 
ins commissioner alan nelson is to meet this week with associate 
attorney general francis keating to discuss the ins proposals 
a justice department policy adopted in july 1987 by thenattorney 
general edwin meese iii encouraged ins officials to expedite 
nicaraguan applications for work authorizations 
since the meese directive was put in place any nicaraguan who 
applied for political asylum has almost automatically been granted a 
work permit while his application was being processed 
the 1987 policy was hailed by most nicaraguans who said the 
action should have been taken earlier 
the ins hasnt acted on many asylum applications from 
nicaraguans but that is apparently about to change 
in the past year and a half there has been a sharp increase in 
the number of asylum applications from central americans most of 
whom cross the border illegally in the harlingen texas area 
there is a backlog of nearly 12000 asylum applications from 
nicaraguans who have come here illegally ins officials have said 
and an estimated 5000 more nicaraguans who have come here illegally 
and who havent filed asylum applications 
one of the internal ins documents is a twopage memo dated dec 5 
from the office of ins deputy commissioner james buck and entitled 
nicaraguan asylum harlingen situation it says that an ins 
staffer had been directed to prepare a document which keating may 
use to support the argument for rescission of the meese memo 
regarding nicaraguans requested by keating the memo was sent to 
keating on dec 2 according to the document 
ins commissioner alan nelson had earlier favored rescinding the 
meese memo according to justice department sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity however said the sources nelson has 
changed his mind and has decided not to recommend rescinding or 
revising the meese directive but rather to make other changes to 
address the nicaraguan question said the sources 
it could not be determined what keatings position on the meese 
directive is or why nelson had changed his mind 
a separate ins document proposes that a clarification be sent to 
ins field offices immediately informing the field that the meese 
memorandum of july 2 1987 does not require automatic granting of 
work authorization to asylum applicants whose claims are frivolous 
another proposal is to establish a procedure under which those 
who have filed asylum applications most recently would be reviewed 
first under what one of the internal documents calls last in 
first out adjudications procedures the ins has not acted on many 
of the nicaraguan asylum applications filed in the past year and a 
half and the proposal would mean an additional waiting period for 
that group 
ins spokesman greg leo declined thursday night to discuss any of 
the proposals and justice department spokesman joseph krovisky 
declined comment 
the ins is gearing up to address the crush of applications 
according to the ins documents and agency sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
sixteen ins examiners and eight support staff would be detailed 
to harlingen to maintain an appropriate asylum processing level 
for a 30day period according to the internal ins documents 
detailing the ins proposals 
another step being proposed is to press the state department to 
secure the assistance of mexico and central american countries to 
slow down the flow of illegal aliens into the united states the 
documents said

the reagan administration has been ordered by a 
federal judge to make faster decisions on whether surplus or excess 
government property can be used as shelter for the homeless 
us district judge oliver gasch on monday gave the government 
until dec 28 to determine if at least half the 350 listed 
properties were suitable for sheltering homeless people 
the department of housing and urban development was given until 
jan 12 to survey the rest of the property which covers more than 
1000 buildings hud was also required to publish weekly in the 
federal register a list of all properties deemed suitable to house 
homeless people 
the decision was made in a lawsuit brought by the national 
coalition for the homeless which had accused the reagan 
administration of not implementing the mckinney emergency homeless 
assistance act 
the law named for the late rep stewart mckinney rconn 
requires the government to survey surplus federal property to 
determine if the facilities may be used for shelters 
no piece of federal property has been turned over for use as a 
homeless shelter since the mckinney law was passed last year 
attorney jeffrey pash said at mondays hearing 
gasch also ruled that once a property is classified suitable for 
a shelter it cannot be made available for any other purpose for 30 
days while the government reviews applications by homeless groups to 
take over the facility 
gasch made the ruling after attorneys for the homeless coalition 
accused the general services administration of selling a property in 
suffolk mass that had been deemed suitable for use as a shelter 
what this means is that the government is now required to 
actually make available a very significant amount of property to 
people who are on the street and to do so very quickly under a 
strict schedule said maria foscarinis washington counsel 
hud was also ordered to canvass federal agencies quarterly to get 
an updated list of surplus excess and underutilized property hud 
was also directed to conduct suitability studies of each property in 
those categories within two months 
gasch also directed the government to give him monthly status 
reports on the program

a crewman aboard an indian merchant ship was 
killed monday when the ship was struck by a halfton practice 
missile launched from a navy jet during a military exercise the 
navy announced 
the nonexplosive missile was fired at a target hulk ship but 
its guidance system locked onto the merchant vessel jagvivek which 
was not supposed to be within the navys pacific missile range the 
navy said 
the missile hit the topside superstructure of the merchant ship 
fatally injuring the crewmember the navy said 
the accident took place 80 miles northnorthwest of the island of 
kauai within an area of several thousand square miles of ocean which 
had been closed to merchant vessels by a notice to mariners issued 
by the navy on thursday the statement said 
lt cmdr gary e shrout a navy spokesman said the ship had 
been en route to singapore but he didnt know what it contained or 
where it was heading from 
there was no report of any other injuries the identity of the 
crewman was not immediately disclosed 
after the accident the 250foot jagvivek headed under its own 
power to honolulu for further damage assessment and possible 
repairs the navy said in a statement the ship was expected to 
reach here tuesday morning 
the fa18 hornet jet that fired the antiship missile was from 
the uss constellation the carrier and its sevenship battle group 
was conducting exercises en route to a western pacific deployment 
the navy said 
the harpoon missile has a range of 65 miles and was launched from 
the jet toward the target ship many miles out to sea the navy said 
unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough to 
the path of the merchant vessel for the missiles seeker to guide on 
it instead of the original target said a statement issued by the 
navy at pearl harbor 
a navy helicopter took the victims body to wilcox memorial 
hospital on the island of kauai according to kauai police 
the harpoon missile is more than 12 feet long weighs more than 
1000 pounds and flies at supersonic speed guided by an imaging 
infrared seeker that locks onto the target according to janes all 
the worlds aircraft 
the warnings for merchant ships to avoid the pacific missile 
range are included in routine advisories transmitted on marine radio 
frequencies at set times throughout the day according to the coast 
guard

rescue workers in soviet armenia like those 
in mexico city three years ago are racing against time and the 
elements to remove tons of rubble without killing people trapped 
below 
using sound equipment dogs hammers and chisels rescue crews 
searched desperately for survivors for nearly three weeks after the 
september 1985 earthquakes in mexico city 
after the first week few were found alive and they were mostly 
babies but the infants gave hope to a shattered city 
fighting infected wounds without water or food they held out in 
the tangled mass of concrete slabs reinforcing rods and crushed 
furniture of the hospitals where they were born 
one baby who was found on the ninth day after the sept 19 
quake is believed to be the last person rescued alive 
five days after the quake amid fears that demolition of 
seriously damaged buildings would begin thenpresident miguel de la 
madrid assured the country rescuers would go slowly 
we have to work with prudence so as not to put at risk the 
volunteers so the rescue work will not provoke internal caveins 
that might cost the lives of those we might still be able to find 
alive he said 
the government acknowledged 6000 deaths but estimates based on 
reports from foreign rescue crews and private mexican sources put 
the toll as high as 30000 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were trapped alive after 
the quake and a strong aftershock the next day that compacted the 
rubble even more 
trained dogs sniffed for signs of life or death then rescuers 
demanding silence from waiting relatives and reporters probed with 
sensitive microphones trying to home in on sounds and determine a 
victims exact location 
rescuers tunneled in with everything from drills to jackhammers 
blow torches shovels and saws 
mexico citys mild climate worked in favor of those trapped with 
temperatures in the 70s during the day and the 50s at night 
although downpours are common in september it stayed dry in the 
days after the quakes 
for many victims in this city of 18 million help came too late 
anyway for some miracles unfolded 
at what was the 12story juarez hospital near the bottom of a 
100foothigh pile of wreckage a young medical intern lay face down 
on top of one body and surrounded by others 
the intern jose juan hernandez cruz heard rescuers reach other 
victims and shouted for help and water he twice heard crew leaders 
give their men only half an hour to reach him or abandon the search 
saying many had died and one more didnt matter 
four days after the quake they eased him out of a tunnel barely 
big enough for his body 
six days after that rescuers felt a last surge of hope when they 
thought they heard sounds in the rubble of another building they 
searched for a week 
no one was found

a man who murdered an immigrant greek 
restaurateur as his wife watched was put to death by injection early 
tuesday in an execution delayed when one of two intravenous needles 
sprung a leak 
raymond landry 39 was pronounced dead at 1245 am hours 
after the us supreme court spared a second convicted murderer from 
the same fate 
landry was the 29th person executed in texas more than any other 
state since the supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 
prison officials began administering the lethal fluid at 1221 
am landry was not pronounced dead until 24 minutes later in 
between a needle sprung a leak sending the lethal mixture shooting 
across the death chamber toward witnesses 
there was something of a delay in the execution because of what 
officials called a blowout said charles brown spokesman for 
the texas department of corrections the syringe came out of the 
vein and the warden ordered the execution team to reinsert the 
catheter into the vein 
after landry was brought into the death chamber he shook his 
head briefly when asked by warden jack pursleyif he had something to 
say 
at first he showed no reaction to the drugs and his lips 
quivered 
the leak occurred at 1223 am the needle on the inside of his 
right arm leaked sending the solution about two feet toward the 
witnesses 
pursley quickly pulled a curtain across the viewing area to block 
witnesses views for more than 14 minutes witnesses heard the 
sounds of doors opening and closing some mumbling and at least one 
groan 
the curtain was then reopened and landry was motionless and 
appeared dead with his eyes half closed 
three minutes later two doctors arrived they declared him dead 
at 1245 am 
brown said it was the first time such a problem had occurred in 
texas in 1985 however authorities repeatedly jabbed needles into 
stephen morin when they had trouble finding a usable vein because he 
had been a drug abuser 
landry was convicted in the death of kosmas prittis who was 
robbed and shot in the head while he and his family were closing 
their houston restaurant in 1982 
hours earlier the supreme court blocked a second execution in 
texas that of samuel hawkins who was convicted of the 1976 
rapeslaying of a 19yearold woman had he been put to death along 
with landry it would have been the first time since executions 
resumed in 1976 that a state had put two people to death on the same 
day 
landrys execution brings to 104 the number of men and women put 
to death in the united states since 1976 the total includes 11 
executions this year three in texas counting landry

a worldwide outpouring of aid has 
overwhelmed the backward mountainous region hit hardest by the 
armenian earthquake clogging yerevans airport and the two crude 
highways that link it with the devastation 
cars trucks buses and cranes creep slowly day and night up the 
narrow winding roads across the caucasus range to the stricken area 
about 50 miles away the sound of honking horns and grinding engines 
breaks the mournful silence of stricken villages and cities 
foreign aircraft bringing in blood medical supplies food 
clothing and rescue equipment wait hours to be unloaded at the 
airport in yerevan the capital of soviet armenia 
two relief planes have crashed killing more than 80 people and 
minor collisions have been reported among the throng of aircraft 
that stacked up over the weekend 
its been unavoidably chaotic with so many aircraft arriving 
at once said colin wheeler an engineer with air europe which 
flew 20 tons of medical equipment and food into yerevan on monday 
he said one of the airlines boeing 707s was clipped by a taxiing 
aeroflot jet on sunday but was not seriously damaged 
ground crews scurry among the mass of parked aircraft with the 
few rolling stairways available 
french and german teams who arrived with search dogs saturday 
said they had to wait an hour to get off their planes and four to 
five hours for their donated cargo to be unloaded 
crates of supplies flown in by more than 40 foreign aircraft were 
stacked around the airport tarmac waiting for trucks buses and 
helicopters to take them to stricken areas 
air traffic controllers spoke politely in broken english to 
foreign air crews then broke into heated shouting with fellow 
armenians all taxed to the breaking point by overwork and personal 
tragedy 
our nation is so undeveloped we cant even receive help 
properly lamented an exhausted dispatcher on the verge of tears 
she said she had been working for three days relieved for only a 
few hours to sleep in a nearby office while other exhausted workers 
took her place 
refugees from the earthquake area cluster 10 deep around the 
information desk of aeroflot the soviet airline the entire city 
transport system has been commandeered to convey supplies to the 
earthquake zone and owners of private cars in the capital have been 
patrolling the streets offering rides to the homeless packs seeking 
refuge 
at night an eerie calm is enforced in yerevan by dozens of army 
tanks and armored personnel carriers patrolling areas that have been 
the scene of ethnic protests for the past nine months 
last wednesdays earthquake has demanded the attention of most 
authorities but armenians campaigning for control of the contested 
nagornokarabakh region in neighboring azerbaijan have continued to 
demonstrate 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov confirmed at a 
moscow press conference on monday that activists had been arrested 
in yerevan a day earlier 
the undeveloped road system linking the capital with the north 
and a spate of winter storms have further complicated relief efforts 
the shorter of the two rutted mountain roads connecting yerevan 
and spitak which was nearly destroyed in the quake was closed 
sunday and monday by a heavy snowfall and a string of accidents 
the sole route between spitak and leninakan another city hit 
hard was closed to all but military vehicles to ease traffic jams 
caused by the dispatch of heavy equipment and the arrival of fellow 
armenians seeking to help out 
a cold spell prevented a major outbreak of disease by slowing the 
growth of bacteria but temperatures dropping below zero have 
exacerbated hardships 
several hundred survivors remain in spitak where virtually every 
home was destroyed forced to camp outside they are searching for 
relatives and trying to salvage belongings 
as hope evaporates that any survivors will be found those 
standing vigil among the ruins of spitak will move on to live with 
relatives or take refuge in evacuation centers 
what we havent seen in these days said yasmina akupyan a 
germanspeaking yerevan resident who has been shuttling between the 
quake scene and the armenian capital to translate for foreign 
volunteers if i had time to sleep i wouldnt be able to

the fabulous piers of atlantic city 
are falling victim to fire disrepair or commercialization gone are 
the days when they featured big bands and ballrooms aquariums 
church concerts and diving horses 
when steeplechase pier burned down saturday the resort was left 
with only four piers only one can be called commercially successful 
the gaming halls that opened during the past 10 years are now 
atlantic citys main tourist attraction but back in the late 1800s 
the resorts piers with the soft whitesandy beaches and ocean 
were the lure 
the book so young so gay a collection of atlantic city 
historical facts tells of numerous piers built and rebuilt since 
1880 mostly for entertainment purposes such as concerts 
atlantic city doesnt seem to be a resort for piers anymore 
said atlantic county historian adrian w phillips i think the 
temperament of atlantic city has changed and i just dont see the 
piers coming back 
saturdays fire at steeplechase pier caused more than 1 million 
in damage but shut down only a fastfood restaurant facing the 
boardwalk and a heliport the pier closed to the public in 1986 
was once know as the funny place for its variety of amusements 
and theater acts 
it had a variety of slides rides and novelty features that 
kept everybody entertained phillips recalled it was famous for 
that enormous chesterfield cigarettes sign with thousands of 
lights 
if the remnants of the pier are demolished as expected four will 
remain 
garden pier holds the citys art and historical museums and a 
small outdoor theater area it is in need of repair although plans 
are under way to refurbish it said phillips 
the old part of the famous steel pier overhanging the ocean is 
being demolished although owner donald trump has said he will 
eventually rebuild and widen what remains as an extension of his 
massive taj mahal casino project 
central pier is now used mostly as a lucrative billboard 
location and for storage although souvenirs and arcade machines are 
out front near the boardwalk a tower that once gave tourists a 
birdseye view of the city is rapidly deteriorating 
the burned out remains of the old million dollar pier became 
the ocean one mall in 1983 the only successful pier its designed 
to look like an ocean liner and attracts tourists bored with 
gambling it recently opened a small section with indoor amusement 
rides 
this is a shopping center where families can come to have a 
good time said ocean one advertising manager rita similides 
were trying to emulate the old amusement piers as best we can 
sometimes its easy and sometimes its not given the interesting 
mix of people that now visit atlantic city 
but phillips said in no way is ocean one family entertainment 
nor does it parallel what steel pier or steeplechase pier used to 
be theres no variety of entertainment 
besides ocean one at least one casino has tried to capture the 
nostalgic image of the past but indoors tropworld casino and 
entertainment resort recently opened up tivoli pier an indoor 
amusement center with attractions and rides 
trump eventually will develop steel pier with a family 
entertainment focus said stephen hyde chief executive of trumps 
casinos 
the problem we would have in making it like the oldtime piers 
is the cost of maintaining everything just for a short summer 
season he said if you bought a ferris wheel at 1962 prices 
you wouldnt mind leaving it in the salt air but at 1988 prices it 
doesnt make sense to use it only in the summer months

east germanys ambassador to the united 
states came to the midwest seeking the childs view of peace on 
earth and thats what he got 
it would feel kind of like a storm on an ocean thats really 
rough and in the morning its all peaceful and calm and quiet 
said 10yearold megan fornelli one of the 15 youngsters at a 
meeting with ambassador gerhard herder a way to be peaceful is to 
stop being selfish because a lot of times wars are started because 
one country wanted something and another country wanted something 
herder participated in the conference monday at the montessori 
childrens house west of st louis he also delivered a letter from 
erich honecker the german democratic republics leader videotapes 
created by children in east germany and a book about the socialist 
country 
the discussion of peace began with a question from one of the 
moderators 9yearold ben rondot 
if you have peace inside of you what does it feel like look 
like and sound like he asked 
sevenyearold ben oberkfell had an answer 
peace is like a light that shines like a candle in someones 
heart the youngster said 
having peace inside you is like floating on a cloud playing 
with friends said trisha guenther 7 
herder was struck by the childrens simple eloquence 
i feel very quiet and relaxed he said i feel happy 
because i am in the company of good friends i like so much and in 
this circumstance i feel the importance of peace 
herders visit and gifts were in response to a letter written to 
honecker by 7yearold brett fornelli megans brother and a 
participant in a project called kids for peace the project began 
last spring when 170 children from the st louis area wrote letters 
to leaders around the world the children wrote to promote world 
peace and to request that kids everywhere share video programs to 
promote the cause 
the first set of letters was mailed in may since then the 
children have received responses from educators television stations 
and government officials from around the world 
but the response from east germany produced the first 
facetoface meeting 
herder told the children that a world at peace would mean no more 
wars people would work to understand and help each other 
everybody would be happy herder said everybody would help 
each other to maintain a happy life that would be global peace on 
earth this is what im working for 
he urged the children to continue working toward peace all their 
lives 
unity and hard work for peace that is the message i would send 
to all children he said our strength is friendship our 
strength is unity our strength is cooperation and you children 
you are our future

marine lt col william r higgins a 
onetime aide to former defense secretary caspar weinberger held 
hostage in lebanon will make his family and country proud 
regardless of his fate his uncle says 
he loves his country delbert eagle of lancaster said after 
higgins was abducted feb 17 he is capable of standing up as well 
as an ordinary man will under the circumstances i dont think 
they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his 
country in any way 
i think he would die first 
on monday lebanese kidnappers holding the 43yearold higgins 
said in a statement they have sentenced him to death as a spy for 
israel 
we have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this 
american spy said the typewritten arabic statement signed by the 
organization of the oppressed on earth 
but the statement did not mention an execution date 
higgins sister mary fisher of louisville said she had no 
knowledge of the threat other than what she has heard from reporters 
i have not been contacted by anyone she said monday 
when he was abducted higgins headed a 75member observer group 
assigned to a united nations peacekeeping force in south lebanon 
a pentagon official said at the time that higgins was on 
temporary detail serving as the chief of the un truce supervision 
organizations lebanon observer group 
the group monitors ceasefire violations on the lebanonisrael 
border higgins was the topranking american officer assigned to the 
group holding the title of senior us military observer 
by the time higgins left for college he was well on the way to 
fulfilling the ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook for 
my family to always be proud of me 
when he was growing up in southern jefferson county in the late 
1950s and early 1960s his friends never expected the chunky 
cheerful youngster to make his career in the military 
he was just pretty much an average guy at southern high 
school rudy fischer an old friend recalled after higgins 
abduction 
i think people were kind of surprised when he went into the 
marines fischer added you think of the marines as being macho 
types and he really wasnt like that 
even so higgins won appointment to west point but chose instead 
to study at miami university of ohio on a navy rotc scholarship 
he opted for the marines after suffering seasickness during a 
summer cruise to scandinavia his brotherinlaw harold fischer 
recalled 
others who knew higgins in louisville remember him as a bright 
wellrounded young man who stood out in school and on the athletic 
field 
higgins whose friends knew him as rich or pinky earned 
mostly as and bs he played guard on his high school football team 
in 1962 and 1963 
he gave us 100 percent effort said henderson wilson then 
the teams line coach 
higgins was president of his sophomore class vice president of 
his senior class and won membership in the beta club and key club 
according to his senior yearbook 
his fellow seniors and teachers voted him one of the top 10 
members of the class of 1963 based on scholarship leadership 
school spirit and personality said assistant principal ralph allen

miami university and later earned masters degrees in human 
resources management at pepperdine university and political science

when retired twa pilot dennis maloney 
picked up a newspaper he thought he might see a reference to a 
hijacking that occurred 20 years ago 
instead mondays headline twa flight to miami is hijacked 
carried him back to dec 11 1968 when he was the captain of 
another miamibound twa flight that was hijacked 
the two piracies took place 20 years apart almost to the hour 
both planes were boeing 727s and the flight numbers contained the 
same digits maloney said his was flight 496 sundays was flight 
469 
i couldnt believe it the same date the same time the same 
type of aircraft said maloney of suburban prairie village kan 
who retired 18 months ago after 23 years with twa i bet the 
chances arent 10 million to one of that happening 
sundays hijacking only the second involving a domestic us 
airliner in 2 years never made it to cuba the intended 
destination of the cuban exile who claimed to have a bomb 
authorities said the flight instead went to grand turk part of the 
british colony of turks and caicos islands southeast of the bahamas 
where the man was in custody pending extradition proceedings 
maloneys flight which originated in kansas city and stopped in 
st louis left nashville for miami when it was hijacked to havana 
it was the 19th us commercial airliner forced to cuba in 1968s 
wave of hijackings 
stories from 20 years ago described maloneys hijacker as a 
supercool gunman with a smiling female companion who appeared to be 
about six months pregnant among the 32 passengers and crew of seven 
were country singer tex ritter father of actor john ritter and pro 
golfer mason rudolph 
maloney 54 recalled there was early speculation the gunman 
might have been eldridge cleaver the black panther party activist 
who had disappeared in november 1968 to avoid arrest for violating 
parole 
but after being shown pictures of cleaver maloney and others 
said he was not the hijacker the gunman later was identified as a 
man named patterson a black panther who eventually ended up in 
algeria maloney said 
maloney said the hijacker grabbed a cabin attendant forced his 
way into the cockpit and ordered the crew to fly to cuba at gunpoint 
when the plane landed in havana between 200 and 300 cuban 
soldiers surrounded the plane maloney said the hijacker and his 
companion were taken off he was disarmed and they were marched 
away he said 
a diplomat from the swiss embassy arrived and interrogated the 
crew and passengers who were taken to a restaurant and fed before 
the passengers were taken to another airport and flown back to the 
united states 
maloney and his crew flew out of havana to miami that evening 
we all lived through it maloney said there was no 
problem other than the delay the next morning i kiddingly said to 
one of the administrative guys at twa i promised the crew a week 
off with pay he said i hope youve got enough money to pay for 
it out of your own pocket 
later as the number of hijackings continued to grow it became a 
policy to allow crews paid leave after an incident maloney said

dozens of homeless people have erected a 
subterranean cardboard city in a downtown subway station using 
about 50 old refrigerator cartons to shelter them from the numbing 
cold 
terry ryan said he doesnt care that the potted flowers in front 
of his box are dead from the cold 
at least im warm he said monday 
ryan is one of an estimated 10000 homeless people in 
philadelphia about 50 have been sleeping in cardboard refrigerator 
boxes in the dank station below the ornate academy of music home of 
the philadelphia orchestra 
the structures at the walnutlocust station of the broad street 
subway began going up about thanksgiving although homeless people 
often congregated in subway stations in previous years this is the 
first year such a vast conglomeration of cardboard shelters has been 
erected 
ryan 19 is proud of his particularly large living quarters he 
has used wire and two metal poles to combine several smaller boxes 
into a 7by14foot shelter and tacked up plastic sheets to cut down 
drafts with this much room ryan invited three other men and one 
woman to live with him 
these are my people he said we help out each other 
everybody down here are protective of each other 
plunging temperatures it was just 13 degrees here early today 
have added urgency to the plight of the homeless in recent days 
the city has sent out teams of social workers police and former 
homeless people to encourage the homeless to enter shelters 
but one of ryans roommates miguel rodriguez said he feels 
safer in his cardboard home 
rodriguez 18 said he had lived in a series of homes and

iran received the final delivery of 50 
fighter jets from china before the aug 20 ceasefire in its war 
with iraq wellinformed diplomatic sources reported today 
the j6 and f7 jets chinese versions of the sovietbuilt mig19 
and mig21 were delivered by ship over three years in knockeddown 
form through irans persian gulf port of bandar abbas a key naval 
and air base and assembled in iran the sources said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the chinese 
jets along with a large quantity of airtoair missiles were 
allocated to the revolutionary guards air wing not the regular air 
force 
western military officials could not confirm the delivery but 
don kerr an aviation specialist with the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies said the jets had been expected 
for some time 
the quantity and the timing are certainly right for the 
iranians in their effort to develop weapons systems from other 
sources to get around their very serious problems of supply for 
their usbuilt equipment kerr said in a telephone interview 
china is irans major arms supplier and has provided ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis regime with antiship silkworm missiles and a 
squadron of 10 j6s in 1985 for training purposes 
irans military collapsed in a series of iraqi victories before 
the united nationssponsored ceasefire took effect and it is 
seeking to rebuild its forces 
the international institute for strategic studies reported last 
year that iran signed a 16 billion deal with beijing in 1985 for 
combat aircraft tanks and artillery 
mednews a parisbased newsletter specializing in middle east 
defense issues reported nov 21 that the deal involved what it 
identified as 60 f7 and f7m jets each costing more than 6 
million between july 1985 and february 1987 
however the diplomatic sources reported that final deliveries 
were delayed until earlier this year 
mednews quoting what it said was a copy of the contract between 
the chinese and the iranians said beijing also agreed to supply 500 
pl2 and 2000 pl2a airtoairmissiles modeled on the us 
sidewinder missile 
also in the deal were 1000 pl7 airtoair missiles copied from 
the french r550 matra weapon and 72500 57mm airtoground 
rockets mednews said 
the chinese also contracted to provide spare engines and 
technical backup with aircrews and ground crews to train iranians 
mednews reported 
china has denied it sells arms to iran or iraq although the 
institute for strategic studies lists j6 fighters in iraqs air 
force inventory 
the delivery of the jets virtually doubled the size of irans 
badly depleted air strength but none of the chinese fighters was 
ever reported in combat even when the iranians were suffering 
military defeats between april and july 
it takes three years to get personnel trained and operational 
on new aircraft kerr said so its not surprising the f7s were 
not committed in the fighting earlier this year even when the 
iranians had their backs to the wall 
the personnel flying these planes would still have been very 
inexperienced 
the iranian air force was built around ussupplied f4 
phantoms f5 tigers and f14 tomcats delivered before khomeinis 
islamic revolution toppled shah mohammed reza pahlavi in 1979 
before the iraniraq war erupted in september 1980 the iranian 
air force had 447 combat aircraft 
but because of a chronic lack of spares mainly due to a us 
arms embargo and combat losses western analysts estimate the 
iranians now only have around 50 operational usmade warplanes 
some without working radars 
iraqs air force equipped mainly with soviet and french 
aircraft outnumbers the iranians by at least 6 to 1

a landlords policy of monthly fees for 
things like sitting on the front porch or having a freezer has 
angered residents of a lowincome housing development 
the price of lounging on a porch or sitting on a stoop at the 
winter green apartments is 25 three violations are grounds for 
eviction landlord eric b allen of greater hartford realty says the 
policy was implemented earlier this year to reduce drug traffic and 
is working 
allen whose company began managing the apartments in may also 
charges residents a variety of monthly fees including for having 
freezers 9 clothes dryers 9 and air conditioners 12 
the porchsitting policy is an apparent violation of federal 
housing rules because it has not been approved by the department of 
housing and urban development which oversees the federally 
subsidized apartments an official said 
residents in the 32building 160unit complex are upset about 
the policy a meeting on the topic last month developed into a 
shouting match between tenants and property managers 
its just ridiculous said albert j farmer who has lived at 
winter green for 13 years 
the 73yearold farmer whose left leg is amputated below the 
knee is targeted for eviction because he has not paid the 9 fee 
for a freezer 
i respect him but i have to treat him like anyone else 
allen said 
farmer plans to fight eviction 
hes acting like a dictator farmer said he has people 
afraid of him but im not going anywhere 
allen said the fines are helping to improve the property keeping 
people off the porches has reduced drug trafficking 
the idea of imposing fines has changed things he said we 
dont have the problems we used to have 
allen said he wont consider relaxing the policy 
we havent won the dope dealers are standing by waiting for us 
to move out 
robert donovan housing management director for the hud in 
hartford said the porchsitting policy apparently violates federal 
housing rules 
to assess additional charges they have to ask us for 
permission he said they never asked us for authorization for a 
fee for loitering on a porch 
donovan said greater hartford realty has received approval from 
hud to levy other monthly charges in addition to rent most cover 
the electricity used by heavy appliances

a computer hacker has breached 
lowerlevel security at lawrence livermore national laboratory for 
the 11th time in a week officials said 
the latest intrusion into the system took place saturday the lab 
announced monday 
so far the hacker has managed to invade the unclassified 
research computer systems at the lab at least 11 times during the 
past week 
there have been no new intrusions since the weekend chuck cole 
chief of the nuclear weapons facility said through a spokesman 
the spokesman ronald teunis said cole could not comment 
directly because he was exhausted from the hectic weeklong 
invasion of the computer systems by the mysterious hacker 
cole had issued a public invitation to the hacker or hackers last 
saturday asking to be contacted directly so i can see what he 
wants 
teunis said cole has received several telephone calls from people 
offering to help but none was believed to be the hacker 
he said the system involved is the unix network which links 
research labs and universities around the nation the network used 
for unclassified scientific research was the one invaded last month 
by a computer virus believed released by a cornell university 
graduate student 
the livermore hacker has not invaded the labs highly secret 
nuclear weapons research computers which are physically and 
electronically separated from the unclassified system 
teunis said the hacker has not destroyed or altered any 
information in the files although the hacker apparently has the 
capability of doing so 
cole emphasized earlier that the attacks do not involve a virus 
a program that invades a computer system and can clog its memory 
system by overreproduction

irans rulers have since july killed at least 300 
opposition activists in the countrys largest wave of political 
executions since the early 1980s amnesty international charged 
today 
evidence of the mass executions is indisputable and the true 
death toll could be in the thousands the londonbased human rights 
organization said 
opposition activists have been killed secretly in prisons 
throughout iran including evin and gohardasht in tehran and others 
in tabriz mashhad and shiraz amnesty said 
iranian authorities initially denied reports of mass hangings and 
shootings but amnesty said the reports were confirmed in effect by 
public statements in recent days by iranian officials including 
president sayed ali khamenei 
among those executed were people either kept in prison after 
serving their sentences or rearrested after release amnesty said 
it added that many of those executed had been tortured 
most victims were leftists the majority members of the peoples 
mujahedeen organization of iran the statement said it said some 
were from rahe kargar the peoples fedayeen organization the 
communist tudeh party or kurdish opposition groups 
both men and women were executed ranging from students to 
doctors and clergymen suspected of supporting ayatollah montazeri 
designated successor to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
revolutionary patriarch amnesty said 
it cited many sources of evidence including relatives of 
executed prisoners and recent statements by authorities the 
organization said it had information all of it crosschecked on 
more than 300 executions since july but believed the real number 
could be in the thousands 
nobody really knows how many people have been put to death 
just as nobody knows when the killing will stop or who will be next 
to die it said 
our fears are heightened because thousands of political 
prisoners are still held in iran and because many of those executed 
recently had been imprisoned without trial or were serving long 
prison sentences imposed after unfair trials 
amnesty said a tehran woman who gave evidence had searched 
secretly for her husbands body in jadeh khavaran cemetery in august 
groups of bodies had been buried in unmarked shallow graves 
in the section of the cemetery reserved for executed leftist 
political prisoners it quoted her as saying 
her husband a communist imprisoned under the late shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi was arrested again in 1985 amnesty said he was 
tortured over several months and convicted at a summary trial during 
which he was barely conscious 
khomeinis islamic revolution overthrew the shah in february 1979 
the statement said the mans wife arrived at evin prison in early 
august to visit him and was told he had been moved 
officials at the cemetery confirmed he had been executed but 
would not say where he was buried the woman had to stop digging 
because of patrols by guards but relatives later found the grave 
amnesty said 
once i knew where he was i could leave it quoted the woman 
as saying she now is outside iran but prefers to anonymous for fear 
of reprisals against her family the statement said 
other prisoners secretly executed included high school students 
arrested in the early 1980s for distributing political leaflets or 
disrupting political rallies amnesty said some of them were kept 
in jail after serving sixmonth sentences it declared 
one former student was held without charge or trial since his 
arrest in 1982 at age 16 the statement said and a 17yearold 
arrested in 1981 was sentenced to 11 years for supporting the 
peoples mujahedeen 
amnesty expressed concern about what it calls lack of provision 
for fair trials of iranian political prisoners and the absence of a 
right to appeal death sentences it opposes the death penalty which 
it considers a violation of the rights to life and freedom from 
cruel treatment or punishment

a poll shows fewer americans admit to 
drinking and driving today than three years ago and the national 
safety council is attributing part of the decrease to a fear of 
getting caught 
from 1985 to 1988 the percentage of americans who said they 
drove after consuming alcohol fell from 37 percent to 28 percent 
according to the poll conducted by the roper organization for the 
allindustry research advisory council 
what were seeing is that the state laws are having some 
effect said david unnewehr research manager of the council 
based here west of chicago 
of those who said they are drinking and driving less 36 
percent said it was because of awareness of tougher laws and 
fines unnewehr said monday 
his group was established by the insurance industry to do 
research in policy areas affecting risk and insurance 
al lauersdorf alcohol programs administrator for the national 
safety council said the perception is there that their chances 
of being caught are greater and thats contributing to a decrease 
as a result greater numbers of people either do not drink when 
they are planning to drive or make other arrangements for 
transportation he said 
the designated driver concept where one person drinks soda or 
coffee or nothing has taken root across the country especially 
where mass transit is not an option said lauersdorf 
the increase of the drinking age to 21 throughout the country 
has cut a lot of drinking by younger people 
drivers between ages 18 and 34 a group more likely to drink and 
drive were mostly responsible for the decline unnewehr said 
the percentage of people from 18 to 24 drinking and driving 
dropped from 48 percent in 1985 to 31 percent in 1988 the poll 
showed among those 25 to 29 the number went from 53 percent in 1985 
to 39 percent this year 
for those ages 30 to 34 the percentage who said they drink and 
drive decreased from 51 percent to 33 percent 
the poll showed that 37 percent of men and 20 percent of women 
said they drove after drinking in 1985 the figures were 45 percent 
for men and 29 percent for women 
in the midwest 33 percent said they drove after drinking 
compared with 32 percent in the northeast 30 percent in the west 
and 21 percent in the south 
the research council commissioned similar studies in 1985 and 
1986 this years telephone survey of 1499 people around the 
country was conducted from june 418 and has an error margin of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points

a 250foot indian merchant ship steamed toward 
port for repairs today after being accidentally hit by a supersonic 
harpoon missile fired from a us navy jet killing one crewman 
authorities said 
the body of the merchant seaman was flown by a navy helicopter to 
wilcox memorial hospital on the island of kauai nursing supervisor 
lillian teshima 
the indian vessel jagvivek bound for singapore with an unknown 
cargo was in navys pacific missile range 200 miles northwest of 
honolulu even though the area was closed to commercial shipping 
because of military operations the navy said 
navy authorities are investigating the incident 
in new delhi the indian government declined comment 
the fa18 hornet attack fighter from the aircraft carrier uss 
constellation launched the 12footlong 1000pound unarmed 
missile during a training mission toward a target hulk ship many 
miles out to sea the navy said 
unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough to 
the path of the merchant vessel for the missiles seeker to guide on 
it instead of the original target the navy said in a statement 
the impact of the nonexplosive missile into the ships structure 
above the main deck killed the crewman and collapsed part of the 
structure the navy said 
two navy ships were sent to assist the jagvivek and a navy doctor 
and a medical corpsman went aboard they pronounced the crewman dead 
at the scene the navy said 
ms teshima did not disclose the type of injuries he suffered 
his name was not released 
the constellation and seven other ships in its battle group were 
conducting training exercises en route to a western pacific 
deployment the navy said 
the thousands of square miles of ocean that make up the pacific 
missile range frequently are closed to civilian craft with 
advisories broadcast at set times each day on marine radio 
frequencies according to the coast guard 
accidents involving civilian vessels in the training area are 
rare but not unprecedented 
in may 1975 two jets from the aircraft carrier uss kittyhawk 
dropped several 20pound practice bombs just missing a 20foot 
cabin cruiser that the pilots apparently mistook for a target craft 
according to newspaper files 
navy officials in that case said the boats skipper had ignored 
warnings to stay out of the restricted area

mobster anthony tony pro provenzano 
the man former teamsters leader jimmy hoffa was on his way to meet 
when he vanished has died of a heart attack while serving a federal 
racketeering sentence 
provenzano died at lompoc district hospital near the federal 
prison where he was serving a 20year term for two racketeering 
conspiracy offenses prison spokesman chuck laroe said 
the 71yearold former new jersey union boss had been confined to 
the hospital in lompoc 140 miles northwest of los angeles for 
treatment of congestive heart failure 
what he represented and has represented in the past is the 
worst of the labor movement said new jersey state police 
superintendant col clinton l pagano 
a convicted murderer and extortionist provenzano engendered 
strong loyalty in teamsters local 560 in union city nj it was the 
nations thirdlargest local with 13000 members when he ruled it in 
the early 1960s 
ousted local 560 officer michael sciarra in court called 
provenzano his idol and said he would pray for his return 
after provenzano was sentenced to jail in 1978 for ordering the 
murder of a union rival 
sciarra was on the union board that us district judge harold a 
ackerman deposed in 1984 after finding in a government suit that the 
local had been dominated by the genovese organizedcrime family 
the union functioned under a trustee for 2 years before members 
last week elected a new leadership of sciarra proteges headed by 
his brother danny a judge had barred michael sciarra from running 
because of his ties to the locals old regime 
in july 1975 hoffa disappeared while on his way to a detroit 
meeting with provenzano then president of his local hoffa is 
presumed dead but his body was never found 
according to an fbi memo hoffa and provenzano had feuded when 
both were in federal prison the fbi speculated hoffa had hoped to 
make peace with provenzano and forge an alliance that would aid his 
drive to regain power 
according to the fbi reconstruction of the hoffa murder tony 
pro called the socalled peace parley with hoffa and then ordered 
him killed according to carl sifakis author of mafia 
encyclopedia 
provenzano was born to italian immigrant parents on new york 
citys lower east side and began driving a truck in hackensack 
nj in 1934 at age 17 he became a local 560 shop steward in 1941 
rose to business agent in 1950 and president eight years later 
one year later provenzano came to head the new jersey joint 
teamsters council which represented 80000 truckers in 1960 he 
became one of 13 vice presidents of the international brotherhood of 
teamsters 
he influenced the teamsters at the highest level he was the 
epitome of control by intimidation said pagano they controlled 
whether a business would or would not function simply by whether 
goods moved in or out 
provenzano went to prison in 1966 for extorting 17000 from a 
truck company in exchange for labor peace his brothers salvatore 
and nunzio who also have been imprisoned for racketeering and 
extortion maintained control of the local 
anthony provenzano was sentenced to life in prison in 1978 in new 
york state for a union rivals murder he was sentenced in federal 
court the following year for racketeering 
he would have been eligible for release in 1992

rival shiite moslem factions battled today 
with machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades in south beirut 
where most of the foreign hostages are believed held police said at 
least one militiaman was killed 
the violence came one day after kidnappers holding us marine 
lt col william r higgins announced that they had decided to put 
him to death for allegedly spying for israel 
police said one combatant was killed and three pedestrians were 
wounded in the fighting between the syrianbacked amal militia and 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
the battles went on for two hours in the streets of the chiyah 
and hay madi districts before syrian troops in charge of security in 
beiruts moslem sector moved in to stop them 
many of the 15 hostages in lebanon are believed held in hay madi 
hezbollahs main stronghold in south beirut hezbollah is believed 
to be an umbrella for proiranian extremists holding the foreigners 
amal and hezbollah have long been vying for dominance of the 1 
million shiites in lebanon they clashed in a sixday battle in west 
and south beirut two weeks ago police reported 40 people killed and 
87 wounded in that confrontation 
there was no way at the time and today tuesday to ascertain 
whether the hostages have been affected by the fighting said a 
police spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
higgins kidnappers call themselves the organization of the 
oppressed on earth which is sponsored publicly by hezbollah

resembled an photograph released april 21 it showed the balding man 
stoopshouldered with his eyes downcast away from the camera he had 
a gray stubble and was wearing a dark field jacket

a man who murdered an immigrant 
restaurateur as the mans wife watched was put to death by injection 
early today in an execution delayed when a tube from an intravenous 
needle sprung a leak 
raymond landry 39 was pronounced dead at 1245 am hours 
after the us supreme court spared a second convicted murderer from 
being executed 
landry was the 104th person executed in the united states since 
the supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 and 11th 
this year 
prison officials began administering the lethal dosage at 1221 
am landry was not pronounced dead until 24 minutes later in 
between a tube attached to a needle inside his right arm began 
leaking sending the lethal mixture shooting across the death 
chamber toward witnesses 
there was something of a delay in the execution because of what 
officials called a blowout said charles brown spokesman for 
the texas department of corrections the syringe came out of the 
vein and the warden ordered the execution team to reinsert the 
catheter into the vein 
after landry was brought into the death chamber he shook his 
head briefly when asked by warden jack pursley if he had something 
to say 
at first he showed no reaction to the drugs and his lips 
quivered 
the leak occurred two minutes after the injections began 
pursley quickly pulled a curtain across the viewing area to block 
witnesses views for more than 14 minutes witnesses heard doors 
opening and closing mumbling and at least one groan 
the curtain was then reopened and landry was motionless and 
appeared dead with his eyes half closed 
three minutes later two doctors arrived they declared him dead 
at 1245 am 
brown said it was the first time such a problem had occurred in 
texas which leads the nation with 29 executions since resumption of 
capital punishment in 1985 however authorities repeatedly jabbed 
needles into stephen morin when they had trouble finding a usable 
vein because he had been a drug abuser 
landry was convicted in the death of kosmas prittis a greek 
immigrant who was robbed and shot in the head while he and his 
family were closing their houston restaurant in 1982 
landry an 11thgrade dropout had a lengthy criminal record 
including arrests for sexual assault and abuse of a juvenile 
assault family neglect and petty larceny 
late monday the supreme court blocked the execution of samuel 
hawkins who was convicted of the 1976 rapeslaying of a 19yearold 
woman had he been put to death along with landry it would have 
been the first time since 1976 that a state had put two people to 
death on the same day 
the high court voted 72 earlier monday to reject landrys appeal 
in appeals for each inmate defense attorneys cited a case 
pending before the supreme court involving texas deathrow inmate 
johnny penry that case challenges the legality of executing 
mentally retarded inmates 
this man isnt retarded assistant attorney general bob walt 
said of landry i dont think thats going to fly with the supreme 
court 
in january landry came within three hours of execution before 
the supreme court issued a stay 
hawkins 45 was convicted in the death of abbe rogers hamilton 
of borger who was killed after hawkins entered her apparently 
unlocked home 
hawkins also has a second death sentence for the abduction and 
slaying of a 12yearold amarillo girl he has been dubbed the 
traveling rapist after admitting to some 40 rapes prosecutors 
said

the trustee overseeing ptl says he 
believes a bankruptcy judge is likely to reject a bid for the 
television ministry by a canadian businessman and to sell the 
ministrys assets piecemeal 
trustee mc red benton said us bankruptcy judge rufus 
reynolds was unlikely to extend the sale and probably would reject 
the high bid of 3625 million made monday by stephen mernick a 
toronto real estate developer 
his reynolds patience has been tested and i dont think 
hell want to go any further benton said monday 
reynolds was scheduled to rule on the sale of ptls assets during 
a hearing this afternoon in columbia 
ptls religious leader sam johnson said monday he hoped 
reynolds would keep intact the ministrys complex here called 
heritage usa and give ptls contributors more time to secure 
financing to buy back the ministry johnson is president of heritage 
ministries ptls nonprofit arm 
benton predicted reynolds would order the ministrys assets 
liquidated but he said it was possible the judge would open bidding 
again on the 2200 acres of property which includes a 500room 
hotel a water park a television studio and a 2000seat church 
the bidders and benton compared mondays auction in which bids 
were raised in increments ranging from 1000 to about 1 million 
to a card game in which the players withheld their final bet and 
gambled that reynolds would change the the conditions of the sale 
today one condition was that bidding begin at 50 million 
nobody won this afternoon bidder cy bahakel a former north 
carolina state senator who owns 15 television stations said monday 
its a new ballgame tomorrow in court 
the ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 1987 
three months after founder jim bakker left amid revelations of 
luxurious living and hush money paid to jessica hahn a secretary at 
a new york church with whom bakker admitting having a sexual liaison 
the offers monday were far below the appraised value of ptls 
assets 92 million to 110 million and half of that offered in 
the initial auction in november 
a month ago mernick said he would pay 115 million 50 million 
of it in cash but reynolds rejected the bid saying there were 
inadequate assurances that mernick would pay the remaining 65 
million 
the four apparent contenders for the assets mernick bahakel 
johnsons group and a new bidder michael karas president of first 
canadian development co of toronto all said they were prepared to 
bid again today 
heritage ministries did not bid at mondays auction which was 
closed to the public but johnson said he was negotiating with other 
bidders on a joint offer 
johnson pastor of the church at heritage usa said he held off 
bidding because he was unwilling to meet a condition that called for 
the downpayment to be forfeited if a bidder was unable to secure 
financing 
johnsons group held a telethon on ptls tv show last weekend 
that brought its kitty up to 5 million for the downpayment 
in another ptl development former ptl officials david and james 
taggart who face federal tax charges were sued by new york jeweler 
cartier for 158925 it says they owe for items they purchased last 
year 
cartier in its suit filed in mecklenburg county superior court 
in charlotte nc says the debt is the balance the taggarts owe 
for 203925 they spent at cartier on may 23 1987 that was about a 
month after ptl officials dismissed david taggart once bakkers top 
aide his brother james did interior design work for ptl until 
early 1987 
the taggarts have declined requests for interviews for the past 
18 months and have referred questions to their washington attorney 
ben cotton who did not return telephone calls monday

city police were ordered to wear 
shoulderharness seat belts after two patrol cars collided killing 
three officers and injuring a fourth on his first day on the job 
it is a terrible loss three young men in the prime of their 
lives these young men were very eager and very aggressive said 
chief daryl gates who issued the order 
the officers killed were not wearing seat belts 
previously department policy gave officers the option of wearing 
either lap belts or belts with shoulder harnesses the officer who 
survived mondays 325 am crash was wearing a seat belt but it was 
not immediately known which type 
the cruisers collided when the officers were en route to aid 
plainclothes detectives who pulled over a car reported stolen one 
of the cruisers was traveling the wrong way down a oneway street 
fellow officers wept during their roll calls when told of the 
deaths 
its like a bomb hit them a somber gates said its hard 
to see grown men cry flags at all stations were to be flown at 
half staff 
the mood however did not soften gates criticism of the dead 
officers both cars appeared to have been traveling in excess of the 
35 mph city speed limit and emergency flashing lights or sirens may 
have been in operation the use of lights or sirens to respond to a 
call for backup would have been in violation of department 
regulations 
this is a good example of what happens when you do not follow 
the rules gates said it was not known how fast the cars were 
going but gates said they were moving at a rate of speed you 
could call overdrive 
officers may ignore rules of the road only when responding to the 
more serious officer needs help call

passenger officer derrick conner 28 were dead at the scene the 
other driver officer manuel gutierrez jr 26 died later at

a man buried by the armenian earthquake said he bit 
the earth and shoveled with his nose to make his way out of the 
rubble of his collapsed factory 
misha nuridzhanyan rushed to find his wife and three children 
only to learn they were trapped beneath separate buildings 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda today published an account by 
the leninakan sewing factory inspector who was caught in the dec 7 
quake that killed up to 60000 people throughout armenia and 
destroyed much of his city 
at 1130 we felt faint tremors nuridzhanyan recalled 
everybody jumped up and ran for the stairs but we succeeded in 
running only 1015 meters and then everything collapsed if i had 
not grabbed a pillar i would have been thrown by the shock 20 
meters not less i dont remember anything after that 
when i came to it was dark i was curled like a fetus not 
flat but how can i explain like a rolled bun with my head 
hunched down between my shoulders apparently i instinctively shrank 
when everything started to fall all around me 
i waited would there be another tremor or not certainly if 
another quake hit nothing would be left of me around me i could 
hear my friends shouting to each other 
where are you 
my leg is squeezed 
my hand 
please talk to me dont keep silent 
it was terrifying a nightmare 
i tried to move and could not everything was squeezed my 
hands my legs my chest just my head was free from the roof dirt 
and sand were pouring onto me i felt someones blood flowing over 
me i bit into the dirt with my teeth and shoveled with my nose 
then a light appeared after i crawled out i dont know why 
but i looked at my watch it still ran i realized that i had spent 
an hour and a half in a grave i just lay down on the top of the 
rubble and my mind went blank then i was awakened by voices saying 
go home go home 
i could see that there was no help no one was helping to dig 
through the rubble somebody managed to crawl out by himself he was 
in his underwear because all his clothes had been peeled off by the 
stones as he crawled out 
i went barefoot to a hospital i stayed there until 4 pm then 
i was given a lift home i went there thinking with two little 
children nothing can happen because my daughter is going to first 
grade and the school is just two stories so it should stand the 
shock my son is in kindergarten a onestory building my wife 
works at a twostory building and the youngest is with my 
motherinlaw at home a fivestory building 
i was brought to the rubble everything had collapsed there my 
beloved ones were lying and there they remain today 
i stood up and didnt know where to move i went to the house 
of my sister where she and her husband screamed at me misha you 
must go to the doctor your head is bleeding i couldnt care less 
about my head no i couldnt leave before i found my child but i 
started to feel sick in the night i was taken to yerevan by 
helicopter 
now i know i have 27 stitches in my head and i feel the pain 
but then i felt nothing

the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission 
has cleared the way for the fivemember commission to consider an 
operating license for the long island lighting cos longdelayed 
shoreham nuclear power plant 
the staff on monday agreed with a september decision by the 
atomic safety licensing board which found that new york state and 
suffolk county had willfully obstructed the federal governments 
attempt to resolve the shoreham stalemate 
the 53 billion plant which was completed in 1984 has been 
unable to obtain an operating license because the state and local 
governments maintain that the surrounding area of densely populated 
long island could not be evacuated in an emergency 
if the commission accepts its staffs advice to uphold the 
boards recommendation that the local and state governments be 
dismissed from the shoreham proceedings no issues will remain to 
prevent a fullpower license for the plant said frank ingram a 
commission spokesman in washington 
ray golden a lilco spokesman said the utility was very 
pleased and optimistic that the nrc commissioners will act 
quickly on approval of a license 
brad ohearn a spokesman for suffolk county executive patrick 
halpin said the county will pursue vigorously with the full nrc 
board our contention that shoreham should not be operated because 
of evacuation concerns 
lilco has sought a full or 25 percentpower license for shoreham 
despite a settlement reached between the state and the utility to 
close the plant the utilitys directors have said lilco would abide 
by the settlement if the state legislature approved it before a 
license was granted 
the lawmakers who objected to the settlement as too generous to 
lilco left albany without approving it the settlement would allow 
the utility to increase rates 5 percent annually over 10 years 
on dec 5 a us district court jury in new york city found that 
lilco and a former executive engaged in a pattern of lies to obtain 
rate increases to help pay for the shoreham plant 
the jury awarded 76 million to suffolk county that amount is 
tripled to 228 million under the racketeering charges brought 
against the utility

the crash of a yugoslav military 
plane bringing earthquake relief to armenia may have been caused by 
a misunderstanding between the pilot and soviet air traffic 
controllers a yugoslav pilot was quoted as saying today 
the yugoslav air force an12 plane crashed monday while trying to 
land at yerevan airport killing all seven people aboard local 
reporters said the pilot mistook a welllit highway for a runway 
capt ljubomir pavlovic who landed another yugoslav plane at 
yerevan airport hours after the crash told the state news agency 
tanjug that the soviet union has not adopted an international civil 
airports association recommendation on measurement of altitude 
as a result he said there was a possibility of a 
misunderstanding between the yugoslav crew and the soviet flight 
control in yerevan 
a common method used at domestic airports in the soviet union is 
to read altitude in meters while international practice is to read 
the distance of the plane above the ground in feet 
pavlovic said yerevan airport where dozens of flights are 
landing daily as earthquake relief pours into armenia is not 
equipped to receive international flights 
i assume that the airport has now received technical and staff 
assistance from moscow and leningrad pavlovic told tanjug 
pavlovic suggested fatigue also might have played a part in the 
crash he said the crew prepared all day sunday for takeoff and 
flew for four hours before being forced by bad weather to make an 
emergency landing in ankara turkey 
tanjug described pavlovic as an experienced pilot who has flown 
to the soviet union often he spoke to tanjug after returning from 
yerevan 
the soviets and the yugoslavs have formed a joint commission to 
investigate the plane crash tanjug said 
the dec 7 quake devastated armenia a soviet official today put 
the death toll from the quake at 55000

the attorney general announced today he 
has rejected a british request to extradite a roman catholic priest 
with suspected terrorist connections believing britain would not 
give him a fair trial 
attorney general john murray who made the decision said the 
rev patrick ryan might face trial in ireland on charges of 
involvement in irish republican army bombings 
in concluding ryan could not be fairly tried murray cited 
british official and press attacks on ryan which were expressed in 
intemperate language and frequently in the form of extravagantly 
worded headlines 
britains seeks ryan on four warrants alleging conpiracy to 
murder and cause explosions and possessing explosives ryan insists 
he is innocent and the affair has sparked a diplomatic furor 
involving britain ireland and belgium 
the belgian government provoked british anger when instead of 
extraditing ryan it sent the 58yearold priest home to ireland on 
nov 25 ryan who had been on a threeweek hunger strike to protest 
extradition checked into a clinic outside dublin and dropped from 
sight three days later 
it is not enough to sign ringing declarations against 
terrorism what matters is effective action prime minister 
margaret thatcher said on dec 3 at the european economic community 
summit where she berated prime minister wilfried martens of belgium 
and prime minister charles haughey of ireland 
murray who considered the extradition warrant for two weeks 
said britain was responsible for his decision 
they the british raised the case to a unique status and can 
only have intensified the impact and lasting effect on members of 
the public of what was being published in the written and 
broadcasting media his statement said 
further the statements in the house of commons must because 
of their origin carry particular weight with potential jurors 
the british charges against ryan should be investigated by a 
court said murray who issued a 16page document supporting his 
decision the criminal law jurisdiction act provides that offenses 
committed abroad may be tried in ireland 
such a trial may under irish law take place before a court of 
three judges without a jury murray said adding that he had asked 
london for the evidence against ryan 
mrs thatcher made no comment on murrays ruling but aides said 
she was extremely disappointed 
ian gow a lawmaker for her conservative party said im 
afraid its very good news for the ira its a good day for them and 
a bad day for those who want to defeat terrorism 
but kevin mcnamara the opposition labor partys spokesman on 
irish affairs said i have sufficient faith in the integrity of 
the irish attorney general to know that he would have made his 
decision dispassionately 
ryan was suspended by his pallottine order in 1974 after he 
refused a transfer to a parish church in england 
ryans cousin tom ryan told the british broadcasting corp that 
the priest remained in hiding 
absolutely and without any reservation i believe that he is 
totally innocent ryan said he said his cousins only crime was 
to feed and clothe families of dead and jailed irish nationalists in 
northern ireland that might relieve pressure on the iras funds he 
said but that kind of guilt is on a whole lot of us here 
thousands of us he said 
the predominantly roman catholic ira is fighting to rid northern 
ireland of british rule and unite the province and its protestant 
majority with the irish republic

an energy department report estimates it will 
cost 50 billion to renovate deteriorating nuclear weapons 
facilities and recommends that all production be done in idaho 
tennessee and south carolina according to sources familiar with the 
report 
the report has been sent to the white house which was to send it 
to the house and senate armed services committees later this week 
but administration source said the committees may not get it until 
later 
congressional and administrative sources described some 
provisions of the 2010 report which looks to the year 2010 
on condition of anonymity accounts of the report appeared over the 
weekend and on monday in the washington post and the los angeles 
times 
the plan would organize many weapons activities around the 
principal nuclear material involved eventually concentrating all 
plutonium processing at the idaho national engineering laboratory 
near idaho falls uranium activities at oak ridge tenn and 
tritium activities at the savannah river plant near aiken sc 
congressional sources said 
this would mean closing the rocky flats plant near denver which 
makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered by 
tritium and the feed materials production center near fernald 
ohio a uranium foundry according to the report 
the rocky flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of its 
buildings because of accidental contamination of three employees in 
october the savannah river tritium reactors are temporarily closed 
to upgrade safety equipment and procedures 
doug elmets press secretary for the department declined to 
comment on the report 
the departments 68 billion plan to replace its tritium 
reactors released last summer called for a new savannah river 
reactor and only one idaho reactor though the idaho reactor was of 
a modular design that could be reproduced easily 
both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium 
according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with to 
produce tritium lithium is added to fuel assemblies 
tritium decays fairly rapidly 55 percent of any starting 
amount turns into inert helium in a year and must be replenished 
in nuclear weapons from time to time supply figures are secret no 
such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium components 
which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old ones are 
retired 
one congressional source said the department was faced with a 
choice of where to put the plutonium site idaho falls or the 
hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash and it chose idaho 
because of growing opposition in the richland area and the severity 
of contamination there 
an administration source said the energy department had not 
changed its estimate that 110 billion would be needed over the next 
40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories and 
laboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weapons 
and components

efforts to free a farmworker imprisoned in 
the poisoning deaths of his seven children two decades ago may be 
gaining momentum after a witness admitted he lied at the mans 
trial the mans lawyers say 
the last surviving witness to an alleged jailhouse confession 
that helped convict james richardson of one of the 1967 killings 
recanted his courtroom story during recent interviews with 
investigators the interviews were ordered by gov bob martinez to 
reexamine the trial 
i didnt hear richardson say anything while i was in there 
james weaver 67 said in the interviews according to the florida 
department of law enforcement i aint never heard the boy say 
anything about it i hope richardson will get out i want him to 
get out 
peter dunbar the governors general counsel said weavers 
statement also was contained in an old prosecution file that 
richardsons lawyer mark lane turned over to martinez office two 
months ago lane said the file had been stolen years earlier by 
someone concerned about the case 
there appears to be some foundation to some of the 
allegations dunbar said now whether or not that has some 
bearing is what well have to decide 
richardson 52 of arcadia was convicted of one of the killings 
and sentenced to life after he was accused of putting the deadly 
insecticide parathion in food a baby sitter served his children 
ages 2 to 8 
lane and richardsons other attorney ellis rubin said weavers 
admission will help when they petition for a new trial thursday 
rubin and lane said they will file appeals to the state supreme 
court and the trial court charging the state knowingly used 
perjured testimony 
i want a jury to hear that he was framed and to bring out the 
perjury on the record rubin said 
martinez will wait until after he has been briefed on the state 
investigative report this week to decide whether to call for a 
clemency hearing said brian ballard the governors director of 
operations 
some of the most damaging testimony against richardson at his 
1968 trial came from weaver and another jailed felon james dean 
cunningham authorities contended that richardson a fruit picker 
confessed to both men while awaiting trial 
a third convict who also allegedly heard richardson confess died 
before trial but his similar account was read into the record 
cunningham was shot to death in 1979 
weavers recantation is the latest development that casts doubt 
on richardsons conviction his lawyers say 
earlier this year it was reported that the former baby sitter 
betsy reese now 67 told nurses in a nursing home in 1985 that she 
had poisoned the children 
last week arcadias former police chief richard barnard said 
he believed that richardson was framed by thendesoto county sheriff 
frank cline 
weaver and cunningham would have done or said anything that 
frank cline asked them to do including making false statements 
under oath in return for lenient sentences barnard said 
cline disputed barnards allegation and prosecutors say the baby 
sitter who is immobile and has lapsed into silence became confused 
over the years after having innocently served a poisoned meal 
richardson is eligible for parole in 1993

police searched with tracker dogs and 
helicopters but found no clues today to the theft of one of vincent 
van goghs the potato eaters and two other works by the dutch 
impressionist master 
monday nights burglary at the kroellermueller national museum 
appears to be hollands biggest art theft also taken were the 
19thcentury dutch masters dried sunflowers and weavers 
interior 
police spokesman karel van seventer said the 30strong task force 
this morning abandoned its search of the national park that 
surrounds the museum they have no leads to the thieves identities 
or whereabouts of the oil paintings he said 
the burglars smashed an 8foot square window to get into the 
sprawling onestory museum seventer said two guards on duty in the 
museum were not alerted but the burglars triggered an alarm at ede 
police station 10 miles away and police surrounded the park near 
the west german border within minutes he said nearby border posts 
were alerted 
there was no official estimate of kroellermuellers the potato 
eaters the second of three versions van gogh painted in 1885 and 
the other two works which were finished in 1887 all belong to the 
state 
experts from sothebys and christies auction houses in amsterdam 
said the final and most important version of the potato eaters 
is on display in amsterdams vincent van gogh national museum 
the series marks one of van goghs harshest expressions of

survivors of the armenian earthquake are 
freezing to death at night because only a fraction of the thousands 
of tents sent to the disaster area reach the homeless a soviet 
newspaper reported today 
rescuers struggled to haul heavy equipment into the disaster area 
and evacuate victims despite roads jammed with grieving relatives 
a mountain snowstorm and temperatures that dropped below zero 
fahrenheit 
the foreign ministry today put the official death toll from the 
dec 7 quake at 55000 and the number of injured to 13000 
hope dwindled for those trapped in the ruins and the smell of 
decaying corpses filled the air rescuers have pulled 18500 people 
from the wreckage in the past four days but only 5400 people were 
alive foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters today in moscow 
newspaper accounts made it clear that despite the outpouring of 
international aid armenians were suffering from lack of shelter and 
medical care 
in the corridor of a hospital a man ran about clutching the 
tiny body of a child to his breast crying please help me 
said the newspaper socialisticheska industria in an article that 
also told how doctors were pressed into service building temporary 
housing 
the communist youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 60000 
tents have been sent to the disaster area but most of the 500000 
homeless are shivering around bonfires in the ruins 
the collapsed villages are suffering especially from the 
disaster the newspaper said citing helicopter capt sergei 
bobylev in one village 20 children died in the quake and now 
survivors are dying from cold the newspaper said 
only two roads and one railroad are open to the mountainous 
disaster area hindering delivery of cranes and bulldozers the 
labor newspaper trud reported evacuees cut off by a snowstorm many 
supplies are arriving by helicopter and parachute 
our nation is so undeveloped we cant even receive help 
properly said one unidentified air traffic controller on the 
verge of tears at the airport in yerevan the armenian capital 50 
miles to the southeast of the disaster area 
in hardhit leninakan once a city of 250000 the remaining 
residents were beginning to suffer from the lack of drinking water 
sewage and garbagehauling facilities and transport said 
sovietskaya rossiya 
the newspaper said it was understandable that officials 
responsible for such services were in a state of shock as 
practically everyone lost families but the lack of action could 
not continue 
in some towns no one was organizing relief efforts because all 
the officials died in the quake soviet television reported monday 
night 
relief efforts were blocked in the first days after the quake by 
huge traffic jams as an avalanche of worried relatives drove to 
the disaster area socialisticheskaya industria said 
the ambulances were flashing their lights in vain the 
newspaper said deadtired traffic inspectors tried to stop cars 
with their chests but their selfsacrifice couldnt change the 
disorganization 
soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov admitted to reporters monday that 
rescue efforts suffered from a lack of organization but he said he 
could not find fault with the enthusiasm of thousands of rescue and 
medical workers or of the 19000 soldiers keeping order 
sverre kilde a un disaster relief officer said no soviet 
troops were visible in leninakan although they can be seen hauling 
supplies in many photographs of the disaster area 
here there are 5060 people shouting in all directions said 
kilde speaking of a site he visited in leninakan on sunday it 
would have been much more reasonable to have an army captain or 
colonel in charge of it 
the politburo commission overseeing the rescue efforts on monday 
visited some villages near leninakan and spitak a city of 25000 
that was nearly destroyed by the quake and found them in equally 
bad condition as the two cities ryzhkov said 
he also said that many people died unnecessarily in the quake due 
to gross violations in planning and building apartment buildings 
that collapsed on occupants 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev who visited the area during 
the weekend and a government commission also believe there were 
very many violations he said 
if the homes had been of good quality construction something 
like this would not have happened ryzhkov said a commission was 
formed to review the construction 
he said the ruined cities will be rebuilt within two years but 
that no new buildings will be taller than three or four stories the 
estimated cost of rebuilding will be at least 5 billion rubles 8 
billion dollars ryzhkov said 
the earthquake destroyed hundreds of new apartment buildings in 
leninakan spitak and kirovakan some leninakan residents have 
complained that until 20 years ago no buildings in the area were 
more than two or three stories high 
a broken concrete slab with the words this piece of concrete is 
not to be used written on it lay in the rubble in leninakan

south africa cuba and angola pledged 
peace in southwestern africa today opening the way for withdrawal 
of 50000 cuban troops from angola and independence for the 
continents last colony of namibia 
us assistant secretary of state chester crocker who led eight 
months of intermittent negotiations on three continents said the 
accord is a new symbol of peace in the world 
it ends years of negotiating over one of africas most 
intractable disputes 
officials of the three countries signed the agreement to be 
finalized in new york on dec 22 at a ceremony attended by crocker 
host president denis sassounguesso of congo and soviet and united 
nations representatives 
we want to be accepted by our african brothers we need each 
other south african foreign minister rf botha declared after he 
signed for the whiteled country a new era has begun we are 
removing race discrimination he said 
ricardo alarcon cuban vice minister for foreign affairs and 
angolan armed forces chief gen antonio dos santos ndalu signed for 
their governments 
botha earlier told reporters the unsupervised independence 
process for southwest africa which is better known as namibia 
will begin april 1 elections will be held seven months later and 
the mineralrich territory will be independent in about a year he 
said 
mediated by the united states and supported by the soviet union 
the agreement will free the former german colony from 73 years of 
south african control and end 22 years of sporadic bush warfare 
this will bring an end to international conflict in 
southwestern africa crocker said it is the end of a sad 
chapter in african history 
still unsettled is the civil war in angola between the prosoviet 
government and rebels backed by south africa and the united states 
but the treaty will bar the involvement of south african and cuban 
forces in that arena scaling down its potential for regional 
conflict 
under todays agreement 3000 cuban soldiers will leave angola 
before april 1 and the rest will withdraw within 27 months from that 
date half the cubans will be out by the time namibian elections are 
held nov 1 
at the same time remaining cuban forces will gradually move 
north from the namibian border by election time they are all to be 
north of the benguela railroad at least 350 miles from namibia 
the three countries are to establish a joint commission to 
resolve disputes about implementing the peace accords and angola and 
cuba are to reach agreements with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar on means to verify the cuban pullout 
crocker praised the close practical and effective cooperation 
with our soviet counterparts the soviet union was not formally 
involved but played a significant role in bringing the parties 
together 
to applause from african diplomats and government officials 
crocker said the agreement was a case study of superpower efforts 
to support solutions to regional conflicts 
south africa had declared its agreement to a 10yearold un 
independence plan but was backed by the united states in linking it 
to a withdrawal of cubans they arrived in 1975 to back the dominant 
marxists against south african and prowest factions 
in namibias capital windhoek political figures said they 
looked forward to april 1 with cautious optimism 
april fools day i dont trust that date but well accept 
it said andreas shipanga the black namibian who chairs the 
cabinet of the transitional government 
shipanga said the south africans had not given the transitional 
government advance warning of the independence date 
he said he hoped the date would not appear and disappear like 
so many others we cannot continue in a state of limbo it is 
destroying the country and the morale of our people 
ben ulenga leader of the proindependence national union of 
namibian workers said namibians would remain skeptical about 
independence until the last south african troops leave the 
country

a woman claiming to be the anonymous plaintiff in 
one of two us supreme court cases that legalized abortion in 1973 
has petitioned a federal court to unseal case records in order to 
help reverse the ruling 
in an interview monday with the atlanta constitution she said 
she wants to be able to prove her identity as the plaintiff to give 
her antiabortion work credibility 
mary doe didnt want an abortion mary doe didnt have an 
abortion mary doe wont ever have an abortion said the atlanta 
woman who was not identified by name in the interview 
in the petition filed friday in us district court in atlanta 
without the assistance of an attorney she requested to be allowed 
to open the envelope with the true identity of mary doe being i am 
mary doe 
the petition said her name at the time of the case was sandra kay 
race bensing according to the petition now 40 she has since 
married twice 
records containing the identity of the anonymous plaintiff can be 
unsealed only by a judges order 
atlanta lawyer margie pitts hames who represented mary doe 
before the supreme court was in london on monday and could not be 
reached for comment 
she said before the petition was filed im not prepared to 
talk to anybody about mary does identity we took great steps to 
see that her identity was kept confidential 
ms hames said she lost touch with the plaintiff and has been 
trying to locate her for six years 
no hearing has been set on the womans request to open the file 
which was sealed at ms hames request 
the newspaper reported in todays editions that the woman said 
participating in the case was the biggest mistake she ever made she 
said she opposes abortion and hopes the supreme court ruling can be 
reversed 
i decided from the very beginning i would never consent to an 
abortion she said im not a religious person but i believe in 
god i know hes real i know we dont take lives 
she said that even after the supreme court ruling she continued 
her pregnancy and gave up her newborn daughter for adoption 
the ruling in the georgia case doe vs bolton referring to 
thenstate attorney general arthur k bolton was handed down by 
the supreme court on jan 22 1973 
the court said georgias conditions for abortions were too 
restrictive that medical committees were unnecessary to approve 
abortions and that the state could not prohibit abortions outside 
accredited hospitals 
the case was overshadowed by roe vs wade a texas case ruled on 
the same day in that case the supreme court struck down texas 
abortion law as a violation of a womans right to privacy

presidentelect bush wont name any members of 
congress to his cabinet because he doesnt want to weaken his party 
in the house or senate both already controlled by the democrats 
bush aides said today 
we decided it wasnt fair to deplete our strength in 
congress said bushs chief of staff craig fuller 
transition spokeswoman alixe glen added many of the vice 
presidents friends in congress have indicated a willingness to 
serve in his administration their appointment would mean a loss of 
strong supporters on capitol hill 
bush began telephoning and sending notes late monday to members 
of congress who had been under consideration for various posts 
aides to bush and several congressmen said 
fuller said he expected a couple of appointments to the new 
administration later this week but he wouldnt specify which 
offices would be filled 
he indicated that background checks are continuing on former sen 
john tower of texas the leading candidate for defense secretary 
and said the timing of an announcement on bushs pentagon chief was 
completely up in the air 
bush meanwhile was meeting today with coretta scott king the 
widow of the rev martin luther king jr 
the private meeting is one of a series bush has had with 
prominent black leaders including former democratic presidential 
candidate jesse jackson and benjamin hooks of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
bush has yet to appoint a black to a highlevel job in his 
administration although he has promised his cabinet will reflect 
the makeup of the american public 
bush also was scheduled today to talk with carlos andres perez 
the presidentelect of venezuela perez is the sixth foreign leader 
the third from latin america that bush has entertained since the 
election nov 8 
on monday bushs transition aides interviewed peter johnson a 
former head of the bonneville power administration in portland 
ore about the job of energy secretary 
i feel good about it johnson said of the meeting but he 
said craig fuller the codirector of the transition and chase 
untermeyer the head of personnel gave him no indication whether he 
was a finalist for the job 
among others mentioned for the department of energy post former 
rep henson moore of louisiana is thought to be a leading contender 
another name surfaced monday for the administrator of the 
environmental protection agency elizabeth dole 
mrs dole the former transportation secretary and the wife of 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan was known to have been 
interested in the post of ambassador to the united nations bush 
picked thomas pickering a career diplomat for that job but said 
he would like to find something suitable for mrs dole 
so far bush has placed only one woman carla hills in a high 
position she was nominated to be the us trade representative 
another woman constance horner the head of the office of 
personnel management is considered a strong candidate for labor 
secretary john n sturdivant president of the american federation 
of government employees says it will not try to block horners 
appointment if she is willing to speak openly with the unions 
another woman candidate for the labor job rep lynn martin 
rill appears to be out of the running because of bushs decision 
on not naming members of congress 
the big hole in bushs national security lineup is the defense 
secretary tower of texas is still said by sources to be the 
favorite for the job although the fbi has yet to finish checks into 
his background 
sources close to tower say the fbi could complete its work this 
week but any announcement might be delayed if bush decides to name 
a full slate at the defense department rather than just the 
secretary 
but the sources also said that transition staff members have told 
tower he will have much to say in choosing his own aides if he is 
awarded the defense secretarys slot

the parents of 52 children who state 
officials say were systematically beaten at a religious camp must 
admit their children were abused before the state will consider 
returning them an official says 
we need to hear from the parents a recognition that the 
children have been abused said bart wilson clackamas branch 
manager for the state childrens services division our assessment 
is that the parents have not yet recognized that 
the division monday also denied the parents request to serve as 
unpaid state volunteers to be near their sons and daughters until 
custody is determined 
the children were taken into state custody immediately after the 
oct 14 death of 8yearold dayna lorea broussard daughter of 
ecclesia athletic association founder eldridge broussard jr 
four members of her fathers organization are awaiting trial on 
manslaughter charges resulting from the girls death at a rural 
house southeast of portland broussard also ran the watts christian 
center in los angeles 
the other children said they were forced to watch the broussard 
girls beating and some were forced to count the blows they said 
beatings with electrical cords and paddles routinely occurred at the 
house 
one parent jewell benefield of los angeles had said earlier 
that the children are worldclass athletes in training and they 
can do things that normal kids cant do such as thousands of 
pushups daily 
benefields comments echoed similar claims broussard made about 
the children leading state officials to question the control the 
association founder maintains over the parents 
wilson said his agency needs the parents to make clear 
assurances that if the children are returned to their custody that 
the abuse would not reoccur 
the state monday also denied a request that broussard be allowed 
to make ministerial visits to the children in state custody he 
claims to have been ordained a minister in the church of god in 
christ in 1976 
broussard however will be allowed to continue his visits to his 
own four children now in custody wilson said other parents have 
been making hourlong visits each week he added 
eighteen of the children are housed at juvenile facilities and 33 
in foster homes wilson said an 18monthold boy was released to 
his parents and grandparents in california for an extended but 
temporary visit

former philippine president ferdinand marcos has 
weak heart muscles and will remain hospitalized for further tests 
his doctors say 
the 71yearold marcos was admitted friday to st francis medical 
center suffering from what aides called congestive heart failure he 
was listed in stable condition today 
marcos wife imelda said his spirits were lifted by visits over 
the weekend from tobacco heiress doris duke a friend of the couple 
and ms dukes newly adopted daughter charlene gail chandi 
heffner 
he seems to come alive when duke visits said mrs marcos 
she is a good american samaritan and has saved my faith in this 
country doris inspires the president she is an angel from heaven 
a remarkable woman who places a high value on friendship 
duke who owns a home here recently provided 5 million bail for 
mrs marcos when the former philippine first lady was arraigned in 
new york on federal racketeering charges 
marcos ousted as philippine president in february 1986 by 
corazon aquino faces the same charges but he and his lawyers 
contend he is too frail to travel to new york for arraignment 
marcos has weakened heart muscles and was prone to develop 
congestive heart failure according to a statement released monday 
by dr calvin wong a honolulu cardiologist 
these episodes in the past have been treated in his home as an 
outpatient because of increased stress that he has been under 
doctors felt it prudent for mr marcos to be hospitalized in order 
to reevaluate his cardiac condition and to readjust his 
medication wongs statement said 
marcos has responded to treatment and his condition has 
stabilized but he would not be released pending neurological tests 
wong said 
a st francis medical center spokeswoman who read the statement 
refused to elaborate on it 
a new york physician who examined marcos here in october said 
then that although marcos suffered various ailments he was well 
enough to travel to new york dr francis weld of columbia 
presbyterian hospital also concluded that marcos faked pain during 
the courtordered examination 
on monday weld said that although marcos did not have congestive 
heart failure at the time of the examination he could have 
developed it since he said the ailment can be either acute or 
chronic 
mrs marcos dismissed accusations that her husband was faking 
illness 
the president would be the first one in new york if he could 
travel she said 
mrs marcos said she was so worried about her husbands safety 
that she tasted his hospital food and medicine to make sure it was 
not poisoned 
i admit it i am kind of scared paranoid she said are 
these not desperate times

former miss america bess myerson tried to buy 
justice when she gave a city job to the daughter of the judge 
making rulings in her lovers divorce a federal prosecutor charged 
today 
in closing arguments at us district court assistant us 
attorney stuart abrams said miss myerson and her millionaire 
boyfriend plotted to influence former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel through her daughter 
ladies and gentlemen its not a complicated case said 
abrams its very simple its a very simple scheme 
abrams said miss myerson and boyfriend carl andy capasso 
decided the way to push mrs gabels buttons to get out of her 
what they wanted was through her daughter 
the prosecution which began its case in early october was 
scheduled to address the jury all day the case is expected to go to 
the jury which heard 10 weeks of testimony next monday 
miss myerson once the citys cultural affairs commissioner is 
accused of trying to influence a judges rulings in the divorce of 
her lover by giving a city job to the judges daughter 
miss myerson 64 capasso 43 and mrs gabel 75 who made 
interim rulings in capassos bitter divorce are charged with 
conspiracy fraud and briberelated charges 
miss myerson who was miss america 1945 is also charged with 
obstruction of justice she faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in 
prison if convicted of all charges 
her two codefendants face up to 25 years in prison if convicted 
last week the prosecution rested its case which is based on 
circumstantial evidence after calling 34 witnesses the defense 
rested the next day calling just five witnesses 
the defendants did not testify 
prosecution witnesses testified that miss myerson made secret 
phone calls to the judges chambers sometimes using an assumed 
name jurors heard how she suddenly became socially close to the 
judge and her family after two decades of a distant professional 
acquaintance 
there also was evidence about the hiring of the judges daughter 
sukhreet gabel in august 1983 a few months after she met miss 
myerson for the first time and how capassos temporary support 
payments to his estranged wife nancy were cut the following month 
from 1850 a week to 850 a week 
there hasnt been much said about capasso a onetime 
multimillionaire city contractor 
the main evidence against him was testimony by his former 
housekeeper shirley harrod who said miss myerson and capasso were 
very upset about the payments capasso had to make to his 
estranged wife 
mrs harrod testified that she later saw capasso throw down 
documents that looked like divorce papers and say to miss myerson 
isnt there something you can do about this 
but on crossexamination mrs harrod conceded she was not sure 
what capasso and miss myerson were discussing and that she only 
surmised that what capasso threw down were his divorce papers 
capasso is serving a threeyear prison sentence for tax evasion 
capassos lawyer jay goldberg asked for an acquittal last week 
claiming the governments case was held together by nothing more 
secure than a rope of sand the judge refused

on the seventh anniversary of the 
declaration of martial law and suppression of the solidarity trade 
movement students chanting solidarity pelted police with 
stones today and were answered with tear gas during a protest at 
warsaw university 
meanwhile the official press defended the imposition of martial 
law on dec 13 1981 by gen wojciech jaruzelski 
about 2000 students faced several hundred shieldcarrying 
helmeted police today at the gates of warsaw university along one of 
the citys main thouroughfares 
students hoisted banners saying solidarity and there is no 
freedom without solidarity and threw stones at the police from 
behind the walls of the campus police answered with canisters of 
tear gas 
at least three people were detained according to zuzanna 
dabrowska a student activist 
in a commentary on martial law the communist party daily trybuna 
ludu said one can remember dec 13th for years with a measure of 
bitterness and divisions one can open the healing wounds anew 
on that sunday morning in 1981 poles awoke to find tanks in the 
streets martial music playing on the radio and thousands of 
solidarity members rounded up and interned 
the army put an overnight end to the legal operation of 
solidarity a 10 millionmember social movement that had electrified 
the country for 15 months solidarity was at first suspended then 
legally banned in october 1982 
little bloodshed accompanied the imposition of martial law but 
nine coal miners were killed during a strike at the wujek mine near 
katowice on dec 16 1981 no other casualties were reported 
the anniversary cannot be an occasion for celebrations but 
can and should be a cause for reflection said trybuna ludu 
a government statement published in most newspapers today said 
the decision to impose martial law not only helped to prevent 
national catastrophe but to defend this reformatory process from 
those who often without being fully aware of it were preparing a 
tragic conclusion to it 
dictated by a supreme necessity the events of dec 13 1981 
did not stop the process of democratization and broad reforms 
under conditions of order not anarchy businesslike discussion not 
sterile disputes the sense of socialist renewal was restored 
alluding to solidarity and others in the opposition the 
statement said the communist partys offer for national 
reconciliation has not always been accepted 
some circles continue to stand aside from talks distrustfully 
or reluctantly viewing a proposal to assume coresponsibility for 
state affairs 
solidarity although still illegal has been increasingly 
tolerated by authorities who have been hoping to lure its leader 
lech walesa to discussions on polands future but the proposed 
talks with the government have stalled with walesa insisting he 
first wants a signal that authorities are willing to legalize his 
union 
the union demonstrated it has a strong following after leading 
two waves of strikes in 1988 
on nov 30 authorities allowed walesa to participate in a 
nationwide tv debate with official union chief alfred miodowicz and 
walesa was widely considered to have won the debate 
solidarity plans ceremonies friday in gdansk where the trade 
union was born to honor the victims of dec 16 1970 food riots 
along the baltic coast and the miners killed resisting martial law

the attorneys general of new york and new jersey 
where beaches were littered by medical waste and other pollution 
last summer have presented an antipollution plan they hope will 
become a blueprint for a national program 
cary edwards of new jersey and robert abrams of new york said 
monday that the bush administration will have to lead an aggressive 
attack if the nations oceans and beaches are to be cleaned up 
the presidentelect said he was going to do things differently 
than the present administration said abrams he said he was 
going to do more vigorous enforcement we are going to push for this 
agenda our role is to be the peoples advocate 
the two officials said attorneys general from around the country 
would lobby for the plan a blueprint to end ocean pollution to 
be adopted as comprehensive national antipollution program the 
plan was issued by the national association of attorneys general 
which abrams heads 
we once felt the oceans were so big we could not destroy them 
but were now realizing thats not the case said abrams 
added edwards anybody who thinks they can stop the dumping of 
syringes and theyre going to clean up the ocean theyre crazy 
edwards said his investigation into the source of debris that 
turned up on the jersey shore in the summers of 1987 and 1988 found 
that there was no mad dumper the mad dumper was the american 
lifestyle 
the federal government and the epa must weigh in on the 
problem he added it cant be dealt with alone by any 
individual states 
the blueprint offers proposals to 
upgrade sewage treatment plants 
remove toxins from industrial waste water 
promote recycling 
control runoff from fertilizer pesticides and other chemicals 
expand research on water quality 
increase coast guard surveillance to prevent ocean dumping 
aggressively enforce existing antipollution laws 
edwards said a top priority was ending sewage overflow or the 
dumping of raw or poorly treated sewage into bodies of water when 
sewage treatment plants are overwhelmed by the volume of waste water 
during storms 
ending the dumping of sewage sludge at sea is another priority 
the two men said

a palestinian grabbed a gun from a jewish 
settler in the west bank today and killed the settler and another 
israeli before he was shot to death by israeli soldiers israeli 
sources said 
the shootings occurred in the arab village of burin near the 
settlement of berakha about the time plo chairman yasser arafat was 
speaking to the un general assembly in geneva 
arab sources said the palestinian was a shepherd identified as 
hamdan najjar 25 they said he had been grazing his flock of sheep 
near the jewish settlement the arab and israeli sources spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
an army spokesman confirmed the settler was killed on his way 
home to berakha when an arab man seized his gun and shot him the 
spokesman said an army patrol arrived at the scene of the attack and 
fatally shot the palestinian 
the spokesman declined to elaborate or say whether there were 
other casualties 
before today 322 palestinians and 11 israelis had died in the 
yearold revolt against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip thousands of arabs have been wounded among them many 
children 
arab residents said jewish settlers entered burin earlier today 
and went into several schools ordering teachers and students to 
leave one high school principal was beaten residents said 
 
a curfew was imposed on the village arab journalists said 
also today a jewish settler today shot and wounded a 26yearold 
arab after his car was stoned in the west bank town of tulkarem and 
troops shot and wounded a 10yearold boy in the tulkarem refugee 
camp arab reports said an army spokeswoman said she was checking 
the reports 
the army increased its forces in the occupied territories today 
and clamped a curfew on the gaza strip in an effort to prevent 
violence during arafats speech 
soldiers used loudspeakers to warn the gaza strips 650000 
residents to stay indoors and not violate the curfew an arab 
reporter said 
we are imposing a curfew and we will open fire on anyone 
who breaks it the troops announced 
despite the heavy military patrols gaza city residents used 
heliumfilled balloons to set aloft a giant palestinian flag and 
burned tires in the streets according to an arab journalist in the 
city 
telephone lines to refugee camps in the gaza strip were cut off 
palestinian sources in gaza said 
in the west bank city of nablus about 100 palestinian women held 
an illegal march to show support for arafat they carried banned

driving along east jerusalems main commercial thoroughfare causing 
it to slam into a wall and a parked car police said

president reagan charged in a speech summing up 
his administrations record on domestic policy today that an iron 
triangle of members of congress the news media and special 
interest groups have helped perpetuate the budget deficit 
reagan received a tumultuous reception with applause punctuated 
by cheers and whistles from his audiences of government officials 
and employees in constitution hall 
one of my great disappointments as i leave office is that the 
federal budget itself is not yet balanced the president said 
it sometimes seems to many americans that what might be called 
a triangle of institutions parts of congress the media and 
interest groups is transforming and placing out of focus our 
constitutional balance particularly in the areas of spending and 
placing out of focus our constitutional balance particularly in the 
areas of spending and foreign policy reagan said 
reagan noted that some had used the term iron triangle to 
describe this complex and said he would borrow the phrase 
administrations come and go but the iron triangle remains 
he said 
the house of representatives he said has become a virtually 
permament chamber no longer truly responsive to the people 
with a 98 per cent rate of reelection there is less turnover 
in the house than in the supreme soviet 
the president said the iron triangle also derives from the 
power of special interest groups to focus debate and overwhelming 
resources like campaign money and letterwriting campaigns on issues 
that dont command broad and intense national attention 
with this pressure he said liberal members of congress take 
up the banner in support of continued spending programs 
you would think the media might act as a check on all this 
he said but too often it doesnt 
while expressing respect for the news media reagan said that 
too many members of the media approach issues like federal 
spending from a superficial perspective 
our positions are reported in caricature he said special 
interest charges are reported uncritically and the publics 
understanding suffers 
shouldnt we expect better of those who act in the name of the 
publics right to know the president asked 
his audience cheered the question

mud around the battleship texas was 
keeping the historic vessel from taking its first voyage since 1948 
a tow up the houston ship channel to a galveston dry dock for 
restoration officials said today 
five tugboats with a combined 16000 horsepower rocked the texas 
back and forth this morning to try to dislodge it from its 40year 
berth 
but four hours later the 27ton national landmark remained mired 
in the impression it left in the mud at the san jacinto battleground 
state park said naval architect edwin phillips 
weve moved about 25 or 30 feet but it hasnt been a great big 
bite phillips said but eventually shell come 
the texas the only surviving us combat ship to have served in 
both world wars is scheduled to undergo a 51 million restoration 
the 40mile trip to the todd shipyard in galveston is expected to 
take 1012 hours said sue moss the texas parks and wildlife 
department project historian for the battleship 
in my judgment we would have very severe longterm problems 
with the ship if we didnt repair her now we have had a history of 
leaks in the ship some in the piping system but some also in hull 
penetration caused by corrosion said wilson dolman director of 
parks 
he said several pumps were placed in the ship in case a leak 
erupts during towing 
the restoration is designed to return the ship to its appearance 
during its last commissioned service in the pacific theater during 
world war ii 
the texas is toured by about 200000 visitors a year

nearly 800 people turned out for a ceremony 
in memory of people killed in drunken driving accidents including 
one that took 27 lives from this community 
as the names of victims were read out monday relatives and 
friends stepped to a table lighted a candle and took a red 
carnation 
similar services also were held the same day in louisville and in 
frankfort where gov wallace wilkinson promised to ask the 
legislature for tougher penalties for drunken and drugged drivers 
the vigil in radcliff sponsored by mothers against drunk 
drivers held special meaning this year because of the may 14 church 
bus crash that killed 27 people authorities have charged the driver 
of a pickup truck that crashed into the bus with being drunk he 
also was charged with 27 counts of murder and is free on bond 
awaiting trial 
it means a lot to me that people care enough to share respect 
for others who lost their lives said larry flowers 16 of 
radcliff a survivor of that crash on interstate 71 in northern 
kentucky i just wished people realized what damage they do by 
drinking and driving 
among those who spoke at the vigil was christy pearman a 
survivor of the crash her father john was driving the bus owned 
by the radcliff first assembly of god church and was killed 
christy pearman read a poem about her feelings of loss that said 
in part we miss your footsteps on the stairs we miss the way 
that you combed your hair 
dave everhart president of the hardin county chapter of madd 
said police courts the media and other professionals cant wage 
the fight against drunken driving alone 
when we reach enough drunk drivers to make them too aware too 
ashamed or just too afraid to get into vehicles after drinking only 
then can we feel hope for a safe future he said 
wilkinson said he will advocate a law that would make it illegal 
for anyone to operate a motor vehicle with a bloodalcohol level of 
010 or higher current law makes that level a presumption of guilt 
a related regulation would allow law enforcement officers to 
immediately suspend the license of anyone who registered a 
bloodalcohol level of 10 or higher refusal to take a test to 
establish the level would be grounds for seizure of a license

a genetic test sought by a man who 
claimed it would prove he was innocent of killing three teenagers 
has instead linked him to the crime a prosecutor said 
the tests show the odds of it being someone other than ronald 
stephen trimboli are one in 55 billion tarrant county assistant 
district attorney bob gill said 
trimboli who has been jailed since december 1985 has been tried 
twice in the 1985 slayings his first trial ended in a mistrial 
because of juror misconduct and his second ended in a mistrial when 
jurors could not reach a verdict no date has been set for a third

defense lawyers 
in october trimboli told reporters he he had urged his lawyers 
to ask for the tests trimboli said he agreed to the tests even 
after his lawyers warned him that the results are virtually 
foolproof

hungary is taking the soviet bloc lead 
in trimming defense spending and it could have up to one third of 
the 62000 soviet troops stationed on its soil withdrawn by 1991 an 
official was quoted as saying tuesday 
the withdrawals would go ahead under the proposals outlined by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at the united nations last 
week hungary used the gorbachev proposal as a cue to slash military 
spending by 17 percent next year and pension off aging generals 
defense minister colgen ferenc karpati on monday announced 
another soviet bloc move to smooth the path to troop reduction in 
europe saying in a radio interview that the warsaw pact would 
publish all data on troop strengths and armaments before new 
alleuropean conventional force reduction talks begin 
this would remove a major stumbling block that stalled the 
15yearold mutual and balanced force reduction talks in vienna 
the new negotiations involving the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact 
nations are to begin in vienna possibly as early as february 
the west has insisted that warsaw pact troops outnumber those of 
nato and that the soviet bloc countries have more troops than they 
admit officially 
gorbachev announced last week that six tank divisions would be 
withdrawn from hungary czechoslovakia and east germany as part of a 
unilateral reduction of soviet forces by half a million men in the 
next two years 
prior to gorbachevs proposal senior hungarian officials had 
said they would like to be involved in the first stage of any troop 
withdrawals 
newspapers tuesday quoted matyas szueros foreign policy expert 
of the hungarian communist party as saying that hungary may play 
a role of coordinator and be a testing ground in the disarmament of 
conventional weapons 
gorbachevs proposal will mean in the next two years the soviet 
forces stationed in hungary will be cut by a fourth or possibly 
by a third szueros said 
this could mean about 16000 of the 50000 troops to be withdrawn 
from the three countries would be removed from hungary the 
communist party daily npeszabadsag reported last week there are 
62000 soviet troops in hungary 
hungary accepted to be a testing ground for the international 
inspection of the implementation of disarmament measures and it 
considers conceivable even a unilateral disarmament which fits into 
the paneuropean process he said 
defense spending has become a key issue in hungary where a 17 
billion foreign debt and double digit inflation have led to lower 
living standards 
parliamentary deputies have called for reductions of defense 
spending saying the money should go toward improving the social 
network for pensioners big families and the unemployed 
according to independent estimates 15 million of hungarys 106 
million population lives below the accepted 80 minimum monthly 
subsistence income 
karpati announced that more than 50 top army officers including 
10 generals who are over 60 will be retired as of jan 1 
hungary also plans to cut its own defense spending by 17 percent 
in real terms next year 
newspapers reported tuesday that parliaments defense committee 
heard a proposal by the government that appropriations for military 
defense would be cut by nearly 100 million in 1989 a 17 percent 
cut in real terms 
karpati would not say how large hungarian forces are but said 
that estimates by the international institute of strategic studies 
estimate of 105000 was reasonable he said an estimate of 
190000 was too big

a presidential advisory commission today 
recommended a 50 percent pay increase for members of congress and 
similar boosts for federal judges and other top government officials 
but only if congress stops its members from collecting speaking 
fees 
the panel the commission on executive legislative and judicial 
salaries also recommended that the presidents pay which has been 
fixed at 200000 since 1969 be raised by congress to about 
350000 
the commission chairman lloyd cutler noted that the 
governments top 3000 or so workers are paid far less than 
professional athletes and cited a list of major league baseball 
salaries published in todays new york times 
more than 500 of them down to the 200hitting utility 
infielders receive more than a district court judge or a member of 
congress or a deputy secretary of state cutler said 
the pay raises are designed to restore purchasing power of top 
government workers to its level in 1969 the first year their pay 
was set under the commissions advice 
the congressional increase from 89500 to 135000 is also 
designed to wean members of congress from taking honoraria for 
speeches to special interest groups and others 
one commission member former sen thomas eagleton dmo said 
the recommended pay level for lawmakers is an ample fulltime 
salary in return for which we expect congress will outlaw all forms 
of honoraria conceivable to man 
cabinet secretaries pay would go from the current 99500 to 
155000 us district court judges pay would be the same as 
congress going from 89500 to 135000 
cutler noted that federal judges are leaving in droves 
because they can make far more in private practice the average top 
executive branch official leaves for the private sector after 18 
months and even members of congress are deciding not to run for 
reelection because they cant afford to put their kids through 
college he said 
while the pay of most american workers has slightly outpaced 
inflation over the last two decades average top government salaries 
have eroded by 35 percent compared to inflation he told reporters 
the recommendations attach dollar amounts to broad principles 
outlined in a draft report issued by the commission last week in 
which the panel said salaries should generally restore top 
government officials purchasing power to 1969 levels 
the selfstyled citizens lobbying group common cause welcomed the 
recommended pay raises and in particular the recommended ban on 
speaking fees the groups president fred wertheimer said it is 
important that congress include in the ban other ways in which 
special interests can funnel money to lawmakers otherwise he said 
the problem will only surface in another form 
but the national taxpayers union called on president reagan to 
reject the outrageous recommendations this scheme was 
designed to fool the voters and enrich the congress charged the 
groups executive vice president david keating 
as congressional salaries have been held down by political 
forces honoraria have grown in effect making up the difference for 
lawmakers who often must maintain dual homes in their states and in 
washington members of congress may accept up to 2000 per speaking 
engagement up to a limit of 40 percent of their salaries for 
senators and 30 percent for house members 
the process lends itself to abuse rather than waiting for 
speaking invitations some of my colleagues have begun to ask 
people for them giving the appearance of shaking down special 
interest groups said rep barney frank dmass 
others have begun to broker them theyll say i can get you 
an honorarium breakfast for 1000 frank said people 
understand that it looks bad and that in some cases it is bad a 
pattern of abuse has begun to show up it affects 10 percent of the 
people but thats too many 
the commissions formal report is due to be delivered to 
president reagan by thursday reagan then can adopt the 
recommendation or as he did two years ago modify it before 
including it in his budget proposal which is sent to congress on 
jan 9 
under the law the increase will take effect a month later on 
feb 8 unless both the house and senate vote to scotch it for 19 
of those 30 days congress will be out of session leaving only a 
limited time for opponents to act 
during hearings in recent weeks the panel which by law meets 
every four years to review the governments top salary structure 
heard testimony that relatively low pay levels were making it 
difficult to recruit and keep talented people in the executive 
branch on the federal bench and in congress 
the recommendations concern the pay of all 535 members of the 
house and senate about 1100 judges from the supreme court through 
us district courts and about 3000 top executive branch workers 
including cabinet secretaries 
on capitol hill supporters of the congressional pay raise were 
working behind the scenes to dampen potential opposition and allow 
it to take effect automatically in february but a fight over the 
perennially prickly issue appeared almost certain 
i think were all going to have a chance to face up to it 
said senate minority leader bob dole rkan some of the members 
are probably home working on their speeches now 
members of congress always are reluctant to do anything that can 
be seen as raising their own salaries knowing how poorly that sits 
with voters for whom the current pay seems like a lot of money 
thats why the law was crafted to let raises take effect without a 
vote 
our goal would be to reaffirm our belief that a vote is a 
conflict of interest said rep vic fazio dcalif one of the 
few lawmakers willing to lead the charge for a pay increase 
who else votes on their own salaries do teachers or firemen 
we believe there is a broadly bipartisan group of people prepared to 
accept the recommendation fazio said 
when the issue last arose two years ago the commission 
recommended an increase to 135000 which reagan in his budget cut 
to 89500 the senate passed a resolution rejecting even the 
reaganmodified increase but the house delayed its vote until it 
was too late to stop it

three subway buffs happily finished a daylong 
underground tour of new york today after passing through every one 
of the citys 466 subway stations in what was said to be the longest 
subway ride in us history 
the trip took 29 hours 47 minutes and 12 seconds 
this is it said a triumphant rick temple as he and his two 
friends stepped off the no 7 train at the main streetflushing 
station 
the three emerged unscathed their trip unspoiled by muggers 
derailments or any of the other problems that have given the new 
york city subway system an unsavory reputation 
but the finish was not trouble free they had intended to alight 
at the roosevelt avenue station but were forced to double back and 
go to main streetflushing because of service problems 
nor did they complete the trip as swiftly as they had hoped when 
they departed from the jamaicavan wyck station at 620 am monday 
equipped with a camera tape recorder handwarmer books and orange 
juice they had expected to be on the rails for 27 hours 
temple 28 phil vanner 25 and tom murphy 28 planned their 
journey with careful attention to detail including where to buy 
food without passing through a turnstile 
but they intended to limit their intake of food and drink 
explained temples mother janice because there arent too many 
bathrooms in the stations and they dont want to exit 
murphy who works days as a security guard and attends college at 
night and temple and vanner who are computer analysts got a 
chance to break the record because sunday the transit authority 
opened three new stations in queens the first such additions in 20 
years 
with 466 stations and 232 miles of track new york citys subway 
system is easily the nations largest and by some measures 
including the number of cars and stations the worlds largest 
working with schedules and maps the three planned a route that 
allowed them to pass through every station without ever leaving the 
system 
according to the guinness book of world records the fastest trip 
through the new york system is 21 hours 8 minutes and 30 seconds 
set by mayer wiesen and charles emerson on oct 8 1973 
it is a trip many have taken albeit when there still were only 
463 stations boy scout troops have done it to get some kind of 
badge reported bob slovak a spokesman for the ta 
but why really would anyone do such a thing they were jerky 
kids laughed mrs temple now theyre jerky adults

two additional air force cargo planes have been 
ordered to prepare for disaster relief missions to the soviet union 
and a soviet plane that brought nuclear arms inspectors to the 
united states earlier this week is being loaded with emergency 
supplies the pentagon said today 
the relief flights were scheduled as american donations to the 
soviet earthquake relief effort reached 32 million president and 
mrs reagan say theyll make a contribution of their own 
the air force said a c141 cargo plane would leave west germany 
today for pisa italy where it will pick up relief supplies that 
include blankets gloves hard hats and water tanks 
that plane will then fly to the scene of the earthquake at 
yerevan in soviet armenia on wednesday afternoon the pentagon 
added 
a second c141 is being loaded today at andrews air force base 
md outside washington it will carry plastic sheeting to be used 
for temporary shelters and should arrive in russia sometime on 
thursday the pentagon said 
in addition to those scheduled flights an il76 that brought 
inf inspectors into travis air force base calif yesterday to 
observe groundlaunched cruise missile destruction will be 
loaded with medical supplies and equipment for the return trip 
said dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
this represents a waiver of inf treaty provisions by allowing 
the soviet aircraft to remain here an extra day to carry the cargo 
out the red cross in san francisco is coordinating supplies 
the soviet inspectors entered the united states at san francisco 
under terms of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which 
requires the united states and soviet union to destroy all 
intermediate and shorterrange nuclear missiles in their 
inventories 
the scheduling of airlift missions came as the state department 
announced the the official us contribution had grown to 825000 
mostly in transportation costs while private donations totaled 24 
million including a 1 million check handdelivered in moscow by 
armand hammer chairman of occidental petroleum corp 
hammer has been a frequent visitor to the soviet union and has 
done business there for decades 
nancy reagan asked during a press preview of the white house 
christmas decorations whether she and the president had sent money 
replied were going to she did not reveal the amount 
state department spokesman charles redman said worldwide 
contributions to the relief effort totaled 261 million a 
department list showed 14 countries making donations besides the 
united states nine of those countries have military ties with 
washington 
redman suggested that the american response was simply a 
reflection of the magnitude of the disaster in soviet armenia where 
tens of thousands were believed killed and half a million made 
homeless by last weeks temblor 
it really is a tragedy of immense proportions redman said 
the united states was a major contributor of aid to the soviet union 
during world war ii but that relationship ended with the onset of 
the cold war 
the soviets are giving highest priority to donations of medical 
supplies including antibiotics and diagnostic and other clinical 
equipment redman said lower priority is being given to such items 
as blankets tents and food he said 
according to the pentagon the first two plane loads of us 
government aid weighing more than 50 tons arrived in yerevan 
the armenian capital on sunday on board were rations water 
winter clothing and surgical supplies 
redman said a commercially chartered aircraft also arrived in 
yerevan on sunday consisting of among other things dogs and dog 
handlers to help search for earthquake victims also aboard were 
us relief experts and representatives of several armenian groups 
the pentagon said air national guard and air force reserve 
training flights may be pressed into service because they can be 
used to carry private aid without the state department having to 
reimburse the defense department for the costs as is true for state 
departmentordered flights carrying government aid

paintings done in france before world war ii 
and american works done after it dominate a major overhaul of 20th 
century art at the national gallery that opened tuesday and will 
stay a major feature of the museum for the next two years 
the upper level of the gallerys east building which is 
celebrating its 10th anniversary starts with a room of paintings by 
pablo picasso his huge family of saltimbanques tumblers 
nearly eight feet high is the first feature the visitor sees 
jack cowart curator of 20th century art said an effort may be 
made to use computer enhancement to get at a picture that picasso 
painted first on that canvas and then covered with the current one 
the picture underneath can be seen by xrays but present techniques 
would not enable the color to be reproduced he added 
the upper level of the building is devoted almost entirely to 
canvasses painted in france by henri matisse andre derain amedeo 
modigliani georges braque fernand leger and others 
the human condition by the belgian artist rene magritte was 
acquired by the gallery last year and is being shown for the first 
time 
so are two rock settees seats made of polished pink and 
green granite by american sculptor scott burton they come from 
boulders unearthed in cold spring minn 
gallery director j carter brown also announced the gift to the 
gallery of five paintings by the american artist barnett newman who 
died in 1970 just below the street the gallerys concourse level 
has a room showing newmans stations of the cross 
other separate rooms on this level will be devoted to the 
paintings of american artists mark rothko richard diebenkorn 
ellsworth kelly jasper johns and robert rauschenberg works by roy 
lichtenstein and andy warhol share a room 
museum officials said the installation does not try to cover the 
whole field of 20th century art 
were not here to touch every base brown said 
he noted that the gallerys older west building shows a 
collection of earlier american paintings much of it from before 
world war ii nan rosenthal also a curator of 20th century art 
pointed out that other museums in washington specialize in work from 
africa and the orient 
the present installation will be kept until the end of 1990 when 
the national gallery begins to celebrate its 50th anniversary brown 
said changes can be expected then

the earths protective ozone is thinning more 
than expected in northern regions of the globe say scientists who 
on tuesday detailed an intense research effort to try to find out 
the reasons why 
while the socalled ozone hole over the south pole has attracted 
the most media attention a lesser but still significant thinning 
also has been found in the north 
and that has prompted a 10 million sixweek research effort 
starting jan 1 based in stavanger norway the research will 
involve scientists from the united states united kingdom norway 
west germany and denmark 
satellite data show an ozone decline of between 25 percent and 
65 percent in the northernmost areas scientific theory had 
expected a drop of only about 15 percent explained dr dan 
albritton of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
that certainly arches the eyebrows he commented 
while this isnt in the same ballpark with the 30 percent to 50 
percent ozone depletion reported in the antarctic the big 
difference is that people live in the north albritton said 
and for every 1 percent drop in ozone levels of skin cancer can 
rise as much as 2 percent explained dr robert watson of the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
watson and albritton provided details of their planned research 
project at a news conference 
understanding what occurs in the arctic will be much more 
difficult than in the antarctic watson said we are looking for 
subtle changes in a much more variable atmosphere 
chlorine and bromine compounds released into the atmosphere by 
human activities have been blamed for the antarctic ozone loss 
trapped by winds circling the south pole those chemicals take 
advantage of ice clouds in the stratosphere as a location for 
chemical reactions with the ozone when the south pole weather warms 
in the springtime the hole disappears along with the ice clouds 
the arctic is not as bitterly cold as the south pole and the 
high ice clouds form less readily albritton said but these clouds 
still form and can help promote the reactions that damage ozone 
the montreal protocol in which many nations have agreed to take 
actions to eliminate release of chlorofluorocarbons which have been 
blamed for much ozone damage was based on a 15 percent drop in 
arctic ozone albritton noted 
if the scientists confirm the satellite reports of declines two 
to three times higher than 15 percent further steps may be needed 
he said 
the scientists operating from stavanger will use an er2 
longrange high altitude research plane as well as a dc8 aircraft 
instrumented as a flying laboratory 
no less than six computers will analyze data collected by the 
planes balloons satellites and groundbased instruments 
in addition the soviet union will conduct ozone research in its 
northern regions at the same time and later the two groups will 
share data

joel steinbergs exlover testified today at his 
murder trial that she lied to police about bruises on their 
illegally adopted daughter because she wanted to protect him even 
though she believed he had inflicted the bruises 
hedda nussbaum said she told detectives who interviewed her the 
morning that 6yearold lisa steinberg was carried unconscious from 
their apartment that the child had been hit in the head by a 
playmate a few days earlier she said she also told them that lisa 
fell a lot while rollerskating 
ms nussbaum 46 admitted under crossexamination by steinbergs 
lawyer ira london that the statements were either wholly or partly 
lies 
i was trying to create a cover story at the time for what joel 
had done ms nussbaum testified 
london reminded ms nussbaum that she had repeatedly said that 
she had not seen steinberg hit lisa before the girl lost 
consciousness 
the bruises on the body i assumed joel had done she replied 
ms nussbaum had told police that a bruise on the girls forehead 
was the result of a slap from a classmate she testified that while 
lisa had been slapped by a friend she had not seen any bruise until 
later when lisa was taken to the hospital the morning of nov 2 
1987 she died three days later of head injuries 
london concluded his fiveday crossexamination of ms nussbaum 
with two questions that go to the heart of the defense isnt it 
true that you have placed a sanitary cordon around the events to 
protect yourself from a painful memory and isnt it a fact that 
you hare willfully forgotten things and events to falsify your own 
reality 
to both questions ms nussbaum replied no 
steinbergs lawyers appeared to be trying to bolster their claim 
that he was not criminally responsible for lisas death 
london has asked court permission to file an insanity defense 
but judge harold rothwax refused the lawyer has tried to show that 
steinberg actually believed some of the things he told ms nussbaum 
london said a psychiatrist who examined steinberg twice has 
prepared an affidavit saying the defendant has a delusional 
disorder paranoid type and is willing to testify to that in the 
state criminal court trial 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer is charged with fatally beating 
his illegally adopted daughter lisa prosecutors also allege he 
beat ms nussbaum 
interest in the case has become so widespread that much of ms 
nussbaums testimony has been carried live on local television cnn 
carried some of todays and mondays testimony nationally 
ms nussbaums lawyers monday released copies of hundreds of 
support letters they say she has received since taking the stand 
i cant tell you how much my heart has ached for you there 
are so many women across america who are cheering you on wrote 
one woman from pennsylvania 
another writer called her an inspiration to all battered women 
and children across the nation 
ms nussbaum who lived with steinberg for 12 years testified 
monday that steinbergs behavior became more erratic and bizarre as 
his use of cocaine increased in the two months before lisas death 
joel was verbalizing a lot of peculiar ideas unusual things 
telling me stories that seem pretty improbable today ms nussbaum 
said 
things that made no sense asked london 
yes replied ms nussbaum 
she said steinberg told her a number of people were staring at 
him and trying to hypnotize him he also told me he thought people 
had been trying to hypnotize him for years even back when he was in 
the air force 
she said steinberg told her she was not her parents natural 
child and that my father had made a deal with someone in europe 
to get her as a baby 
ms nussbaum also said steinberg called the manhattan district 
attorneys office anonymously in 1984 to complain that i was 
involved with a cult 
she said the cult supposedly hypnotized people and used them 
sexually and steinberg thought she was in the groups thrall 
did you believe you were being manipulated by a cult london 
asked 
i believed it she said adding she now believes steinberg 
used these stories to control her 
ms nussbaum said steinbergs unusual behavior was exacerbated by 
cocaine and that she and steinberg often used the drug around the 
time lisa died 
previously she testified that she and steinberg used cocaine the 
night of nov 1 1987 rather than help lisa who was lying 
unconscious on their bathroom floor lisa was removed from 
steinbergs apartment early the next day by authorities 
steinberg denies that he hit the girl 
the couple raised lisa from birth after acquiring her from an 
unwed long island teenager they never formally adopted her

its no surprise to see texas connections as 
george bush an adopted son of the lone star state puts together 
his administration but a marshall islands connection 
over at bush transition headquarters the texans have competition 
from a network with connections to the sundrenched dirtpoor 
marshall islands two atoll chains in the pacific with a total land 
mass of 70 square miles and a population of 35000 the place where 
the united states tested nuclear weapons for years 
in a town where who you know is often as important as what you 
know the marshalls seem to have friends in high places 
wilfred i kendall the little republics diplomatic 
representative says its good to know someone higher up its 
important 
the marshalls network give an example of how connections and 
contacts are often the grease that make the city run ties are 
formed when people in federal agencies congress and private busines 
are thrown together to work on a single issues 
several officials at the bush transition office are very familiar 
with the islands recent history they worked on negotiations that 
led to independence for the us trust territory in october 1986 
a key contact for kendall is fred m zeder who was chief us 
negotiator of the compact with the marshalls zeder and his wife 
martha are among the presidentelects best friends in april 
zeder accompanied bush his friend nicholas brady the secretary of 
the treasury and sen alan simpson rwyo on a weekend holiday in 
florida 
like bush zeder is a wealthy businessman who moved from 
connecticut to texas he has also lived in hawaii and the nations 
capital in recent years the zeders have given substantial sums to 
support bush politically in 1987 federal records show they each 
gave the maximum permitted 5000 to bushs political action 
committee additionally zeder gave 11000 this year to the 
republican national committee 
zeder and james baker iii the texan designated to be the 
secretary of state are the highestpaid people at transition with 
salaries at an annual rate of about 71000 
alixe glen a spokeswoman for the transition said zeder is 
mostly working on appointments and personnel especially those 
for the interior department where he once worked 
zeders son howard is the marshalls maritime commissioner and 
partowner of a company that operates the republics new 
shipflagging registry the registry was partly financed with us 
development aid 
such an operation under which ships fly the flag of the 
countries in which they are registered even though the vessels may 
be owned by citizens of other countries can be remunerative for 
example liberias registry the worlds largest brings in between 
30 million and 40 million a year 
another friend of the marshalls is peter s watson a new 
zealandborn attorney who represents the republic in his private law 
practice watson who became an american citizen less than a year 
ago is lending a hand on ethics and legal issues at the transition 
howard hills a lawyer at the state department handling marshalls 
business is dealing with logistics while on leave at the 
transition hills who worked with zeder when the reagan 
administration was pushing the compact with the marshalls recently 
spoke at a reception in new york tossed by the ship registry 
manase mansur a staffer at the house interior and insular 
affairs committee the panel that supervised legislation on the 
marshalls atoll chain also has a position in the transitions 
administrative office 
glen said the men perform different functions at the office but 
dont work on issues affecting the marshalls all except mansur are 
listed as paid employees of the transition 
zeder was the subject of criticism after the compact with the 
marshalls was ratified 
what has irked some is an arrangement in which zeders son became 
the marshalls maritime commissioner as well as having a financial 
stake in the ship registry in october majestic shipping corp 
became the first company to fly the marshalls flags 
the arrangement would have been barred if former rep john 
seiberling dohio an exmember of the interior committee had had 
his way 
seiberling sought unsuccessfully to insert language in the 
compact that would have ensured nobody who worked on negotiations 
could receive or be part of any contract under which they would 
receive funds from the freely associated states the ban also 
would have applied to family members of people involved 
we wanted to make clear that nobody was going to profit from 
any deals that were made he said in a telephone interview 
seiberling retired from the house in 1986 
neither howard zeder nor watson who has served as a spokesman 
for the marshalls and for the registry will reveal the financial 
details of the private company that operates the ship registry 
watson is associated with the law firm of coudert bros 
howard zeder sees the registry as a key element of a plan to 
develop the impoverished marshalls this is one of the few 
ventures that has real development potential for the islands he 
said

nelson mandela is in total 
isolation at his new prison farm house his attorney said tuesday 
after the african national congress leader met with his wife winnie 
mrs mandela her daughter zinzi and three grandchildren made 
their first visit to the victor verster prison outside cape town 
where mandela was moved to a prison staff house last week 
the family is allowed unlimited access to mandela but mrs 
mandela visited for only 80 minutes saying they wont accept 
special privileges from the government until all political prisoners 
receive the same treatment 
attorney ismail ayob speaking on behalf of mrs mandela told a 
news conference afterward this is not freedom the move is in 
fact a retrogressive step mr mandela now has no contact at all 
with any of his jailed anc colleagues 
mrs mandela attended the news conference with ayob but did not 
speak 
the mandela family felt saddened and particularly hurt today 
when they saw what has happened to mr mandela ayob said he is 
in a house surrounded by a great many prison officials it is a 
cruel situation that he is in total isolation 
ayob accompanied mrs mandela to the prison gate but wasnt 
allowed to see mandela because authorities had not responded to his 
request for a visit 
mandelas house complete with a swimming pool in on a remote 
part of the prison complex closer to a private game reserve full of 
zebra and giraffe than the main prison building 
some whites have written letters to south african newspapers 
expressing outrage that a prisoner is being kept in such 
luxurious conditions 
however ayob noted that mandela had no say over his move i 
dont even think he can swim said ayob 
mandela the countrys best known black leader has been 
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the government 
mandela 70 contracted tuberculosis in august but has recovered 
following three months in a hospital the governments decision not 
to send him back to prison appears part of phased release designed 
to calm the public clamor over his possible freedom 
by placing mandela in a special house however the government 
has underscored mandelas special stature 
the government has expressed concern that if mandela was released 
unexpectedly the move could reignite widespread black protest that 
has largely been silenced under a 30month state of emergency the 
government also is worried that freeing mandela could unleash a 
violent backlash by rightwing whites 
in a related development tuesday recently released activist 
zwelakhe sisulu visited pollsmoor prison in cape town to see his 
father walter sisulu a leading anc figure and close colleague of 
mandela 
zwelakhe sisulu editor of the new nation newspaper was released 
from detention dec 2 after being held for two years without charge 
walter sisulu was convicted with mandela at the same trial in 1964 
and is serving a life sentence 
zwelakhe sisulu is under severe restrictions that bar him from 
working as a journalist participating in politics or talking to 
the media

paramedics called to treat an asthmatic 9yearold 
boy left a city housing project when their ambulance was pelted by 
eggs and returned with police too late to save the boy authorities 
said today 
paramedics were unable to revive carl jarnagin who died a short 
time later at a hospital said bill crowley a chicago fire 
department spokesman 
the two paramedics first summoned by an emergency call at 416 
pm monday were not aware of the seriousness of the boys health 
problem when they arrived at the chicago housing authority building 
on the citys south side crowley said 
crowley was uncertain when the ambulance first arrived at the 
dearborn homes project but said it left at 428 pm 
there were different objects hitting the vehicle and there was 
egg on the windshield projectiles maybe stones were hitting the 
vehicle crowley said for that reason it was decided to 
leave 
he said he did not know where the objects were coming from or 
who was throwing them 
some building residents disputed the story saying the paramedics 
initially refused to enter the building though nothing was being 
thrown at them 
sandra falls 26 a secretary for the chas local advisory 
council at the dearborn homes said residents told her nothing was 
thrown at the vehicle but instead ambulance workers refused to 
enter the building for 15 to 20 minutes even with police there 
there was no one throwing rocks out the window added randy 
taylor a building resident there was just i think fear of the 
black community 
crowley did not immediately know the races of the paramedics 
building residents are overwhelmingly black 
police received a call for help from the fire department at 421 
pm said officer charles marschke police entered the fifthfloor 
apartment found the boy unresponsive on the floor in a bedroom 
tried to revive him and put out a call for the paramedics to return 
the police report did not mention whether the ambulance had been 
attacked he said 
according to crowley police arrived at the apartment project at 
434 pm and the ambulance returned at 440 pm paramedics worked 
to revive the boy for 30 minutes before taking him to mercy 
hospital where he died crowley said 
the fire department will investigate the incident he said 
well pull our radio tapes and speak to people and try to get a 
blowbyblow of what happened 
paramedics often are accompanied to cha buildings by police or a 
fire unit making the trip into some highcrime areas safer crowley 
said 
going into the projects alone is a problem he said with 
only two unassisted paramedics at a scene where they are likely to 
encounter hostility he added the possibility certainly exists of 
them getting injured 
it was so frustrating for them that this child passed away 
crowley said so many times you go to the scene and its something 
very minor

plo chairman yasser arafat today offered a 
threepoint peace plan calling for negotiations with israel at an 
international peace conference and un supervision of 
israelioccupied territories 
in a longawaited speech to a special session of the un general 
assembly arafat referred specifically to israel several times and 
directly appealed to israeli leaders to join peace talks 
i ask the leaders of israel to come here under the sponsorship 
of the united nations so that together we can forge that peace 
arafat said 
he also appealed to the israeli people come he said let 
us make the peace of the bold far from the arrogance of power and 
the weapons of destruction far from the occupation and oppression 
and humiliation and murder and torture 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir dismissed arafats 
initiatives saying the plo had not changed its policy of terror he 
called on washington not to recognize the plo 
we know what hides behind his arafats words shamir told a 
news conference we know that as they are spoken acts of terror 
continue he cited an incident today in which a palestinian shot 
and killed two israelis in the occupied west bank 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
arafat failed to meet conditions for opening a dialogue with the 
united states because his speech did not clearly recognize israels 
right to exist 
the speech contained some interesting and positive 
developments redman said but continued to be ambiguous on key 
issues including recognition of israel renunciation of 
terrorism and acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 
arafats threepoint plan called first for a serious effort 
to convene an international peace conference in geneva under un 
auspices 
his second point urged that occupied palestinian land be 
placed under temporary un supervision that peacekeeping forces be 
deployed and that israeli troops withdraw he did not say if he was 
referring to the west bank and gaza strip occupied by israel in 
1967 
arafats third point called for a comprehensive settlement 
among all parties to the arabisraeli conflict including the 
state of palestine israel and other neighbors within the framework 
of the international conference 
he said the conference should be conducted on the basis of 
resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and the 
balance of interests especially our peoples rights in freedom 
national independence and respect for the right to exist in peace 
and security for all the un resolutions provide for all 
countries in the region to exist within secure borders 
immediately afterward moshe raviv of israels foreign ministry 
criticized arafats speech as evasive rhetoric and repeated 
israels claim that an independent palestinian state is an obstacle 
to peace 
yohanan bein israels un ambassador said he saw nothing new 
in arafats remarks 
there was more ambiguity in this speech than in algiers he 
said referring to arafats address last month to the palestine 
national council i do not see any major departure ambiguity 
and more ambiguity 
arafats speech expanded on palestinian proposals for middle east 
peace and appeared to be a bid to gain us support 
he said the palestine national council at its algiers meeting in 
november had rejected terrorism in all its forms including state 
terrorism 
israel said after that meeting that the council had not 
recognized israel explicitly and the declarations did not warrant 
opening a dialogue with the plo which it views as a terrorist group 
arafat wearing his traditional khaki military uniform and 
blackandwhite checkered arab headdress spoke in arabic for an 
hour and 20 minutes delegates in the hall applauded for nearly a 
minute afterwards 
an english text of the speech was distributed by plo officials 
after arafat spoke 
earlier in his speech arafat thanked countries that supported 
his right to address the world body in geneva after the united 
states denied him a visa preventing him from speaking at un 
headquarters in new york 
he also thanked the countries of western europe and japan for 
their recent stand following the palestine liberation organizations 
declaration of independence in algiers 
in israel radio reports had said that after arafats speech the 
united states would announce it accepted the plo as a partner in 
middle east peace talks 
the reports on israeli radio and army radio said the plo chiefs 
speech was submitted to american officials and arafat agreed to 
change the language to meet us conditions of recognizing israeli 
and renouncing terrorism 
israel criticized the un decision to invite arafat to speak and 
cited 10 terrorist attacks in which he allegedly had direct 
involvement 
arafat last addressed the general assembly in 1974 in new york 
delegates of at least 92 countries including the united states 
were due to address the session in geneva the delegates included 18 
foreign ministers or deputy foreign ministers mostly from third 
world and communist countries 
about 70 countries mostly third world and communist have 
recognized the palestinian state 
arafats cause appears to have been strengthened by persistent 
palestinian unrest in the west bank and gaza strip more than 300 
palestinians and a dozen israelis have been killed in the revolt 
the palestine national council meeting in algiers implicitly 
recognized israel and arafat said in stockholm last week the plo 
would accept an arab state and a jewish state israel side by 
side 
while some european countries praised the plo for moderating its 
stand israeli and us officials said the latest statements did not 
meet preconditions for talks with the plo clear recognition of 
israels right to exist and renunciation of terrorism

pentagon auditors will expand a review of top 
military contractors that already has found us taxpayers are being 
billed for millions of dollars in questionable consulting fees 
officials said tuesday 
the first investigation covered a dozen contractors but the new 
review will look at 18 more over the next 10 weeks said william 
reed director of the defense contract audit agency 
the review was ordered by defense secretary frank c carlucci in 
the wake of the justice departments ongoing investigation of 
possible fraud and bribery involving defense contractors 
that investigation codenamed ill wind has not yet produced 
any indictments it centers on the use of consultants employed by 
defense firms to win pentagon contracts worth billions of dollars 
reed said the review of the dozen firms found that contractors 
were spending considerable sums supplementing virtually every 
inhouse activity with professional and consultant services 
the pentagon was billed by the dozen firms for 237 million worth 
of consultanting fees over the past year reed said of that total 
investigators found that 576 million was questionable and the 
contractors are being asked to provide more support for the claims 
most of these questionable expenditures represent claimed costs 
where the contractor could not produce evidence of services 
rendered or to a lesser degree could not produce written 
agreements as to the value of and type service being purchased 
reed said 
normally contractors pay consultants from their own funds and 
then bill the pentagon for reimbursement 
reed did not name the dozen companies and said he was withholding 
the information because the cases were still under discussion about 
allowable costs 
reed made his statements before the senate government affairs 
federal service subcommittee which is chaired by sen david pryor 
dark 
pryor said consultants do legitimate jobs but he added that 
the ill wind probe suggests that consultants may also be involved 
in criminal activities involving bribery fraud collusive bidding 
and trafficking in confidential material 
one of the biggest problems pryor admitted is coming up with a 
definition of a consultant 
reed agreed at the onset of our review we encountered 
significant difficulty in isolating consultant services and costs 
due to the lack of a universally accepted definition of the term 
pryor criticized the administrations policy of having 
contractors police themselves administration officials have 
testified to congress that defense firms are being asked to do a 
better more thorough job of making sure all their expenses are 
justified 
the pentagon audit suggests that the much ballyhooed theory of 
this administration that defense contractors will police themselves 
without strict controls is a pipe dream pryor said 
reed said his agency was urging some changes in federal 
regulations governing allowable costs 
in the wake of the public announcement about the ill wind 
investigation carlucci wrote to the top 200 defense contractors 
urging them to tighten their controls on consultants 
since the pentagons audit of the dozen companies carlucci has 
written again to the companies to urge them to act said eleanor 
spector deputy assistant secretary of defense for procurement

prime minister yitzhak shamir saying the plo 
had not changed its terrorist ways today rejected yasser arafats 
peace initiatives and called on the united states to withhold 
recognition of the plo 
we know what hides behind his arafats words shamir told a 
news conference after arafat addressed the un general assemby in 
geneva we know that as they are spoken acts of terror continue 
shortly before he spoke israeli officials announced that a 
palestinian in the west bank had shot to death two israelis after 
seizing a gun from a jewish settler the palestinian also was killed 
referring to the incident shamir said what happened is another 
illustration of a decision by the hostile circles in the plo to 
continue their violence 
calling on washington to withhold recognition of the palestine 
liberation organization shamir said that in his speech arafat spoke 
favorably of a war of liberation and stopped short of 
recognizing israel 
i hope that as long as these conditions are not met the united 
states will not recognize the plo shamir said 
he said he was ready for peace talks with arab states and 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip but not the 
plo 
foreign minister shimon peres shamirs political rival in the 
coalition government had no immediate comment on arafats speech 
however the liberal citizens rights movement which was aligned 
with the labor party in the recent parliament elections called on 
both the us and israeli governments to start talks with the plo 
the israeli government must now put the plo to the test and 
propose peace negotaitions it said as long as the government 
refuses to recognize the significant changes in the plo position 
then the american administration should recognize the changes meet 
arafat and advance the cause of peace in our region 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
arafat did not meet conditions for opening a dialogue with the 
united states because he did not clearly state plo recognition of 
israel 
israeli radios had reported earlier today that the us 
government was expected to announce after arafats speech that it 
accepted the plo as a partner in middle east peace talks 
however the radio reports said the us decision was contingent 
on arafat meeting us conditions in his un speech in geneva 
to us officials the three key conditions for opening a 
dialogue with the plo are acceptance of 1967 and 1973 un security 
council resolutions asserting the right of all middle eastern states 
to live within secure borders explicit plo recognition of israel 
and renunciation of terrorism 
us officials reportedly proposed some alterations in language 
after requesting and receiving the speech in advance israel radio 
said the united states was told the changes had been accepted 
today several dozen palestinians drinking steaming cups of 
sweet tea and coffee listened to arafats speech broadcast on the 
frenchrun monte carlo radio at the hakawati theater in east 
jerusalem 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab said arafat had challenged 
israel to join a peace process there are now no more excuses for 
israel not to give a positive response to this message of peace 
he said explicit recognition was not possible because it meant 
recognizing israel with specific borders which should be determined 
in negotiations 
spelling out such specific boundaries could be detrimental to 
negotiations arafat is leaving the boundaries open to 
negotiations said kuttab

britain and ireland clashed bitterly over the irish 
attorney generals refusal tuesday to extradite an irish catholic 
priest wanted on terrorism charges 
raising an 18dayold confrontation over the rev patrick ryan to 
a new pitch the irish said the priest would not get a fair trial in 
britain and prime minister margaret thatcher called that a great 
insult to all of the people of this country 
mrs thatcher in an angry response in the house of commons said 
we repudiate utterly the irish attorney generals assertion that 
ryan would not be fairly tried before a british jury 
attorney general john murray said british politicians and 
newspapers had prejudiced his trial by attacking him in 
intemperate language and frequently in the form of extravagantly 
worded headlines 
they raised the case to a unique status and can only have 
intensified the impact and lasting effect on members of the public 
of what was being published he said 
he added that statements in the british parliament must 
because of their origin carry particular weight with potential 
jurors 
ryan in a statement read to reporters by family and supporters 
in dundrum county tipperary called murrays decision a victory 
for all 
answering parliamentary questions mrs thatcher said murrays 
decision meant that someone accused of very serious crimes will be 
at liberty in the irish republic 
we repudiate utterly the assertion that patrick ryan would not 
receive a fair trial in this country of course he would she 
said adding 
to arrest anyone on charges of that nature is inevitably going 
to be receiving frontpage treatment and it will be a matter for the 
courts if there were any prejudice to the trial 
but the headlines would have died down long before the case came 
to trial she said 
the ryan affair has plunged britain into confrontation with two 
countries belgium for failing to extradite him when he was arrested 
there and ireland for letting him go free after the belgians flew 
him home 
ryan 58 says he is innocent britain suspects him of serving 
the irish republican army in its war to rid northern ireland of 
british rule and wants him on four warrants alleging conpiracy to 
murder and cause explosions and possessing explosives 
murray said ryan might face trial in ireland on terrorism 
charges and added he had asked the british for the file of evidence 
on him but mrs thatcher said an irish court would hear only two of 
the charges and there will be problems about security of 
witnesses 
ryans statement said that if ireland tried him they will be 
acting on behalf of the british government i will resist in the 
same way i resisted my extradition 
mrs thatcher said the 1987 angloirish extradition treaty was 
not working satisfactorily because dublin had unilaterally 
changed it to make extraditions contingent not upon the courts but 
upon the attorney generals approval 
when ryan was arrested in his brussels apartment in june police 
said he had a forged passport and manuals on making bombs he also 
was linked to the purchase in 1975 of a timer that later was used in 
a bomb 
ryan fasted for three weeks in his cell to protest extradition 
and although the belgian court ruled against him the brussels 
government decided the extradition papers were flawed and flew him 
to ireland on nov 25 
ryan checked into a clinic outside dublin disappeared three days 
later and remains in an undisclosed place of refuge with a 
religious order 
he was suspended by his order in 1974 after he refused a transfer 
to a parish church in england and said he would rather work on 
behalf of families of irish nationalists dead or jailed in northern 
ireland 
ryans cousin tom ryan insisted to the british broadcasting 
corp that the priests only crime was to feed and clothe families 
in northern ireland who had lost their main breadwinner 
ryans work might relieve pressure on the iras funds he said 
but that kind of guilt is on a whole lot of us here thousands of 
us he said

rescue workers said today they believe all bodies 
have been recovered from the wreckage of a threetrain crash in 
south london that killed 33 people and injured more than 100 
railway officials said mondays accident near clapham junction 
one of europes busiest rail stations may have been the result of a 
signal mixup caused by work being done on the line 
opposition politicians and consumer groups said lax safety 
measures and overcrowded trains were underlying causes of the 
morning rushhour crash 
a crowded commuter train plowed into the rear of a stationary 
passenger train an empty freight train coming in the opposite 
direction on a parallel track then hit wreckage from the first crash 
more than 110 of the estimated 1500 passengers on the trains 
were hospitalized 32 suffering serious injuries including multiple 
fractures crushed abdomens and amputations hospital and ambulance 
officials said 
bodies were cut in half limbs were thrown around by the 
impact physician robin winch said 
the condition of the bodies caused officials to repeatedly change 
the official death toll from the crash on monday night officials 
said 36 people died but tonight scotland yard revised the death 
toll to 33 saying the discrepancy was caused by the mutilated state 
of some of the bodies 
rescuers aided by arc lights and cranes worked until dawn today 
to clear debris from the crash britains worst rail disaster since 
43 people died when a subway train crashed in a london tunnel in 
1975 
a british rail spokesman who requested anonymity said officials 
hoped to have commuter trains running again by tonights rush hour 
and at least some trains running through the accident area 
the duchess of york and prime minister margaret thatcher 
separately visited the injured at st georges hospital 
allison killerby a 26yearold clerk who suffered deep gashes 
across her nose and forehead recalled 
i saw peoples legs and arms and heard them screaming for help 
in one way i wish i had been unconscious so i wouldnt remember 
it all so clearly 
eight of the 20 cars overturned and three were hurled into the 
air some passengers were trapped up to four hours 
ronald arlette 52 who was on the stationary train said 
there was an almighty bang like an explosion the carriage went 
up and we flew over and over 
strangely enough nobody panicked he said i know it 
sounds strange but we just lay there and we had a laugh and a bit 
of a joke with each other it just seemed the best thing to do to 
keep our spirits up 
the british railways board said preliminary investigations 
suggested the crash may have been due to a signal failure associated 
with modernization of the lines 40yearold signaling equipment 
the railways board said it ordered an internal inquiry into the 
accident and transport secretary paul channon announced an 
independent public inquiry 
i dont think the actions of the drivers will be significant in 
our inquiry gordon pettitt general manager of british rails 
southern region said the fault that we had today was associated 
with resignaling work in hand rather than a basic fault in the 
signaling system itself 
he would not confirm one television report that a signaling 
expert had found a loose wire that could have caused random signals 
green red or yellow to be displayed to approaching trains 
the resignaling at clapham junction is part of a 37 million 
project begun a year ago to modernize the equipment on the line 
transport minister michael portillo said the project was evidence 
that neglect did not play a part in the crash 
the investment that is going on into british rail at the moment 
is really at a record level theres been a huge amount over recent 
years theres an enormous amount planned for years to come he 
told the associated press 
i see no evidence at all to suggest that any economy measures 
have contributed to this accident 
others disagreed 
the system has been creaking at the seams for so long that 
something had to give said john stewart policy coordinator for 
capital a public transport pressure group 
john prescott the opposition labor partys transport spokesman 
cited a department of transport report which he said concluded 
deaths and serious injuries on trains had risen 62 percent and 
collisions 18 percent since 1982 
the railways board said the staterun british rail network 
accepted full responsibility for the disaster it said claims for 
compensation from relatives of the dead and from those injured would 
be dealt with quickly no amounts were stated

plo chairman yasser arafats un speech on the 
outlook for peace in the middle east contained some interesting 
and positive elements but failed to meet us conditions for a 
dialogue with the palestinian organization the state department 
said today 
these issues must be handled squarely and without ambiguity 
spokesman charles e redman said 
meanwhile the us official disclosed that the state department 
working through unspecified third parties attempted to persuade 
arafat before the speech to meet the us conditions for a dialogue 
israeli sources disclosed that secretary of state george p 
shultz had notified ambassador moshe arad monday night that if the 
conditions were met the united states was prepared to deal with the 
plo 
shultz and charles hill a close aide who had served in the us 
embassy in tel aviv both called arad to inform him of the 
diplomatic exchanges said the sources who insisted on anonymity 
us policy prohibits diplomatic contacts with the plo until it 
accepts israels right to exist redman said the united states was 
simply responding to requests from third parties he did not 
identify them on the specifics of the american conditions for 
a dialogue 
these are explicit recognition of israels right to exist 
acceptance of 1967 and 1973 un security council resolutions 
upholding the right of all states to live within secure borders and 
renunciation of terrorism 
asked whether his administration would meet with the plo as a 
result of arafats un speech presidentelect bush said no 
weve got to get a much clearer statement of everything 
bush said the three us conditions would have to be met i 
would welcome any progress but its got to be clear on these three 
specific points he told reporters during a picturetaking session 
as he met with carlos andres perez the presidentelect of venezuela 
redman said the speech contained interesting and positive 
aspects but there were problems with all three us 
requirements for a substantive dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization 
the spokesman specified as positive the overall tone of the 
speech and some movement by arafat on the two resolutions 
redman did not elaborate 
we listened carefully to the speech redman said there 
were some interesting and positive developments but it continued to 
be ambiguous

a former wrightpatterson air force base 
radiation safety officer was placed on probation by a federal judge 
tuesday on a charge that stemmed from a 1986 spill of radioactive 
material at the base 
us district judge walter rice ordered james w lewis 62 of 
enon to serve two years probation on a charge of illegally 
possessing highly radioactive americium 
rice also ordered lewis to pay 50 to a victims compensation 
fund and to perform 200 hours of community service 
rice said he believed lewis was guilty mainly of a lapse in 
judgment 
he is not a criminal said rice he is a good decent man 
lewis pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly possessing a 
quantity of unsealed radioactive americium that was not authorized 
by the nuclear regulatory commission prosecutors dropped a charge 
of making a false statement to the nrc 
lewis could have been sentenced to two years in prison fined as 
much as 250000 and ordered to pay full restitution 
according to a statement submitted to the court lewis on june 
15 1978 received a drum from newark jeweler jc haynes that 
contained lab waste contaminated with what lewis thought were trace 
amounts of americium lewis agreed to accept and transport the drum 
to wrightpatterson where it was stored with other radioactive 
materials at the base 
no one was injured in the spill of the radioactive powder but a 
radiological safety officer said tests showed that one air force 
officer inhaled a small quantity of the material the spill resulted 
in a 1 million cleanup 
the powder initially leaked from an unlabeled barrel at the base 
while four workers were taking inventory sept 18 1986 the powder 
is not considered dangerous to the skin but can cause cancer if it 
is swallowed or inhaled experts say 
the workers later washed themselves under a spigot at a boy scout 
camp at the base air force officials said there was no 
contamination there but as a precaution offered to test hundreds of 
boy scouts who had camped there 
a second spill of americium occurred oct 6 1986 
revelations of the spill one year after it happened touched off 
allegations of a coverup by air force officials and prompted a us 
senate governmental affairs committee hearing near the base

ghulam ishaq khan the senior 
statesman credited with guiding pakistan back to democracy became 
pakistans eighth president tuesday following a landslide victory 
reflecting his broadbased support 
chief justice abdul haleem administered the oath of office during 
a 15minute ceremony in the mirrored hall of the presidency a 
modern building that sits between the two houses of parliament 
he was to address a joint session of the legislature wednesday 
on monday the 73yearold former senate chairman captured 78 
percent of 446 electoral votes cast by members of the senate 
national assembly and the four provincial assemblies they acted as 
an electoral college 
ishaq khan was the only one of four candidates who had the 
support of prime minister benazir bhuttos leftleaning pakistan 
peoples party and its conservative opposition led by ishaq khans 
own muslim league party 
pakistanis of almost all political stripes have credited the 
senior statesman with evenhandedly guiding the country back to 
democracy from 11 years of autocracy and martial law under late 
president mohammed zia ulhaq 
zia died in an aug 17 military plane crash investigators 
concluded the plane was sabotaged but did not say by whom 
ishaq khan automatically became head of state but mondays vote 
confirmed him for a full fiveyear term 
on monday ms bhuttos government also sailed through its first 
confidence motion in parliament with 73 percent among members 
attending 
she and ishaq khan have expressed mutual admiration but ms 
bhutto has called for the repeal of a 1985 constitutional amendment 
authored by zia that gives the president broad discretionary powers 
such a repeal would restore the prime ministerial system in 
effect during the 1970s when her father zulfikar ali bhutto was 
head of government 
zia overthrew bhutto in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged 
two years laters on conviction of plotting to murder a political 
opponent 
ishaq khan has not commented publicly on the repeal issue and ms 
bhutto 35 has yet to test support for it in parliament 
pakistans election process began with midnovember national and 
local polls 
it will be completed with byelections sometime in january to 
fill disputed seats or those from districts where a candidate died 
during the campaign

a pit bull that fatally mauled a 6monthold 
girl had been owned by the girls father since it was a puppy and 
was resentful of the attention the baby was getting according to a 
neighbors son 
i think the dog was just jealous said timothy douglas whose 
mother lives next door to amber haverstocks parents greg and 
carrie haverstock vergara it was a house dog who never acted like 
a pit bull 
amber the vergaras only child died sunday in childrens 
hospital medical center at akron five hours after being attacked by 
the familys 5yearold 60pound american pit bull witnesses say 
the dog apparently wanted to eat half a cookie the girl had received 
from her mother 
douglas 17 said the vergaras lived in california until moving 
into a canton duplex about a month ago they were loving parents 
and one of them was always with the baby douglas said 
summit county coroner william cox said the 24pound baby died of 
heart and lung failure caused by injuries stemming from the bites 
i have heard of deaths like this but i never expected to see 
injuries so severe cox said in a published report its just 
overwhelming to realize that these injuries came from a dog 
private services for the baby will be at 11 am wednesday 
city prosecutor john poulos said monday that an investigation 
into the incident will be completed after the babys funeral 
canton health commissioner robert pattison ordered the dog 
quarantined at the stark county animal control center where it is 
being observed for rabies he said health department and animal 
control workers will meet with poulos to determine whether the dog 
should be destroyed before the normal quarantine of 10 days elapses

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade shrank to 3089 billion from july through september the 
smallest imbalance in three years the government reported tuesday 
while the reagan administration said the decline was proof that 
its efforts to solve the countrys trade problems were bearing 
fruit private economists expressed fears that the trade improvement 
was in danger of stalling next year 
the commerce department report said americas deficit in its 
current account narrowed by 84 percent after an 86 percent drop in 
the second quarter when the current account deficit was 337 
billion 
the current account also known as the countrys balance of 
payments is the most important trade statistic because it measures 
not only trade in merchandise but also trade in investments and 
other services 
half of the improvement in the third quarter came from a decline 
in the merchandise trade deficit which dropped to 285 billion 
reflecting a record level of us export sales 
the other half of the improvement came from a swing in the 
services category back into surplus services which primarily 
reflect investment flows between countries posted a deficit of 837 
million in the second quarter the first investment deficit in 30 
years 
in the third quarter services climbed back into the black with a 
757 million surplus reflecting increased earnings by us 
companies on their overseas operations but economists warned that 
the investment category soon will sink back into deficit as america 
is forced to service a growing foreign debt burden 
the third quarter deficit was the smallest imbalance since a 
276 billion deficit in the third quarter of 1985 
for the first nine months of this year the current account 
deficit has been running at an annual rate 12 percent below the 
record 15396 billion imbalance run up in 1987 
the reagan administration has credited this improvement with 
providing the country with almost half of its overall economic 
growth this year as us manufacturers have hired more workers and 
stepped up production to meet a 27 percent jump in export sales 
but jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association 
of manufacturers said the big export gains could be ending unless 
the new administration aggressively pursues efforts to open foreign 
markets to us goods 
the bush administration is going to have to hit the ground 
running on trade policy jasinowski said unless policymakers 
cooperate we face the danger of a midpoint stall and a large trade 
deficit that will continue to plague us far into the next decade 
the government on wednesday was scheduled to release its estimate 
of the monthly merchandise trade deficit for october in advance of 
the report david wyss an economist with data resources inc 
predicted the october merchandise deficit would total 105 billion 
the same as the september level he said the deficits were likely to 
be stuck at this level until the dollar declines further 
financial markets were braced for any unexpected widening of the 
deficit which at times in the past has sparked a selloff of us 
investments by foreign investors and sent the dollar into a tailspin 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner one of the 
administrations top trade experts said predictions that trade 
would not show significant improvements next year were too 
pessimistic 
the united states is now quite competitive in the world and as 
the worlds economy keeps growing we will recoup some of the 
business that we lost during the period when the dollar soared to 
record levels ortner said 
the current account reflects the amount of money that the united 
states is transferring into the hands of foreigners to pay for its 
trade deficit in this decade americans have handed over billions 
of dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods 
that development has transformed the united states from the 
worlds largest creditor country a position now held by japan to 
the worlds largest debtor country 
simply put that means foreigners now own more in us 
investments than americans hold in overseas investments at the end 
of last year americas net debt had grown to 3682 billion 
according to commerce department figures the current account 
deficits this year are expected to push that debt total to above 
500 billion 
the countrys continuing need to finance its trade deficits with 
foreign investment is likely to be the biggest economic problem 
facing presidentelect bush 
the dollar fell sharply in the days following the presidential 
election as foreign investors feared that bushs notax pledge and 
the larger democratic majorities insured further deadlock on 
resolving the federal budget deficit 
to reassure jittery markets bush has been pledging at every 
opportunity that he views tackling the budget deficit as his top 
priority 
for the third quarter the deficit in merchandise trade declined 
to 2853 billion its third consecutive quarterly improvement 
added to this figure was an increase to 312 billion in us 
foreign aid and pension payments overseas 
the small 757 million surplus in investments and other services 
is subtracted from those deficit figures to arrive at the current 
account deficit of 3089 billion

the space shuttle atlantis today 
completed its piggyback ride across the country atop a special 
boeing 747 returning to its florida launch site a week after 
completing its classified military mission 
the specially modified 747 with the atlantis on top of it arrived 
at the kennedy space center after a threehop flight across the 
country from edwards air force base calif the shuttles landing 
site 
the shuttle left edwards in the mojave desert on sunday and 
stopped at davismonthan air force base near tucson ariz 
overnight before flying on to kelly air force base near san antonio 
on monday it remained there overnight before departing for florida 
during the fourday flight the crew of the atlantis deployed a 
spy satellite according to sources close to the mission 
the weather was a concern for the shuttles trip back to florida 
with officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
concerned that flying through rain could damage the thousands of 
ceramic tiles on the shuttles belly the tiles ward off the extreme 
heat of reentry into the earths atmosphere 
an airconditioning heating and filtering unit was flown from 
davismonthan and hooked up to the shuttle to maintain its 
temperature and filter the air inside the orbiter 
atlantis was the second shuttle flight since missions resumed in 
september following the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster which 
claimed the lives of seven astronauts

the aids virus can lie dormant longer than has 
been thought in children infected as newborns implying that a 
large population of such children have yet to develop the 
disease a new study asserts 
statistical analysis of children infected as newborns suggests 
that of those who will develop aids by age 104 half may remain 
healthy until age 48 researchers said 
about 20 percent will develop aids within the first year of life 
and the rest at about 8 percent a year the analysis suggested 
such incubation periods are longer than those previously reported 
in children and strongly suggest there is a large population of 
children who are infected but not yet diagnosed with aids 
researchers wrote in the british journal nature 
but they cautioned that their estimates are subject to 
substantial error because of lack of solid information about 
incubation periods of the aids virus 
one researcher also said it is unclear what fraction of infected 
newborns the projections apply to because nobody knows what 
fraction develops aids by age 104 the cutoff used in the study 
we cannot make any inferences for incubation periods longer 
than 104 years because the disease is too new said ivan auger of 
the new york state department of health 
he described the work in last weeks nature with colleagues at 
the department the new york city health department and the harvard 
school of public health 
they developed statistical analyses from the records of 215 
children with aids who had apparently been infected by their 
mothers which can occur during pregnancy or delivery 
currently most infected newborns who develop aids are diagnosed 
by age 2 said margaret oxtoby of the federal centers for disease 
control other children have reached ages 7 or 8 before developing 
symptoms she said 
but the true distribution of incubation periods in children is 
not yet known she said current observations underestimate it 
because the disease is relatively new and only children who develop 
symptoms soonest after infection are being observed she said 
tuesday 
the new study just highlights the fact that we havent seen the 
whole epidemic yet she said its still unfolding in front of 
us 
while the projections are useful for pointing out that theres 
more out there than meets the eye i would just hesitate in 
putting weight on a specific figure she said 
the analysis suggested that some children may have a brief 
incubation period with half diagnosed within 41 months of birth 
but most children appear to have a longer incubation with half of 
them being diagnosed only by about age 6 
researchers have no explanation for such a difference auger said 
monday 
lynne billard of the university of georgia in athens who has 
studied aids incubation periods said she was unaware of any similar 
study of children infected by their mothers the new work is 
important for exploring that ground she said

americans flew the last us cruise 
missiles out of belgium on tuesday making it the first western 
nation to be rid of its mediumrange nuclear missiles under the 
yearold superpower treaty 
eight missiles and their launch canisters sealed in white 
containers were rolled onto a giant c141 cargo plane at florennes 
air base for the flight back to the united states florennes is 65 
miles south of brussels 
this marks a very important milestone and a great success for 
us said maynard glitman us ambassdor to belgium and chief 
american negotiator in talks leading to the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty 
belgian defense minister guy coeme said farewell ceremonies 
are very often full of bitterness even of sadness here however 
in the case of the departure of the last cruise missile based on our 
territory one can speak of hope hope for peace 
within the atlantic alliance belgium is the first country 
from which intermediaterange missiles have been withdrawn he 
said 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed 
the accord dec 8 1987 it provides for elimination by june 1 
1991 of all us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges of 300 
to 3400 miles 
im really proud to take these out of here said airman 1st 
class tammy murray the loadmaster who flew with the plane from 
travis air force base calif 
glitman confessed that i suppose i should be more emotional 
but he noted the issues that lie behind the negotiations havent 
gone away either we still have a lot of work to do 
unofficial observers also were moved by the sight of the plane 
lifting off 
its beautiful to see them leave said paul dhuyvetter one 
of a small group of demonstrators outside the base 
dhuyvetter who held a small pink carnation to mark the event 
said the missiles departure gives us energy to go on and press 
for further arms control measures 
in all 16 groundlaunched cruise missiles and four spares were 
kept at florennes base along with four launchers and eight spares 
the sleek groundhugging weapons arrived in march 1985 
col calvin chasteen commander of the tactical wing said the 
first 12 missiles were removed within the last two weeks 
glitman said as far as he knew no other american nuclear devices 
remained on the base which has housed the us air forces 485th 
tactical missile wing since 1984 
the missiles are being flown to davismonthan air force base in 
tucson ariz where they will be destroyed 
the european repair facility at gosslies 10 miles north of 
florennes is expected to operate until nearly all missiles covered 
by the treaty are removed 
the 21foot weapons are jetpropelled winged missiles with 
advanced guidance systems 
no soviet inspectors attended the ceremony they visited the base 
earlier this year as part of an unprecedented review process given 
each side under the treaty 
coeme said the belgian government was studying options for the 
base which include using it as a storage center for us military 
equipment or a training school for test pilots for the north 
atlantic treaty organization

military headquarters around the world 
the pentagon in a brief statement tuesday said carlucci had 
sided with civilian manpower officials in ordering the cuts and that 
his decision is final 
the civilian officials had asserted at least 3000 to 3500 jobs 
could be eliminated from allegedly bloated command staffs with the 
people assigned to more important combat units 
the joint chiefs of staff however had countered the reductions 
should be limited to no more than 500 positions or billets 
the secretary of defense has adopted all of the recommendations 
that he felt could be accomplished without hurting military 
readiness the pentagon said in response to a query 
with the reduction of 3000 spaces the secretary of defense 
has determined that he has accomplished his initial review 
objectives which were to reduce manpower levels and overhead costs 
by eliminating overlapping responsibilities duplication of 
functions and excessive layering of organization echelons 
carluccis order had its genesis in an internal study he ordered 
last december shortly after he assumed the post of defense 
secretary 
the study was performed by a 22member panel chaired by derek j 
vander schaaf the pentagons deputy inspector general in unusually 
blunt terms it concluded in february the pentagon could eliminate 
7309 jobs from multiservice military headquarters around the world 
or 12 percent of the total without jeopardizing readiness 
such cuts would save more than 300 million a year in operating 
costs and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost guarantees 
americas military forces will have a hard time fighting any war 
the study concluded 
the panel found the socalled unified and specified commands 
around the world were supported by 59510 civilian and military 
staff adding the review disclosed significant areas of 
overlapping responsibilities duplication of functions layering and 
opportunities for saving manpower 
the panels conclusion that 7309 jobs were superfluous 
eventually was referred to the pentagons manpower office and then 
to the joint chiefs of staff the sixmember body that includes the 
nations highestranking admirals and generals 
the manpower office found plenty of room for cutting sources 
later disclosed and urged carlucci to trim between 3000 and 3500 
jobs 
the sources who asked not to be named said the joint chiefs 
went ballistic saying that was totally unacceptable 
the dispute then went to carlucci for a final decision 
the pentagon said tuesday the cuts are to be completed by sept 
30 1991 and will affect civilian as well as military staff the 
military members will be reinvested in validated positions in 
combat units or medical units the pentagon said 
the civilian personnel will be offered other employment 
opportunities by the departments priority placement program we do 
not anticipate that many if any civilian personnel will actually 
lose their jobs 
the vander schaff panel had criticized by name several commands 
as overstaffed or unnecessary including the us forces caribbean 
command in key west fla the armys western command in hawaii the 
strategic air command and the separate air and ground defense 
command structures for alaska 
the pentagon said tuesday no final decisions had been made on 
whether to close any command headquarters 
it did disclose however the army and air force would bear the 
largest percentage of reassignments 1123 and 1168 respectively 
the navy will be reassigning 654 individuals the marine corps 41 
and the jcs staff 14 
the department declined to estimate the dollar savings of the 
move

retail sales in november got the crucial 
holiday shopping season off to a fast start by posting the second 
consecutive strong monthly gain the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said sales jumped 11 percent in november 
to a seasonally adjusted 1381 billion that followed a 16 percent 
increase in october revised up from an earlier estimate of 09 
percent 
it looks like the christmas season will be better than people 
feared and make an important contribution to growth commerce 
undersecretary robert ortner said 
everybody keeps writing off the consumer sector of the economy 
but consumers dont know they are supposed to stop spending 
ortner said their incomes are growing and they are optimistic 
christmas sales provide general merchandisers with about half of 
their annual profits many economists had expected sluggish sales 
in part because the federal reserve has been nudging interest rates 
higher since march 
the fed fears that excessive consumer demand could lead to higher 
inflation and make it difficult to stem the flood of foreign 
imports and shrink the nations trade deficit the federal open 
market committee which sets monetary policy was meeting behind 
closed doors tuesday 
the fed is not going to be pleased with this development in 
retail sales said john hagens an economist with the wefa group 
a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm this is probably another 
reason for them to continue to tighten and maybe a little more 
quickly than they had previously planned 
but sj levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua ny said 
overall sales gains have been bolstered by auto buying excluding 
autos sales have risen at an annual rate of about 7 percent over 
the last six months which is little better than the inflation and 
job growth rates 
thats not a startling figure he said 
auto sales last month rose 20 percent to 309 billion after a 
46 percent increase a month earlier but even excluding autos 
aggregate sales rose a strong 09 percent in november and 08 
percent in october 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores shot up 
11 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 158 billion 
following a 26 percent rise in october 
in a separate report earlier this month major department store 
chains reported mostly sluggish sales through much of november and 
then a surge over the thanksgiving weekend as holiday shoppers 
flooded the stores 
sales of durable goods big ticket items intended to last 
three or more years rose 18 percent in november after a 25 
percent october rise nondurable goods climbed 07 percent 
following a 11 percent jump 
hardware garden and building supply store sales surged 28 
percent while furniture sales increased 12 percent 
food and grocery stores reported a 07 percent increase 
specialty clothing stores a 17 percent rise drug stores a 13 
percent gain and restaurants and bars a 10 percent increase 
the only category reporting a decline was gasoline service 
stations where sales fell 14 percent

the united states and china have opened a 
research laboratory in beijing to help find natural enemies of 
insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
orville g bentley assistant secretary for science and 
education said the new sinoamerican biological control 
collaborative laboratory is located at the chinese academy of 
agricultural sciences 
under a fiveyear agreement with the academy three usda 
scientists will go to the laboratory next may and conduct research 
there for six months each year they will work in the united states 
the remaining six months of the year 
richard s soper biocontrol research leader in the departments 
agricultural research service said the beijing laboratory will be a 
quarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrol 
organisms between the two countries 
the targeted us pests include leafy spurge a noxious 
rangeland weed two water weeds hydrilla and watermilfoil and the 
russian wheat aphid soper said the aphid is the most worrisome 
pest it was first spotted in the united states in 1986 and has 
spread rapidly to wheatgrowing areas 
pests of concern to china are croftonweed a weed so toxic to 
horses that they cant be kept on certain land scale insects and 
apple leaf mites 
next year the chinese academy is expected to send scientists to 
usda laboratories in fort lauderdale fla and buenos aires 
argentina 
soper said scientists at four agency laboratories in france 
italy south korea and argentina are searching overseas to find 
biocontrols for us pests but until now he said scientists have 
not been able to easily explore kmust of the vast eurasian land area 
the new lab takes care of much of asia that weve missed and 
were hoping we can develop similar arrangements with the soviets

space shuttle atlantis its right 
fuselage in need of repairs returned to its launch site tuesday 
atop a boeing 747 jetliner after two overnight stops 
the 747 touched down at the kennedy space center here at 225 
pm to complete a hopscotch flight that began sunday at edwards air 
force base calif 
atlantis landed at edwards in the mojave desert a week ago 
after completing a fourday classified flight during which the five 
military astronauts aboard reportedly deployed a sophisticated 
reconnaissance satellite 
enroute back here the jetliner made overnight stops at 
davismonthon air force base near tucson ariz and at kelly air 
force base near san antonio tex 
when atlantis returned to earth nasa found it had suffered 
heavier than expected damage to the heatresistant tiles on its 
right fuselage and the vehicles processing director conrad nagel 
estimated between 125 and 175 of them will have to be replaced 
nasa engineers suspect something struck that area of the shuttle 
during launch possibly insulation falling off the external fuel 
tank an agency team has been named to investigate the cause 
debris found imbedded in a shuttle tile has been sent to a 
laboratory for analysis and films and photographs of the launch are 
being studied for clues 
atlantis is covered with about 28000 tiles designed to protect 
it from heat up to 3000 degrees fahrenheit when it leaves orbit and 
reenters earths atmosphere 
officials said the repair work should not affect preparations for 
launching atlantis on its next flight during which astronauts will 
dispatch the magellan spacecraft to explore the planet venus the 
launch is scheduled april 28 
discovery which was launched on the first postchallenger flight 
on sept 29 is scheduled to be launched again on feb 18 with a

a declining population has led 
a northern minnesota county to try a version of the nations old 
homestead policy anyone can claim up to 40 acres of land if they 
build a house and live in it for 10 years 
our real problem up here is that nobodys here anymore said 
lee hervey one of the residents of rural koochiching county who 
proposed the homesteading plan 
the 2 millionacre county along the canadian border three times 
as big as rhode island has about 15700 residents only eight 
communities and vast stretches where no one lives 
it also has about 50000 acres of woods and farmland abandoned to 
the county when its owners failed to pay taxes thats the land the 
county wants to give away 
there are people that live in chicago new york or the twin 
cities that might be sick and tired of the rat race the rushhour 
traffic and believe me well eliminate that from the lifestyle 
real quick said bob schwiderski who directs the homestead 
program 
added hervey we really dont have a lot to offer up here 
besides the land so we decided thats what we should offer the 
populations dropping and that hurts the schools the power company 
everything if we dont get neighbors we wont be able to live here 
either 
more than 180 people have inquired about the homesteading 
program and two dozen have formally applied county officials say 
they hope to hand over the first deeds within a week 
while other rural areas in the country have offered tax breaks 
and other financial assistance to lure residents federal officials 
and development experts said they believed this was the first 
largescale land giveaway since the federal homestead program was 
eliminated 
homesteading was the catalyst that spurred the settlement of the 
plains and the west the homestead act of 1862 offered up to 160 
acres of free farmland to settlers willing to develop the property 
and live there for at least five years 
during the first five years of homesteading settlers rushed into 
minnesota faster than into any other state more than 62000 of 
them by 1880 
in 1976 long after homesteading had ceased congress abolished 
the act only in alaska does it continue under a statedirected 
program 
in koochiching county officials hope that international falls 
will boom again once boise cascade completes a 525 million 
expansion of its big paper mill but the countys other vital signs 
arent good since 1980 the population has dropped by about 2000 
residents 
koochiching county isnt the only area of minnesota seeking new 
residents in october the central minnesota town of osakis began 
offering 5000 in cash to anyone willing to build a house and 
settle 
koochiching officials persuaded state legislators last year to 
sponsor a special local law that allowed them to implement the 
homestead program formally called the bidstead and economic 
development program 
under the rules not only must applicants agree to homebuilding 
taxpaying and occupying their new home they also must maintain an 
income sufficient to live there and before their application is 
approved they must submit to a credit and criminalrecords check 
we want people that are selfsufficient schwiderski said 
were not looking for an opportunity to increase our welfare rolls 
up here 
theres really not any jobs up here as such added hervey 
42 who is selfemployed we expect them to bring their livelihood 
with them 
if 250 families applied and settled in the county i would 
consider the program successful schwiderski said 
among applicants so far are retirees and couples interested in 
relocating their small businesses schwiderski said 
one of the applicants tom johnson jr said he returned to his 
familys koochiching county home from florida because the homestead 
program would give him a chance he wouldnt otherwise have to make a 
living where he grew up 
johnson 23 has his eye on 40 acres next to his fathers 
property he plans to build an earthberm passivesolar house on 
the land supporting himself by working for his fathers logging 
operation 
ten years is a long time but im planning to stay here the 
rest of my life if i can he said

nato should respond to announced soviet troop 
cuts by reducing its own military forces and match the soviet plan 
to move to strictly defensive forces a liberal study group said 
tuesday 
in addition european members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization should be prepared to pick up a greater share of the 
burden of defending the western alliance the institute for peace 
and international security said 
economist john kenneth galbraith and rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo a member of the house armed services committee and a 
frequent critic of reagan administration defense policies head the 
advisory board of the cambridge massbased research center 
mrs schroeder who released the study at a news conference 
noted the announcement last week by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev that the soviet union was cutting its armed forces by 10 
percent worldwide some of the reductions will be in eastern europe 
and the soviet forces also will be restructured to make them 
defensive rather than offensive gorbachev said 
as we face the largest budget deficit in our nations history 
mr gorbachevs initiative gives us the opportunity to cut our 
defense budget without endangering our national security mrs 
schroeder said 
our european allies must still face up to new 
responsibilities she added 
in the face of a new positive arms control climate and the 
emergence of western europe as a unified world trading entity our 
european allies must prepare themselves not only for this new role 
but for roles and responsibilities that come with being a global 
power she said 
the study proposed several responses to gorbachevs plan 
including 
an immediate confidencebuilding withdrawal of 5 percent of 
the active ground forces in central europe by both sides which 
would be 20000 soviet troops and 10000 us troops gorbachev had 
pledged to implement his reductions by 1991 
a pause in deployment of new shortrange nuclear weapons by nato 
and the soviet bloc mediumrange missiles are being eliminated by a 
ussoviet treaty signed a year ago but the pact doesnt affect 
weapons with socalled battlefield range 
movement to dominance by defense rather than offense in the 
military structure of each side one example would be a decrease in 
heavily armored forces including tanks and artillery because those 
forces normally are employed in attack 
a prime focus of arms control efforts should be the withdrawal of 
offensive weapons the study said 
one of the hurdles to be overcome is the belief by western 
leaders that nato forces already are at the minimum level despite 
the warsaw pact reductions the study said 
another potential problem it cited was the possibility that 
nato may be reluctant to break its morbid dependence on nuclear 
weapons even if progress in conventional arms negotiations 
undermines the present rationale for those weapons

washingtons largest law firm announced tuesday 
a joint venture with a soviet enterprise aimed at creating a variety 
of ussoviet businesses ranging from pollution control to caviar 
production 
speaking at a news conference with a telephone hookup to moscow 
officials of the 300lawyer firm of arnold amp porter said us and 
soviet officials of the new venture would meet with prospective 
clients later this week 
new soviet economic policies of openness or perestroika 
offer access to a market of 280 million highly educated soviet 
consumers with an enormous need for goods and technology said 
james jones arnold amp porter managing partner 
he said soviet president mikhail gorbachevs policies are 
setting an exciting new course for eastwest business 
relationships 
the firms consulting affiliate apco associates hopes to double 
the number of ussoviet ventures by the end of next year ten 
joint ussoviet business agreements have been concluded to date 
along with about 100 soviet ventures with businesses from other 
countries 
soviet law expert randy bregman who will direct apcos new 
soviet and east european operations said he looks to the day when a 
soviet citizen can buy borscht made by campbell soup co 
he said campbell is not one of the companies now involved but 
this is an example of the kind of enterprise that might result from 
the new agreement with infeks a sixmonth old soviet consulting 
cooperative affiliated with the ussr ministry of foreign 
economic relations 
bregman declined to name companies that might deal with the 
soviets through apco but he said they include about a dozen 
companies involved in food processing pollution control medical 
equipment tourism and telecommunications one us company even 
wants to get into caviar production he said 
current soviet law requires that joint ventures be no more than 
49 percent foreign owned but bregman said there have been strong 
indications this might be liberalized early next year he said some 
contracts already have been written with majority foreign ownership 
vladimir gusinsky infeks president said from moscow that the 
soviet enterprise is part of the economic perestroika under way in 
the soviet union 
we are looking forward to developing economic relations with 
us companies gusinsky said through a translator who also 
translated the washington news conference in russian over the 
telephone hookup 
apco president margery kraus said the company which also has set 
up joint ventures with japanese and iraeli businesses would open an 
office in moscow early next year 
she said the company would provide onestop shopping for 
companies wanting to do business in the soviet union charging fees 
for its services she said there were no plans for apco to share in 
profits of the joint ventures it helps set up 
bregman who has been dealing with soviet commerce for 25 years 
said the climate for business has changed dramatically under 
gorbachev with many cooperatives and other enterprises set up with 
only partial state involvement those run by people with more 
initiative are seeking foreign business ties he said 
a few years ago bregman said when moscow citizens saw a man in 
a suit they would approach the individual and say do you want to 
change money 
now he said they ask do you want to do joint ventures

the threetrain fatal accident in south london has 
become a lightning rod for commuters grievances over rising fares 
and sardine express service 
we have to stop talking about the profitandloss account and 
thinking about whether we can go on patching up a 150yearold 
railway system the way british rail has to said robert adley a 
member of parliament for prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party 
some of adleys constituents from dorset ride british rail 
through busy clapham junction where the accident involving two 
commuter trains and a freight train occurred monday killing 33 
people 
the system has been creaking at the seams for so long that 
something had to give said john stewart policy coordinator for 
capital a public transport pressure group 
british rail brings 467000 commuters to london every morning 
rush hour an increase of 19 percent since 1983 
death on the sardine express blared the tabloid today even 
the conservativeleaning daily telegraph said prime minister 
margaret thatchers government has yet to reveal the commitment to 
public services transport prominent among them that it has so 
admirably displayed in creating a new spirit within the private 
sector 
on the morning of the crash railroad union members dressed as 
sardines were handing out leaflets at londons euston station 
complaining about crowding on trains 
conditions for many commuters are very very bad we need new 
trains more staff and longer platforms neil milligan general 
secretary of the associated society of locomotive engineers and 
firemen said at the euston demonstration 
on a small island crowded with 56 million people commuters must 
choose between roads spread thick with traffic jams and 
standingroomonly service on british rail 
passenger traffic on network southeast the british rail division 
which serves london and its suburbs is up 19 percent since 1983 
capital investment has also grown rapidly from 644 million 
systemwide in 1983 to 115 billion this fiscal year 
british rail meanwhile has been hardpressed to fill staff 
vacancies particularly among telecommunications and signal workers 
some of them lured away by higher wages offered by the recently 
privatized telephone company british telecom 
earlier this month british rail announced incentives worth 450 
to 2175 a year for workers in southern england in november as 
part of an effort to fill 200 vacancies for train drivers british 
rail announced plans to develop 73 lowcost apartments and 15 houses 
in london 
meanwhile the 10000mile british rail system has pledged to cut 
its government subsidy by 25 percent between 1987 and 1990 
the burden lifted from the taxpayer has fallen increasingly on 
the ticketbuyer british rail is raising fares by an average of 9 
percent on jan 8 compared to an inflation rate around 6 percent 
but fares for longdistance commuters are soaring as much as 21 
percent 
the 155mile round trip from swindon to london for instance 
will go from 3996 a year to 4825 
the central transport consultative committee the rail systems 
statutory watchdog said in its 1988 report that crowding had become 
an epidemic in the southeast 
the existing load factor standards 110 percent for slamdoor 
stock 135 percent for newer slidingdoor trains were intended as 
maximum loadings not average targets to be aimed at the report 
said 
robin seymour the chief inspector of railways acknowledged 
concern about overcrowding in his report however he said there 
is no evidence to suggest that overcrowding per se may be the cause 
of train accidents 
seymour reported there were 1164 accidents on british rail and 
the london subways in 1987 the lowest total in five years deaths 
went up from 72 in 1986 to 104 largely due to 31 deaths in the 
kings cross subway station fire 
the clapham disaster may have been caused by signal improvements 
part of 37 million being spent on some of the lines leading to 
londons waterloo station

consumers became more cautious about their 
economic futures in november following the presidential election and 
the renewed debate over the budget deficit a businessfinanced 
research group reported wednesday 
the conference board said its consumer confidence index declined 
to 1131 in november from a revised 1169 in october 
the monthly survey which covers 5000 us households is 
conducted for the board by national family opinion inc of toledo 
ohio 
the survey indicated that although consumers showed more 
confidence in present employment conditions last month than in 
october they turned less confident about the outlook for the next 
six months the report said 
of those responding 302 percent indicated jobs were plentiful 
in november compared with 298 percent in october however only 
155 percent believed employment conditions would improve over the 
next six months down from 186 percent in october 
solme 185 percent of those polled said they expected business 
conditions to improve in the next six months down from 211 percent 
who thought so in october those expecting conditions to worsen rose 
to 85 percent from 70 percent in october 
growing uncertainty about the immediate future appears to be 
the reason for the latest dip in consumer spirits said fabian 
linden executive director of the boards consumer research center 
the budget and trade deficits and other major economic 
problems largely ignored by both candidates during the presidential 
campaign are now emerging as urgent issues he said 
consumer buying plans largely were unchanged from october the 
percentage of people planning to buy automobiles and major 
appliances in november remained at 73 percent and 27 percent 
respectively 
but rising mortgage interest rates pushed the percentage of those 
planning to buy homes down to 29 from 37 percent

students chanting solidarity hurled 
stones at riot police tuesday and were answered with tear gas in a 
demonstration at warsaw university on the seventh anniversary of 
polands martiallaw crackdown 
thousands of antigovernment protesters rallied in wroclaw and at 
least four other cities opposition activists said as the official 
press defended the military crackdown ordered dec 13 1981 by 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
a government spokesman said five policemen were injured badly 
enough in warsaw to require hospitalization and five people 
probably students were detained 
about 2000 students squared off against several hundred 
shieldcarrying helmeted police at the gates of warsaw university 
students hoisted banners saying solidarity and there is no 
freedom without solidarity during a rally organized by the 
outlawed polish socialist party just off campus at a monument to the 
16th century astronomer copernicus 
banners also were raised for other illegal opposition groups 
including the socialist party the independent students association 
and the confederation for an independent poland 
police chased the students back into the walled campus dragging 
some of them away then students began throwing stones from within 
the gates and police answered with tear gas which filled the chilly 
air with stinging smoke 
students picked up canisters and threw them back at police and 
after about an hour the situation degenerated into a standoff with 
students chanting slogans and the police facing them from behind 
their shields across the street 
several sweeps by phalanxes of police cleared the sidewalks by 
late afternoon and most of the students drifted away through back 
entrances of the university to end the protest 
in the southwestern city of wroclaw an opposition spokeswoman 
said 15000 people rallied with banners saying jaruzelski must 
go and police did not interfere 
the speeches concentrated on what happened on dec 13 1981 
and the fact that it is high time for democracy to be implemented 
said maria pinior whose husband jozef was one of the leaders of 
the protest 
the demonstration also included one minute of silence for those 
killed during the martial law crackdown she said 
the solidarity information service in warsaw reported smaller 
rallies in lodz jastrzebie and lublin zygmunt lenyk a spokesman 
for the confederation for an independent poland in krakow said 
2500 people there marched to the site of solidaritys former 
headquarters 
we survived seven years and we are still here lenyk quoted 
solidarity activist jerzy smagowicz as telling the crowd 
in a commentary the communist party daily newspaper trybuna ludu 
said one can remember dec 13 for years with a measure of 
bitterness and divisions one can open the healing wounds anew 
but would it not be better for poland if the date of the 
lesser evil were overshadowed by a joyful day the day of 
eliminating national discord and of common action for poland 
government spokesman jerzy urban said we consider the 
imposition of martial law to have been a necessary evil an evil 
that turned out to be effective todays progress toward 
reconciliation would not have been possible without martial law 
on dec 13 1981 poles woke up to find tanks in the streets 
martial music on the radio and thousands of active members of 
solidarity rounded up and interned 
the lightning blow by the army under jaruzelskis command put an 
end overnight to the legal operation of the east blocs first 
independent trade union a 10 millionstrong social movement that 
had electrified the country for 15 months 
solidarity was at first suspended and was banned the following 
october 
the operation took place with little bloodshed nine coal miners 
were killed during a strike at the wujek mine near katowice on dec 
16 1981 but otherwise there were no known casualties during 
introduction of the officially named state of war martial law 
was formally lifted in july 1983 
officials argued the solidarity leadership had been taken over by 
elements who threatened the political supremacy of the polish united 
workers communist party if poles had not acted to restore order 
the soviet union and its allies would have been forced to intervene 
at a higher cost they said 
solidarity remains illegal but is increasingly tolerated by 
authorities 
the union demonstrated it still has a following after leading two 
waves of strikes in 1988 the strongest since the martiallaw 
crackdown walesa ended the second wave of strikes when the 
government agreed to talk with him 
on nov 30 authorities allowed him to participate in a 
nationwide tv debate with official unions chief alfred miodowicz 
which walesa was widely considered to have won 
but the proposed talks with the government have stalled with 
walesa insisting that he first wants a signal that authorities are 
willing to legalize his union again 
solidarity plans ceremonies friday in gdansk to honor the victims 
of dec 16 1970 food riots and the miners killed resisting martial 
law in 1980

remains of about 100 jews killed by the 
nazis during world war ii were reburied tuesday in a ceremony 
attended by 15 rabbis from around the world 
the bones were discovered near the site of the old jewish ghetto 
in warsaw last summer during a construction project which since has 
been abandoned 
historians determined that the site was a mass grave used by the 
nazis for polish jews who were shot or died of starvation in the 
ghetto some nonjewish poles also were believed to be buried there 
in the ceremony carried out during a light snowfall about 100 
wooden boxes of remains were carried by several dozen people from a 
temporary storage area to a specially build crypt at the site 
the rabbis removed the bones from the boxes wrapped them in 
white cloths and lowered them into preformed concrete cubicles the 
entire site is to become a monument to the victims of genocide 
the ceremony attended by warsaw mayor jerzy boleslawski and 
other dignitarites was organized by the polish veterans 
organization and by the nissenbaum foundation which restores and 
preserves jewish monuments in poland 
we want to express our appreciation to the polish government 
for its courageous stand in preserving this entire area said 
rabbi hertz frankel of new york speaking at the ceremony 
we participate in sorrow and mourning of our elder brothers 
who gave us the commandment thou shalt not kill said bishop 
henryk muszczynski of warsaw who also took part in the prayers of 
mourning led by the rabbis 
before world war ii poland was home to 35 million jews about 3 
million were slaughtered by the nazis most of the rest left poland

a condemned inmates muscular arms and 
previous drug use caused a tube carrying a deadly solution into his 
arm to spring a leak prolonging his execution by injection state 
officials said tuesday 
raymond landry 39 was declared dead at 1245 am 24 minutes 
after prison officials began administering the lethal dosage 
two minutes into the procedure the tube attached to his right 
arm sprang a leak spraying the solution toward witnesses and 
halting the execution witnesses heard murmurs and at least one 
groan before landry was pronounced dead 
it was a mechanical and physical problem ron dusek a 
spokesman for texas attorney general jim mattox said tuesday 
landry was very muscular and had popeyetype arms when the 
stuff was flowing it wouldnt go into the veins and there was more 
pressure in the hose than his veins could absorb 
dusek called the prolonged execution an accident 
theres not much you can say about it dusek said this has 
been done 29 times now without any major screwup or problem it 
couldnt be helped 
but landrys attorney mike charlton said the state had the 
responsibility to carry out executions with dispatch and dignity 
this is somewhat bizarre he said i dont know how you can 
describe your feelings about something like that it had to absolute 
hell for raymond 
to sit there and to have to go through that is an ordeal you 
would not wish on anybody i think its bad enough to find yourself 
in that situation but to go through a situation like that if our 
society ever gets to the stage where we execute people without 
regard to the emotional implications then we will have reached a 
sad day 
the supreme court monday denied landrys request for a reprieve 
but another inmate samuel hawkins scheduled to die immediately 
after landry received a stay about 3 hours before he was to be 
executed hawkins 45 faced death for the 1976 rape and slaying of 
a 19yearold woman 
landry was convicted in the shooting death of kosmas prittis 
prittis 33 a greek immigrant was robbed and shot in the head on 
aug 6 1982 as his wife and children watched 
landry was the 104th person executed in the united states since 
the supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 and 11th 
this year

president reagan looking back on his eight 
years in the white house said tuesday that one of his great 
disappointments is leaving office without taming the federal 
budget deficit 
reagan had come into office promising to balance the nations 
redink spending by 1984 
the president who leaves office in less than six weeks 
contended that a washington colony composed of an iron 
triangle of members of congress the news media and special 
interest groups had helped perpetuate the deficit 
when i came to office i found the presidency a weakened 
institution reagan told his audience of several hundred 
government officials and employees at constitution hall 
i found a congress that was trying to transform our government 
into a quasiparliamentary system and i found a washington colony 
that through the iron triangle was attempting to rule the nation 
according to its interests and desires more than the nations 
reagan said some had used the term iron triangle to describe 
the triad of the congress news media and special interest groups 
and that he would borrow the phrase 
administrations come and go but the iron triangle remains 
he said 
reagan said he believed that he has been able to use the 
presidents ability to frame the broadest outlines of debate to 
compensate for some of the weakening of the office 
he accused the triad of perpetuating their game of tax and 
spend and fighting his efforts to balance the budget through 
spending cuts and proposals for a balancedbudget amendment to the 
constitution and authority to veto individual items in major 
spending bills 
reagan received a tumultuous reception with applause punctuated 
by cheers and whistles from his audiences of government officials 
and employees in constitution hall 
one of my great disappointments as i leave office is that the 
federal budget itself is not yet balanced the president said 
the house of representatives he said has become a virtually 
permament chamber no longer truly responsive to the people 
with a 98 percent rate of reelection there is less turnover 
in the house than in the supreme soviet he said 
the president said the iron triangle also derives from the 
power of special interest groups to focus debate and overwhelming 
resources like campaign money and letterwriting campaigns on issues 
that dont command broad and intense national attention 
with this pressure he said liberal members of congress take 
up the banner in support of continued spending programs 
you would think the media might act as a check on all this 
he said but too often it doesnt 
while expressing respect for the news media reagan said too 
many members of the media approach issues like federal spending from 
a superficial perspective 
our positions are reported in caricature he said special 
interest charges are reported uncritically and the publics 
understanding suffers 
shouldnt we expect better of those who act in the name of the 
publics right to know the president asked 
his audience cheered the question 
in the long run the situation we have now isnt good for 
anyone even the members of the iron triangle reagan said 
fundamentally the american people know whats up and they dont 
like it they may reelect their congressmen but they trust 
congress itself less and less 
they may watch or read the media but they stop believing it 
he said and they show more and more dislike for special interest 
influence the only question is when will they say once and for all 
that theyve had enough

arrested and accused of taking part in an armed rebellion 
michael goldsmith the ap north africa correspondent said he was 
unable to confirm rumors of gabas death or get any information 
about the reporters fate during several meetings last month with 
chadian officials in the capital ndjamena 
after gabas arrest last year the ap and londonbased 
international press institute called for his release amnesty 
international urged president hissene habre to take steps to ensure 
his safety noting that political detainees had disappeared or been

police hunting burglars who stole 
three vincent van gogh paintings said tuesday they are hampered by 
the size of the scene of the crime a museum surrounded by the 
countrys biggest national park 
karel van seventer said however the polices rapid response 
apparently stopped the thieves taking a fourth painting by the 19th 
century dutch impressionist master 
weavers interior which seventer earlier identified as one 
of the stolen works was found lying on the floor of the room from 
which the other three had disappeared he said 
in probably the biggest art theft in the netherlands thieves 
monday night broke into the kroellermueller museum and stole the 
oil paintings the potato eaters wilted sunflowers and the 
loom seventer said earlier he wrongly identified the flower 
painting as dried sunflowers 
alerted by an alarm when burglars smashed a groundfloor window 
police rushed to the museum within minutes and sealed off the 
12350acre expanse of forests shrubs and heath of hoge veluwe 
park he said guards posted in the sprawling singlestory museum 
said they did not hear the thieves he said 
it all happened very fast we were acting on the assumption 
that they were possibly still on the grounds right after the 
alarm seventer told a news conference 
the trouble was the grounds are 5000 hectares large and made 
up of difficult terrain he said the park has only three roads 
accessible by motor vehicle 
two helicopter sweeps of the area which normally is inhabited 
only by five gamekeepers and their families produced no clues 
police used tracker dogs also to no avail 
no official valuation has been disclosed for the works which 
were not insured by the state because of the astronomical premiums 
they would command however a dutch art expert speculated the 
potato eaters alone could be worth more than the 399 million 
paid for van goghs sunflowers at a london auction last year 
but it would be virtually impossible to sell it on the open 
market 
the spectacular theft was the second in seven months involving 
works by van gogh and underscored relatively lax security at museums 
in may thieves broke into amsterdams municipal museum and stole 
van goghs carnations and two other impressionist paintings all 
three were recovered undamaged a few weeks later 
most officials declined to speculate on why the paintings were 
stolen since it would be virtually impossible to sell them on the 
open market 
however dutch association of museums spokesman r zijp said in a 
dutch tv interview that whats most likely is that theyll be held 
to ransom in a kind of kidnapping 
van seventer said no ransom demand had so far been made 
in another tv interview culture minister elco brinkman said 
security at the countrys national museums was being increased 
but you cant just go on pouring tens of millions of guilders 
into it brinkman said some time youll have to face the 
question whether there arent any better ways of spending that money 
on culture 
the kroellermueller museum is named for mrs helj 
kroellermueller the artloving wife of a prominent industrialist 
who bequeathed it to the nation in 1938 with the surrounding park 
the museum contains 278 van gogh paintings sketches and etchings 
kroellermuellers the potato eaters is the second in a 
series of three with the final and most important painting on 
display at amsterdams vincent van gogh national museum 
the 1885 works were painted in van goghs native village of 
nuenen and are among his most poignant expressions of famine and 
hardship done in dark harsh tones they show a peasant family 
eating potatoes their faces lined by suffering and deprivation

year that began oct 1 the agriculture department said tuesday 
under tea as the program is called various trade organizations 
get funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural 
products the programs goal is to counter the adverse effects of 
unfair foreign trade practices on us exports 
in most cases the sponsoring organizations put up some of their 
own funds in carrying out a specific project although the amounts 
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the 
department 
the level of tea spending was set by the 1985 farm law at 110 
million annually through fiscal 1988 and at 325 million in each of 
the following two years however the usdas appropriation act for 
1989 reduced the level to 200 million

1989 fiscal year

promote the overseas sales of almonds followed by 81 million for 
the us meat export federation other leading recipients include 
cotton council international 71 million american plywood

a former fbi agent who claimed his gambling 
habit was a handicap not a reason for dismissal has settled a suit 
he filed against the federal government after he was fired for 
gambling away 1800 in fbi funds officials said tuesday 
the justice department has agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to 
anthony p rezza 50 a 22year veteran of the fbi according to an 
unidentified source cited by the philadelphia daily news 
rezza also will be entitled to a reduced pension as a result of 
the settlement and to attorneys fees the newspaper reported 
tuesday 
rezza had sued the justice department seeking back pay his 
pension and lawyers fees 
assistant us attorney joan k garner who handled the 
negotiations for the justice department would not comment tuesday 
on the terms of the settlement or the reasons the government agreed 
to settle 
rezzas attorney alice w ballard did not immediately return a 
phone call seeking comment tuesday 
ms ballard had contended that rezza was a pathological gambler 
in july 1985 when he drove to atlantic city without permission in an 
fbi car and played blackjack with money that was to have been used 
for an undercover drug buy 
agents found rezza inside the trump plaza casino rezza now a 
private investigator underwent treatment for his gambling and said 
in court documents that he has not gambled since he also made 
restitution of the fbi funds he lost 
ms ballard said pathological gambling is a handicap which 
under federal law obligates the fbi to help not fire an impaired 
employee 
us district judge edmund v ludwig ruled last month that rezza 
was a pathological gambler when the gambling spree took place 
court records showed rezza had lost as much as 40000 of his and 
his wifes money in the preceding five years through gambling 
rezza claimed in his suit that the fbi punished him more severely 
than it did other agents who committed worse offenses in response 
the government had to produce files of secret disciplinary actions 
against other agents fbi officials have declined comment on the 
files 
the cases included 
a supervisory agent in philadelphia who placed bets with a 
bookie through an intermediary while his squad was investigating the 
same bookie the agent was demoted suspended for 45 days and placed 
on probation 
an agent arrested while entering the united states with 
marijuana and drug paraphernalia suspended for 30 days 
an agent who falsified a report from a lie detector test in 
1983 suspended for 21 days 
an agent who failed to report his arrest for drunken driving 
suspended for 40 days and put on probation 
no names were included in the files presented in court and they 
were accompanied by little detail

fire ants infamous for chewing through 
underground cables and sparking shortages have nibbled their way to 
the attention of federal scientists evaluating the texas farmland 
designated as the site for the 44 billion super collider physics 
project 
the department of energy says additional studies may be needed to 
evaluate the effect of the venomous fire ant which has defied 
scientists attempts at eradication for decades on the giant 
underground facility that researchers hope will give new insights on 
the nature of matter 
warranting a special look said the doe in a 26pound final 
environmental impact statement are the design of electrical 
facilities and other underground components to prohibit fire ant 
infestation construction practices to protect workers from the 
ants painful sting and an environmentally sound pesticide policy 
the impact statement totaling some 10000 pages said the texas 
site near waxahachie is in an area infested with fire ants and 
that local residents report it has caused numerous problems with the 
operation of home and farm equipment 
fire ants appear to be attracted to electrical equipment and 
can cause shorts by chewing through insulation and by crowding into 
spaces around electrical contacts the statement said 
the study noted unsuccessful efforts by utility companies and 
highway departments to deal with the ants and the outages they cause 
a texas department of agriculture representative told the energy 
department that management programs were only 80 percent effective 
others who commented said 30 years of study by federal and state 
agriculture officials still has not yielded an effective method of 
eradicating the ant only control procedures 
fire ants can also pose a potential health risk since their bite 
is painful and can sometimes lead to other more serious reactions 
in humans the study said 
for most people a sting results in a postule accompanied by 
pain and itching that lasts a week the study said for others 
medical attention may be needed especially for a few victims so 
sensitive to the ants venom they go into anaphylactic shock

rep bill nichols a staunch pentagon supporter 
who became a leader in efforts to reform the nations military 
establishment died tuesday after suffering a heart attack at his 
office an aide to the alabama democrat said he was 70 
nichols who won his 12th term in congress last month died in 
the emergency room at capitol hill hospital shortly after 8 am 
hospital spokeswoman lisa poulter said 
he was rushed to the hospital after an aide heard a noise in his 
office and found him unconscious lying face down behind his desk 
said tom mcmahan a nichols spokesman 
nichols who lost a leg in world war ii was a strong supporter 
of president reagans military buildup but he used his chairmanship 
of the house armed services investigations subcommittee to keep a 
close watch over pentagon spending 
after widely publicized hearings into such questionable 
expendutures as 400 navy hammers and 5000 air force coffee pots 
nichols succeeded in amending a military spending bill to require 
the defense department to report to congress on procurement reforms 
and to prohibit defense contractors from billing the government for 
expenses such as country club dues and lobbying costs 
the courtly whitehaired legislator also headed the 
congressional investigation into the 1983 bombing of the marine 
barracks in lebanon which killed 241 americans that investigation 
uncovered problems in the military chain of command which prompted 
nichols to push for a reorganization of the joints chiefs of staff 
three years later congress enacted legislation coauthored by 
nichols and thensen barry goldwater rariz that provided for 
the most farreaching overhaul of the upper levels of the military 
services in four decades 
the legislation known as the goldwaternichols defense 
reorganization act strengthened the authority of the chairman of 
the joint chiefs and the heads of the nations joint commands while 
reducing the power of the individual uniformed service chiefs it 
also made hundreds of changes in military procedures 
rep tom bevill dala who served with nichols for nearly 30 
years in the alabama legislature and the congress said nichols 
took a lot of heat on that legislation from the pentagon 
but he held the line bevill said in a statement and in my 
judgment this legislation will prove to be one of the most 
important changes made in the armed services in this century 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said in a statement that 
nichols was a true friend of the military and a respected member 
of the house armed services committee for many years we will miss 
his support his leadership and his friendship 
an aide to alabama gov guy hunt a republican said the governor 
is required under state law to call a special election to replace 
nichols in the 3rd district congressional seat 
nichols was born on a farm near becker miss but grew up in 
sylacauga ala he earned an undergraduate degree in agriculture 
from auburn university in 1939 and a masters degree in 1941 he was 
captain of the schools football team 
during world war ii nichols was injured in a land mine explosion 
while fighting with the army in europe in 1944 he underwent 19 
operations and eventually lost his left leg from the knee down he 
was awarded the bronze star and purple heart 
nichols returned to sylacauga after the war and served as 
president of parker fertilizer co and parker gin co he was elected 
to the alabama house where he served until his election to the 
alabama senate in 1963 he was elected to congress in 1966 
he is survived by his wife the former carolyn funderburk two 
daughters margaret vlachou of athens greece and memorie mitchell 
of birmingham ala a son flynt nichols of dallas and three 
grandchildren 
funeral services will be held thursday afternoon at the first 
united methodist church in sylacauga the rev j charles boling 
nichols minister and lifelong friend will officiate

in my opinion short of physical violence this is the most 
outrageous human conduct i have seen ihrie said they are a 
hurt couple they are trying to restore themselves its been a 
nightmarish experience 
east detroit municipal judge benedict segesta in july ordered 
sanderson to stay away from the couple and released him on 2000 
personal bond 
but the couple told police the videotapes cartoons and calls 
continued through the summer ihrie said he tried to have 
sandersons bond revoked but segesta instead increased it to 5000 
on oct 27 
eventually the woman enlisted a group of friends and asked them 
to stake out a pta meeting she was attending her friends saw a man 
begin taping videotapes to the windshields of cars outside the 
meeting place police said 
the man later was identified from photos as sanderson ihrie said 
on dec 1 segesta revoked sandersons bond and sentenced him to 
30 days in jail for violating his bond

one driver involved in the fatal tripletrain crash 
in south london left his engine moments before the accident to call 
signal operators from the side of the tracks british rail said 
tuesday 
scotland yard revised the death toll to 33 down from 36 saying 
the discrepancy was caused by the mutilated and dismembered state of 
some of the bodies the victims included nine women and 24 men all 
but two of whom died at the scene 
the staterun railroad has said mondays crash which injured 113 
people 32 seriously probably was caused by a signalrelated fault 
during modernization of 40yearold equipment 
neither british rail nor driver alex mcclymont would comment on 
news stories that he was reporting the signal lights were flickering 
between red green and yellow and confusing drivers 
ml engineering of plymouth the company responsible for designing 
and supplying the new signaling equipment said the difficulty 
appears to be in the wiring to that equipment which was british 
rails responsibility 
gordon pettitt general manager of british rails southern 
region said mcclymont acted properly in stopping his train to call 
signal operators because his train was not equipped with a twoway 
radio 
therefore the driver quite correctly being concerned at what 
he had seen we believe got down and talked to the signalman at the 
earliest possible stage pettitt said he acted absolutely 
correctly 
asked in an tv interview whether the accident could have been 
averted if the driver had a radio pettitt said i think its 
likely that it may have avoided it and it certainly may have avoided 
such serious results 
as workers removed the last of the mangled metal and retrieved 
personal belongings of the estimated 1500 people the duchess of 
york and prime minister margaret thatcher visited the injured and 
pope john paul ii sent his condolences 
the stretch of track that had been closed since the disaster 
reopened tuesday night 
mcclymonts train was idling outside the clapham junction rail 
station one of europes busiest when a fastmoving passenger train 
slammed into it during the morning rush hour entombing some 
passengers in the twisted metal and hurling out others 
an empty freight train traveling in the opposite direction on the 
adjoining track struck the spillover wreckage as well as some 
passengers trying to scramble to safety a fourth train crowded 
with commuters stopped a few feet short of the wreck british rail 
said 
a british rail spokesman who requested anonymity said mcclymont 
was still in a state of shock and like all railroad employees 
involved in mondays accident did not work tuesday 
we hope to get his account if he is fit enough to talk to us 
when the railroads internal investigation begins wednesday the 
spokesman said the driver of the other passenger train john rolls 
was killed he said 
transportation secretary paul channon said the lack of radios on 
some british rail trains would be one subject of an independent 
inquiry he has ordered into britains worst rail accident since 1975 
mcclymont said monday night he was standing at the side of the 
track talking to the signalers on the telephone when he heard a 
train approaching 
then a split second later there was a hell of a bang and 
everything shot forward he said it was a terrible sight 
pettitt said plans to equip trains with radios might be speeded 
up all new trains are being fitted with radios but they are being 
installed gradually in older trains like the ones involved in the 
crash he said 
british rail said it will issue checks for about 3600 as soon 
as possible to families who need financial help for funerals or to 
visit hospitalized relatives

said 
three prisoners were in university hospitals intensive care unit 
tuesday and three others were being treated in the prison hospital 
garza said 
the excelsior news agency quoted an unidentified woman as saying 
she was on a conjugal visit with her husband when the fire broke

nobody would let them out

prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday 
rejected plo chief yasser arafats call for peace talks and said 
israel would never accept the plo as a partner for negotiations 
calling the plos new image of moderation a mirage shamir 
urged the united states not to be duped into thinking the 
organization had changed its ways 
we know what hides behind his arafats words shamir told a 
news conference we know that as they are spoken acts of terror 
continue 
arafats appeal to the un general assembly in geneva won praise 
from prominent israeli doves including the liberal citizens rights 
movement but it failed to sway the center 
foreign minister shimon peres shamirs political rival from the 
centerleft labor party remained silent in apparent agreement with 
shamir he was expected to react in a parliament speech wednesday 
shamir was uncompromising in his rejection of the palestine 
liberation organization and arafats peace feelers 
we shall not negotiate with the plo under any conditions nor 
recognize it the prime minister said from our point of view 
the plo is no partner for any peace process 
before arafats speech israels staterun radios raised 
expectations the us government was poised to recognize the plo 
they said us officials had received an advance text of arafats 
speech and had coordinated changes in wording with the plo 
in washington the state department relieved some of israels 
concern by announcing that arafats speech fell short of meeting 
us conditions for opening a dialogue with the plo 
those conditions are explicit recognition of israels right to 
exist unequivocal acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 as a 
basis for negotiations and renunciation of terrorism 
the un resolutions accord all nations in the region the right 
to exist within secure borders and call for the withdrawal of 
israeli troops from territory occupied in 1967 
about the time arafat addressed the united nations israeli 
officials announced that a palestinian in the west bank had shot and 
killed two israelis after seizing a gun from a jewish settler the 
palestinian was then killed by israeli soldiers 
referring to the incident shamir said what happened is 
another illustration of a decision by the hostile circles in the plo 
to continue their violence 
although arafat condemned terror in all its forms israeli 
officials noted he continued to praise the struggle for 
liberation a reference to the palestinan uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip in which 13 israelis have died 
they also noted the plo had not clearly recognized israels right 
to exist 
the citizens rights movement which was aligned with the labor 
party in the recent parliament elections called on both the us 
and israeli governments to start talks with the plo 
the israeli government must now put the plo to the test and 
propose peace negotiations it said calling on us leaders to 
exert pressure by meeting with arafat 
similar views were expressed by doves in the labor party itself 
one has to be blind not to see that the moderate stream is 
becoming the dominant one in the plo labor parliament member lova 
eliav said on israel television 
amiram goldblum of the peace now movement said in an interview 
that the plos new moderation was having an impact he said 30 to 35 
members of israels 120seat parliament now supported a favorable 
response to arafats peace initiative 
palestinian moderates here welcomed arafats speech 
daoud kuttab a journalist who listened to the speech with 
several dozen other palestinian intellectuals at a theater in arab 
east jerusalem said israel had no more excuses for avoiding 
talks with the plo 
he defended arafats refusal to extend explicit recognition of 
israel saying this would mean recognizing israel with specific 
borders 
spelling out such specific boundaries could be detrimental to 
negotiations kuttab said

earthquake survivors shivered in freezing weather 
with little shelter tuesday and foreign medical experts said rescue 
efforts should focus on the living because it is too late to save 
people still trapped 
six days after the earthquake razed northern armenia the 
official death toll climbed to 55000 and the number of injured 
reached 13000 soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
told a news briefing 
one of our most urgent tasks is to rescue those people who are 
alive gerasimov said about 5400 people have been pulled from 
wrecked buildings since the earthquake and the number still trapped 
is not known 
but two foreign doctors involved in the relief effort said 
resources must be devoted to saving those who are known to have 
survived 
dr bernard mankikian visited the region around spitak as part of 
a relief team from the french branch of medecins du monde doctors 
without borders which returned to paris on tuesday 
spitak small town near the epicenter of wednesdays quake was 
almost totally destroyed 
they survivors are almost totally isolated in the cold he 
said people are staying close to their homes without shelter or 
access to aid that is available in the bigger towns they cannot 
stay like this and survive he said 
relief workers with blankets warm clothes and tents have yet to 
reach survivors in small isolated villages around the mountainous 
countryside near spitak 
soviet television tuesday showed rows of tents set up near the 
ruins of the city of stepanovan to the northeast the commentator 
said there are not enough tents 
a commission headed by prime minister nikolai ryzhkov has ordered 
soviet relief workers to ensure that warm clothes blankets and 
tents reach rural areas the official news agency tass reported 
tuesday 
it was pointed out that the state agroindustrial committees of 
armenia and the soviet union had displayed perplexity and lack of 
organization at first tass said tuesday the situation began to 
change after resolute measures were taken yesterday 
the soviet meteorological center in moscow forecast continued 
freezing weather for the next several days trucks struggled to 
cross snowy mountain passes to bring in tents flown in by relief 
planes to outlying areas 
the communist youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said 60000 
tents have been sent to the disaster area but many people still 
were shivering around bonfires scattered among the ruins 
the collapsed villages are suffering especially from the 
disaster the newspaper said quoting helicopter capt sergei 
bobylev in one village 20 children died in the quake and now 
survivors are dying from cold the newspaper said 
survivors also have other tasks on their minds besides their own 
shelter and safety they are busy burying their relatives or 
searching for loved ones still buried under the rubble 
in the village of nalbanb with a prequake population of 4200 
residents have already buried 2800 of the dead associated press 
photographer morton hvaal reported after visiting the village on 
tuesday 
dr robert gale a bone marrow specialist who assisted the 
soviets following the chernobyl nuclear disaster in april 1986 said 
the medical effort must now focus on saving those who survived 
because it is too late to help those still buried 
we now consider the search and rescue phase as being over 
because there is very little hope of finding anyone alive said 
gale who arrived in yerevan on sunday and went straight to spitak 
in the long run well save more lives in yerevan by 
reinforcing the hospitals there gale said 
but one of mankikians colleagues patrick aeberhard said in 
paris that the cold actually could help trapped victims by slowing 
their metabolism and allowing them to live longer 
citing the experience of other earthquake disasters such as 
mexico city where people lived for up to two weeks buried in 
rubble ryzhkov pledged on monday to keep looking for survivors as 
long as it was possible to find anyone 
in his first public comment since he left the quake area health 
minister yevgeny chazov described the conditions faced by some of 
the 220 medical teams in armenia 
the first complex operations including amputations were carried 
out in the streets under the open air tass quoted chazov as saying 
when we arrived in the quakestricken area there was neither 
electric light nor communications there fires were raging the 
quake destroyed all hospitals seventy per cent of the medical 
personnel was killed chazov said 
many survivors suffer from compression syndrome when the body is 
crushed blood cannot flow to the injured parts of the body toxic 
elements accumulate and gangrene sets in dr alexander konavalov 
director of the institute of neurosugery told the komsomolskaya 
pravda newspaper 
gerasimov said at least 17 of the dialysis machines essential to 
fight compression syndrome have arrived but more are needed 
soviet officials have begun considering the massive 
reconstruction effort needed in areas flattened by the quake 
ryzhkov said the estimated cost of rebuilding will be at least 5 
billion rubles 8 billion 
ryzhkov is heading a commission that will investigate the design 
of the buildings which crumbled during the quake 
at a news conference monday ryzhkov said many people died 
unnecesarily in the quake due to gross violations in planning 
and building apartment buildings that collapsed on their occupants

a lawyer for confessed twa 
hijacker mohammed ali hamadi on tuesday asked the court to summon 
syrias president to testify at the trial 
president hafez assad could shed light on the june 1985 hijacking 
of the twa athenstorome flight that was diverted to beirut where 
hostages were released and sent to damascus the syrian capital 
said gabriele steckbromme 
mrs steckbromme also asked the court to summon nabih berri 
lebanons justice minister and leader of the shiite amal militia 
who helped negotiate the release of passengers 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger made no immediate ruling on mrs 
steckbrommes motion 
during the 17day ordeal 39 americans were held hostage and us 
navy diver robert stethem was shot and killed hamadi a lebanese 
shiite moslem who is charged with air piracy and murder admits he 
was one of the hijackers but denies he shot stethem 
mrs steckbromme also said us authorities reneged on their 
promise not to prosecute the hijackers if the hostages were released 
from the seized plane she said the us officials made the pledge 
before the american hostages were handed over to red cross officials 
and sent to damascus the us government has denied that any deals 
were made 
after mrs steckbrommes motion a journalist called by the 
court to testify as a middle east expert said american authorities 
made such a promise but did not keep it 
west germany last year rejected a us request for hamadis 
extradition but much of the prosecutions case against hamadi is 
based on evidence collected by us authorities and on testimony 
from american witnesses 
adel elias 50 a middle east correspondent for the west german 
news magazine der spiegel testified that berri had told him about 
us promises tied to the release of the americans 
elias a lebaneseborn journalist who is now a west german 
citizen also described the difficult conditions in which poor 
shiite families live in west beirut where hamadi was raised 
mrs steckbromme maintains berri could testify about the aim of 
the hijackers who had demanded the release of more than 700 arab 
prisoners held in israel shortly after the end of the hijacking 
israel freed some of the prisoners but said their release was not 
linked to the air piracy 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

two of the three apollo 8 astronauts reminisced 
tuesday about their mission around the moon 20 years ago this month 
a feat they said helped lift the nation out of despair at a trying 
time in its history 
you have to remember the time span of when apollo 8 went up 
which was the end of 1968 not a very stellar year here in this 
country james lovell who served as command module pilot 
recalled at the museum of science and industry the spacecrafts 
command module is on loan there from the national air and space 
museum in washington 
bobby kennedy was assasinated martin luther king the 
vietnam war was going on the democrtaic convention in chicago 
we had all sorts of riots and it was sort of a down year lovell 
added 
it was some sort of project or an achievement that everybody 
could look up to it was a goal that you could go outside and see 
the moon and know that the united states had finally put a 
spacecraft around the moon 
it couldnt have happened at a better time he said 
joining lovell at the museum was frank borman the apollo 8 
commander the third astronaut on the mission was william anders 
apollo 8 is perhaps best remembered for footage broadcast 
internationally of the three astronauts reading passages from the 
biblical book of genesis on christmas eve 1968 with a stunning view 
of the earth from 250000 miles away 
up to that point it was the largest audience that had ever 
listened to a human voice lovell recalled 
the mission launched dec 21 1968 hurled the three astronauts 
25000 miles an hour a speed no human had endured during the 
sixday space flight then the longest on record the men circled 
the moon 10 times photographing potential sites for future apollo 
landings there 
the apollo 11 mission the first to put a man on the moon 
landed six months later on july 20 1969 
borman recalled the apollo program as generating almost a 
nationalistic fervor that faded as space flights became blase 
borman 60 left the space program in 1970 and took the helm at 
eastern airlines where he served as chairman for 11 years until his 
resignation in 1986 he currently serves as vice chairman at texas 
air 
lovell also 60 resigned from the space program in 1973 and 
currently serves as executive vice president at centel business 
systems in chicago 
apollo 8 i think will always be the single most highlight of 
my professional life borman said

congress is expecting a pentagon commission to 
recommend that about 24 military bases be closed according to house 
and senate aides who were briefed tuesday on what to do if a base in 
their area gets the ax 
fifty anxious congressional staff members from northeast and 
midwest states met for two hours to be briefed by reagan 
administration officials and to swap rumors about which bases might 
be declared obsolete 
the aides were told by officials of the northeastmidwest senate 
coalition and its counterpart group in the house that they likely 
will receive the list of recommended base closings on dec 30 the 
friday kicking off new years weekend 
while the briefing was closed to reporters participants said the 
working figure for the expected number of bases on the list was 
24 that estimate was provided at the briefing by robert bayer of 
the senate armed services committee staff 
the defense secretarys commission on base realignment and 
closure has kept quiet about its deliberations refusing even a 
request by 17 senators to learn whether it would take geographic 
considerations into account 
the commission was created from legislation designed to save the 
government up to 5 billion per year by shutting down bases deemed 
no longer useful 
northeast and midwest lawmakers have urged the commission to 
consider regional inequities as it draws up its list of unneeded 
bases at the briefing the northeastmidwest congressional 
coalition distributed charts and tables showing northeast and 
midwest states getting less than their fair share of defense dollars 
we wish to prevent the further entrenchment of regional 
inequities stemming from the location of existing military 
facilities said an oct 25 letter to the commission from sens 
john heinz rpa daniel patrick moynihan dny and 15 other 
senators 
but all the the commission would say in reply was that it has 
developed five factors to consider each bases value to the 
military and that environmental and economic factors also would be 
weighed 
house and senate staffs have focused their attention on large 
bases the congressional research service recently obtained from the 
defense department a list of all bases employing 100 people or more 
to help members prepare for dec 30 
but bayer said tuesday the commission also may opt to sell off 
some bases highvalue properties while leaving the facilitys 
overall mission intact a move that would come under the heading of 
base realignment 
john lynch associate director of the defense departments office 
of economic adjustment said communities that lose bases might be 
advised to quickly mobilize private sector and government support 
rather than trying to contest the decision 
often the wrong course may be to fight lynch said he said 
government grants are available to help communities adjust to losing 
a base 
defense secretary frank c carlucci will have until jan 15 to 
accept or reject the commissions list

us immigration commissioner alan nelson on 
tuesday said his agencys proposals to conduct swift reviews of 
asylum applications from thousands of nicaraguans are necessary to 
clear up a huge backlog and stem abuses 
the proposals if implemented in their entirety could result in 
denials of work permits to many asylumseekers detention and 
eventual deportation 
the game plan is to devote additional resources to deal with 
the asylum backlog involving nicaraguans and other central 
americans nelson chief of the us immigration and naturalization 
service said in an interview 
in harlingen texas nearly 12000 nicaraguans crossing the 
border illegally have filed applications since june seeking asylum 
in the united states claiming they have been persecuted in their 
home country 
under a july 1987 directive signed by thenattorney general edwin 
meese iii once nicaraguans file asylum applications it is virtually 
automatic that they are granted work permits in the united states 
while their applications are pending 
meeses order hailed by nicaraguans in the united states had 
the effect of liberalizing political asylum policy for nicaraguans 
who feared persecution if they returned to their homeland 
a clarification of the meese order was sent this month to ins 
field offices saying the meese memorandum doesnt require automatic 
granting of work authorization to nicaraguan asylum applicants whose 
claims are deemed frivolous 
nelson said that in harlingen salesmen are offering phony 
packets of asylum documents to nicaraguans and other central 
americans seeking refuge in the united states 
we have to have an orderly immigration system nelson said 
we want those with legitimate claims to immigrate and get them 
approved but we must avoid abuses and were seeing evidence of 
that in south texas 
ins has devoted few resources to reviewing the nicaraguans 
asylum applications but with a current nationwide backlog of 22000 
applicants and increases continuing ins approach is about to 
change 
nelson said half a dozen ins employees were being sent to texas 
to deal with the backlog of asylum applications and that some ins 
workers in los angeles were being diverted to handle the backlog 
there 
after the first of the year well likely add more to these 
three areas to cut the backlog nelson said 
the most recent asylum applications will be reviewed first and 
well work our way back to the older applications on a lastin 
firstout basis nelson said the speededup asylum reviews also 
would apply to other central americans seeking refuge in the united 
states 
canceling work permits issued to nicaraguans or not issuing work 
permits to new asylum applicants wont stop the influx of 
nicaraguans coming into the united states said roberto arguello 
chairman of the public relations committee of the nicaraguan 
american bankers association in miami 
nicaraguans would rather work under the worst kind of 
conditions imaginable than to face the harsh realities that the 
sandinista government has imposed over them arguello said 
arguello said he anticipates that by the summer over 1000 
nicaraguans a week will be coming to miami with the current level 
at more than 400 a week including people from all walks of life 
we have some nicaraguans coming to miami who cannot even read 
spanish 
the ins steps are not going to stop people from coming 
predicted maritza herrera executive director of the nicaraguan 
american foundation in miami they come here and theyre going to 
stay in the underground economy underpaid 
internal ins documents obtained by the associated press show the 
agency is contemplating a series of proposals which if implemented 
could result in many nicaraguans being detained promptly and 
ultimately deported once their asylum claims are rejected 
nelson is to meet this week with associate attorney general 
francis keating to go over various proposals which the ins 
commissioner said have already been discussed with the state 
department nelson refused to say specfically whether the proposals 
had been discussed with the white house but he added that these 
things dont happen in a vacuum 
nelson said the internal documents were draft proposals that were 
still in the discussion stage they include 
having the majority of asylum applicants in harlingen remain 
there while ins makes a determination whether their applications are 
frivolous 
applicants denied asylum would immediately be served with court 
orders and enter the deportation process 
ensuring the effective utilization of all possible detention 
capacity without adversely affecting the inss criminal alien 
program or detention of mariel cuban detainees ins detention 
facilities currently are crowded and ins spokesman duke austin 
downplayed the idea that substantial numbers of nicaraguans would be 
placed in detention facilities while awaiting final disposition of 
deportation proceedings 
instituting a fee system for asylum requests and work 
authorization requests and use the funds to help clear up the asylum 
case backlog

three subway buffs completed their version of 
what they called the longest subway ride in american history 
tuesday a 29hour 47minute marathon through each of the citys 
466 stations 
were here grubby but triumphant said richard temple 
expedition leader and all on one token we never left the 
system 
for 1 the three young men got a chance to view the sunrise over 
queens taste pastry under columbus circle and enter a squalid 
ladies room in coney island 
seizing an opportunity afforded by the opening of three new 
subway stations the first in 20 years the trio claimed to be the 
first people to ride through every station of the enlarged system 
why did they do it 
because its there temple said its something ive always 
wanted to do being something of a subway junkie 
because of subway delays the three friends temple 28 phil 
vanner 25 and tom murphy 29 finished almost three hours behind 
schedule 
despite the subways wellpublicized woes the travelers 
assessment was favorable beginning with a view of the sun rising 
from the elevated j train monday and ending tuesday morning with a 
tasty eclair purchased at a shop in manhattans columbus circle 
station they even found roses awaiting them at the finish a gift 
from some transit authority employees 
they said they went 15 hours before meeting their first 
panhandler and encountered just four in all only two cars were 
significantly marked by graffiti 
the riders took turns catnapping and bought some snacks at shops 
in stations although they brought along books and a tape player 
we mostly looked out the window and relaxed temple said 
the trio said the low point of their trip came monday night on 
the n line to coney island a onehour 45minute ordeal on an 
unheated train that often slowed to a crawl behind a trash 
collection train 
we were questioning our sanity recalled vanner 
when the trip began at 613 am monday at the jamaicavan wyck 
station the riders expected to be on the rails for 27 hours but 
various mixups including a rerouting during rush hour on tuesday 
morning forced them to improvise 
with 466 stations and 232 miles of track new york citys subway 
system is easily the nations largest and by some measures 
including the number of cars and stations the worlds largest

a special un general assembly session in 
geneva to hear plo chairman yasser arafat on the palestine problem 
will cost the world body about 645500 a un official said 
tuesday 
the general assembly voted this month to meet in geneva to hear 
arafat after the us state department refused him a visa to speak 
at un headquarters in new york us officials said they took the 
action because arafat was tied to terrorism 
arafat spoke on tuesday and asked israeli leaders to join peace 
talks 
the move to geneva represents the first time in the 43year 
history of the united nations that a session has been moved to 
protest a decision by a host country 
all un member states including the united states and israel 
will be assessed for their share of the costs said fred eckhard 
the uns chief financial spokesman israel also opposed granting a 
visa to the chief of the palestine liberation organization 
the united states will be asked to pay 25 percent of the special 
sessions costs totaling 161375 israel will be assessed their 
usual 02 percent totaling about 1420 
washingtons un mission sent its permanent representative gen 
vernon a walters two political advisers and a legal counsel said 
mission spokeswoman caroline dulin 
most costs of the session come from conference services and 
travel said bock cheng yeo a spokesman for the assemblys budget 
committee 
the costs of the session include 390200 for conference 
services such as overtime for translators and broadcast 
specialists 159800 for air tickets for the president of the 
general assembly a un secretariat officer a security officer 
one delegate from each of the 40 least developed nations among the 
uns 159 member states and 67700 for air tickets for 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar seven of his senior staff 
and 16 lowerranking staffers 
yeo said an austerity measure taken last year by the general 
assembly made a deep cut in potential travel costs until last year 
five delegates from every un member state were entitled to travel 
costs for sessions outside new york but the general assembly cut 
the allowance to one delegate only from the 40 least developed 
countries

experts see the soviet promise to devalue the 
ruble by 50 percent over the next two years as a welcome gesture 
but still just a gesture 
officially a ruble costs about 160 but on the black market 
in tunisia say you can get four five six rubles for a dollar 
said murray feshbach research professor in demography at georgetown 
university and a specialist in soviet economics so a 50 percent 
devaluation is only a start 
the devaluation by january 1990 was announced in the soviet press 
on friday in the following year an entirely new rate is to be 
established 
under the soviet decision the first devaluation will be only for 
trade purposes so foreign visitors in moscow will not find their 
vodka or hotel bills any cheaper in terms of their own currency 
its very different from making the ruble into a convertible 
currency said christian paddet an economist with chase manhattan 
bank in new york 
soviet officials have been saying that convertibility is their 
ultimate aim but it is likely to be many years before that takes 
place 
in the major capitalist countries currencies are freely 
convertible marks can be freely bought for yen and dollars can be 
freely sold for francs at prices set by international markets 
this has never been the case with the soviet ruble 
feshbach said the decision had been expected and is an 
indication that the soviets are more ready to face economic 
realities 
he suggested that the new exchange rate when it is actually 
applied could help western businesses that engage in joint ventures 
now being encouraged by the soviets 
a ruble with a lower value in terms of dollars or marks could be 
an advantage to such enterprises if the cheaper ruble enables them 
to spend less of their own currency to pay for soviet labor or goods 
of course that depends on the prices the soviets set 
feshbach said 
if they raise the prices at the same time as they devalue the 
advantage would be reduced

mayor marion barry jr has canceled the city 
governments participation in the annual new years eve celebration 
because of concerns over crime and cost but organizers said it will 
go on under private sponsorship 
officials of the old post office pavilion a complex of 
restaurants and shops that was focus for the party said they 
learned last month that barry planned to call off the mass event 
but they said tuesday they will have their own party with big band 
music dancing and other festivities targeted for the 3545 age 
group 
we feel that its an important tradition in washington said 
christine masterson pavilion marketing director 
each year that event attracted revelers to downtown washington 
including an estimated 100000 poeple last year 
on monday barry withdrew city support for the celebration 
citing the citys 150 million budget deficit and a drug and crime 
wave that has pushed the capitals homicide total to a record 347 
this year 
in a radio interview barry said canceling the event will save 
little money but he said i think were in serious times now 
with the crime being what it is and the drug epidemic its no time 
to celebrate its a time to work hard and to pray 
the cancelation spells the end for barrys ambitious hopes for 
the new years celebration which began in 1983 
barry boasted in 1986 that it would surpass new york citys 
celebration in times square which attracts about 1 million people 
and become a major tourist attraction in the revitalized 
pennsylvania avenue corridor between the white house and the capitol 
but a slaying during the 1986 celebration along with 15 arrests 
and reports of fighting and bottle throwing by youths led barry to 
make the entertainment more familyoriented 
in the past two years the city moved to ensure safety at the 
celebration by limiting alcohol sales adding police protection and 
changing the musical program

a 50 percent pay increase for 2500 top federal 
officials was recommended tuesday by a presidential commission which 
said members of congress should quit pocketing fees from 
specialinterest groups in exchange for heftier checks from the 
taxpayers 
i think the pressure on congress to get rid of honoraria is 
going to be very strong said lloyd cutler chairman of the 
commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries after 
the panel unanimously adopted its recommendations in my view it 
will be irresistible 
the commission recommended that members of congress and federal 
district judges who now make 89500 a year be paid 135000 the 
house speaker would go from 115000 to 175000 and majority and 
minority leaders from 99500 to 155000 top executivebranch 
officials such as cabinet members would get boosts from their 
current 99500 to 155000 
the proposed pay increases officially will be forwarded on 
wednesday to president reagan who can then accept or modify the 
figures before sending his budget to congress on jan 9 
under the law unless both the house and senate vote to head off 
the pay increases they automatically will take effect 30 days 
later congressional supporters of the increases hope to avoid any 
votes although opponents are unlikely to let the clock expire 
without a fight 
the pay commission also said congress should act to give the 
president whose salary has been fixed at 200000 since 1969 a 
raise to about 350000 such an increase could not take effect 
until 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising a 
presidents pay during his term 
commission members conceded that the recommended increases will 
appear huge to taxpayers but cutler noted that baseball players 
even 200hitting utility infielders receive more than a district 
court judge or a member of congress or a deputy secretary of state 
and they said the cost of the increase would be relatively small 
about 128 million overall in fiscal 1990 these numbers are 
probably no more than what gets spilled at the pentagon every day 
said cutler 
chief justice william h rehnquist said the panels action is 
bound to be encouraging to the nations federal judges the 
commissions salary recommendations would restore to those judges 
the cuts in real income which have been caused by inflation over the 
last 20 years 
not only the judges but everyone interested in attracting to 
the bench capable men and women for a lifetime of service will be 
well served if the president and congress follow these 
recommendations rehnquist said 
top federal workers buying power has declined 35 percent on 
average since 1969 when the salaries first were adjusted under the 
commissions recommendations tuesdays proposal was an attempt to 
play catchup with two decades of inflation 
it also was a way of tempting congress to wean itself from the 
burgeoning practice of seeking speaking fees from interest groups 
and giving lawmakers the political cover they need to accept a pay 
raise the selfstyled citizens lobby common cause noted that 
lawmakers had accepted a record 98 million in such fees in 1987 
the pay recommendations directly affect about 2500 top federal 
jobs and indirectly impact another 10000 highlevel positions 
where pay is tied to salaries in the top echelon 
in its report the commission cited testimony that top federal 
positions are going begging for talented people because of the huge 
discrepancy between government salaries and privatesector pay 
cutler noted that the average top executivebranch worker now 
stays on the job just 18 months they barely get to understand 
their jobs before they leave because of inadequate salaries he 
said cutler added that senior research posts at the national 
institutes of health have gone unfilled for 10 years because the 
government cant attract top talent he said 
but of all three branches the most appealing case is the case 
of the judges cutler said judges are leaving in droves to 
return to far more lucrative law practices soon theyll all be 
millionaire wall street lawyers you wont have blacks on the bench 
you wont have women on the bench 
the panel made it clear that it intended the raises to go 
handinhand with a ban on honoraria not only speaking fees but 
other ways in which specialinterest groups could funnel money to 
lawmakers to buy access and influence 
it is our devout intent that there be this quid pro quo said 
commission member and former sen thomas eagleton dmo we view 
that as an ample fulltime salary in return for which we expect 
congress will outlaw all forms of honoraria conceivable to man 
consumer advocate ralph nader called the pay recommendation a 
shameless salary grab and predicted a public revolt the public 
is saying you are freezing the minimum wage and asking for a pay 
increase top public officials already make several times the 
average working americans salary he said 
rep tom tauke riowa said he would oppose the pay increase and 
called on colleagues to scrap the law that lets such raises take 
effect without a vote 
house speaker jim wright dtexas who has publicly advocated 
doing away with honoraria will favor whatever salary level reagan 
proposes said an aide to the speaker 
rep tony coelho dcalif the majority whip predicted the pay 
raise will ultimately take effect the opportunity to beat up on 
this thing is great he said but the reality is that people 
with collegeage kids can no longer be involved in public service 
the american bar association embraced the commissions 
recommendations for the judiciary saying many of the men and 
women serving today on the federal bench are making extraordinary 
financial sacrifices in order to remain on the bench and many 
others who would aspire to the bench are finding the financial 
sacrifices too great 
the national taxpayers union said reagan should ignore these 
outrageous recommendations this scheme was designed to fool the 
voters and enrich the congress 
tuesdays recommendations were similar to those proposed by the 
commission in 1986 at that time reagan reduced the levels before 
submitting them to congress the senate voted to reject the pay 
raises but the house allowed the 30day clock to expire before 
voting and the increases took effect

a test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
that takes only five minutes and can be performed without 
sophisticated equipment was approved tuesday by the food and drug 
administration 
the new test called recombigen hiv1 latex agglutination test 
uses an engineered protein and microscopic beads to detect 
antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
the test costs about 10 and is designed for use only under 
supervision of medical professionals 
this technical advance should help make testing available to 
all who want to be tested fda commissioner frank e young said 
it will also be particularly useful in remote areas of the world 
that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests 
the test also may be useful he said as a preliminary 
screening measure in emergency situations in this country 
young said the test is not designed to replace the more accurate 
enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or elisa now used to screen 
donated blood and both the recombigen and elisa require a 
confirming test called the western blot because of possible false 
positive results 
recombigen consists of microscopic latex beads coated with an 
engineered protein taken from a portion of the outer surface of the 
aids virus the protein is produced by inserting a portion of the 
aids virus genetic material into the genes of a bacteria the 
bacteria then produces the aids protein the protein is refined and 
then applied to the surface of the beads 
to conduct the test a sample of blood is mixed with the coated 
beads within five minutes any aids antibodies in the blood sample 
will form clumps a process called agglutination 
this clumping then can be detected by a medical profssional under 
a strong light 
the test is much faster than elisa and western blot which take 
several hours and require sophisticated laboratory equipment 
an fda announcement said falsepositive reactions can occur in 
the test because of interpretation errors some medical conditions 
and problems of sample quality that do not ordinarily affect the 
elisa test 
the announcement said a positive result using the new test must 
be verified with repeat testing using a fresh blood sample and by 
the western blot test 
recombigen is manufactured by cambridge bioscience corp of 
worcester mass and distributed by baxter health care corp

palestinians said tuesday they saw progress 
in yasser arafats speech to the united nations but expressed doubt 
that israel would accept the plo peace plan 
israeli officials dismissed the appeal and us officials said 
his speech did not meet conditions washington has set for dealing 
with arafats palestine liberation organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel said we know what 
hides behind his words we know that as they are spoken acts of 
terror continue 
abduljawad saleh deported mayor of the west bank town of el 
bireh said even if arafat comes out and writes shamir a letter 
saying i recognize the state of israel i condemn terrorism i stop 
terrorism shamir would say go to hell 
saleh who lives in amman was among many palestinians who 
listened to a live radio broadcast of the plo chairmans speech 
tuesday to a special session of the un general assembly in geneva 
television stations in egypt kuwait qatar and abu dhabi also 
carried the address live 
arafat urged israel to join unsponsored peace talks intended 
to produce a peace settlement based on security for all nations of 
the region including israel and a palestinian state 
king hussein of jordan visiting paris said on french 
television chairman arafat has responded to every demand of the 
united states i know what was requested of the plo as i was 
personally involved in the past 
the united states has set three conditions for a dialogue with 
the plo that it clearly recognize israels right to exist renounce 
terrorism and accept un resolutions that give all nations of the 
region the right to exist within secure borders 
us officials said arafats speech was interesting but did not 
meet the conditions 
in washington swedish embassy spokesman lars romert said his 
country served as a messenger between the us government and 
plo he said the palestinians sought clarification of american 
conditions for official dealings 
esmat abdelmeguid foreign minister of egypt followed arafat to 
the podium in geneva and said i call on israel to respond to 
this positive palestinian proposal to reach a just and lasting 
peace 
egypt signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 the only arab 
nation to have done so jordan and egypt have been essential 
elements in virtually every us peace proposal since israel was 
born in war 40 years ago 
rami khoury a jordanian journalist and publisher said of 
arafats speech i think its very positive and historic its 
really the first time in a practical way that the plos 
acceptance of coexistence and the twostate solution has been taken 
to the next level of a practical series of steps 
khoury said israel the united states and some european countries 
demanding specific conditions from the plo have so painted 
themselves into a corner that when arafat offers to make peace they 
say no youve got to say the words in this order 
many palestinians said they oppose further concessions until the 
plo gets something in return from israel and the united states 
what more do they want from us asked khalid saadi a 
38yearold amman businessman recognition cannot come from one 
side israel has to recognize the palestinian state and the 
palestinian people 
mohammed hamdam a physician said we call on the whole world 
to understand that what was asked of the plo was given

some of congress most visible and 
controversial perks the 1000 breakfast the 2000 lunch and the 
10000 allexpensespaid tours of defense plants came under fire 
tuesday from a presidential commission 
the panel while recommending 50 percent pay increases for top 
federal officials suggested that members of the house and senate 
honor their part of the bargain by dumping their honoraria 
the commission said members of congress should be paid 135000 
instead of 89500 but they should give up the speaking and writing 
fees that brought in a record 98 million in 1987 up 30 percent 
over 1986 
unlike bureaucrats and judges members of congress are free to 
use their positions to collect speaking fees most often from lobby 
groups and trade associations with a stake in a members votes in 
committee or on the floor 
the potential for abuse or the appearance of abuse is obvious 
to the public the salary commission said in a report to president 
reagan the only principled argument that can be made for the 
practice of accepting honoraria is that official salaries are too 
low 
this put the commission in line with longtime honoraria critics 
like fred wertheimer president of common cause the selfstyled 
citizens lobby 
the growing practice of accepting honoraria from special 
interests raises intolerable conflicts of interest and gravely 
undermines the integrity of congress and the public trust in 
government wertheimer said tuesday 
there is no limit on how much a member can make through 
honoraria the 1987 capitol hill champion rep dan rostenkowski 
the illinois democrat who heads the taxwriting ways and means 
committee pulled in 245000 
there are limits however on how much a member can keep the 
senate has a limit amounting to 40 percent of official salary or 
35800 the houses limit is 30 percent of salary or 26850 
there is a 2000 cap on a single honoraria payment 
to keep within the limit rostenkowski gave 219156 of his 1987 
honoraria earnings to various charities leaving 25844 for 
himself the senates top honoraria earner in 1987 minority leader 
bob dole rkan made 106050 on the speaking circuit gave 
80000 to charity and kept 26050 for himself neary 10000 less 
than he could have kept 
neither man nor any of their colleagues would suffer an earnings 
cut under the commissions plan a senator now keeping honoraria to 
the limit would be 9700 ahead of the current system if the pay 
goes to 135000 a house member at the limit would end up 18650 
ahead 
according to financial disclosure statements 87 senators 
received 31 million in honoraria in 1987 keeping 23 million or 
nearly 74 percent in the house 390 of the 435 members shared 667 
million and kept about 78 percent of it 524 million

south africa cuba and angola signed a 
usmediated peace plan tuesday stipulating that southwest africa 
will become independent and 50000 cuban soldiers will leave angola 
westernbacked rebels fighting the government of angola were not 
included in the agreement which would end only foreign fighting 
there 
this will bring an end to international conflict in 
southwestern africa said chester crocker the us diplomat who 
was the agreements chief architect it is the end of a sad 
chapter in african history 
crocker assistant secretary of state for african affairs said 
the accord was achieved in large part through ussoviet 
cooperation 
crockers negotiations on southwest africa also known as 
namibia were a central element in the reagan administrations 
constructive engagement policy toward south africa which 
congress rejected in favor of sanctions 
applause by black african diplomats and officials interrupted 
foreign minister rf botha of south africa when he declared 
tuesday a new era has begun my government is removing racial 
discrimination we want to be accepted by our african brothers we 
need each other 
south africa clearly sees the agreement as a chance to improve an 
international image marred by its apartheid system of racial 
discrimination and end conflict that has cost hundreds of millions 
of dollars and killed hundreds of white soldiers 
botha signed for south africa in a ceremony attended by the congo 
president denis sassoungueso whose government has been host to 
several negotiating sessions meetings leading to the agreement 
began in may 
also signing the agreement tuesday were angolas military chief 
of staff antonio dos santos franca and ricardo alarcon quesada 
cuban deputy foreign minister alarcon said it begins a new era of 
peace 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also hailed 
the pact 
we hope that this major diplomatic milestone in southern africa 
will be followed by renewed efforts to settle the internal conflict 
in angola through a process of national reconcilation and peaceful 
negotiation among angolans he said 
the agreement to be formalized in a treaty scheduled for signing 
dec 22 in new york does not end the civil war in angola but bars 
the involvement of south african and cuban forces 
prowestern guerrillas of the union for the total independence of 
angola or unita have fought the marxist government of angola since 
independence from portugal in 1975 
some african leaders have expressed hope the withdrawal of cuban 
and south african troops would lead to negotiations between angola 
and jonas savimbis unita rebels who have been supported by south 
africa and the united states 
south african military sources reported new fighting monday 
between angolan soldiers and unita 
whatever the course of angolas civil conflict the agreement if 
carried out successfully would end 22 years of sporadic bush 
warfare in namibia a territory rich in minerals that south africa 
has controlled since capturing it from germany in world war i 
the southwest african peoples organization which has been 
fighting south africa for control of namibia from bases inside 
angola welcomed the pact tuesday 
we are happy that at long last our people will be able to 
exercise their right of selfdetermination said spokesman hidipo 
hamutenya 
he said his groups forces in namibia will observe an informal 
ceasefire and fight only if provoked or cornered 
the league of nations gave south africa a mandate but the un 
general assembly withdrew it in 1966 and has tried since then to get 
the south africans out 
botha said implementation of a un independence plan will begin 
april 1 and elections are expected seven months later 
speaking to reporters on the flight from johannesburg to the 
congolese capital he also said the plan calls for 3000 cuban 
troops to leave angola before april 1 all 50000 are to be out 
within 27 months 
about half the cubans are expected to be withdrawn by the time 
elections are held in southwest africa about nov 1 1989 most of 
those remaining are to move north at least 350 miles from the 
namibian frontier 
prisoners of war are to be exchanged and a joint commission will 
be formed to resolve disputes cuba and angola are to negotiate an 
agreement with javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral 
for verification of the cuban withdrawal 
politicians in windhoek the territorial capital reacted with 
wary approval 
andreas shipanga a black namibian who is cabinet chairman in the 
transitional government said of the day when the independence plan 
is supposed to go into effect april fools day i dont trust

is santa claus a compulsive shopper why are his 
favorite colors red and green the colors of rage and envy and does 
he really drink 
in the decidedly nonchristmas spirit of selfpromotion a boston 
advertising agency tuesday unveiled an expose by one rudolph 
rn reindeer that lays bare the sad truth behind the ho ho ho 
one year after taking on santa as a client in search of a yuppie 
image the firm of heller breene shoots down the myth of kriss 
kringle via a book written by the disgruntled reindeer called a 
stocking full of lies 
fed up with being no 2 rudolph tells a lurid story of a santa 
claus paranoid over shopping mall imposters perpetually struggling 
with obesity a man who buys everything in sight and gives it all 
to total strangers 
and what exactly happened on christmas eve 1927 in amsterdam 
the agency writes in a synopsis rudolph and his fellow reindeer 
accustomed to waiting less than a minute above each chimney found 
themselves hovering for a full hour above this particular one 
santa maintains he got stuck but if so why was he blushing 
when he eventually returned to the sleigh 
tacky tasteless silly 
well the truth hurts sometimes you know said cheryl 
heller the agencys chairman and creative director if you think 
about it there have to be some terrific conflicts in a man like 
santa 
who knows him better and who has a better ax to grind she 
said all those years of playing second fiddle and being 
unappreciated 
after billing itself as new englands hottest and most creative 
agency heller breene executives were redfaced to learn they 
misspelled rudolf on the glossy bookjacket ad accompanying a 
news release quoting its own executives as well as the reindeer and 
a santa spokesman 
heller said the spelling was intentional in becoming an 
artiste now he has some creative expression she said its like 
barbra streisand 
the agency last year took on the claus account to revitalize his 
image and break with 600 years of tradition 
the santa biography is aimed at the flurry of kissandtell books 
published in 1988 
it was not my intention to destroy santa rudolph is quoted 
as saying but there are certain things the world has to know 
beneath that cuddly image lies a disturbed and dangerous man 
someone has to protect the children

the national commission on working women on 
tuesday honored the broadcast industry for making the 1980s a 
decade of progress for women on television 
our report shows progress in the treatment of women on 
television over the past ten years and because of that the 
networks get a pat on the back said sally streenland who wrote a 
study released by the commission entitled ten years in prime time 
an analysis of the image of women on entertainment television 
19791988 
the report citing the expansion and diversification of female 
characters in primetime television examined the portrayal of women 
and compared the fictional panorama with the profile of reallife 
women during the decade 
the 1980s mark a decade of progress for women on television 
their portrayals have become more diverse and for the most part 
more truetolife the report concluded 
the commission also presented three new milestone awards to 
people who have made outstanding contributions to advancing the 
role of women through the media the recipients were abc news 
senior correspondent carole simpson cagney amp lacey tv series 
actresses sharon gless and tyne daly and executive producer barney 
rosenzweig and national public radio 
the studys examination of the 25 top nielsen rated shows from 
1979 to the 1988 fall season revealed that as the percentage of 
working mothers increased in the workplace so did their percentage 
in tv portrayals 
the study showed that 60 percent of tvs female characters worked 
in 1979 threequarters of the tv women were single 10 percent were 
single mothers and 5 percent were married mothers 
by 1987 75 percent of the women americans watched on television 
worked onefourth were single 15 percent single mothers and 20 
percent married mothers according to the report 
meanwhile 1987 population statistics from the us census bureau 
showed 56 percent of all women were in the labor force 25 percent 
have never been married 30 percent are married working mothers 10 
percent are single mothers and 25 percent are homemakers 
the pat on the back is a somewhat soft one because despite the 
growing diversity in these areas television has been fascinated 
with wealth for much of the 80s said streenland citing 
nighttime soap operas there has not been that diversity 
economically 
streenlands study showed tv painting a much rosier picture than 
actually existed of the types of employment women had 
in 1979 more than 40 percent of televisions women were employed 
in clerical or service jobs with a corresponding percentage in 
professional jobs by 1987 only 23 percent of the women on tv had 
the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional careers 
the real life portrait was almost exactly reversed with 47 
percent in clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent 
working in professional or managerial jobs in the real world 
twothirds of us women earn 15000 or less only 1 percent earn 
more than 50000 
the report also showed the percentage of black women on tv almost 
tripled during the period studied in 1979 there was only one black 
female character representing 8 percent of the women on tv that 
year by 1987 22 percent of the women on tv were black 
but only 2 percent of tvs women in 1987 were hispanic and there 
were no asian or other minority women depicted in reality 77 
percent of women in the united states are white 125 percent are 
black 75 percent are hispanic and 3 percent are other minority 
women 
the commission also presented its annual alice awards to 
actresses producers and journalists for excellence in portraying 
working womens issues in radio and television at a luncheon 
ceremony tuesday 
since joining the commission and the broadcast awards program 
i more perfectly understand the importance of portraying reallife 
situations said actress linda lavin whose waitress character 
gave the commissions award its name i think twice about the 
roles i take and the programs i produce 
carole simpson who won one of the milestone awards said i 
would have to say that entertainment has moved along further than 
news has it is still astounding to me that at my network there 
are 115 correspondents and only 15 of them are women that there is 
no woman anchoring the news on a daily broadcast

a tax lawyer testified tuesday he advised 
political extremist lyndon h larouche jr not to file federal 
returns because he had no income and that he was so uncaring about 
his basic needs that he wore baggy suits and wornout shoes 
the lawyer mayer morganroth of new york and southfield mich 
told a federal jury that larouches publishers and political 
supporters provided his food clothing housing and other 
necessities to enable him to conduct research write articles and 
make speeches promoting his various causes 
morganroth said he believed the goods and services did not 
represent income for larouche but were intended to benefit the 
publishers and other larouche organizations from whom larouche 
didnt get paid anything 
the lawyer said he gave his view of larouches tax liability at a 
1979 meeting with larouche and his chief accountant gerald doherty 
and that his position was endorsed at a december 1984 meeting with 
harold dubrowsky a detroit lawyer for the prominent accounting firm 
of grant thornton 
at the second meeting which larouche reportedly did not attend 
morganroth quoted dubrowsky as saying it was a totally defensible 
position to say that larouche received no income and need not file 
tax returns 
morganroth was a key witness called by defense attorneys to 
testify on the 13th day of larouches trial in us district court 
on tax and mail fraud conspiracy charges 
another defense witness thomas seay of washington who conducted 
a yearlong review of larouche financial records for the defense 
team said larouche was an employee of all the organizations under 
his control but did not receive any taxable income seay agreed that 
larouche and was not required to file any federal income tax returns 
under questioning by prosecutors seay conceded that he did not 
have any access to financial records prior to july 1986 and which 
were seized by federal agents who raided larouches leesburg va 
headquarters in october 1986 
seay also acknowledged under questioning that he did not know for 
sure whether larouche received a minimum 1080 in income which 
requires filing tax returns 
larouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service by failing to file returns for any tax year since 
1978 and having all his personal expenses paid by various 
corporations he controls 
in addition larouche and six associates are charged with mail 
fraud and conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in 
loans from supporters that they never intended to repay 
if convicted of all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million 
morganroth testified he didnt know who was paying larouches 
expenses but that it was assumed wherever he went he was provided 
a roof and security so he could write and do research for his 
writings 
said morganroth his clothes were quite minimal his shoes were 
worn down the suits he had on were baggy like someone had thrown 
them away his teeth needed work on them it was obvious he didnt 
care for his daily needs 
the witness said he had not received even half of the estimated 
500000 in legal fees he had charged the larouche organization for 
his tax advice and had written off 125000 as a bad debt 
asked if he was a larouche supporter morganroth replied far 
from it 
another defense witness who testified tuesday was richard morris 
a san francisco corporate lawyer and former aide to william p clark 
when clark was deputy secretary of state white house national 
security adviser and interior secretary during president reagans 
first term 
at the white house in 19821983 morris said he had numerous 
conversations with larouche supporters who passed along their 
concerns about reagans star wars plan for a spacebased missile 
defense system terrorism in west germany third world debt and 
intelligence matters regarding the soviet union 
morris said he forwarded any credible information from larouche 
supporters to specialists on the national security council staff 
but he heeded orders from us intelligence agencies and refused to 
give any information to larouche operatives in return 
morris said his contacts in the cia and the defense intelligence 
agency warned him that larouche was a socialist fascist 
communist a member of the kgb and even a democrat but morris 
said that then and now he believed larouche supporters were acting 
in good faith and in the best interests of the united states as they 
saw it

a widow has beaten the louvre and its army of 
highpowered art experts in a 20year legal battle over ownership of 
a 17th century painting that she has sold for 14 million 
the louvre bought olympos and marsyas the rustic scene by 
17th century landscape artist nicolas poussin for 366 in 1968 
but owner suzanne saintarroman 78 won her fight in the french 
courts and forced the gallery to take it out of storage and return 
it to her 
olympos and marsyas was sold monday night at an auction house 
off the champselysees for the equivalent of 14 million 
my aunt was delighted but she was very emotional because her 
husband was not there to enjoy the victory said a niece who 
accompanied mrs saintarroman to the auction 
the niece said mrs saintarroman would not comment because her 
doctor advised several days rest after the excitement the niece 
herself spoke on condition of anonymity 
a swiss man is the new owner of the painting but he bid by 
telephone and did not wish to reveal his identity according to 
jacques tajan a spokesman for auctioneers drouotmontaigne 
the poussin affair began in 1968 when mrs saintarromans 
husband jean a mining engineer decided to sell a family heirloom 
he chose a dark shadowy painting executed between 1625 and 1628 of 
scowling gods making music surrounded by nymphs and a rosycheeked 
infant holding up a crown of flowers 
saintarroman consulted auctioneer maurice rheims who studied 
the work with expert robert lebel they attributed it to the 
carracci school a lesser known group of bolognese artists 
the painting brought 366 at auction but the louvre whose 
experts recognized it as a poussin took advantage of its right of 
preemption under french law to acquire the picture at the last 
bid price 
shortly after le monde newspaper reported the louvre had made 
a rare discovery akin to a shooting star with the purchase 
of a poussin for a scant sum 
the shooting star turned out to be saintarromans painting 
and he filed suit against the louvre the auctioneer and the expert 
the case has been in court ever since in 1972 the auction sale 
was annulled by the tribunal de paris the louvre then took the 
painting down and put it in storage where it has been ever since 
in 1984 saintarroman died and his widow continued the fight 
three years later after a series of appeals a versailles court 
handed down a final ruling ordering the louvre to return the 
painting to mrs saintarroman 
in a statement the french judge said the louvre did not have the 
right to use its vast resources financed by the public to cheat a 
private citizen 
the louvre has so many resources experts documents 
hightech equipment which should all be in the service of 
individuals and not used to make a profit at their expense tajan 
said in an interview 
but he said he considered the painting hardly a masterpiece 
its a lovely interesting historical document because of its 
dark somber style which is characteristic of poussins early 
period in which he was imitating other more popular painters of the 
period he said

afghanistans sovietbacked government 
now says its own warplanes not pakistans dropped the bombs last 
weekend that killed 24 people in kandahar province western 
diplomats reported tuesday 
the initial kabul radio report directed suspicion at pakistan by 
saying lowflying aircraft approached the southern province from the 
east but the diplomats said a later report admitted the afghan air 
force dropped the bombs 
in a burst of unexplained candor soviet and regime media have 
announced the attacks by afghan aircraft of civilian targets in 
kandahar and announced an attempted takeover of the 2nd corps 
headquarters nov 21 by disaffected officers one of the 
diplomats said all spoke on condition of anonymity 
official reports of the attempted takeover said several renegade 
military officers led 400 extremists presumably a reference to 
guerrillas into the corps headquarters but the invaders were 
repulsed 
whether or not these public statements of events which would 
have received much less notice otherwise are intended to portray 
the pdpa and regime as incompetent they certainly are accomplishing 
that end the diplomat said 
president najib of afghanistan is head of afghanistans communist 
party called the peoples democratic party of afghanistan or pdpa 
there have been reports the kremlin is easing him out 
diplomats corroborated guerrilla claims that portions of a 
strategic highway linking the afghan capital to pakistan were closed 
the road is a major route for food convoys to kabul and the 
eastern city of jalalabad diplomats reported heavy fighting and 
said many army wounded had been taken to kabul 
guerrillas have stopped all vehicle traffic near sarobi 30 miles 
east of kabul and travelers must walk for a number of hours 
before finding transporation to continue their journey a diplomat 
said 
moslem insurgents began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1978 and soviet military forces entered the country 
in december 1979 
an estimated 115000 red army soldiers were in afghanistan when a 
unmediated agreement to withdraw them was signed april 14 in 
geneva about half have been pulled out and all are to be gone by 
feb 15 1989 
at least 3 million afghan refugees live in towns and refugee 
camps just inside the pakistani border which the guerrillas use as 
bases and supply points the rebels are supported by pakistan and 
the united states

a palestinian shepherd crushed 
a jewish settlers skull with a rock tuesday grabbed his rifle and 
fired on an army patrol killing a soldier before other troopers 
killed him the army reported 
two soldiers were wounded the army spokesmans office said 
the deaths of the settler and soldier bring to 13 the number of 
israelis killed since a rebellion began dec 8 1987 among the 15 
million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip at 
least 323 palestinians have been slain and more than 7000 wounded 
maj gen amram mitzna israels west bank commander said the 
attack occurred near near berakha a hilltop jewish settlement two 
miles south of nablus it took place shortly before plo chairman 
yasser arafat addressed the un general assembly in geneva and 
called for peace with israel 
settlers at berakha said palestinians from burin the nearby 
village where the assailant lived had uprooted trees and planted 
their own crops on settlement land 
mitzna told reporters the shepherds family was involved in a 
land dispute with the settlement but whether that prompted the 
attack was not clear 
in the afternoon an israeli resident of berakha was brutally 
murdered by an arab shepherd mitzna said the shepherd crushed 
the israelis head with a stone then took his m16 and ambushed a 
military patrol 
this shepherd is known to us in the past members of his 
family sabotaged some tractors and plows in the settlement 
the 70000 jews who occupy 131 settlements in the west bank and 
gaza are allowed to carry weapons for protection 
mitzna said the palestinian killed the driver of a patrol jeep 
and wounded an israeli officer in the leg and the army spokesman 
said another soldier was slightly wounded 
soldiers in the jeep returned the fire killing the shepherd 
mitzna said arab sources said he was hamdan najjar 25 and often 
grazed his flock near berakha 
the settler identifed as yaakov pereg 33 was on routine patrol 
outside the settlement mitzna said berakha founded in 1981 is 
home to about 20 religiously observant jewish families 
soldiers put a curfew on burin and searched the area 
mitzna and lt gen dan shomron the army chief of staff met 
with settlement leaders tuesday night the settlers demanded that

principal was beaten the residents said 
four palestinians were wounded in confrontations elsewhere in the 
west bank including a 13yearold boy shot in the chest and right 
arm at the fara refugee camp near nablus hospital officials said 
soldiers imposed a curfew on the entire gaza strip shouting 
through megaphones they would fire on those who violated the order 
confining all 650000 palestinians to their homes residents 
reported 
the roundtheclock curfew was imposed in an effort to prevent 
antiisraeli violence after arafats address in geneva 
an associated press reporter taken on a tour of gaza by the army 
saw smoldering tires and watched patrols weave in and out of narrow 
alleys hunting curfew violators two outlawed palestinian flags 
attached to helium balloons floated over gaza city

spoke they exploded fireworks and emitted the shrieks and 
ululations associated with arab celebrations

burned tires and chanted nationalist songs while masked youths 
danced waving balloons and pictures of the palestine liberation

vietnam will start withdrawing 
18000 troops from cambodia on thursday in a weeklong transfer along 
four land routes and down the mekong river army spokesman lt gen 
nguyen van thai announced 
he told a news conference on tuesday that the seventh partial 
pullout will leave 50000 vietnamese troops fighting three cambodian 
guerrilla groups the communist khmer rouge and two noncommunist 
groups 
communist vietnams withdrawal promised for completion by the 
end of 1990 has raised fears that the khmer rouge will become the 
dominant military force in the country and institute a second reign 
of terror 
but thai told reporters the prohanoi cambodian army along with 
the remaining vietnamese troops can take care of themselves 
thai said the largest single withdrawing element consists of 
6000 troops and 300 vehicles that will begin a fiveday trek across 
the length of the country thursday from battambang and sisophon in 
northwestern cambodia to vietnams tay ninh province in the east 
one infantry division and an engineer regiment will leave phnom 
penh the cambodian capital by boat down the mekong river which 
flows into southern vietnam he said 
vietnam says it has withdrawn 32000 troops so far this year and 
with this weeks 18000 it will have pulled out the 50000 it 
promised to send home in 1988 some western diplomatic sources in 
bangkok said recently that only 15000 to 20000 were withdrawn so 
far this year 
but western analysts after describing earlier announced pullouts 
as mere troop rotations say hanoi appears serious about leaving 
most of the fighting to the phnom penh government and husbanding its 
stretched resources for domestic economic development 
the analysts and sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
hanois military presence in cambodia has seriously fractured its 
ties to the western world china japan and other countries the 
united states has said it will not establish diplomatic ties until 
after a total pullout 
but concern also has arisen that the khmer rouge estimated at 
between 30000 and 40000 will prove stronger than either the phnom 
penh army or its own cambodian allies and make another grab for 
power 
before being toppled by vietnams invasion force in early 1979 
the khmer rouge forced cambodia into a brutal regimented society 
hundreds of thousands died in forced labor communes and mass 
killing fields 
western diplomatic sources estimate the phnom penh armys 
strength at 44000 regular soldiers and the combined strength of 
the noncommunist factions uneasily allied with the khmer rouge is 
about 27000 
thai said some units returning to vietnam will be demobilized as 
part of a major reduction of the countrys massive military strength 
over the next few years the reduction would involve more than 
300000 personnel thai said 
with more than a million regular soldiers under arms vietnam 
fields the worlds fifth largest armed force after the soviet union 
china the united states and india

a news agency reported tuesday 
that greek heiress christina onassis took a significant dose of a 
sedative before she died last month but it did not blame her death 
on the drug 
responding to the report the friend who was hosting ms onassis 
when she died said the drug was for the heiress housekeeper and 
ruled out any possibility of suicide 
im surprised and i cant believe it mrs marina dodero 
said of the report i doubt it and the forensic results are not 
in 
the private news agency noticias argentinas drew no connection 
between ms onassis death and the barbituate which it identified 
as optalidon the agency based its report on judicial sources it did 
not identify 
ms onassis the 37yearold multimillionaire daughter of the 
late aristotle onassis died nov 19 at the country home of mrs 
dodero 
initial reports said she apparently suffered a heart attack and 
a preliminary coroners statement said the death was caused by a 
buildup of fluid in the lungs federal judge alberto piotti is 
directing an inquiry into what caused the accumulation of fluid to 
determine whether the death was from natural causes 
piottis secretary told the associated press in a telephone 
interview tuesday that final forensic reports have not been 
submitted to the judge we dont have knowledge of that 
information about the sedative the secretary said 
mrs dodero said in an interview with a buenos aires television 
station that the heiress was afraid of taking medicine 
she said the optalidon was for ms onassis housekeeper heleni 
syros 
ms onassis family ruled out last month any possibility that ms 
onassis committed suicide 
she was completely happy mrs dodero said tuesday she 
would never take an action of that kind because of the enormous love 
she had for her daughter 3yearold athena 
the child will inherit most of her mothers wealth estimated at 
500 million christina onassis father who was married to 
president kennedys widow jacqueline kennedy built his fortune on

the transportation department is reviewing a 
request by one of the countrys major railroads to eliminate random 
tests as part of a drug testing program for railroad workers 
officials said tuesday 
csx transportation inc filed a petition with the federal 
railroad administration this week asking that a railroad not be 
required to conduct random drug tests if it already has a proven 
drug testing program under way 
the dot maintains that random testing is an integral part of an 
effective drug testing program for transportation workers involved 
in safety related jobs 
but csx one of the nations largest railroad companies said 
random testing is at best an untried experiment and that there 
are other methods to combat drug abuse problem in the railroad 
industry 
fra administrator john riley said the petition will be given 
full and fair consideration as will any other suggestion for a 
modification of the drug testing requirements that were announced 
last month 
unions representing 200000 railroad workers sued tuesday in 
federal court in san francisco challenging the drug testing program 
in the railroad industry 
the suit contends random drug testing without suspicion of 
current drug use violates constitutional standards for searches it 
also contends the fra has no legal authority to order random testing 
a suit by the unions in the same court resulted in a ruling by 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in february prohibiting 
postaccident drug testing by railroads without reasonable suspicion 
of individual drug use that case was one of two drug testing cases 
argued before the supreme court last month no ruling has been 
issued 
the transportation department on nov 14 said millions of 
transportation workers including railroad workers will be subject 
to a broad range of drug tests beginning in december 1989 
the random tests have been strongly opposed by labor but most 
transportation companies have endorsed them as being necessary 
during a series of hearings on drug testing csx was the only 
railroad that opposed random testing 
in its petition csx said it does not believe the evidence 
supports random drug testing as the most effective means of 
combating drug abuse in the industry 
csx asked that a railroad be exempted from the random testing 
requirement if it can show that its existing drug testing program 
works as well or better than the expectations of random drug 
testing 
random testing in the railroad industry is at best an untried 
experiment with many admitted unknowns csx said in a statement 
that belief is based not on supposition but on the railroads 
actual experience

a judge on tuesday ordered the assets of 
the troubled ptl television ministry sold to a toronto real estate 
developer for 65 million 
stephen mernick a 34yearold orthodox jew bid 3625 million 
on monday in a session at heritage usa headquarters near fort mill 
but after meeting tuesday with attorneys for the ministry and for 
the creditors he agreed to increase his bid to 65 million 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds approved the sale at a 
hearing in columbia just more than a week after ptl founder jim 
bakker and three former associates were indicted by a federal grand 
jury in north carolina 
the heritage usa theme park and accompanying satellite television 
operation were left behind by bakker in march 1987 after it was 
revealed he had a sexual liaison with new york church secretary 
jessica hahn and paid her to keep quiet about it 
the ministry filed for reoganization under bankruptcy laws in 
june 1987 and attempts to sell it had included two auctions before 
tuesdays session the sessions monday and in november produced no 
acceptable bids 
included in the sale were 2200 acres of property a 500room 
hotel a water park a television studio and a 2000seat church 
reynolds polled major creditors and nearly all approved the sale 
to mernick saying they believed it was the best deal they would get 
mernick would take over the administration and operations 41 days 
after reynolds approved the sale and closing would be 60 days later 
were excited mernick told reporters outside the courthouse 
were very excited and happy we won we look forward to being 
here 
he would not answer questions about plans for heritage usa 
including whether heritage ministries the nonprofit religious 
spinoff would be able to continue leasing the television ministry 
and church at fort mill 
mernick has said he was buying the property as an investment but 
would considering keeping heritage usa operating as a christian 
theme park 
we are in the middle of ongoing discussions with heritage 
ministries mernick said 
mernicks family has roots in toronto real estate that go back 40 
years but he was little known outside the areas orthodox jewish 
community until march when he purchased the old firestone canada 
inc tire plant in hamilton ontario 
his holdings include a landfill in the toronto area a 50 percent 
interest in a local waste disposal and recycling company and 
wholesale and retail travel agencies 
had no acceptable bid been submitted ptl would have been broken 
up and sold courtappointed bankruptcy trustee mc red benton 
said after mondays failed auction 
bidders this week also included michael karas president of first 
canadian development co of toronto sam johnson president of ptls 
religious operations who is trying to get major contributors to buy 
back the ministry and cy bahakel owner of 15 television and radio 
stations 
bahakel a former north carolina state senator said his partner 
in his attempt to by ptls assets is george shinn majority owner of 
the charlotte hornets basketball team shinn considered buying 
heritage usa last spring but never made a formal bid 
faison barnes an attorney for bahakel objected to the bidding 
procedures 
it appears to us that was a negotiated deal between yesterdays 
auction and the appearance in court today barnes told reporters 
were going to very careful consideration to an appeal 
johnson acknowledged that heritage ministries was about 1 
million behind in lease payments to ptl but said he remained 
confident that contributors would eventually back the effort to buy 
back heritage usa 
johnson said mernick told him we want to work with you were 
sensitive to your needs 
a month ago mernick said he would pay 115 million 50 million 
in cash but reynolds rejected the bid saying there were inadequate 
assurances that mernick would pay the remaining 65 million 
the offers monday were far below the total appraised value of 
ptls assets 92 million to 110 million in an appraisal dated 
aug 18 arthur little amp co of atlanta said ptls assets would be 
worth 76 million to 85 million if sold piecemeal 
the grand jury that indicted bakker on dec 5 is scheduled to 
reconvene jan 17 a source familiar with the investigation said 
tuesday in charlotte the source demanded anonymity 
the panel has accused bakker and former top aide richard dortch 
of diverting more than 4 million in ptl money to support their own 
lavish and extravagant lifestyles 
two other former aides brothers david and james taggart each 
were indicted on six tax charges 
bakker who has avoided reporters since his indictment and the 
others are to appear in court thursday

a state prosecutor has asked for a sentence of 15 
years in prison at hard labor for the late soviet leader leonid 
brezhnevs soninlaw yuri churbanov who is on trial for 
corruption tass reported on tuesday 
the official soviet news agency said prosecutor alexander sboyev 
summed up his case on monday and tuesday and that defense lawyers 
will take the floor after a short interval 
churbanov was first deputy interior minister before brezhnev died 
in 1982 he is accused of accepting more than a million dollars in 
bribes to protect a criminal network that extended throughout the 
southern republic of uzbekistan 
the trial of churbanov and eight other defendants has been the 
centerpiece of a recent campaign aginst the brezhnev era whose 
18year rule in the soviet union is portrayed as a time of 
corruption and stagnation 
churbanov now 51 married brezhnevs daughter galina in 1971 and 
almost at once began rising rapidly to the upper echelons of the 
interior police force 
the state prosecutor regarded the bribe as a malicious 
instrument of corrupted consciousness which become simply monstrous 
in the hands of law enforcement bodies tass said 
the defendants held key posts in soviet law enforcement bodies 
whose duty it is to fight against injustice embezzlement state 
deceit and of course bribery in all its forms 
churbanov was accused of accepting 1133000 in bribes but 
sboyev suggested a reduction to 675000 in the amount of money 
churbanov allegedly took since it could not be proven that he had 
accepted the rest of the money 
sbobyev also recommended reducing the sum of bribes allegedly 
accepted by khaidar yakhayev a codefendant who also faces 15 years 
at hard labor 
the prosecutor recommended sentences for the seven other 
codefendants ranging from six to 13 years in hard labor camps 
he asked that all property of the defendants be confiscated

curve just before daybreak monday

blond hair coming our from under his hat and the black bicycle 
frame said his grieving stepfather richard hogenson as i 
heard the thud and was bringing the car to a stop i thought gee 
i hope thats not larry

second car then hit him and a third car dragged him 45 feet along 
the road the florida highway patrol said the teenager was 
pronounced dead at the scene

is 55 mph and the bicycle had reflectors but no light the boys

party and the major opposition party clashed tuesday night over 
charges that an opposition mayor took part in killing an election 
official 
fidel chavez mena the nominee of the governing christian 
democrats in the march 1989 presidential election said that mayor

investigation has found no evidence that involves vasquez as the 
author of the murder 
the arena leader accused the christian democrats of using the 
incident for political purposes and said its the judicial 
tribunals and not politicians or candidates who can give 
conclusions 
he said his party would cooperate with official investigations 
and that if anyone is found to be involved we would be the first 
to say that all the weight of the law should fall against the guilty 
one 
christian democratic officials said vasquez was among a group 
that forced eduardo bonilla and several companions to get out of the 
car in soyapango four miles north of san salvador the capital one 
of those who got out was beaten and eduardo bonilla was shot when he 
tried to intervene they said 
there was no official confirmation of the account

fire unit making the trip into some highcrime areas safer crowley 
said going into the projects alone is a problem 
there was no one throwing rocks out the window said randy 
taylor a resident there was just i think fear of the black 
community 
i used to have asthma and this happened to us several times 
my mother used to have to scuffle around trying to get me to the 
hospital when i was a little boy 
the building has 48 apartments and most residents are black 
crowley said he did not know the race of the paramedics but a 
resident who lived a floor above the jarnagins 23yearold sherry 
teague said both were white 
after police arrived she said she begged the paramedics to come 
to the apartment where the boy was having an asthma attack 
she said the paramedics complained of having things thrown at 
them and refused to immediately go upstairs 
the lady was saying were not going in there miss teague 
said im not going to get my head busted with people throwing 
things 
she said she knew of nothing being thrown 
crowley was uncertain when paramedics arrived at the building 
but he said they left at 428 pm police arrived at 434 pm and 
the ambulance returned six minutes later he said paramedics worked 
to revive the boy for 30 minutes before taking him to mercy 
hospital where he died crowley said 
an autopsy showed the boy died of bronchial asthma according to 
an intake worker at the cook county medical examiners office who 
identified himself only by his last name morris 
morris said he was unsure if the autopsy showed if the boy could 
have been saved with quicker treatment dr margarita arruza who 
performed the autopsy was in a meeting and not immediately 
available a secretary said 
police received a call for help from the fire department at 421 
pm said officer charles marschke police entered the fifthfloor 
apartment found the boy unresponsive and on a floor tried to 
revive him and called for the paramedics to return he said 
the police report did not mention whether the ambulance had been 
attacked marschke said 
crowley said the paramedics were upset over carls death it 
was so frustrating for them that this child passed away he said

the district of columbia council on tuesday 
passed congressionally mandated laws allowing insurance companies to 
test health insurance applicants for the aids virus 
the council enacted the insurance law despite a raucous angry 
protest from about 250 gay advocates who disrupted the councils 
proceedings about 50 were removed from the councils chambers and 
five were arrested on disorderly conduct charges police said 
the aids testing measure repealed a 1986 ban on such testing that 
the council had enacted in an effort to head off discrimination 
against homosexuals 
in response to the 1986 ordinance insurance companies in the 
district had simply stopped writing new health care plans and 
congress had threatened to cut off its 537 million payment to the 
city for the fiscal year that began oct 1 if the law was not 
changed 
the council also replaced its requirement that all city employees 
live in the city with a plan that gives preference to city residents 
for all city jobs congress pushed that system on the city after 
reports that the police department and city agencies were having 
trouble recruiting workers from the citys applicant pool 
under the plan residents exercising the preference option on 
their applications would be required to live in the city for five 
years at which point they would be free to move to the maryland or 
virginia suburbs 
the council also passed a law guaranteeing that city buildings 
will be opened to homeless persons if all the citys shelters are 
filled on nights when the temperature drops below 25 degrees 
fahrenheit

the captain of an indian merchant says he was 
following a course given by the navy and was advised he was out of 
the danger area 40 minutes before his ship was hit by a us navy 
practice missile killing a crewman 
navy officials said they could not confirm the captains account 
of the accident that occurred in the navys pacific missile range 80 
miles northnorthwest of the island of kauai at about noon monday 
the missile range gave us a certain course to steer and later 
advised us we were clear of the area said capt pm mirchandani 
34 who brought the 550foot jag vivek into port here tuesday for 
repairs 
lt cmdr gary shrout a spokesman for the navy at pearl harbor 
said the captains contention and everything about this thing will 
be investigated itll take a while to put all the pieces together 
an fa18 hornet attack fighter from the aircraft carrier uss 
constellation fired a 12foot unarmed harpoon missile toward a 
target hulk ship many miles out to sea the navy said 
unfortunately the exercise missile was fired close enough to 
the path of the merchant vessel for the missiles seeker to guide on 
it instead of the original target the navy said 
attorney leonard alcantara representing the ships owner said 
the jag vivek was notified by radio at about 8 am monday it was in 
restricted waters of the pacific missile range 
the navy gave the ship a new course to get out of the area and 
two or three hours later said the ship was clear and wished it 
bon voyage alcantara said forty minutes later the missile 
hit 
mirchandani said he believed it was the navys mistake 
when the missile was fired the jet was about 45 miles from the 
freighter too far away for it to see the ship shrout said 
the supersonic missile tore through the living quarters located 
near the top of the pilot house on the stern of the ship that is 
carrying 25600 tons of wheat from vancouver bc to bombay 
officials said 
after exiting the structure the missile fell into the ocean 
according to the coast guard 
shrout said the commander of naval base pearl harbor rear adm 
stephen chadwick went aboard the jag vivek just before it reached 
honolulu to express the navys condolences to the master of the 
ship 
the constellation and seven other ships in its battle group were 
concluding training exercises en route to a western pacific 
deployment the navy said 
several thousand square miles off the pacific missile range 
facility on kauais northwest coast are frequently closed to 
civilian vessels with advisories broadcast at set times each day on 
marine radio frequencies according to the coast guard 
the missile hit a fivestory pilot house on the ships left side 
below a porthole in the radio room 
the impact collapsed part of the pilot house and killed radio 
operator kt joseph 36 an indian citizen the navy said an 
autopsy was to be performed tuesday 
the indian government declined comment on the accident 
the ship would remain here until it was decided whether the us 
navy would pay for repairs which are expected to take about two 
weeks said coast guard spokesman scott hartvigsen 
the ship is owned by the great eastern shipping co ltd of new 
delhi hawaii pacific maritime its hawaii marine agent refused to 
release details of the incident pending a prelimininary

standdown and there will be some readiness standards that will not 
be met 
almost half of the us air forces tactical forces in europe 
are located in the federal republic west germany anderson said 
at a news conference so its a substantial amount of force and a 
substantial amount of flying on a daily basis

assessed 
anderson is commander of the us third air force which is 
stationed in mildenhall england the pilot of the jet was under his 
command

suspended for such an extended period and he expressed concern that 
it set a precedent for suspensions after future accidents

flights over residential areas 
before the crash 12 major accident involving military aircraft 
killed 95 people this year alone they included 70 people people who 
died in an air show crash at the us air force base in ramstein in 
august

carrying rifles and truncheons roughly prevented residents from 
entering their stricken neighborhood 
us personnel were not carrying weapons rifles or any kind 
of clubs he said 
he said a squad of us military police officers with pistols 
were dispatched to the site after the crash but were pulled out a 
few hours later 
us officials have said security efforts at the scene were 
handled largely by west german troops and police 
anderson also denied allegations by west german officials that 
american authorities mishandled the rescue efforts and delayed 
releasing information about the plane and its munitions 
he said more than 114000 has been paid in property and other 
claims after the accident under agreements with west germany the 
us pays about 80 percent of the claims total 
meanwhile government sources said on condition of anonymity that 
the parliamentary undersecretary of defense peter kurt wuerzbach 
would resign in january 
wuerzbachs decision to order a suspension of the west german air 
forces lowlevel training flights immediately after the crash 
angered defense minister rupert scholz who was in the united states

presidentelect bush has asked us trade 
representative clayton yeutter to be the new agriculture secretary 
and has settled on samuel skinner of illinois for secretary of 
transportation presidential transition sources said tuesday 
yeutter earlier tuesday declined to discuss reports that he was 
still under consideration for the agriculture post after he 
initially stated he would rather return to private life but a 
source close to yeutter said he was considering the offer 
the 58yearold trade representative told reporters as he arrived 
for a capitol hill luncheon that his proclivity was to return to 
the private sector but he added ive learned never to say 
never 
for the transportation department job transition sources said 
bush has chosen skinner 50 a former us attorney in chicago who 
has headed the regional transportation authority in the chicago area 
since 1984 
skinners wife sue said tuesday night in a telephone interview 
from their home i assume he probably will be appointed 
transportation secretary but i dont think its been totally 
confirmed with him yet skinner whose reputation for toughness 
has earned him the nickname sam the hammer was not at home and 
could not be reached immediately his wife said 
announcements on the two cabinet posts could come wednesday or 
thursday one source said 
two transition sources said bush had planned to meet tuesday 
evening with yeutter an exfarmer from nebraska who formerly served 
as chief executive officer of the chicago mercantile exchange 
but yeutters daughter kim said that although her father was 
attending a party at bushs home tuesday evening a formal meeting 
between the two would not be held until wednesday 
the washington post reported in wednesdays editions that bush 
tried to persuade a reluctant yeutter to take the agriculture job by 
suggesting that he would not be expected to serve a full term 
citing unidentified transition sources the newspaper said bush told 
yeutter that he would be expected to stay only through the first 
summit conference of the leaders of the western industrial 
democracies a meeting which bush has said he wanted to devote to 
agricultural issues 
meanwhile rumors circulated that an announcement on the defense 
secretary position was imminent 
but craig fuller bushs chief of staff and codirector of the 
transition office said tuesday the timing on any such announcement 
was still up in the air as the fbi continued background checks on 
prospective nominee john tower a former senator from texas 
fuller said he expected a bush to name a couple more cabinet 
positions this week and that the cabinet should be filled by 
christmas 
the field of contenders changed somewhat with bushs decision 
that hell pick no one from congress for cabinet posts 
several members of congress had said they were being considered 
for highlevel positions in the new administration but bush is 
putting an end to that telling them in notes and telephone calls 
that it was more important for them to retain their spots in the 
democraticcontrolled house and senate 
the vice president has several friends in the congress who 
had expressed an interest in doing something in the departments and 
agencies and he really just decided it wasnt fair to deplete our 
strength in congress by pulling republicans out said fuller 
there was no word tuesday on the biggest question about an 
unfilled position when or whether bush would name tower as 
secretary of defense 
bush asked about it tuesday said the process is still going 
forward fuller said timing of any announcement on the job was 
completely up in the air while towers background is reviewed 
he noted that bush still could pick someone else 
weve been working on some of the other agencies he said 
adding that he expects bush to announce a couple more cabinet 
positions later this week he declined to specify which ones 
bush spoke briefly to reporters after meeting with 
presidentelect carlos andreas perez of venezuela responding to 
questions bush said 
he and perez discussed latin american debt nicaragua and other 
subjects and the relationship is off to a very good start 
bushs administration taking office jan 20 could not meet with 
the palestine liberation organization based on yasser arafats 
speech tuesday in geneva other officials said arafats speech 
failed to meet us requirements such as explicit acceptance of 
israels right to exist and renunciation of terrorism weve got 
to get a much clearer statement of everything bush said 
as for the cabinet tower is undergoing detailed background 
checks covering such matters as his defense industry connections and 
allegations made by his exwife in their divorce case various 
sources close to the tower and the transition have said 
there have also been reports that the bush team wants to name 
towers top aides at the pentagon at the same time the secretary is 
chosen thereby making sure they will be bush choices 
fuller said of tower theres been the assurance that he would 
be involved in the review and evaluation of senior appointments to 
the defense department should he be chosen as secretary 
sources close to tower say the fbi could complete its background 
work this week however checks on other defense appointees could 
delay the announcement further 
for energy secretary fuller said peter johnson former head of 
oregons bonneville power administration is still in the 
running after being interviewed by transition aides monday 
former rep henson moore of louisiana also is under consideration 
saying a lot of work needs to be done in the nuclear area 
along with the departments traditional focus on oil and gas 
interests fuller said were looking for somebody who has got the 
technical scientific and management background to deal with that 
side of the equation 
epa administrator lee m thomas has been mentioned as a possible 
energy secretary because he is an expert in waste cleanup 
bush meanwhile met tuesday with coretta scott king widow of 
the slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr mrs king said 
the presidentelect reiterated that he would name a black to his 
cabinet 
we didnt mention names she said she gave a positive report 
on the meeting telling reporters the goals of him and his 
administration are very close to the goals i would like to see 
one black contender for a cabinet job is dr louis sullivan 
president of morehouse school of medicine in atlanta fuller said he 
was on a short list the transition team is looking at for 
secretary of health and human services 
other people fuller said are still in contention for various 
positions are rep jack kemp of new york and former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole 
mrs dole once mentioned as a possible united nations 
ambassador a post since filled has been spoken of recently as a 
potential head of the environmental protection agency 
kemp was considered a contender for secretary of housing and 
urban development but a transition source said he no longer was 
under consideration for the cabinet 
fuller said constance horner head of the office of personnel 
management is certainly on short lists for consideration in a 
couple of areas including labor secretary 
robert teeter codirector of the transition office said there 
was no basis to the rumor that he had turned down an offer to be 
deputy white house chief of staff teeter reached at his home in 
ann arbor mich said he was spending a few days sorting out what 
he wanted to do next year

lawmakers who say its hard to make ends meet

boost in pay 
a presidential commission reviewing the governments top pay 
levels was poised today to recommend hefty salary increases for 
members of congress federal judges and senior executive branch 
employees the recommendations will attach firm dollar amounts to 
broad principles outlined in a draft report issued by the commission 
last week in which the panel said salaries should generally restore 
top government officials purchasing power to 1969 levels 
for members of congress for example that would put pay near 
135000 roughly a 50 percent increase cabinet members and 
supreme court justices who now make 115000 would presumably be 
recommended for similar boosts

restricted the number of classified documents the former white house 
aide may use for his defense 
by deciding to bar as evidence more than 90 percent of the 
classified documents north wanted to disclose us district judge 
gerhard a gesell greatly increased the chances that the case will 
go to trial possibly late next month 
gesells ruling diminishes the possibility that president 
reagans refusal to release virtually all the secrets sought by 
north would force dismissal of charges on the ground that the former

arctic wolves live far from humans and have never 
been hunted so they dont know enough to run from someone with a 
gun or a camera 
wildlife photographer jim brandenburg and wolf biologist david 
mech took advantage of the wolves tolerance and occasional 
curiosity during two years of observing them from a camp on 
ellesmere island canada less than 500 miles from the north pole 
the result was some rare and amazingly closeup footage of arctic 
wolves for brandenburgs national geographic explorer film white 
wolf premiering this sunday on superstation tbs 
ellesmere island is barren so there was no way to hide from the 
wolves but the scruffy whitecoated critters were merely curious 
about brandenburg and mechs tents and cameras and fourwheel 
motorcycles 
their remote location keeps the wolves safe from persecution by 
humans who in other areas of north america kill them for attacking 
domestic stock and sometimes just for sport 
wolves live under something of a monarchy and the king and queen 
are the alpha male and female at one point the alpha female 
nicknamed mom came close enough to mech that he could toss her 
bits of his sandwich she also allowed the men to come within a few 
feet of her frisky pups 
though the wolves are magnificent to watch not that much new 
information is revealed by the film anyone who has read farley 
mowats bestselling never cry wolf or just seen the disney 
film adaptation already knows wolves are not the slathering 
indiscriminate killers of lore but highly intelligent creatures 
with a welldeveloped social structure 
mech we are told has spent 30 years studying wolves but when 
he and brandenburg stand over a tape machine listening to a 
recording of the packs howling mech remarks notsohelpfully i 
wish i knew what it all meant no doubt so does anyone who might 
have supplied him with a research grant 
but the men did figure out that a half bark was the wolf 
equivalent of back off man so when curious wolves invaded 
their camp they mimicked the bark and sent the pack hightailing it 
back to their den 
later mech went over a ridge and mimicked a strange wolf howling 
in the distance leaving brandenburg to observe the packs reaction 
brandenburg reported to mech that hey they howled back then all 
jumped around together in such a jumble he couldnt really sort it 
out your aunt martha could have observed as much 
the narrative read by richard kiley is rather ploddingly 
written and doesnt do justice to the film footage brandenburg is 
more articulate with his camera 
even documentaries seem to need some kind of plot so tension 
builds as brandenburg tries to film the pack hunting big game in 
this case muskoxen great furry creatures that look like 
overdressed buffalo 
in one of brandenburgs attempts to follow them the wolf pack 
crosses a river and leaves him behind on another outing he keeps 
up with them but they only sniff around a threesome of muskoxen 
apparently deciding they are too formidable to take on 
finally late in the film brandenburg gets his chance and the 
result is some stunning footage of the wolf pack working together to 
bring down a hapless calf whose mother abandons it giving literal 
meaning to the term thrown to the wolves as brandenburg and 
mech note the wolves they had gotten so familiar with back at the 
den had turned into one finely tuned killing machine 
almost every aspect of the wolves life was documented except 
the five months of winter the humans couldnt endure when 
brandenburg and mech returned the following spring three wolves had 
died probably of starvation or disease and there was a new alpha

you may not ever go to harvard but harvard might 
come to you bit by bit course by course one professor at a time 
right into your living room classroom conference room or board 
room on videotape 
it wont be like strolling through harvard yard because the 
courses are offered by the graduate school of business 
administration which is across the river in boston and many of the 
scenes were shot at a dozen different sites 
but it will be harvard as evidenced by the first production 
michael porter on competitive strategy many business people 
already know porter as one of the business schools brightest 
lights a professor there since 1973 
in his harvard videotape debut porter will have support from a 
cast of top executives in american business including john pepper 
the rarely interviewed procter amp gamble president and robert 
crandall american airlines chairman 
the approach conceivably could be even more effective than the 
classroom says porter it allows us to illustrate in a visceral 
tangible way how broad theoretical concepts have application in the 
real world 
benson shapiro professor of business administration declares 
the tapes are more than a lecture they offer strategy in vivo 
dynamics in action seeing as believing understanding and 
absorbing 
john nathan of nathantyler a production company that joined 
with harvard to produce the tapes is even more descriptive he says 
the impact is analagous to watching a botanist leave the lab walk 
through the rain forest and turn over a leaf that contains evidence 
in support of his theory 
porter already is familiar to executives through his lectures 
his eight books his articles his interviews of them his 
firsthand advice to them on competition and his frequent 
professional testimony 
the most widely acclaimed of his books gives an idea of his 
influence published in 1980 competitive strategy techniques for 
analyzing industries and competitors is in its 32nd printing and 
is available in 14 languages 
the idea for a series of harvard business school tapes began at 
least four years ago said shapiro who is also serves as the 
business schools senior associate dean for publications 
the goal he said was to produce a series that would capture the 
vitality of the business school experience through development of 
sophisticated material simple as that might sound it posed big 
technical problems 
those difficulties evaporated before the creative powers of 
porter john nathan and sam tyler nathan an author and translator 
as well had produced several documentary business films for 
television he knew the procedure 
in 1984 he and tyler had created a company to produce and 
distribute films and videocassette programs for business training 
and executive education they scored from the start their first 
production was in search of excellence a 90minute film based 
on the runaway bestselling book by tom peters 
porters tape is the first of the harvard business school video 
series jointly produced by the school and nathantyler two others 
will follow in the next few months 
the second in the series managing information technology as a 
competitive weapon features professors f warren mcfarlan and 
james i cash jr the third is yet to be given a title 
a harvard education doesnt come for a song 
each program consisting of two videocassettes totaling 2 hours 
plus a manual viewers guide and printed materials costs 1000 
including shipping and handling add to that a 5 percent 
massachusetts state sales tax discounts of 20 percent are available 
to degreegranting institutions of higher learning 
if you still need to be convinced that a harvard education is 
worth your time and money you may obtain a 15minute preview that 
highlights the longer tapes it costs 50 with the cost applicable 
to purchase 
for information you can write to harvard business school video 
series nathantyler 535 boylston st boston mass 02116

theres a moment in clint eastwoods movie 
bird when the great jazzman charlie parker stands on a 
blackened paris stage after finishing a concert consuming massive 
doses of applause and sniffing a longstemmed red rose 
he was something of a god to jazz zealots but perhaps the 
tortured musical genius never really got a chance to wake up and 
smell the roses he mutilated his life with drugs and alcohol and 
died at the age of 34 in 1955 
eastwood who has loved jazz since his childhood and who always 
wanted to film a portrait of parker attempts to harness the birds 
creative spirit and all the creative juices of that time a time 
when bebop came to fore and brought jazz into the modern age at the 
same time it pokes into the underbelly of the jazz world with its 
stark portrayal of drugs alcohol debauchery 
his life was obviously filled with many excesses sort of a 
dichotomy eastwood says how a person who can be so brilliant 
and who spent hours and hours to become as great as he did and have 
that kind of discipline could not in any other part of his life 
that was always a wonder to me 
but i wanted a movie where you root for him i just wanted 
to explore the fact that he was brilliant and innovative and the 
other just became a part of his life 
eastwood even films bird in a dark brownish hue 
most of the jazz world is nocturnal he says tv 
unfortunately has shown a whole generation that flat light is the 
only way i dont like flat light i like the feel of the movie i 
like to look into a film instead of having it look out at you i 
approached the color of it in terms of black and white 
forest whitaker good morning vietnam platoon is 
gentle yet fierce playful yet obsessed in his role as parker for 
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the cannes film 
festival it was well deserved for a stunning performance that even 
captures the hunched body stances once assumed by the musician as he 
performed as chan parker diane venora ironweed fx 
finds the right balance between free spirit and strong loving wife 
who battles her husbands philandering and personal demons and at 
the same time champions his work and wellbeing 
 
bird followed the success of last years round midnight 
the story of an expatriate sax player in paris tenor saxophone 
great dexter gordon who once worked with parker received an 
academy award nomination for his role as the tragic dale turner 
though based loosely on the late jazz musician bud powell bertrand 
taverniers movie is a universal story of jazz artists who fled 
bigotry and rough times in america for the allure of paris and 
amsterdam during the 1940s 50s and 60s 
paris blues martin ritts 1961 jazz movie starring paul 
newman and sidney poitier takes a more romantic hollywood 
approach the late duke ellington received an oscar nomination for 
his score 
in bird lenny niehaus did the score which isolates parkers 
original playing of laura april in paris ornithology 
parkers mood and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded 
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist ron carter 
trumpeter john faddis pianists walter davis jr and barry harris 
jazz purists have been rankled by the soundtrack which they say is 
technically excellent but misses the interplay between parker and 
his sidemen 
but eastwood defends his decision if youre going to do a film 
and have stereophonic sound you need to record well charlie never 
had the opportunity to do stereophonic sound 
charlie parker was born in kansas city and took up first 
baritone and then alto sax while still in high school which he left 
at the age of 14 so he could study such greats as lester young and 
count basie in the local clubs he soon found himself in new york 
where a young trumpet player named dizzy gillespie was all the rage 
with thelonious monk and bud powell on piano kenny clarke on 
drums and later a young miles davis on trumpet parker and gillespie 
helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz bebop 
parker whose nickname was yardbird and shortened to bird 
stumbled into the lost world of night life but even with the 
debiliation of drugs and alcohol he never failed to solve musical 
problems and invent new directions 
there have been no great harmonic changes in jazz since charlie 
and dizzy eastwood says 
and then he muses what musical levels would parker have reached 
today had he lived it would be interesting the actorfilmmaker 
says

a 28yearold woman in an exclusive 
suburban neighborhood climbs into her latemodel car with her purse 
andshopping list and a shotgun under the seat 
my shotgun is my best protection against carnappers said 
the woman using the favored local expression for car thieves 
she is among a growing number of manila residents who have begun 
carrying weapons as protection against what they see as a rising 
crime rate in manila 
military officials estimate there are nearly 513000 pistols 
rifles and shotguns in civilian hands throughout the philippines a 
nation of 58 million people and that than 184000 of those weapons 
are unregistered 
advertisements for imported firearms have begun appearing in 
newspapers and masscirculation magazines 
walden carbonell manager of the waldenjames guns and hobby 
shop says business is booming he said about 40 customers most of 
them businessmen and professionals come into his shop every day 
there are more criminals with guns nowadays he told one 
customer thats why you need a sophisticated weapon 
the customer lawyer tomas lahom agreed 
im buying a semiautomatic shotgun just for the home he 
said 
there has been an increase in the number of individuals wanting 
to own firearms said col jose andaya chief of the philippine 
constabularys firearms and explosives unit but this is normal 
because of our peace and order situation 
police report that in 1986 the most recent year for which 
complete statistics are available 21914 crimes were reported in 
metropolitan manila of those 14281 were index crimes such as 
murder rape armed robbery and kidnapping 
the police say they have no later figures that would show whether 
the rate is rising or falling but the general public perceives it 
as rising president corazon aquino said in september law and order 
was breaking down and that preventing crime was a top government 
priority 
according to a study by private security companies 764 murders 
were reported up to october this yar and only 299 have been solved 
the study also said banks lost 553 million pesos 27 million in 
nearly 50 armed holdups in that same period 
fascination with firearms has been a traditional feature of 
philippine life but police acknowledge that the firearm fad is 
increasing because of public fears about violent crime and lack of 
confidence in law enforcement 
there is a most compelling felt need among a growing number of 
filipinos to arm themselves said the philippine daily inquirer 
newspaper the average filipino does not have enough confidence in 
the authorities to defend him from physical harm 
several manila newspapers have decried the spread of firearms 
among the public maintaining that the increase in weapons will only 
make the city more dangerous 
more firearms in the hands of civilians will not combat 
criminality said the manila chronicle all government has to do 
is strictly enforce the ban on carrying of firearms by unauthorized 
persons 
but in october the philippine congress actually made it easier 
for filipinos without criminal records to obtain weapons it 
approved a bill allowing individuals to own as many as two licensed 
firearms and to carry one of them outside a residence 
congress itself has imported weapons for the protection of its 
members and carloads of armed security guards trailing limousines 
of congressmen government officials or prosperous businessmen are a 
common sight on manila streets 
in 1986 customs intercepted a cargo of firearms including 
israelimade uzi submachine guns but released the shipment when it 
turned out the weapons were imported by the office of vice president 
salvador laurel

the scantily dressed dancers are long 
gone the last liquor store was blown up six years ago this ancient 
roman city now is the capital in lebanon of shiite moslem 
fundamentalism 
public drinking and dancing are forbidden now but brief 
malefemale unions called pleasure marriages are condoned 
on the surface at least life in baalbek is governed by the 
dictates of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis stern brand of islamic 
fundamentalism in iran which to western eyes appears joyless and 
forbidding 
wearing makeup or jewelery in public is taboo so is singing and 
dancing at mixed gatherings because as one woman noted it causes 
psychological imbalance and tempts men 
but when the sun goes down and the doors are locked the black 
robelike chadors shiite women have to wear in public are discarded 
in favor of shorts and strapless tops along with makeup and 
perfume 
people think were made of stone just because we cover 
ourselves with chadors but were not were ready to do anything to 
please our husbands said selma a housewife 
before lebanons civil war erupted in 1975 baalbek was a 
cultural center where dance and theatrical festivals were held in 
the breathtaking roman amphitheaters 
now the ruins echo to islamic slogans as the fundamentalists 
stage political rallies there chanting ritual denunciations of 
death to america death to israel the amphitheaters have also 
been used as mortar positions in lebanons sectarian fighting 
the shiites strict lifestyle has drawn bitter criticism from 
many lebanese moslems and christians alike who say that the 
fundamentalists double standards has brought islam into 
disrepute 
most shiites in baalbek belong to hezbollah party of god which 
is believed to be an umbrella for shiite kidnappers holding most of 
the 16 foreigners missing in lebanon its made up of zealots 
blindly loyal to khomeini 
we follow whatever khomeini decrees whatever he rejects we 
reject said zeinab nasser an administrator at the womens 
haouzeh or religious center in baalbek 
the practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs 
frowned on by other lebanese especially moderate shiites and sunnis 
in a pleasure marriage a young woman who would not dare expose a 
curl of her hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited 
number of lovers in the name of religion 
but most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are 
considered respectable and far from promiscuous 
the practice is widespread in iran where overwhelming majority 
of the 54 million population is shiite 
nasser said the prophet mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage 
making it acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period 
which could last for an hour two days a month or as long as 
they desire 
its all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child 
born after the marriage contract expires she explained 
she said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid lebanons 
economic crisis because men cannot afford a regular marriage and 
lets face it they have physical needs 
if these cannot be met within a permanent marriage pleasure 
marriage provides the outlet she added its much better than 
doing it illicitly 
no cleric is required to perform the cermony the woman who 
should preferably be either divorced or widowed tells the man i 
give myself to you in pleasure 
he responds i accept and thats it 
virgins need the consent of their parents but they often do not 
seek it 
as for forms of entertainment the fundamentalists permit 
classical music because it does not have any negative 
psychological effects nasser said 
she observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is 
bad for the nerves and the blood circulation 
like other factions in lebanon where the government has 
collapsed the shiites have established their own medical and 
welfare systems amply funded by iran 
abbas mousavi a hezbollah leader told the associated press 
social work has become one of our main responsibilities because of 
the catastrophes that have befallen lebanon 
weve founded the imam khomeini hospital here which provides 
free medical treatment there are similar centers in other shiite 
areas 
he noted weve also founded pharmacies that make a very small 
profit as well as schools which we hope will accommodate 6000 
students in the near future 
weve given money to needy families and bought deepbore drills 
to provide wells in remote villages especially those we consider 
have military or political importance 
asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and night 
clubs mousavi noted were not imposing islamic values on people 
no one can say weve raided houses where people gamble or drink 
asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs he conceded 
there were incidents where young men acted out of islamic zeal 
after witnessing aberrant behavior but hezbollah is against that

to help prepare for his rain man 
role of raymond babbitt an autistic man whisked from the 
institution where hes spent his life dustin hoffman studied an 
autistic west virginia man who lives outside institutional walls 
thanks to support from his mother and hometown 
hoffman was introduced to joseph sullivan a 28yearold 
huntington man at the ucla behavioral sciences media lab there he 
watched two documentaries that described sullivans life along with 
16 hours of outtakes from one of them the 1986 documentary 
portrait of an autistic young man thats where i met joe in 
a sense that was my kickoff i buried myself there for the first 
two months hoffman said last weekend at a local showing of rain 
man to benefit the autism services center run by sullivans 
mother ruth 
hoffman finally met sullivan facetoface in cincinnati while 
filming rain man 
we just made a film thats going to play for you know a month 
or two or whatever in cities around america and around the world 
and be put out on cassette and put on shelves and seen once 
hoffman told huntington residents at the screening 
you people have joe in your community for the rest of your 
lives and i would take that any day of the week he is a very 
special person who shines through this magic he has 
no one is sure what causes autism which makes some victims 
catatonic some selfdestructive some uncommunicative some 
scientists believe its caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain 
dr daniel hubert a ucla associate clinical professor of 
psychiatry and principal writer and producer at the media lab said 
his role is to help victims how to function in society 
what we try to do is control chronic problems and teach 
them to lead reasonable normal lives hubert said we try to 
help them avoid being institutionalized selfdestructive or being 
left vulnerable 
those criteria make sullivan a success 
i was impressed that this guy wasnt institutionalized 
hubert said of sullivan for a kid who started where he started 
from he was able to do things that werent expected of him 
sullivan has perfect pitch and excels at math common traits in 
autistics he can for example come up with the square root of a 
number such as 4555 in his head in just a few seconds 
sullivan graduated from huntington high school in 1981 he was 
taught through the special education program but took regular math 
and science courses 
everyone at huntington high knew joe sullivan but nobody really 
knew him said his teacher melanie butler some students remained 
abusive toward him and few understood that in many ways he was like 
them 
he would go up to girls and say im going to touch your 
breasts all he wanted was for them to become hysterical like 
little boys putting frogs down a girls dress butler said 
i told him once go ahead if you can find them he said 
no he was crestfallen and he never did it again 
sullivan now works at the cabell county public library butler 
said she would like to see him move on eventually to experience a 
wider slice of life hes still growing and changing she said 
mrs sullivan upon learning in 1962 that her 2yearold son was 
autistic committed her life to learning more about the condition 
she has fought for funding and understanding 
doors are just becoming open for autistic people she said 
theres lots of mystery and whats not mystery is 
misinformation

in oaxaca the state government created a department of religious 
cults to mediate religious conflicts among the indians it consists 
of one person jesus angel martinez oceguera 
martinez pulls out a thick folder stuffed with accords he has 
negotiated in some of oaxacas most isolated mixe mixtec and 
zapotec indian communities many are signed with the thumbprints of 
people who cannot read and write 
in the mixe village of chuxnaban for example authorities agreed 
to stop fining jehovahs witnesses for refusing to help pay for 
religious festivals the witnesses agreed to help pay for public 
works projects instead 
in the zapotec town of san franciso yatee protestants and 
catholics agreed to end sunday loudspeaker wars 
but the rev benjamin hernandez spokesman for an alliance of 
more than 30 protestant faiths in oaxaca said catholic officials 
have refused to discuss the exile problem with his group 
at easter archbishop bartoleme carrasco of oaxaca wrote that his 
diocese has been battered by protestant sects principally 
fundamentalists and fanatic anticatholics 
in a recent interview the diocese spokesman the rev daniel 
quiroga called the exile problem a religious war he accused some 
protestant missionaries of wooing converts with food clothing and 
medical care a charge marroquin said was not justified 
these people do not sell their faith for a little money said 
marroquin 
converts are often individuals in crisis living in societies in 
crisis hernandez said 
i was a drunk francisco ramirez nicolas a triqui indian who 
belongs to the clevelandbased church of god of the new testament 
said when asked why he converted 
other converts wanted a more direct personal involvement than 
their old religion offered they welcomed the chance to become lay 
ministers relished studying the bible it was an intellectual 
adventure for many bright people whose horizons had been clouded 
abraham sanchez bautista a triqui said he converted after 
joining a protestant bible study group the catholic priests in his 
village he said never talked to us they never taught us 
quiroga claimed that protestants are a divisive force in indian 
communal life saying they reject local customs and often preach 
foreign materialistic ideas some he said exhort their adherents 
to reject the mexican flag and the national anthem 
the spanish conquest committed great injustices not just 
against property but also against cultural values quiroga said 
the indigenous people suffered great abuse now once again some 
sects are trampling on the unity of those communities 
quiroga said the catholic church does not condone the expulsions 
but it cant stop them the indians are not as docile as they used 
to be he said 
lopez mendez of chamula said pluralism is the path to extinction 
in chamula we dont permit other customs he said if we 
did all the old ways would be thrown away

for farmers across america 1988 was a 3d year drought 
destruction and despair 
the nation suffered through one of the worst dry spells in a 
halfcentury since the days of the dust bowl as sunny skies 
created clouds of doom for thousands of farmers who watched their 
crops and hopes shrivel in blistering tripledigit heat 
it was a year when farmers prayed and indians danced for rain 
when the mighty mississippi stopped its easy rolling and crop seeds 
started blowing when the country sizzled while the fourth of july 
fizzled because fireworks celebrations were canceled for fear of 
igniting grass fires 
but the drought brought prosperity too for rail carriers whose 
business picked up when barge traffic slowed down for auction 
houses flooded with livestock because ranchers were short on feed 
and for farmers lucky enough to have surpluses or to live in areas 
blessed with rain 
in fact although losses climbed into the billions of dollars and 
thousands of acres of crops were lost the drought was not the total 
disaster some had feared 
prices were up we had some of last years crop in the bin to 
sell said jim nichols minnesotas agriculture commissioner 
thats what saved us it didnt have to anything to do with 
the crop we harvested this year 
and with billions of dollars of federal aid and late rains 
most farmers have fared much better than they would have 
otherwise said jim vertrees an agriculture department economist 
but thats not to say farmers arent hurting he added corn 
production fell by 34 percent from last years bumper crop while 
soybeans dropped 21 percent and spring wheat 54 percent vertrees 
said 
the council of economic advisers has estimated crop losses at 
about 13 billion in 1982 prices vertrees said 
despite those gloomy numbers the agriculture department citing 
higher commodity prices inventory and only moderate drops in 
government subsidies has predicted net cash income the amount of 
money farmers have to spend during the year to be close to 1987s 
record 571 billion 
but many states were hit hard in sparsely populated north 
dakota for example the estimated total loss including the impact 
on nonagricultural business dependent on the farm economy is a 
whopping 22 billion even with federal aid said arlen leholm a 
north dakota state university extension economist 
and leholm noted the drought came at a time when many farmers 
were just digging out from the agricultural crisis of the early 
1980s land prices were climbing slowly livestock prices were up 
there was a general feeling of optimism he said they had 
feelings of euphoria they felt maybe i can see the light at the 
end of the tunnel then it turned out to be a train 
from may through july the critical growing season 
precipitation was at record lows in seven states from montana to 
mississippi and at its secondlowest levels ever in six other 
states from georgia to north dakota 
signs of trouble surfaced early in may ranchers in the parched 
texas prairies were burning thorns off prickly cactuses to feed to 
cattle from san francisco to atlanta residents were asked to 
reduce water consumption 
it reached different people at different times said neil 
harl an economics professor at iowa state university it became 
increasingly clear as temperatures started to rise by early june we 
had a serious problem 
heat records fell in city after city aggravating the bonedry 
conditions water levels shrunk by june more than a thousand 
barges were stranded in the shrunken mississippi wind erosion had 
damaged millions of acres in the great plains fish were dying in 
wisconsin streams and wells were drained in nebraska 
as summer began anxious farmers fought to keep their animals 
from starving and watched their normally kneehigh corn stunted at 
anklelevel 
although rain fell in some spots hints of relief didnt come 
until august when president reagan signed a 39 billion drought 
aid package that provides disaster payments to those who harvested 
less than 65 percent of their normal production 
it was one of two silver linings we were not anticipating 
congress would be as generous or that crops would be as resilient as 
they were harl said 
farmers also benefited from an additional 3 billion in emergency 
aid feed assistance and crop insurance and relaxed standards 
that allowed haying or grazing on land normally exempt from such 
uses 
by fall the farmers home administration also had declared 1489 
counties eligible for emergency disaster loans including 13 entire 
states vertrees said 
still it was a bitter harvest for farmers facing another season 
with little moisture in the ground and less grain in the bin 
were in a situation where its going to take above average 
rainfalls to have an average crop said bruce bullock an 
agricultural economist at the university of missouri its a 
little premature to say the drought is totally behind us

relentless sunshine 
smokechoked days and sleepless nights finally convinced the 
stewards of some of americas most precious public land to make a 
judgment call last summer that will be debated for years fight all 
fires in yellowstone national park 
the established wildfire management plan had called for 
suppressing forest fires caused by man but allowing those touched 
off by lightning or other natural causes to burn on as long as they 
didnt threaten life property or historic sites 
by midjuly however fires were burning in almost every corner 
of the park worse the usual summer rains hadnt come and millions 
of lodgepole pine trees killed by bettles were just waiting for an 
airborne spark 
everybody concluded we were into some unprecedented conditions 
and each and every fire had to be fought aggressively said park 
spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
did that decision mean too little and come too late 
congressional hearings internal reviews and public oversight 
panels are trying to find out whether bad policy and bureaucratic 
mismanagement needlessly allowed almost half of americas first 
national park to burn or whether park officials acted as 
aggressively and responsibly as humanly possible in the face of 
natures fury 
by anybodys reckoning these fires are a catastrophe said 
yellowstone superintendent bob barbee but i just despair at this 
they should have known attitude there was no way to anticipate 
this its never happened before 
some western politicians called for dismissal of the national 
park service director william penn mott their calls went unheeded 
but the rhetoric ignited almost as much heat for park managers as 
the fires themselves 
when heavy winter snows finally smothered the flames in 
midnovember park officials tallied preliminary numbers from 
yellowstones recordbreaking summer of fire figures that do not 
include fire costs in six surrounding national forests 
706278 acres of the 22millionacre park burned 
29 buildings destroyed including 20 at the old faithful 
complex an estimated loss of 800000 
25000 firefighters mustered from around the nation to fight the 
dozen blazes including 5595 army and marine troops 
at least 115 million spent on mostly futile firefighting 
efforts 
the boise interagency fire center which coordinates logistical 
support for all wildfires throughout the country reported that more 
than 30000 firefighters battled 72000 blazes that charred more 
than 5 million acres in the united states this year including 22 
million acres in alaska 
it was the worst year for wildfires since 1926 when an estimated 
28 million acres burned 
heroic efforts saved the priceless old faithful inn the massive 
wooden landmark in front of the geyser that still fire or no fire 
erupts on schedule about every 75 minutes 
but thousands of acres of the nations mother park are black 
and dead the economies of surrounding tourist towns in three states 
were severely undercut by the fires and civic leaders worry 
tourists will stay away because of bad publicity there are also 
fears that yellowstones famous animals the grizzly bears bison 
and elk will face serious food shortages 
only the scientists so far have found a silver lining they say 
yellowstone now offers the most important wildfire research 
opportunity in history

after seven years tens of thousands of lost 
lives and almost 300 million in spending the united states is 
looking for a way out of president reagans contra policy in 
nicaragua 
although presidentelect george bushs policy on the nicaraguan 
rebels remains short on detail contra opponents and supporters 
alike agree that 1988 probably will be viewed as the beginning of 
the end for the antisandinista insurgents 
nineteen eightyeight was a year in which the policy 
essentially ended because the contras by the end of the year had 
become a nonfactor said rep mickey edwards rokla who led 
the losing fight in the house of representatives to continue 
military aid for the contras 
basically the war has come to a halt said rep david 
bonior dmich a leader of anticontra forces in the house 
the rebels who began the year with as many as 16000 fighters 
launching attacks inside nicaragua ended it with most of their 
forces huddled under makeshift black plastic shelters in camps along 
the honduran border 
throughout his presidency reagan made the contras a top 
foreignpolicy priority 
critics said the presidents romantic fervor for those he equated 
with americas founding fathers and his fear of soviet influence in 
the region blinded him to latin americas larger economic problems 
and locked the united states into a nowin policy 
but reagans supporters said military force was the only way to 
move the sandinistas toward fulfilling promises of democratization 
made to the organization of american states after they took power in 
1979 
after years of military aid to the rebels both covert and overt 
the house voted narrowly feb 3 to cut off the flow of weapons 
heeding the call of costa rican president oscar arias sanchez and 
house speaker jim wright dtexas to give peace a chance 
the contras last military support ran out feb 29 and no direct 
us weapons aid has flowed since 
the democrats not wanting to be seen as abandoning the rebels 
entirely later approved 75 million in humanitarian aid for the 
contras food medicine and shelter 
a shaky ceasefire took effect in 1988 in the sandinistacontra 
war estimates now are that some 10000 rebel troops unable to 
mount an offensive but unwilling to disband remain encamped just 
inside honduras with as many as 30000 family members 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams a champion of contra 
aid contends that the withdrawal of us military aid from the 
contras has emboldened the sandinistas 
there is more repression in nicaragua more subversion in el 
salvador essentially undiminished soviet aid levels abrams said 
he says the only solution is to revive the rebel resistance to the 
nicaraguan government 
but few of washingtons key actors still share abrams hardline 
stance bushs designated secretary of state james baker known as 
a pragmatist is unlikely to begin his relationship with congress 
with a surefire confrontation and the new house elected in november 
will be slightly more anticontra than the last 
something will have to be done by april 1 when the last of the 
nonlethal aid to the rebels expires

maybe the local food was too good or 
maybe they were too young to know better for whatever reason in 
midoctober three malingering whales became trapped in alaskas 
arctic ice and caught in the camera eye of the world 
roy ahmaogak was the first to spot the three california gray 
whales ringed by encroachin on alaskas northern 
coast 
the eskimo whaling captain could have gone for the easy kill but 
he wanted to help fill barrows whale quota with bowheads larger 
animalsg ice off barrow he passed the grays by 
his hunting instincts told him however it wasnt right to let 
them suffer he sought advice from his fellow whalers and they 
sought the advice of the national marine fisheries service 
ron morris a service biologist was in barrow discussing the 
matter with the eskimos when he learned that the key decision had 
already been made word came from washington that he should do 
everything possible to save the whales 
the twoweek rescue effort that followed captured the worlds 
imagination and cost more than 1 million 
day after day rescuers tried untested techniques for freeing the 
20000pound animals finally the combined efforts of the eskimos 
us government agenciesdio 
warnings and it gave no indication it was not hostile so our 
grief and despair are tempered by the knowledge we did what we had 
to do when we had to do it rogers said 
the navy board of inquiry agreed 
the uss vincennes did not purposely shoot down an iranian 
commercial airliner rather it engaged an aircraft the commanding 
officer believed to be hostile and a threat to his ship 
the navy report also said however that the fog of war the 
stress of combat and the unconscious distortion of data by the 
vincennes crew may have played a major role in the incident 
an investigatory panel of the international civil aviation 
organization found the navy culpable saying us warships in the 
gulf should have been aware of and monitoring such scheduled 
commercial air traffic 
little more than a month after the accident iran and iraq would 
begin a ceasefire that was still holding months later ending eight 
years of bloody warfare on land and at sea oil tankers could 
transit the gulf without any need for us escort 
ironically some american analysts concluded that the loss of 
flight 655 contributed to irans acceptance of the truce 
dramatizing to that nations leaders that they could neither defeat 
iraq nor force the us navy out of the gulf and that civilians 
would increasingly bear the consequences 
within the navy the tragedy produced plans for some changes in 
training and minor equipment alterations the navy also added 
equipment for monitoring civilian air traffic 
but by refusing to take disciplinary action against rogers or his 
crew the pentagon also underscored its willingness to back up any 
skipper as long as he didnt make the mistake of the uss stark 
commander in may 1987 and take the first hit 
the orders given to all skippers entering the persian gulf made 
clear that there should be no repeat of the stark incident in 
which that frigate was hit by two missiles fired by an iraqi jet 
says rep les aspen dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee 
we all know that what captain rogers did was in error the 
tragedy is that through the weight of the evidence a decision to 
shoot was logical

securities analysts say a takeover brawl may be 
brewing for pennwalt corp a diversified chemical maker that 
received a 760 million offer by a pair of financiers who have been 
eying the company for months 
pennwalt stock surged 1475 a share to close at 98 in new york 
stock exchange trading monday after the investment partnership 
centaur partners said it would pay 100 a share cash for the 873 
percent of the company it doesnt own 
company officials declined to comment on the tender offer from 
centaur partners which came in the midst of a major restructuring 
of pennwalt that was aimed partly at thwarting unwelcome acquirers 
but wall street strategists who follow the philadelphiabased 
company said there was plenty of room for the bidding to go higher 
perhaps attracting rival offers 
i think the companys going to fight it tooth and nail said 
donald a pattison a securities analyst for cyrus j lawrence inc 
in new york this is not going to be over next week 
centaur principals abbey j butler and melvyn j estrin said in a 
letter to the companys chairman and chief executive edwin e tuttle 
that they had all the financing needed to complete the deal and were 
prepared to negotiate all aspects of their offer including price 
we believe that our offer represents a fair price and is in the 
best interest of pennwalts shareholders they stated in the 
letter 
but in a signal that the bidders expected a fight they sued 
pennwalt in philadelphia federal court to block its socalled poison 
pill shareholders rights takeover defense which pennwalt and many 
other companies have adopted to thwart unwelcome bids 
pennwalt manufactures and markets industrial chemicals used in a 
range of products from swimming pool chlorine to the chemical odor 
in natural gas that alerts consumers to leaks it has 9000 
employees and annual sales exceeding 1 billion 
pennwalt also is a leading maker of chlorinated plastic commonly 
used in building cable insulation and has operations in mineral and 
petroleum processing and industrial equipment 
the size of the pennwalt takeover offer isnt large when measured 
against the multibilliondollar bidding wars that have shaped 1988 
into the year of unprecedented megadeals 
nevertheless pennwalts vulnerability to a takeover typifies the 
predicament many diversified industrial companies are facing 
because their operations in many cases are worth more individually 
than the company is as a whole 
by some estimates pennwalts socalled bustup value is 
approximately 120 a share or more than 900 million 
speculation about pennwalt as a possible takeover target has 
persisted since july when centaur partners disclosed it had a 65 
percent stake that it subsequently doubled 
the companys management responded by undertaking a major 
restructuring that so far has resulted in the sale of its 
pharmaceutical business maker of items such as desenex foot powder 
and allerest allergy medicine 
the proceeds of the 460 million sale to fisons plc of britain 
were used to help repurchase nearly 40 percent of pennwalts 
outstanding shares 
although those moves boosted the price of the remaining stock 
they evidently werent sufficient for centaur principals butler and 
estrin who have been financial partners for years and have dabbled 
in other takeover investments before

even though grand metropolitan plc says 
it has made its last and best offer to buy pillsbury co 
officials of the food and restaurant giant are expecting the bid to 
be sweetened again 
but for that to happen pillsburys cornerstone poison pill 
defense must be left intact lawyers for the minneapolisbased 
company said monday in response to legal attacks against the pill by 
grand met and dissident pillsbury shareholders 
the british liquor hotel retailing and gambling conglomerate 
challenged the pill for the second time before justice william duffy 
in the delaware chancery court duffy who earlier ruled in favor of 
pillsbury a delaware corporation took the case under advisement 
and did not say when he would make a decision 
pillsbury lawyer steven rothschild said duffys original decision 
to uphold the pill benefited pillsbury shareholders because grand 
met on monday raised its allcash tender offer to 63 a share or 
55 billion up from 60 a share or 523 billion 
pillsburys board of directors called the sweetened bid 
inadequate and recommended shareholders hold on to their stock the 
offer is set to expire dec 23 
pillsbury stock jumped 387 higher to 6212 a share monday on 
the new york stock exchange 
the court respectfully should let things run their course 
rothschild said in a courtroom crowded with wall street arbitrage 
experts and other spectators were in a very fluid situation 
the pill is serving its function rothschild said they 
know it makes economic sense for them to further increase their 
offer 
but robert rifkind a lawyer for grand met said he had been told 
by the company that 63 a share was its last and best tender 
offer 
grand met chairman allen sheppard in weekend meetings with 
pillsbury chairman philip smith offered to buy the company for 65 
a share on friendly terms but the offer was rejected stuart gold 
a lawyer for grand met said the higher offer would only stand for a 
friendly deal because it would eliminate costs related to the 
takeover fight 
grand met conditioned both tender offers on the removal of the 
pill or shareholders rights plan which it has said would make a 
takeover prohibitively expensive 
grand met also is seeking to block pillsburys proposed spinoff 
of its burger king subsidiary which gold said would add as much as 
8 a share in tax expenses to the cost of a takeover 
partly because pillsbury has not offered an alternative to the 
63 tender offer of equal immediate value the pill should be 
removed to give grand met control rifkind said 
shareholders have a fundamental right to sell their shares to 
whomever they please whenever they want rifkind said if they 
pillsbury can merely label it the offer as inadequate and that 
is allowed to sustain the poison pill there will be no more tender 
offers 
shareholders will have lost a fundamental right to sell their 
shares to the highest bidder rifkind said 
the best pillsbury has been able to offer shareholders is a vague 
recapitalization program that its advisers say could improve the 
companys value to the range of 68 to 73 a share rifkind and gold 
said 
and those projections are based on a 5year plan to spin off 
burger king and have it sold in addition to selling pillsbury in a 
few years rifkind said 
theyre talking about the distant future at best rifkind 
said what they are not offering shareholders is a trading value 
anything like the grand met offer 
gold said the valuations of up to 73 a share for pillsbury are 
based on superaggressive projections that are wildly 
optimistic about managements ability to turn the faltering 
company around 
their refusal to redeem the pill is sort of the nuclear weapon 
in the arsenal of the board said rifkind who said there is no 
threat to merit its use 
grand mets lawyers repeatedly noted that 874 percent of 
outstanding pillsbury shares had been tendered to grand met and not 
withdrawn as of friday 
but rothschild said the percentage is high because grand mets 
offer is coercive shareholders fear they will be left out of 
the deal if they do not tender their shares even though grand met 
has said the offer would be extended to those who dont rothschild 
said 
he said there are circumstances under which grand met would not 
be obligated to pay the offered price to shareholders who dont 
tender 
rifkind said duffy should block the burger king spinoff which 
has a record date of dec 19 for the same reason he should 
invalidate the pill because the spinoff would amount to a poison 
tax 
under the proposed spinoff pillsbury shareholders would be 
issued stock in a newly separate burger king which would borrow 
money to issue a special dividend 
rothschild said grand met could prevent the spinoff of burger 
king by offering a fair price for pillsbury 
if grand met doesnt want to step up to the plate with a higher 
offer before this date arrives rothschild said then thats a 
business decision they have to make 
grand met must recognize and it better recognize that only the 
surface of our negotiating skills have been scratched rothschild 
said let mr sheppard make no mistake about it hes not going to 
buy pillsbury on the cheap

the traditional postolympic slump and weakness 
in local advertising spending are being blamed as projections for 
1989 point to the slowest growth in domestic ad spending in 14 years 
it will be a rather mediocre year robert j coen senior 
vice president and director of forecasting for the advertising 
agency mccannerickson said monday in projecting 61 percent ad 
spending growth next year 
he warned that the underlying sluggish trend could even become 
worse if the economy falters and drifts into a recession 
the 61 percent growth to 1256 billion in 1989 would be down 
from the 79 percent rise coen expects this year and it would be the 
slowest growth since a 48 percent rate of increase in 1975 
a decline in ad spending growth is typical in the year after the 
olympics and a presidential election both of which are believed to 
attract extra money into advertising 
in postolympic years the dropoff in national ad spending has 
sometimes been cushioned by local ad growth but growth in the local 
category is also expected to suffer this time around coen said 
coen said he expects national ad spending will rise 65 percent 
next year while local spending will be up 56 percent national ad 
spending rose an estimated 89 percent this year while local ad 
spending rose about 67 percent 
he said 1989 will also be the first time since 1975 that ad 
spending failed to exceed the expected 68 percent growth including 
inflation that many economists forecast for the economy next year 
meanwhile foreign ad spending was projected to exceed us ad 
spending for the first time this year and is expected to widen its 
lead next year 
coen said foreign ad spending grew 18 percent to about 1214 
billion in 1988 compared with spending of 1183 billion in the 
united states 
next year he said while us ad spending rises to 1256 
billion foreign ad spending should rise 12 percent to 136 billion 
in the us market coen blamed the sluggish pace of local ad 
spending growth on turmoil in retail marketing partly to recent 
acquisitions and restructuring in the retail business he said the 
activity has left less money available for spending on local 
advertising 
he also said the volume of classified advertising in newspapers 
appears to have flattened out after several years of rapid growth 
he cited a decline in real estate activity due to higher mortgage 
rates and slower growth in helpwanted advertising 
he expects local ad spending will reach 553 billion next year 
coen said he expects 1989 spending on the national broadcast 
media will rise 45 percent to 212 billion national print 
spending will be up 58 percent to 102 billion and other national 
ad spending such as the fastgrowing direct mail will be up 78 
percent to 389 billion 
spending on network television will be flat because of the 
absence of an estimated 1 billion in spending related to the 
olympics but cable and syndicated television should have 
doubledigit gains again coen said 
national ad spending in newspapers should be flat while spending 
in magazines may fall back particularly if automotive and toiletry 
sectors scale back the growth in their ad spending 
coen was more optimistic about his longerterm outlook for ad 
spending 
the correction in overexpanded ad spending of the early 1980s 
has been completed and most budgets are back in line with other 
operating costs he said

a disneyheld company seeking to acquire polaroid 
corp has amended its takeover offer to meet a federal court order 
that had blocked the 26 billion bid from going forward 
shamrock holdings inc said monday its hostile 42ashare bid 
for the instant camera pioneer was now contingent on whether a judge 
in delaware invalidates or rescinds polaroids controversial 
employee stock ownership plan 
analysts said the move would not dramatically alter shamrocks 
tender offer which has been in abeyance pending court action 
in delaware us district judge caleb wright on monday ordered 
shamrock to modify the language of the offer and issue a news 
release on the changes the burbank califbased television 
company whollyowned by the roy e disney family met the 
conditions immediately 
shamrock said it would purchase polaroid shares under the 
42ashare offer only if the employee stock plan is invalidated by 
the delaware chancery court where shamrock is challenging the plan 
previously shamrock had maintained that the deal could have 
proceeded merely if the 10 million shares in the stock plan were 
ruled not part of the companys outstanding shares 
if the 300 million employee stock plan is invalidated shamrock 
would try to buy 62 million outstanding shares if not it would be 
faced with acquiring about 72 million shares under an earlier 
40ashare offer analysts said 
shamrock currently owns 5 million shares of polaroid 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips said the company had no 
comment on the development 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in philadelphia last month 
ordered the district court to issue a preliminary injunction 
blocking the takeover bid until shamrock clarified its position on 
the employee stock plan 
the plan places 14 percent of polaroid stock in employee hands a 
move shamrock claims was designed intentionally to defend against 
its hostile takeover bid under delaware law a hostile bidder must 
acquire at least 85 percent of a company 
polaroid which introduced instant snapshots in 1948 is based in 
cambridge mass but incorporated in delaware 
i dont think this implies a change in the approach of shamrock 
to the offer or really any material change in the offer said alex 
henderson an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
arguments in the chancery court case are scheduled for friday 
shamrock said it would extend its offer for polaroid past next 
mondays expiration date to wait for a court ruling

share prices were higher but below their morning 
peaks at midday tuesday boosted by a growing belief that british 
interest rates wont have to be increased further 
dealers said prices were marked up in very thin trading with 
many players still cautious ahead of wednesdays release of us 
trade figures for october 
but property and retailing stocks hurt recently by fears of yet 
higher interest rates proved especially strong tuesday as the 
interest rate concerns receded 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 99 
points or 06 percent at 17578 at about 1245 pm below the 
peak of 155 points up 
volume was a modest 2878 million shares but up from 2301 
million shares at the same time a day earlier 
the market continued to react to mondays news that british 
retail sales volume dropped 05 percent in november from october 
apparently suggesting that recent interest rate increases are 
already cutting back consumer spending 
that suggests the government wont have to boost base lending 
rates above the present 13 percent to choke off the consumer boom 
and squeeze out inflationary pressures dealers said

general motors corp employees will receive profit 
sharing for the first time since 1985 but their payments will be 
fractions of those received by their counterparts at the other two 
major us automakers 
gm said monday that it expected to pay out about 90 million to 
its 450000 hourly and salaried employees who worked all of 1988 or 
about 200 per worker those working less than a full year could 
receive lower payments 
about 200000 of the gm workers are employed in michigan 
the estimated 1988 payments are based on a new profitsharing 
formula first negotiated between the united auto workers union and 
ford motor co in 1984 and now in place at chrysler corp and gm as 
well 
but employees at ford which has fewer employees than gm but is 
more profitable could expect profit sharing payments of more than 
2100 each this year company spokesman tom foote said ford 
workers have received profit sharing each year since 1984 including 
an average 3700 per worker in 1987 
chrysler employees could expect profit sharing payments exceeding 
the 500 minimum guaranteed under the no3 automakers contract with 
the uaw said anthony st john vice president of human resources 
gm said in a statement that a large capitalexpenditure program 
left its 1986 and 1987 earnings too low to trigger profitsharing 
provisions much of that program which included the addition of new 
equipment has been completed 
the gm employees have been part of a truly great team effort to 
redirect gm to assure its competitive position for the future 
chairman roger b smith said we have come a long way and the 
profitsharing payments are further evidence that general motors has 
turned the corner and is achieving improved results in our us 
operations while providing job security for our employees 
the payments to come out of gms pretax profits from domestic 
operations were made possible by improved sales and quality and 
successful costcontrol efforts smith said 
while the anticipated amount of profitsharing per worker will 
be quite modest the basic news that gm is making money while our 
members enjoy greater job security provided under the national 
agreement is welcome indeed uaw president owen bieber and vice 
president donald ephlin director of the unions gm department said 
in a joint statement 
the formula now in place with all big three automakers is based 
on the ratio of profits to us sales rather than profits exceeding 
a defined minimum annual return gms expected 1988 payments will 
trail those of ford in part because gm earns a greater share of its 
automotive profits overseas

the united mine workers is urging other 
unions and their supporters to withdraw funds from banks lending 
money to pittston group as part of a campaign designed to pressure 
the coal company into negotiating a contract 
in addition the umw is organizing for a possible boycott of 
all pittston subsidiaries includinference 
monday and set a jan 31 strike deadline if pittston doesnt agree 
to a new contract with 2000 members in three states 
pittston president gene matthis said a strike would be 
unfortunate and severely affect communities in which the company 
has coal operations 
trumka said the unions campaign against pittston will increase 
pressure against the company on all fronts to negotiate 
the campaign has included demonstrations in new york washington 
richmond and greenwich conn where pittston is headquartered the 
union also planned an advertising campaign in the wall street 
journal and in local newspapers in the coalfields and in connecticut 
our campaign is designed to reach out to the company during the 
holiday period and shortly after the first of the year and try and 
get them back to the bargaining table trumka said 
the umw president said he announced the strike deadline more than 
a month in advance because we want to give every last 
opportunity to a negotiated settlement this gives us 47 days to 
work out an settlement 
we want to go the last step the last mile to see if an 
agreement can be reached trumka said but this is one union 
that has never run from a fight and were prepared to fight this 
one 
we think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carry 
through with this matthis said it would create a lot of 
hardship in some of these communities 
matthis has said the company will continue to operate if the 
union strikes 
pittston miners in west virginia virginia and kentucky have been 
working without a contract for 11 months since the 1984 national 
coal contract expired last jan 31 trumka said there have been no 
negotiations since nov 9 when pittston gave the union a 
takeitorleaveitoffer 
the offer they made would eliminate the eighthour day 
trumka said it would weaken safety rights force our members to 
work on sundays and substantially increase their outofpocket 
health care costs it would allow the company to gain exclusive 
control of our pension plan including the ability to unilaterally 
change or cancel it at any time 
pittston dropped out of the national coal industry bargaining 
organization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement 
saying the companys needs were different than those of the rest of 
the industry the union has accused the company of engaging in 
surface bargaining however and contends pittston has 
demonstrated no interest in reaching an agreement 
we cant discuss their needs because they havent told us what 
their needs are trumka said theyve sent midlevel managers 
to the negotiating table with no authority to change a word on the 
piece of paper 
trumka said he also requested a oneonone meeting with 
pittston chief executive officer paul douglas but he didnt even 
have the courtesy to respond 
matthis said his companys latest offer is better than the 
contract the umw recently signed with at massey coal co ending a 
bitter conflict that began in 1984 and he said he doesnt expect 
talks to resume soon 
according to trumka before the 1984 contract expired the umw 
offered pittston a nostrike agreement in exchange for a promise 
that the company would sign the contract negotiated between the umw 
and the bituminous coal operators association 
when the company refused the union went a step further and 
offered to work under an extension of our existing agreement with 
pittston until we could reach a satisfactory agreement to both 
sides again pittston dismissed the unions offer out of hand 
trumka said 
in fact pittstons actions went far beyond a mere dismissal of 
the unions efforts to negotiate a strikefree agreement in the 
dead of winter management abruptly cut off all health care benefits 
to 1500 umwa retirees widows and disabled miners people who had 
sacrificed the best part of their lives to make pittston a very 
very profitable corporation

the european economic community will 
examine the joint bid for plessey co a british electronics 
company by rival general electric co and siemens ag of germany 
following a formal complaint by plessey an eec spokesman said on 
tuesday 
the spokesman said that plesseys complaint focused on a breach 
of eec antitrust rules by siemens and gec in making the joint 17 
billion pound bid which amounts to 31 billion 
the eec bans industrial agreements which are likely to distort 
free competition 
the plessey case is the second major takeover battle that the eec 
has been asked to deal with in recent months and shows that its role 
in policing mergers in the eec is growing the spokesman said 
in august the eec blocked a consortium bid for irish distillers 
group and forced the companies in the consortium to bid 
independently for the irish whiskey maker 
normally the eec can intervene in mergers only after they take 
place except if the takeover involves a consortium of companies it 
is trying to persuade eec govermments to adopt rules that will allow 
the eec antitrust authorities to intervene in mergers before they 
occur

keeping social securitys promises to todays 
workers will be a lot easier if the government stops using the 
systems trust funds to cover deficits in other federal programs 
three brookings institution economists say 
using the trust funds as a form of enforced national savings 
would spur economic growth and ease the burden of providing pensions 
in the 21st century for the baby boom generation the economists 
said in a book released monday 
the economists gave a qualified yes to the question they 
posed in the title of their book can america afford to grow old 
paying for social security 
but their assessment is contingent upon early painful action to 
wipe out the big deficit in the governments other accounts one 
author barry p bosworth said there is no way to do that without 
raising taxes 
if you do this you kind of destroy the argument that you can 
solve the deficit on the expenditures side bosworth said at a 
news conference 
bosworth and colleagues henry j aaron and gary burtless also 
suggested that even if social securitys trust funds are used as a 
form of national savings the payroll tax may still have to be 
raised by 69 percentage points over the next 75 years to keep 
social security and medicare from running deficits 
the total payroll tax is now 1502 percent divided equally 
between employee and employer it is scheduled to peak in 1990 at 
153 percent or 765 percent for each 
social security is currently rolling up 40 billion annual 
surpluses that soon will become 100 billionayear surpluses 
the growing surpluses in the social security system camouflage 
a major deterioration in the budget balance for nonsocial security 
and medicare operations said the brookings experts 
the payroll tax ostensibly earmarked for retirement 
survivors disability and hospital insurance is being used 
increasingly to pay for other government expenditures such as 
defense and interest on the public debt they said 
the brookings institution is a washington think tank its 
economists work was paid for in part by the social security 
administration 
while the government reported a 155 billion budget deficit for 
fiscal 1988 it was 210 billion in the red if the 55 billion 
surpluses in social security and medicare were not counted 
if the social security trust funds were used to buy up the old 
national debt that would add to the national savings rate and spur 
growth the economists said 
such a step would relieve future generations of workers of all 
or most of the burden from the added costs of pension benefits in 
the next century when the baby boomers reach old age it said 
however the economists said if national saving is not 
increased then these programs will impose significantly greater 
burdens on future generations than they do on current generations 
if the politicians are unwilling to act to save the trust funds 
instead of using them to finance current consumption the brookings 
experts recommended lowering the payroll tax to prevent a big trust 
fund buildup but such a payasyougo approach would also mean 
higher payroll taxes 20 or 30 years from now 
social security under current law is scheduled to build its 
reserves to more than 12 trillion 2 trillion in todays dollars 
over the next 40 years then draw them down over the following 
decades

atari games corp has sued rival computer 
giant nintendo co of japan for 100 million accusing nintendo of 
monopolizing the home video game market with a system that locks out 
competitors game cartridges 
the us district court suit filed monday said atari games of 
milpitas calif has finally developed the functional equivalent 
of a key that will unlock the lockout system after suffering 30 
million to 35 million in damages over several years the suit seeks 
triple damages under antitrust laws 
lynn hvalsoe general counsel for nintendo of america inc in 
redmond wash nintendos us subsidiary declined comment on the 
suit 
atari games was founded in 1985 as a privately held company and 
is not affiliated with atari inc of sunnyvale calif a publicly 
held company 
atari games said nintendo controls more than 80 percent of the 
us market for home video game machines the suit said nintendo has 
equipped its machines for several years with a computer chip that 
allows the machines to accept only video game cartridges that have a 
compatible chip 
using this barrier and its completely dominating position in 
the market for home video game machines nintendo has forced the 
more than 30 companies that have written games that play on nintendo 
machines to have all of their game cartridges manufactured by 
nintendo at prices it dictates the suit said 
it said nintendo likely will earn more than 1 billion in revenue 
this year from us sales of home video cartridges that play on its 
machines nintendos exclusionary practices limit competition and 
variety on the market and drive up prices the suit said

a senior official of japans ministry of 
international trade and industry said tuesday that japan wont be 
able to reduce its trade surplus to the governments target for 
calendar 1988 
the official did not predict how much the surplus would shrink 
he noted however that over the past three monthly reports the 
trade surplus has risen in comparison to a year earlier probably 
putting the target out of reach 
the governments target was to cut about 11 billion off japans 
1987 surplus which came to 798 billion the surplus in calendar 
1987 was narrower than the 1986 surplus of 827 billion 
on monday the finance ministry said japans merchandise trade

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade narrowed to 309 billion from july through september the 
smallest imbalance in three years the government reported today 
the commerce department said americas deficit in its current 
account fell by 84 percent from a second quarter level of 337 
billion as us manufacturers continued to enjoy a boom in export 
sales 
the current account is the most important trade statistic because 
it measures not only trade in merchandise but also trade in 
investments and other services the third quarter deficit was the 
smallest imbalance since a 276 billion deficit in the third 
quarter of 1985 
half of the improvement in the latest quarter came from a 56 
percent decline in the merchandise deficit as exports of both 
agricultural products and merchandise increased 
also showing improvement was the investment and services 
category which had posted an 837 million deficit in the second 
quarter the first deficit in this category in 30 years for the 
third quarter this had returned to a surplus of 757 million 
the current account also known as the countrys balance of 
payments hit a record deficit of 15396 billion in 1987 
in the first nine months of this year the current account 
deficit has been running at an annual rate of 13542 billion 
deficit while this is a significant improvement it still leaves 
the current account deficit at a high level 
this figure is important because it translates into the amount of 
money foreigners have to lend or invest in the united states the 
string of deteriorating current account deficits beginning in 1982 
has meant the united states has gone from being the worlds largest 
creditor nation to the largest debtor country as americans have 
handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for 
imported goods 
that means that foreigners now own more in us investments than 
americans own in overseas investments the question of the 
willingness of foreign investors to continue holding us 
investments is likely to be the biggest economic problem facing 
presidentelect bush 
the dollar fell sharply in the days following bushs election as 
investors feared his notax pledge and the larger democratic 
majorities in congress would mean a continuation of the sevenyear 
budget deadlock to reassure jittery markets bush has taken to 
pledging at every opportunity that he views tackling the budget 
deficit as his top priority 
at the end of last year americas net debt had grown to 3682 
billion and many economists believe the current accounts 
performance this year will push the net debt level above 500 
billion by the end of 1988 
some economists have warned that the debt service burden will 
eventually lower americans standard of living by reducing the 
amount of money available in this country for government operations 
business investment and individual consumption 
the reagan administration has sought to play down the 
significance of the countrys net debtor status saying that the 
cost of financing that debt is still a tiny fraction of the 
countrys 5 trillion economy 
economists said however that the deficit in the services 
category in the second quarter although small was an ominous 
event before 1982 america was able to count on surpluses from its 
overseas investment earnings to erase perennial merchandise trade 
deficits 
but with foreigners now holding a bigger share of us 
investments the country will never be able to eliminate its current 
account deficit unless it starts running surpluses in the 
merchandise category something that even optimistic forecasters say 
will be impossible until well into the next decade 
for that reason some economists have forecast that the level of 
the countrys net debtor position will approach 1 trillion before 
it starts to show any improvement 
for the third quarter the deficit in merchandise trade declined 
to 2853 billion its third consecutive quarterly improvement 
added to this figure was an increase to 312 billion in us 
foreign aid and pension payments overseas 
the small 757 million surplus in investments and other services 
is subtracted from those deficit figures to arrive at the current 
account deficit of 3089 billion 
many economists fear that the improvement in the trade deficit 
this year which has accounted for almost half of the overall growth 
in the economy is in danger of stalling next year without a major 
push by the bush administration to open up foreign markets and 
without further declines in the value of the dollar 
the national association of manufacturers issued a report today 
calling on the bush administration to move aggressively to use the 
powers in the new trade bill to open foreign markets 
weve made significant advances toward reducing the us trade 
deficit but unless policymakers cooperate we face the danger of a 
midpoint stall and a large trade deficit that will continue to 
plague us far into the next decade said jerry jasinowski 
executive vice president of the manufacturers group

winstonsalem nc ap the hometown newspaper of rj 
reynolds tobacco co has pulled a comic strip in which a reynolds 
applicant has trouble saying cigarettes do not cause cancer 
without laughing 
a oneparagraph statement on the winstonsalem journals sunday 
editorial page said editors pulled the doonesbury comic strip 
because they felt it singled out for an unfair attack the citys 
largest company and would be personally offensive to its employees 
their families and a large number of the journals readers 
spokesmen for universal press syndicate which distributes 
doonesbury to 900 newspapers worldwide said it was the first time 
garry trudeaus controversial comic strip has been pulled from a 
newspaper in deference to a corporation 
it certainly wont be the last time said lee salem 
universal presss editorial director 
the comic strip came on the heels of last months takeover of the 
food and tobacco giant by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for 2453 
billion the largest corporate buyout in us history 
more than 40 journal reporters and editors sent a memo to 
publisher joe doster protesting the withdrawal of the comic strip 
and four people called john gates editorial page editor to 
complain 
virtually to a person they said they felt they were old enough 
to determine whether something was offensive for themselves and i 
have long since given up trying to make the distinction between 
censorship and editorial judgment to these people gates said 
doster who made the final decision was not available for 
comment this morning his secretary said 
gates said sundays doonesbury was hilariously funny but 
he added that the comic strips timing was bad coming on the 
heels of last months buyout of rjrnabisco inc rj reynoldss 
corporate parent 
it was sort of like kicking somebody when he was down gates 
said 
but salem said when else would one talk about rj reynolds 
except when its in the news 
maura payne a spokeswoman for rj reynolds in winstonsalem 
said the comic strip misrepresents the companys position on the 
subject of smoking and health and does a disservice to our 
employees 
executives of reynolds and other cigarette companies when they 
address what they call the smoking and health controversy say 
the link between smoking and disease in humans has not been 
scientifically proven 
reynolds spokeswoman betsy annese said the company considered the 
strip a terrible affront to the honest hardworking employees 
of rjr the journals decision to pull the strip was a nice 
gesture she said 
over the years newspapers across the country have pulled 
doonesbury when it poked fun at various public figures 
including president reagan former california gov jerry brown sen 
john warner of virginia and entertainer frank sinatra newspapers 
also have withdrawn the strip because of statements about the 
vietnam war and other controversial issues

the dow jones average of 30 industrials which lost 391 points

and 641 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 6173 million shares at noon 
compared with 6367 million shares at the same point in mondays

analysts attributed the decline this morning to deepening worries 
that interest rates could be headed higher making shortterm 
treasury issues relatively attractive compared with stocks 
as federal reserve policymakers gathered for a private twoday 
meeting at which they are expected to chart a course on credit the 
government reported strongerthanexpected growth in november retail

the commerce department said november sales rose 11 percent 
about twice as big a gain as many analysts had expected it also 
revised upward its estimate of growth in october to 16 percent from 
the initial report of 09 percent 
the report sent bond prices lower early in the session and stock 
prices followed both bonds and stocks later retraced some lost

carl c icahn disclosed today he has raised his 
stake in texaco inc to 158 percent raising fresh questions about 
the takeover strategists ultimate plans regarding the thirdlargest 
us oil company 
icahn said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission that he purchased 26 million shares of texaco stock 
between dec 7 and dec 12 for 131 million or an average of about 
5037 a share his filing did not not explain why he bought the 
stock 
but the move vaulted icahns stake over the 15 percent threshold 
which under the takeover laws of delaware where texaco is 
incorporated means he must raise his ownership to 85 percent or 
wait at least three years before attempting any acquisition effort 
that would result in the companys breakup 
wall street has been rife with rumors lately that icahn 
texacos largest shareholder might renew his effort to either buy 
the company provoke a takeover attempt by some other investor or 
conduct a second shareholder proxy fight to wrest control of texaco 
from its board of directors 
his first effort to win control in a shareholder vote was 
defeated earlier this year but icahn didnt rule out the 
possibility of undertaking another fight later 
icahns disclosure today further clouded his intentions because 
it was seen as a possible sign he might want to sell out his 
interest in texaco 
texaco stock rose 150 a share to 5225 in heavy early trading 
on the new york stock exchange reflecting speculation that icahns 
move might at least provoke another takeover bid 
officials at texacos white plains ny headquarters declined to 
comment on icahns stock purchase icahn did not return telephone 
calls to his executive offices in nearby mt kisco ny 
icahn is chairman of trans world airlines inc one of his 
successful acquisitions and widely is regarded as a shrewd 
financier and takeover investor who has gone after some of the 
biggest us corporations such as usx corp and phillips petroleum 
co 
he began building a stake in texaco as the company was struggling 
to emerge from federal bankruptcy court protection between april 
1987 and may 1988 texaco sought protection as a result of pennzoil 
cos record 103 billion judgment against texaco over the disputed 
purchase of getty oil co in 1984 
texaco settled with pennzoil by paying it 3 billion in cash and 
emerged from bankruptcy protection by undertaking a major 
restructuring to divest billions of dollars in assets most of the 
proceeds from those sales will go to shareholders and to pay down 
debts

the number of insolvent savings and loan 
associations fell further from july through september but the 
improvement was partially offset by the 22 thrift institutions that 
slipped into insolvency the government said today 
the federal home loan bank board which on nov 29 reported on 
the industrys loss for the third quarter said the number of 
insolvent institutions fell from 498 as of june 30 to 434 as of 
sept 30 at the end of last year there were 520 insolvents 
however even as the government resolved or stabilized the cases 
of 86 sampls during the third quarter 22 more slipped into insolvency 
the sampl industry is piling up the biggest loss this year since 
the depression losses in the third quarter were 16 billion down 
from 39 billion in both the first and second quarters 
james barth chief economist of the bank board declined to say 
whether he thought thrift institution performance would improve or 
worsen in the fourth quarter but he warned that rising interest 
rates will cut into earnings 
the relative health of commercial banking stands in stark 
contrast to the condition of savings and loan institutions 
the nations commercial banks are posting record profits this 
year and should have another good year in 1989 unless the third 
world debt problem worsens dramatically analysts say 
the federal deposit insurance corp which insures deposits up to 
100000 in 13239 commercial banks said monday that the industry 
earned 59 billion in the julyseptember period topping the 
previous quarterly record of 58 billion set a year ago 
earnings totaled 50 billion in the first quarter of this year 
and 55 billion in the second 
i think we can say without much question that this year will be 
an alltime high for banking profits fdic chairman l william 
seidman told reporters 
the agency is predicting profits will top 23 billion in 1988 
surpassing the record 181 billion earned in 1985 last year the 
largest banks took big writedowns on loans to third world countries 
holding the industrys earnings to 36 billion the weakest since 
the depression 
banks did not take further writedowns this year but the ldc 
less developed country debt does remain a key overhanging issue 
said james h wooden an analyst with the investment firm shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
the fdic said the fact that brazil has resumed payments on its 
huge foreign debt following a moratorium should add 15 billion 
to the fourthquarter bank earnings total 
but wooden warned theres some expectation that argentina is 
going to go nonperforming and if the government loses the 
election in brazil next november we could be back to square one 
there 
despite the good news for banks seidman sounded notes of caution 
regarding an increase in bad loans and banks rising involvement in 
leveraged buyouts 
bad loans on which borrowers have stopped making payments 
jumped 43 percent from the second quarter to 765 billion in the 
third the fdic said much of the increase came in the southwest 
where the economy has been depressed by troubles in the oil industry 
however bad real estate loans in the new england states new 
jersey and florida also rose 
we need to keep a careful eye on that seidman said 
but they are not i repeat not at alarming levels and not like the 
southwest 
robert g dederick an economist with northern trust co said 
theres no question that real estate prices bolted up pretty high 
in some areas and there are some vulnerabilities there fortunately 
it doesnt seem to be national in scale 
seidman also said that a substantial but undetermined share of 
bank income is coming from the boom in corporate buyouts 
leveraged buyout transactions are becoming a big part of 
banking activity and that does increase the risk to some extent 
he said but added at this point i dont have any evidence 
that would indicate that institutions are going to fail because of 
leveraged buyouts 
the strong 1988 earnings paradoxically are coming amid the 
worst year for bank failures since the depression through last 
week 213 banks either failed or were saved from failing through 
government assistance that already tops the record of 203 for all 
of last year 
the failures reflect continuing troubles in the southwest and to 
a lesser extent the fallout from farm problems earlier in the decade 
in the midwest of the failures this year 114 were in texas 24 in 
oklahoma 11 in louisiana nine in colorado eight each in minnesota 
and kansas and seven in iowa

mcdonalds is the king of the fastburger business 
in japan but only at the cost of constant price wars and assaults 
by competitors who entice the japanese palate with recipes including 
soy sauce and rice 
americanstyle fast food has become a multibilliondollar annual 
business since mcdonalds co arrived 17 years ago in this nation of 
sushi and noodle soup eaters 
thousands of outlets are being added at a rate of almost one a 
day and the competition to grab customers has intensified in recent 
months 
mcdonalds which sold 300 million hamburgers and had 12 
billion in sales here last year launched a campaign in october 
featuring a hamburger french fries and a cola for 360 yen 295 
mcdonalds spokesman tatsuki kubo said the campaign celebrates 
the achievement of one trillion yen 81 billion in sales since 
the company began its business in japan in 1971 
the new promotion offers a 25cent discount from last years 
sankyu set which triggered a price war sankyu is the 
japanese pronunciation of thank you and also means 39 a 
reference to the price of 390 yen 320 for the same combination 
we can lower prices by combining a hamburger with fries and a 
drink cost prices of which are very cheap kubo said 
lotteria co the no 2 chain with 496 million in sales in 1987 
said mcdonalds campaign is an attempt to win back customers that 
lotteria had grabbed with its 380yen trio that was launched a 
few months after mcdonalds sankyu set 
lotteria first tried to compete by putting a little more meat and 
lettuce in sandwiches said the firms tetsuo uchimoto but bigger 
burgers werent attracting more customers so in the summer of 1987 
lotteria undercut mcdonalds price by 10 yen 8 cents on the 
burgerfriescola combination 
now that mcdonalds is down to 360 yen yet another competitor 
meiji sante ole with 75 outlets in eastern japan has knocked 20 
yen 16 cents from three sets on sale at about 10 outlets located 
near mcdonalds restaurants said an official of sante ole speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
wendys a us chain that has 30 outlets mainly in eastern japan 
after eight years in the country has joined the price war said 
ryokichi morishita of the daiei corp wendys parent company in 
japan 
wendys cannot compete with others on the same level 
morishita said but it has set prices from 280 yen to 390 yen 230 
to 320 on combinations normally costing 320 yen to 560 yen 
cheaper prices may not always increase sales however a 
27yearold stockbroker anonymously said i wouldnt buy a 360yen 
set when i only want a hamburger 
yuko nomura a 23yearold office worker said in a letter 
published recently in the asahi shimbun daily that she was offended 
when a clerk strongly recommended a set when she had ordered a 
hamburger and coffee 
meanwhile mos food service is competing by opening new mos 
burgers outlets at a breakneck pace and tops the list with 747 
followed by mcdonalds 644 and lotterias 542 though mos is third 
in sales with 434 million last year 
mos burgers made the largest sales increase of 382 percent last 
year followed by mcdonalds 101 percent and lotterias 82 percent 
its locations however are less visible than those of the top 
two companies which are easily found along major highways and at 
the center of big cities 
we dont want to spend money on buying expensive pieces of 
land mos spokesman kazuhiro kobayashi said adding instead we 
have tried to build more shops in cheaper areas 
kobayashi said the company plans to open about 150 new outlets a 
year while mcdonalds and lotteria said each will add about 50 
mos burgers menu more japanese than the others includes 
chicken teriyaki sandwiches and riceburgers the latter has meat 
flavored with soy sauce in a rice cake instead of a bun those two 
sandwiches accounted for 20 percent of sales last year kobayashi 
said 
another competitor morinaga love recently added a healthy 
burger with 20 percent less fat than normal hamburger according 
to the company 
the first kitchen a chain which introduced a beefsalad 
burger in october said its a pain that mcdonalds 360yen set 
may attract many customers who tend to think the cheaper the 
better 
burger chains said unanimously that their survival strategy is to 
offer something new and different and to create tastes that suit 
japans food culture 
and to take on the big mac 
i guess taste is the ultimate factor to be successful in any 
kind of food business lotterias uchimoto said 
i dont care if kids go to mcdonalds for the 20yen 
difference because we aim at adults he said mcdonalds is the 
target until we beat it

if al copelands bid to take over churchs 
fried chicken falls through it will cost him by his own 
estimation about 5 million 
he can afford it however 
im not interested in losing money i dont expect to says 
copeland whose net worth is put at 200 million i think i can 
always make more though ive always had that kind of faith in 
myself i can always make another million 
not bad for a guy who grew up in a new orleans housing project 
dropped out of school at 16 and started his working life as a soda 
jerk 
im having a ball i really am my life is like a story about 
the american dream i always had the desire to make it big and i 
always knew i had the ability to make it big said the 44yearold 
founder of popeyes famous fried chicken amp biscuits 
he owns 96 percent of popeyes and although he still puts in 
12hour work days he finds plenty of time to enjoy everything from 
offshore powerboat racing to his splashy display of christmas 
lights that attracts hundreds of thousands of viewers to his 
corporate headquarters every year 
as a 16yearold high school dropout with no training and no 
special skills copeland worked two jobs days at a local 
supermarket soda counter and nights at his brothers doughnut shop 
he scraped together enough money to buy his own doughnut shop in 
1962 but even then he was thinking chicken 
the chicken business looked pretty attractive to me but i knew 
that id have to have a product i considered better than kentucky 
fried chickens if i was going to compete he said 
in 1972 he opened chicken on the run in new orleans 
featuring fast service but a chicken recipe that lacked bite he 
had toned down his own pepperladen cajun style formula at the 
behest of friends who said it wouldnt sell 
in the first year he said the store lost almost 13000 
he decided to go with his original recipe he renamed the 
business popeyes and started what became the third largest chicken 
chain in the country 
popeyes now has 725 outlets and is expected to do about 500 
million in business this year 
i set a goal of being a millionaire by the time i was 30 he 
said he made it easily 
after that copeland said he set himself a goal of making 100 
million he has now reached that goal 
now its a billion dollars its not the money anymore now 
its just a way of keeping track you have to have a goal so thats 
mine he said 
copeland is not at all shy about using his wealth to do what he 
likes 
his 12car collection now includes a new rolls royce a 
custommade porsche and a 100000 lamborghini he has four racing 
boats and has held the us title for a record five years in 
offshore power boat racing 
he owns a helicopter and a 100foot yacht 
his corporate offices on the fifth floor of popeyes plaza in

an investment group seeking to buy tw services 
inc for 114 billion extended its tender offer tuesday until jan 
5 and sent the foodservice giant the draft of a takeover agreement 
to show its sincerity 
tw services officials had no immediate comment on the moves by 
coniston partners an investment concern run by three new york 
takeover strategists who have been pursuing the company for months 
coniston said in a statement that under the 29ashare tender 
offer it began in late october 853 percent of tws 486 million 
shares of stock outstanding had been been tendered 
tw has been fighting the takeover with its socalled poison pill 
defense designed to make a hostile bid prohibitively expensive 
coniston has challenged the defense in court 
the target company has called conistons offer too cheap and 
implied the investment group is interested only in selling its 93 
million shares for a profit or breaking up the company and selling 
it piecemeal 
in response coniston said it had given tws board of directors 
copies of a draft merger agreement to demonstrate that the 
investment group is seriously interested in running the company 
we urge you to give the enclosed form of agreement prompt and 
serious consideration and we remain ready to meet with you or your 
advisors at any time coniston said in the letter which it made

the occupational health and safety 
administration tuesday proposed fining a pepperidge farm inc plant 
nearly 14 million for exposing workers to dangerous working 
conditions 
the 1384 million fine will be imposed if pepperidge farm does 
not contest it within 15 working days said jack hord spokesman in 
philadelphia for osha an arm of the us department of labor 
the norwalk connbased company said the fine was arbitrarily 
assigned and totally unjustified and said it would contest the 
alleged violations 
there have been eight proposed fines higher than the pepperidge 
farm proposal according to frank kane osha spokesman in washington 
fifty workers at pepperidge farms plant in downingtown pa 
developed carpal tunnel syndrome an inflamation of the sheaths 
around nerve endings in the fingers wrists and shoulders 
according to hord twentysix of them required surgery hord said 
the injuries resulted from repeatedly putting together sandwich 
cookies hord said 
oshas sixmonth investigation recorded 389 willful violations of 
recordkeeping rules and safety standards at the 1500worker plant 
according to a news release 
there were gaps and inaccuracies in illness records and although 
the plant had a manual on how to prevent the injuries officials did 
not implement the recommendations according to osha 
management was clearly aware of the need to address ergonomic 
hazards at this pepperidge farm plant yet chose to ignore its own 
experts and employees while more and more employees suffered 
crippling injury said john a pendergrass assistant secretary of 
labor and osha head 
the results were predictable an increase in injuries repeated 
trauma for previously injured employees high turnover at the plant 
and a call to osha for help pendergrass said 
in disputing the proposed fine pepperidge farm said the disorder 
can occur in all occupations that involve repetitive movements 
we have been singled out and chastised for a phenomenon common 
to myriad jobs both bluecollar and whitecollar requiring 
repetitive movement of hands and arms richard a shea pepperidge 
farm president said in a prepared statement 
the company said it has been improving its downingtown operation 
for the past three years by installing automatic case packers and 
redesigning the assembly line the company also has been rotating 
workers involved in repetitive motions every 20 to 30 minutes 
pepperidge farm said 
we have spent in excess of 275000 over the past two years to 
improve the ergonomics of our cookie operation said dale stokes 
manager of the downingtown plant we are slated to spend an 
additional 250000 over the next year on the ergonomic design of 
our cookie assortment line 
the company is reviewing its recordkeeping of injuries 
according to a press release 
there are eight us pepperidge farm plants including four that 
make cookies said karen sportini company spokeswoman the other 
cookie factories are in willard ohio richmond utah and lakeland 
fla she said 
after checking within osha akio konoshima an agency spokesman 
in washington said he was not aware of any investigations at 
pepperidges other plants

the imperial valleys winter iceberg 
lettuce crop is threatened by insects and bad weather the same 
problems blamed for shortages and high prices a year ago 
however experts dont expect prices to soar to last winters 
levels 
whiteflies have been a problem in the desert area that stretches 
from californias imperial valley to yuma arizona and that provides 
almost all of the nations iceberg lettuce each winter 
we have a very similar situation to last year but what has 
made it a little tougher and accentuated the deep problem was the 
extreme heat here in october said grower joe colace 
the heat put stress on young lettuce plants and increased the 
number of the flies that can stunt formation of lettuce heads or 
cause leaves to yellow he said 
desert iceberg lettuce is bringing 10 to 14 for a carton of 24 
heads more than the price received two years ago but well under 
last years prices 
this time last year we were upwards of 20 a box said colace 
however industry experts did not predict prices to equal last 
winter when supermarkets sold iceberg lettuce as high as 159 a 
head 
prices have been kept from soaring as high as in 1987 by late and 
heavy harvests that lasted through november in the southern san 
joaquin valley and the ventura areas but colace expected tight 
supplies through the rest of december 
any shortage was expected to be less severe because imperial 
valley growers planted about 35000 acres to iceberg lettuce this 
year up about 12 percent from 1987 
last year was a very very unusual season i dont think youll 
see another like it said bob lee of the arizona agriculture 
departments fruit and vegetable division in yuma i think people 
will give up lettuce before they pay those prices again 
lettuce californias number one vegetable crop grossed 598 
million for the state growers last year compared with 485 million 
in 1986 according to department of food and agriculture statistics

the us economy is likely to do better in 1989 
than it has this year because of growth in exports and capital 
spending the nations purchasing managers said in a report released 
tuesday 
fiftythree percent of the purchasing managers surveyed felt 
their businesses would be better in 1989 than in 1988 compared with 
13 percent who expected it would be worse the national association 
of purchasing management said the rest thought it would be about 
the same 
the report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more 
than 250 industrial companies in all 50 states 
the exceptionally high level of optimism expressed by 
purchasing managers about the next 12 months overshadows their 
concerns regarding inflation rising interest rates and the budget 
deficit robert j bretz chairman of the associations business 
survey committee and director of materials management at pitney 
bowes inc said in a written statement 
overall theyre expecting a continuation of a very healthy 
growth throughout all of 1989 perhaps heavier in the first half 
than the last half bretz said in an interview 
on inflation 87 percent predicted their companies would be 
paying higher prices at the end of 1989 than at the end of 1988 and 
of those the average inflation forecast was 42 percent seven 
percent predicted lower prices with an average forecast decline of 
24 percent 
the association said the combination of answers on inflation 
translated into a prediction of a net average price increase of 37 
percent in 1989 the managers expect a net average price increase of 
5 percent for this year 
members reported their companies were operating at the highest 
percentage of capacity since may 1979 the 76 percent who said 1988 
fully measured up to their expectations was the most to say so since 
1978 
the top three concerns mentioned by the purchasing managers were 
inflation cited cited by 22 percent rising interest rates 14 
percent and the federal budget deficit 13 percent 
on capital expenditures 42 percent said they expected to spend 
more in 1989 while 24 percent said they expected to spend less 
asked a broader question about the outlook for the economy in 
general not just their own companies 48 percent said they were 
satisfied or optimistic the highest reading for a december survey 
since december 1983 
fifty percent said they were concerned and 2 percent said they 
were worried or pessimistic

a late surge in bluechip issues left the stock 
market narrowly mixed tuesday amid worries about the course of 
interest rates 
a spurt in the final minutes of trading enabled the markets 
bestknown indicator to erase exactly the modest loss it recorded a 
day earlier but several broader market gauges finished lower for 
the day 
and analysts said the pace of activity was tempered by 
anticipation of the october trade report which is to be released on 
wednesday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which lost 391 points 
on monday made it all back on tuesday gaining 391 to close at 
214349 
the index had been down nearly 15 points with 30 minutes 
remaining in the session and was off nearly 10 points five minutes 
before the close 
the blue chips have been leading the market and maybe they are 
doing it again said thomas czech first vice president for 
research at the brokerage blunt ellis loewi in milwaukee 
he noted that the dollar has been strong and said the late 
bluechip buyers may suspect the trade deficit report will help the 
market 
in the broader market however declining issues outnumbered 
gainers by about 9to5 in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted stocks with 541 issues up 890 down and 570 
unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 13234 million shares up 
from 12416 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
15730 million shares 
analysts attributed the decline in the broader indexes to 
deepening worries that interest rates could be headed higher making 
yields on shortterm treasury issues more competitive with the 
uncertain returns on stocks 
the nervousness was heightened because federal reserve 
policymakers were gathering for a private twoday meeting at which 
they are expected to assess the economys strength and whether 
inflation is becoming a problem 
in the latest indication of the economys health the commerce 
department reported that november retail sales rose 11 percent 
about twice as big a gain as many analysts had expected it also 
revised upward its estimate of growth in october to 16 percent from 
the initial report of 09 percent 
the report sent bond prices lower early in the session and stock 
prices followed 
its the old good news is bad news syndrome said larry 
wachtel a market analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
anything that smacks of economic vigor does not sit well with the 
market 
also on tuesday a majority of the nations purchasing managers 
who responded to a survey indicated they expect the us economy to 
do better next year than it has in 1988 
but analysts said traders were reluctant to take a position in 
advance of wednesdays report on nations merchandise trade deficit 
for october which many economists expect will be little changed 
from the 1046 billion imbalance reported for september 
texaco was one of the most active issues on the nyse rising to

the dollar strengthened tuesday in a mild rally 
that dealers attributed to yearend demand for the currency and some 
optimism that an impending report on the monthly us trade deficit 
would not cause alarm 
gold prices weakened slightly in us trading after rising in 
europe and falling in asia republic national bank quoted bullion at 
41950 a troy ounce at 4 pm est down 75 cents from its late 
monday quote 
currency strategists said steppedup commercial demand for 
dollars a usual occurrence at the end of the year was partly 
behind the dollars strength 
they also said there was a consensus in the market that the us 
trade deficit for october to be reported wednesday by the commerce 
department would be around 105 billion expectations of that 
figure which would be substantially unchanged from the previous 
month also helped the dollar 
the trade statistics fluctuate sharply but have enormous 
potential to affect the dollar because they are the most visible 
evidence of american competitiveness abroad a widening deficit 
would put downward pressure on the dollar while a narrowing gap 
would tend to strengthen the currency

copper futures prices plunged in frantic selling tuesday on new 
yorks commodity exchange in reaction to the settlement of a 57day 
mining strike in peru the worlds sixthlargest copper producer 
on other markets precious metals edged lower cotton futures 
were sharply lower energy futures declined grains and soybeans 
were mixed livestock and meat were mixed and stockindex futures 
gained 
reports of an overnight settlement in the peruvian mining strike 
surprised traders on the commodity exchange where copper futures 
prices had been expected to stabilize following a steep selloff on 
monday 
it came as a shock said bernard savaiko metals analyst with 
painewebber inc in new york 
copper settled 6 cents to 7 cents lower with the spot contract 
for delivery in december at 152 a pound and the most actively 
traded march contract at 129 a pound 
the strike which began oct 17 was a major factor in coppers 
run up to a record 16475 a pound on the commodity exchange last 
week analysts said the shutdown along with a shorter strike in 
august may have cost peru up to 100000 metric tons of copper 
production and could reduce 1988 peruvian exports of copper by 30 
percent compared with 1987 
even with the end of the strike it will take peruvian mining 
companies at least a month to resume full production and another six 
to eight weeks before the first shipments reach fabricators to be 
made into copper wire and other forms for industrial use 
youre going to have the supply tightness continuing for a 
while but during the holiday period youre not likely to get rising 
physical demand as fabricators are not that active said bette 
raptopoulos metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york 
the key question said savaiko is whether or not there 
will be adequate supplies to meet demand during the peak consumption 
period of the first quarter of year 
analyst james steel of refco inc in new york noted that 
production problems still plague many other copperproducing 
countries 
he said coppers price could fall further in the next day or 
two purely because theres a technical run on the downside now but 
the markets still very tight and we expect this thing to rebound 
later 
gold and silver futures settled marginally lower on the commodity 
exchange 
gold settled 30 cents to 40 cents lower with february at 42410 
a troy ounce silver was 10 cent to 70 cent lower with march at 
6295 a troy ounce 
cotton futures fell sharply on the new york cotton exchange in a 
mostly technical selloff triggered by the agriculture departments 
24 percent upward revision monday of its 198889 us cotton 
production estimate 
i would say the whole thing was due not to cotton fundamentals 
but to the charts said ed whitten an analyst with balfour 
maclaine corp in new york the crop report may be going to get 
some credit but that was just the icing on the cake 
cotton settled 128 cents to 164 cents lower with march at 5755 
cents a pound 
heating oil futures fell sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange following mondays strong rally crudeoil and gasoline 
futures also retreated 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 31 cents 
lower with january at 16 a barrel heating oil was 92 cent to 108 
cents lower with january at 4927 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline was 52 cent to 90 cent lower with january at 4330 cents 
a gallon 
corn futures ended strongly higher on the chicago board of trade 
on hopes for new export sales while soybean prices fell and wheat 
finished mixed 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 
427 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with december at 
265 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 2 cents higher with december 
at 209 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 5 cents lower with 
january at 765 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange following sharp gains in the two previous 
sessions 
live cattle settled 10 cent lower to 05 cent higher with 
december at 7245 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower 
to 15 cent higher with january at 8397 cents a pound live hogs 
were 25 cent lower to 97 cent higher with december at 4252 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 02 cent lower to 150 cents 
higher with february at 4472 cents a pound 
stockindex futures advanced modestly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for march delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 index settled 30 point higher at 27960 each point is 
worth 500

atari games corps doublebarreled attack 
on nintendo co could be the opening zaps of a broader battle in the 
multibilliondollar home video game market 
at issue is whether nintendo the leading maker of video game 
machines can control the software market by limiting the number of 
games it makes under licensing agreements with software developers 
and preventing them from making the games independently 
atari games a licensee says nintendo is violating antimonopoly 
laws and has sued for 100 million in damages 
but mediagenic another licensee formerly called activision says 
nintendos controls may be illegal but probably are good for the 
market overall 
nintendo a japanese company with a us subsidiary based in 
redmond wash isnt saying what it thinks although its attorneys 
are studying the lawsuit atari games filed against it monday in us 
district court in san francisco 
nintendo which controls 80 percent of the us market for home 
video game machines may be planning a countersuit to stop atari 
games from releasing through its tengen inc software subsidiary the 
first independently manufactured video game cartridges for nintendo 
machines 
atari games a privatelyheld company based in milpitas calif 
and unrelated to computermaker atari inc claims its profits have 
been hurt because it is required to turn to nintendo for 
manufacturing and is limited in the number of cartridges it may sell 
we have been able to get only a small fraction of the games we 
want to sell into the market said dennis wood senior vice 
president for atari games we are so frustrated by our inability 
to get the proper supplies 
atari games says nintendo has equipped its machines with a 
computer chip that allows them to accept only video game cartridges 
with a compatible chip 
using this barrier and its completely dominating position in 
the market for home video game machines nintendo has forced the 
more than 30 companies that have written games that play on nintendo 
machines to have all of their game cartridges manufactured by 
nintendojapan at prices it dictates the suit states 
the suit claims atari games lost between 30 million and 35 
million because of inadequate supplies atari games is seeking three 
times its direct losses under the provision for treble damages in 
antimonopoly suits 
ataris tengen subsidiary has about 35 million in annual sales 
nintendo in recent years has cashed in on what some have 
described as an almost cultlike consumer devotion to its games the 
company reported 800 million in sales last year and expects to more 
than double that this year 
bruce davis president of mediagenic based in mountain view 
says nintendo has maintained its restrictive licensing procedure in 
a principled way 
they dont give anyone as much product as they want and they 
give some more than others but that have a rationale for what 
theyre doing said davis whose companies sells two 
nintendolicensed games super pitfall and ghostbusters 
davis was in redmond on monday to negotiate licenses for several 
new products 
nintendo is trying to control quality and overall inventory he 
said two areas that led to the collapse of the video game industry 
in the early 1980s after astonishing growth in the 1970s 
activision and atari were two of the biggest losers in the 
collapse atari games and atari inidiary foundered and eventually 
was sold and dividedwarner subsidiary foundered and eventually was 
sold and divided 
davis said mediagenic which posted 26 million in sales and 
500000 in profits in the first six months this fiscal year could 
have sold more nintendobased products if it were allowed 
but i cant complain the way nintendo has conducted business 
given the licensing arrangement he said i would prefer not to 
pay a licensing fee or to have them be the sole source manufacturer 
but i dont think its in our interest now to challenge it

dana milner believes the future of 
trucking is installed in the cab of his 18wheeler 
along with his cb radio radar detector and several pinetree 
shaped air fresheners milner rides with a computer device linking 
him via satellite to his home base in ontario 
its a pretty handy gizmo said milner 27 a leased driver 
for frederick transport ltd of dundas ontario its what 
trucking of tomorrow is all about 
milner no longer must call general motors corp every four hours 
to give the progress of his three weekly trips from ontario to 
baltimore with roof supports for gm vans 
a geostar corp satellite orbiting 22000 miles above earth 
automatically tracks milners progress and relays the information 
through a ground station to a frederick transport dispatcher 
milner also can send messages with a keyboard if he is stuck in 
traffic has engine trouble or needs emergency help 
id say five years from now youre going to see every major 
trucker in the united states and canada using it said milner who 
has been a truck driver for the past six years 
a us commerce department report issued in may estimated annual 
mobile satellite services revenues could reach 150 million to 200 
million worldwide by 1992 and 1 billion or more by 1995 
in the united states more than 135000 units could be in 
operation by the end of 1990 according to the report space 
commerce an industry assessment 
costs for the units now more than 3000 are expected to drop 
below 500 apiece in coming years 
the justintime delivery system now favored by the automotive 
and other industries has broadened he need for improved 
communication between dispatchers and truckers said edward k 
morlok a university of pennsylvania professor of transportation 
under justintime delivery manufacturers get parts when they 
are needed for assembly instead of constantly keeping large parts 
inventories 
most dispatchers now must wait for a driver to call in before 
they can reroute a truck or learn if its delayed morlok said 
drivers in turn must find a telephone and often wait on hold for 
the dispatcher he said 
a 1985 survey published in motor carrier computer news showed 85 
percent of trucking companies used telephones to communicate with 
their drivers most of the remaining us companies among the 1134 
surveyed by the marketing research bureau inc used twoway radio 
geostar one of only two companies offering satellite 
communications began its tracking service in may 1987 added 
oneway data communication in june and plans to have twoway 
communication in january 
the publicly held washingtonbased company has 55 clients with 
1025 satellite transponders and orders for 7500 more said geostar 
spokeswoman joanne c devincent sales are expected to reach 12 
million this year she said 
most companies purchasing the 3300 to 3450 units made by sony 
or hughes corporations are in the longhaul trucking business but 
geostar also has sold its service to track planes trains and ships 
ms devincent said 
in 1992 geostar plans to launch a satellite designed to 
calculate a vehicles relative distance to another vehicle to within 
5 meters for use as a collision avoidance system 
qualcomm inc a privately held san diegobased company in june 
began offering a satellite tracking and twoway data communication 
system called omnitracs said richard beyer the systems marketing 
and sales vice president 
qualcomm has sold the system to 17 trucking companies and some 
43 other companies have expressed interest in the 4100 units 
which qualcomm manufactures 
qualcomms anticipated annual sales are 70 million for the 
fiscal year ending sept 30 1989 beyer said 
morlok said satellites also can track the progress of valuable or 
hazardous cargo monitor the temperature of a refrigerated truck and 
send electronic signals from the engine 
american mobile satellite consortium an eightcompany consortium 
organized in may wants to give truckers and their dispatchers voice 
communication as well 
the consortium plans in the next five years to launch a satellite 
capable of transmitting voice communication anywhere in the country 
said john d kiesling president of mobile satellite corp in 
malvern one of the companies in the consortium 
frederick transport has outfitted about 125 of its 620 truck 
tractors with satellite systems and hopes to outfit all of them by 
april 1989 said frank dunton marketing director 
its a terrific planning tool because were able to use it to 
plan utilization of our trucks dunton said he also said it cuts 
the related telephone bills in half

holly farms corp misled tyson foods inc 
in an effort to thwart the poultry giants hostile takeover bid for 
its smaller rival an attorney for tyson foods argued tuesday in 
delaware chancery court 
memphis tennbased holly farms the fifthlargest poultry 
producer in the country has rejected two takeover offers from 
tyson based in springdale ark and the nations top poultry 
producer 
holly farms board of directors saying tysons latest offer was 
not in the best interest of shareholders said last week it would 
proceed with a proposed merger with conagra inc of omaha neb 
both deals are valued at about 1 billion 
the merger agreement which has yet to be approved by the 
companies shareholders would allow conagra to purchase key assets 
of holly farms if the deal fails to go through 
tyson processes about 2 billion to 22 billion of the 
readytocook chicken that is raised in the united states 
conagra a diversified company produces about 15 billion pounds 
a year and holly farms processes 12 billion pounds 
the three companies handle about 30 percent of the readytocook 
chicken market 
tyson went to chancery court seeking a preliminary injunction 
that would block the conagra merger attorneys said after tuesdays 
hearing that chancery court vice chancellor maurice hartnett was not 
expected to rule on the injunction until later in the week 
in rejecting tysons latest offer holly farms rejected a bid 
that would have given shareholders 53 per share plus a 
quartershare of tyson stock for each holly farms share traded 
holly farms has about 20 million shares outstanding 
tyson said the cash and stock offer was worth 57 a share to 
holly farms stockholders 
in trading tuesday holly farms rose 62 cents a share to 5425 
on the new york stock exchange while tyson rose 62 cents a share 
to 1675 in overthecounter trading 
in its request for the injunction tyson argued that the 
stockholders right to the best price was not enforced by holly 
farms board of directors attorneys claimed the board was 
influenced by holly farms managers who were unfriendly to tyson 
a tyson takeover likely would lead to top management changes at 
holly farms while the conagra merger would not industry observers 
say 
the directors concern was not to get the best price for the 
stockholders but to get the best defense against tyson tyson 
attorney rodman ward said 
holly farms failed to get the best offer because it did not press 
tyson for a better one while negotiations were under way with 
conagra ward said 
at one point during the negotiations ward said a holly farms 
representative said tyson could be bidding against itself although 
at that time the board was on the verge of an agreement with conagra 
ward called that an intentional deception of tyson 
but holly farms attorney steven m barna said tyson knew conagra 
was a rival 
tyson publicly disclosed it had begun takeover discussions with 
holly farms in october and mentioned conagra in bank documents that 
month as a potential competitor barna said 
the terms of bids by conagra the nations secondlargest chicken 
producer and tyson required complete secrecy barna said 
what they wanted was to have been told who was out there but 
they couldnt have been under rules established by all parties 
barna said 
the process was to get the best offer by giving them no 
information barna said 
bruce mcnew an attorney representing shareholders asked the 
court to require open bidding between the two companies

the national association of securities dealers 
has expelled a bankrupt new york investment firm suspended its 
expresident and punished five former brokers for stock 
manipulation the selfregulatory organization said tuesday calling 
it a flagrant fraud that victimized investors 
the disciplinary action against rooney pace inc and the six 
individuals capped a 2year investigation into questionable dealings 
in american educational computer inc an overthecounter security 
that the firm encouraged clients to buy aggressively based on 
misleading information the stock subsequently tumbled under 
mysterious circumstances 
these are serious sanctions john pinto nasd vice president 
for compliance said in a telephone interview from the associations 
washington headquarters we went after the individuals who were 
active in the security and put them out of business for awhile 
the nasd runs the us electronic market for overthecounter 
stocks and is the selfregulatory authority for firms that make 
markets in these securities expulsion and suspension are among its 
most powerful disciplinary tools 
although the sanctions wont have any practical impact on rooney 
pace because it is not active in the securities business anyway 
they could lead to more serious securities and exchange commission 
penalties against the individuals 
in a press statement the nasd said rooney pace was expelled 
from nasd membership fined 50000 and censured randolph pace its 
former president was fined 100000 suspended from assocation with 
any nasd member for two years and suspended from association with 
any nasd member in a supervisory role for an additional five years 
the nasd also said joe p foor of norman okla a senior vice 
president of the firm and coy e dean its oklahoma city branch 
office manager were each censured fined 50000 and barred from 
association with an nasd member 
lesser sanctions were imposed on daniel dispigno a rooney pace 
trader from smithtown ny and terry l rogers and thomas c 
henry registered representatives with the firms oklahoma city 
office 
a person answering the telephone at rooney paces new york 
office said nobody was available to comment and that the whereabouts 
of its current president arnold weinberg were unclear 
rooney pace once had 14 offices nationwide and was ranked as the 
81st largest brokerage specializing in underwriting securities of 
startup companies 
it unsuccessfully sought a merger with another investment group 
in late 1986 and intensifying financial trouble subsequently pushed 
it into bankruptcy court proceedings 
the nasd sanctions were not the first time rooney pace was named 
in a fraud investigation in june 1986 it was charged by the sec 
with participating in a stock manipulation scheme that the 
enforcement agency said netted more than 4 million in illegal 
profits

trustees for the estate of national enquirer 
publisher generoso pope jr on tuesday announced the splashy 
supermarket tabloid is for sale 
pope who died oct 2 of a heart attack at his beachfront home 
built the chronicle of ufos and celebrities woes from a small new 
york tabloid to a glitzy weekly with a 45 million circulation 
the terms of his trust allow for the enquirer and its sister 
tabloid the weekly world news to be sold when practical said 
jerome s traum one of three trustees for the estate the other 
trustees are peter p peterson a new york investment banker and 
citibank 
a price for the tabloid was not disclosed but an adviser to 
british media mogul robert maxwell was quoted in tuesdays wall 
street journal as saying that the enquirer is a 400 million 
newspaper 
traum said they decided to sell the enquirer after they became 
aware of the tremendous interest in the paper however despite 
many indications of interest there had been no negotiations 
yet he said 
we expect that all the major media players will probably be 
involved in the selection of the final purchaser traum said 
but newspaper industry analyst edward atorino of smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york said the fear of being tainted by the 
enquirers scandalsheet image most likely would prevent major media 
companies from bidding 
although the enquirer flourished it has been the target of 
several celebrity suits carol burnett won 800000 in a 1981 suit 
for libel 
the sale of the enquirer and the weekly world news with 11 
million readers will be handled by the blackstone group a new york 
investment banking firm chaired by peterson and at least one other 
investment banking firm 
following popes death the enquirers president and editor ian 
calder was named chairman of gp group which owns the tabloids
