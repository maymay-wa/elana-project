the estranged wife of a man accused in two fatal 
mail bombings has pleaded guilty in a related witnesstampering 
case an atlanta newspaper reported in its wednesday editions 
susan moody 28 is cooperating with government prosecutors in 
their case against walter moody jr the atlanta 
journalconstitution said 
moody was charged earlier this month in the mail bombings of 
federal appeals judge robert vance in alabama and civil rights 
activist robert robinson in savannah ga last december 
mrs moody entered the guilty plea nov 10 before us district 
judge anthony alaimo the paper quoted people close to the 
investigation as saying alaimo sealed records of the proceeding 
and his action prohibits participants from even acknowledging 
whether a hearing took place 
walter and susan moody were indicted in july on 13 counts of 
obstruction of justice bribery and witness tampering 
they are accused of threatening two women who had been paid to 
provide a fake alibi for moody during his efforts to overturn a 
1972 bombpossession conviction the women were considering 
changing their story 
both moody and his wife originally entered innocent pleas in 
that case but mrs moody changed her plea to guilty the 
journalconstitution reported 
moody is being held without bond in the atlanta federal 
penitentiary mrs moody who has filed for divorce is living with 
her parents in dekalb county 
as moodys wife when the alleged crimes occurred it is mrs 
moodys choice whether to invoke spousal immunity from testifying 
lawyers said 
in a related development a florida man who had been holding 
three footlockers for moody that contained diagrams for a remote 
control bomb was denied bail monday 
the footlockers found at the home of ted banks of titusville 
whom agents described as a close friend of moodys also contained 
five weapons a book with bomb formulas three pieces of pipe and 
several metal rods 
banks 63 was arrested friday on charges of receiving weapons 
while being a convicted felon 
us magistrate donald dietrich denied the bond request saying 
there was enough evidence that banks was involved with the crimes 
of violence currently under investigation

the government plans to prosecute british rail on 
criminal charges for a train wreck in south london that killed 35 
people two years ago officials said 
allan green director of public prosecutions decided in may 
that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges 
against the stateowned rail line or any of its employees 
but tuesday the department of transport said the board that 
runs the network was being served summonses under the health and 
safety act that allege it criminally failed to take all practical 
steps to ensure safety 
on dec 12 1988 an express train on its way to central london 
from southern england crashed into the back of a stationary train 
at clapham in south london the driver of the stationary train had 
stopped to report a faulty signal in addition to those killed 
about 500 people were injured 
one summons alleged that by failing to provide effective 
signaling british rail did not ensure the safety of its employees 
a second summons alleged british rail failed to ensure passengers 
were not exposed to safety risks 
the battersea magistrates court in southwest london will meet 
jan 7 to decide if there is enough evidence to warrant trial 
it is far too early to say how the board will plead a rail 
board spokesman said we will have to examine the prosecution 
case in detail and speak to witnesses as well before commenting 
further 
lawyer sir anthony hidden found during a public inquiry last 
year that while rewiring signals in the area a technician had 
failed to cut back a small piece of old wire 
this interfered with new wiring causing the signal to flick 
from green to red and back again 
in september an inquest jury ruled the 35 were unlawfully 
killed 
british rail has admitted civil responsibility and paid out 
nearly 2 million in compensation in 300 cases so far

come on says mother wonderful have some 
cheesecake it wont kill you 
no one ever got cardiovascular disease from a sliver of 
cheesecake now and then says mother wonderful alias myra 
chanin dont eat cheesecake three times a day but when you do 
have it enjoy it to the max 
chanins book mother wonderfuls cheesecakes and other 
goodies first came out in 1982 and went out of print the second 
edition now is in its second printing 
chanin whose cheesecakes come in flavors like ginger pear 
mocha blanca and honey fig isnt surprised she sees good food as 
essential for marital bliss 
soft lights sweet music and diaphanous gowns may create an 
evenings diversion but comes the dawn and even casanova must 
eat she says in the books introduction 
professional bakers agree that cheesecakes havent lost their 
attraction 
were selling more than ever said janet rosing owner of 
cheesecakes by jr in chicago 
ms rosing estimates she sells more than five tons of cheesecake 
a week its fun to visualize isnt it she said 
nancy bier owner of miss grimble associates in new york says 
people think of cheesecake as something special 
when people want dessert and want to splurge they say lets 
have a piece of cheesecake everyone likes the flavor and the fact 
that its so rich 
miss grimbles has been in business for about 20 years and turns 
out about 50 different cakes and pies but mrs bier said 
cheesecake still is the no1 item 
the classic vanilla with a sour cream topping is the best 
seller she said 
several qualities come together to make a good cheesecake ms 
rosing said 
its a combination of creamy texture which is very 
satisfying and the flavors of the cream and the sweetness she 
said people feel theyre really getting value in cheesecake 
theres really something substantial there its not some light 
fluffy thing 
even a doctor from the american heart association went along 
somewhat with mother wonderfuls idea that a sliver of cheesecake 
once in a while isnt all that bad 
i would certainly agree with a sliver now and then but what 
does one call a sliver said dr alan chait chairman of the 
ahas nutrition committee and if you bake a whole cheesecake 
whos going to eat just a sliver 
chait a professor of medicine at the university of washington 
said the aha doesnt preach the idea of good or bad food 
the important thing is a persons total diet a diet that is 
low in saturated fat and cholesterol rather than the individual 
food he said 
both the ahas cookbook and mother wonderful offer lowfat 
cheesecake suggestions 
chanin also offers encouragement to the nervous cook 
cheesecake is the easiest dessert to make how did it get such 
an awesome reputation bakers lie when you find out how easy it is 
to make cheesecake youll stop paying 25 for theirs and start 
baking your own 
she thinks the problem is the oldfashioned ways of baking 
people are still using recipes that were created in 1850 
ovens then had no thermostats so theyd tell you to bake the cake 
in the oven for half an hour and leave them in the oven with the 
door ajar you couldnt leave the house 
then there are those recipes that tell you to put your 
cheesecake pan in a pan filled with boiling water i think that one 
was invented by johnson amp johnson to sell more bandaids theres 
no better way in the world to scald yourself 
theres none of that in this cookbook what chanin does offer is 
advice such as how to get that creamy custardlike texture 
since i never want to unwrap another package of cream cheese 
i pass on all my secrets to you she confides before introducing 
her ten commandments for making perfectly baked cheesecakes every 
time 
actually there are 17 commandments which chanin admits tends 
to prove her husbands contention that she is bossier than god 
among them 
thou shalt not chintz on ingredients 
thou shalt never defile thy crusts with graham cracker crumbs 
thou shalt never even think about using those gunky cornstarch 
toppings 
thou shalt measure out ingredients before beginning to bake 
thou shalt always add eggs to thy batter with thy mixer on the 
lowest speed 
she really means it about using the best ingredients 
the cost differential between a sublime cheesecake and a 
thirdrate one is less than 3 if money is a problem make an 
8inch version and serve petite wedges but always make sure anyone 
who tastes it will rave about your skill and beg for more 
 
here for thanksgiving is a recipe for pumpkinginger

tips for americas favorite celebration by anthony dias and 
kathryn k blue harper amp row 1990

queenslands dry hot weather is doing 
nothing absolutely nothing for the love life of the states 
crocodiles 
crocodile farmer john lever says the crocs mate once a year and 
depend on monsoon rains due around now 
but with the dry dry weather weve been having theres no 
stimulus at all the crocs are all sort of lying about in 
anticipatory glory theyve gone off their food and theyre 
listless some of the males are a bit tetchy and were all getting 
a bit anxious 
he said the farms passion indicator a frolicksome female 
nicknamed the old tart was stirred only faintly by a recent 
thunderstorm 
shes always the first one to be switched on but even she 
has hardly batted an eyelid lever said 
he said the croc exhibited some signs of arousal after the 
thunder and lightning stretching her neck and blowing bubbles in 
the water but she failed to draw any sign of interest from the 
males 
a heavy rain was needed he said 
otherwise males could miss out on the females peak onceayear 
fertility period and the eggs would be sterile 
like all farmers he said were really dependent on the 
weather

gloom has replaced the euphoria 
that enveloped czechoslovakias peaceful revolution a year ago 
economic worries abound and slovak nationalism threatens to split 
the country 
ordinary people are fearful without the economic security the 
old communist system provided economists forecast that 
unemployment and inflation will rise rapidly as the nation converts 
to capitalism 
president vaclav havel the former dissident playwright who 
personified the velvet revolution has acknowledged the 
national malaise 
a question is looming over this state whether it is dying due 
to its own faults he said in a television speech oct 28 the 
72nd anniversary of czechoslovakias birth we do not have too 
many reasons to be satisfied 
such national uncertainty has seldom been matched since the 
czechs and slovaks joined in 1918 after centuries of domination by 
the austrohungarian empire to create czechoslovakia 
the two nations were separated by the nazis during world war ii 
and afterward czechoslovakia spent 40 years as part of the soviet 
bloc 
now with the disintegration of the communist empire slovak 
separatism is resurgent and the threat of another separation has 
become real 
slovaks make up about onethird of the 155 million people and 
occupy the more rural eastern part of czechoslovakia under the 
centralized communist government nearly all slovak affairs were 
decided in prague the federal capital 
discord between czechs and slovaks seemed nonexistent a year 
ago they filled the streets together to bring down the old regime 
czechoslovaias revolution began nov 17 1989 when police 
brutally beat thousands of students demonstrating for more rapid 
democratic change of the kind that was transforming poland hungary 
and east germany 
the police brutality inspired street protests that toppled the 
communist party politburo seven days later before the end of the 
year havel and fellow dissidents were in power 
havel visited several countries in the ensuing months back 
home the mood remained euphoric with rising crime and increasing 
nationalism seen as relatively minor problems accompanying the 
revolution 
because about 5 million czechoslovaks were at least indirectly 
beholden to the communists the interim governments campaign 
against the party was not entirely successful 
in elections june 8 havels civic forum and public against 
violence its slovak sister organization won 57 percent of the 
vote the turnout was 97 percent 
the first economic shocks came after the elections food prices 
were raised gasoline prices went up 50 percent and train fares 
doubled disillusionment spread and many people had a sense of 
betrayal 
we disregard our everyday worries for the sake of discussing 
privatization leaving the spiritual values aside daniela 
kolarova an actress and member of parliament said earlier this 
year we keep hearing the argument that once the economy starts 
functioning there will be time for the soul 
slovak nationalists have held mass demonstrations for months in 
midnovember thousands of slovaks marched in bratislava capital 
of slovakia demanding secession they were angered by their 
regional governments efforts to reach agreement on power sharing 
with the czech and fed administrations 
some members of the slovak parliament also have demanded a 
separate nation 
the resurgent slovak separatism cast a cloud over the 72nd 
anniversary ceremonies and led havel to appeal for cooperation 
i believe our reason our sense of togetherness our 
responsibility culture as well as the instinct for 
selfpreservation will prevail he said in the televised address 
some people old enough to remember the two separate nations seem 
to be preparing for the memory to become reality again 
it just may be that the end of the communist excursion into 
history could bring the end of the czechoslovak experiment too 
a 78year old czech told a reporter who asked his opinion

every once in a while umberto bilisco used to 
disappear for a few hours into the attic his parents thought he 
was looking for a book but bilisco was on a secret mission 
working alone the young state employee would carefully set up 
sophisticated radio equipment as his parents placidly watched tv 
downstairs in their home in the northern city of trieste bilisco 
would practice calling the contacts he would need during a soviet 
bloc invasion 
bilisco was one of 622 italians who belonged to an 
anticommunist network recently exposed in europe set up by secret 
services in the 1950s in some cases with cia help it was 
coordinated through nato 
throughout western europe men and women like bilisco secretly 
trained for years in how to blow up bridges conduct secret radio 
conversations and organize a resistance movement in the event of 
invasion 
the organization in many cases is only being dismantled now 
i entered this organization with enthusiasm said bilisco 
now 64 here in trieste we had terrible moments after the war 
bilisco and a few dozen other members of the italian 
organization have been exposed by the press since prime minister 
giulio andreotti last month disclosed the existence of the group 
known as operation gladio 
those who agreed to interviews have described years of secrecy 
in which they were spirited off to military bases for training or 
contacted by strangers using code names 
several say they met us military officials during their 
training in the 1960s their reports contradict statements by some 
us officials that washington helped organize the units but had 
nothing to do with them after the 1950s 
like bilisco most say they joined gladio out of patriotism and 
fear of an invasion during the cold war 
today with things the way they are and the way gorbachev has 
changed europe theres no more need for a service of this kind 
said mattia passudetti 70 a former gladiator from udine 
but if conditions were the same as back then there would 
be 
operation gladio has caused an uproar in italy because of 
speculation by politicians and newspapers that it might be linked 
to a series of unsolved terrorist attacks in the 1960s and 1970s 
attributed to the right wing 
but the members of gladio named for the swords carried by 
roman gladiators deny such assertions 
all the things we learned were things that would help in a 
guerrilla movement in the case of war bilisco said in a 
telephone interview they never said anything about politics 
the italian gladiators received training at a base on the 
island of sardinia and at a military installation near rome 
according to the accounts periodically exercises were held in 
northern italy 
it was during such an exercise that gianmario pierantoni 60 
worked with american soldiers he said 
i only know that it was a group coming from vietnam the 
airborne cavalry pierantoni said in a telephone interview from 
verona 
we did a training exercise a vietcong type thing among 
the hills he said pierantoni practiced escorting people out 
through enemy lines during the 1965 exercise which involved four 
to five italians and a squad of americans he said 
passudetti said two american military men as well as some 
french and germanspeaking officers observed his training exercise 
in september 1962 
unlike the others bilisco said he worked only with italians 
the state landsurveyor entered gladio in 1960 at the invitation 
of an old school friend he said 
i joined on condition it was an organization recognized by the 
state he said he assured me it was 
bilisco took a fourmonth night course at a local school to 
learn how to communicate by radio then during a twoyear period 
a mysterious instructor who seemed to be a police officer came to 
trieste frequently to train him further 
the lifelong bachelor went to a military base near rome three 
times for instruction with others whom he knew only by their first 
names the last session was in 1980 
the group also held a practice exercise in the mountains near 
bergamo in northern italy he said 
my job was to receive messages and transmit the organizational 
plans he said we simulated a guerrilla situation when a 
plane passed over we had to hide 
bilisco has no regrets about his years in the secret 
organization 
if by chance during the training i learned that there was 
something fishy i would have resigned immediately he said i 
saw it was legal secret but of the state

but just in case the us military has 600000 prepackaged 
turkey dinners stashed in a warehouse 
since midaugust chief warrant officer wes wolf has been 
preoccupied with trying to provide american servicemen a holiday 
meal that will remind them of moms home cooking 
for the 42yearold major domo of military cuisine that means 
fresh food rather than prepackaged tvstyle tray rations known as 
trats in militaryspeak 
ive only got one unit thats going to eat trats and i think 
im going to be able to get them fresh rations he said about 
230000 soldiers are going to be eating fresh rations 
for five days now wolf has been overseeing the distribution of 
thanksgiving dinner courses from three huge warehouses staffed by 
the 123rd supply and service company from alabama national guard 
supply officers from 139 different military units from 15 
people to 35000 in size have been arriving to pick up ingredients 
ranging from shrimp cocktail to afterdinner nuts and happy 
thanksgiving banners 
tuesday was the day for salad fixings vegetables half a dozen 
varieties of fruit 45000 pies in five flavors whipped cream and 
bread 
thanksgiving may be american but the ingredients for dinner are 
as international as the multinational force deployed here following 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the 60000 pounds of rolled boneless turkey from the united 
states and 2000 whole turkeys from saudi arabia each weighing 15 
to 20 pounds have already been picked up by units scattered around 
the country and are being prepared for the roasting pans 
because saudi arabia is a moslem country which forbids the 
eating of pork the us military has cut pork products from its 
menus but wolf said he decided to make an exception for 
thanksgiving and include ham shipped from the united states 
there will be plenty of other american contributions shrimps 
mashed potatoes stuffing cranberry sauce fruit cake and pumpkin 
pecan and mince meat pies 
but the roast beef is from saudi arabia the cherry and apple 
pies from germany the grapes from lebanon the oranges from 
brazil and the tomatoes and vegetables from lebanon turkey and 
syria 
ehad kamal general manager of sanad trading cold storage where 
the produce is kept said he ordered 25000 cartons of bananas from 
the philippines and honduras each with 90 bananas which means 
every man and woman in the military here will be getting five 
bananas 
too many bananas he said with a laugh 
the military also printed 230000 souvenir menus featuring a 
turkey on the cover and president bushs thanksgiving message 
inside 
bush will be dining on the same food as the troops when he flies 
in for thanksgiving dinner wolf said 
there is no frontline combat version of thanksgiving dinner 
known as an mre or mealreadytoeat that comes in a bag and is 
usually eaten cold but wolf ordered holiday trats so units 
without kitchens could still have a hot meal 
weve got units coming in every night and i just wanted to 
make sure that on thanksgiving if a soldier showed up in saudi 
arabia id be able to give him some turkey some cranberry sauce 
some mashed potatoes he said 
two people helped wolf plan dinner and 160 others worked on it 
ive fed up to 30000 soldiers at one time but never this 
many so its been really tough he said but were in good 
shape with everything 
with all troops expected to eat fresh food known in 
militaryspeak as arations wolf will have plenty of holiday trats 
for christmas and holidays next year if need be 
after thanksgiving dinner with troops in the desert wolf said 
he plans to get a good nights sleep and then get back to work on 
christmas dinner 
the rangy warrant officer from monterey calif nicknamed 
santa claus by maj gen william gus pagonis the us 
armys logistics chief said he started on christmas two weeks 
after he began thanksgiving preparations 
ive just had to double my figures for christmas because were 
bringing some more troops in he said

after being grounded half a year 
columbia appeared headed for an early december liftoff with an 
observatory despite scientists pleas that nasa wait another week 
for better viewing 
the space agency turned its attention to columbia after atlantis 
ended a secret military mission tuesday with the first shuttle 
landing at kennedy space center in five years 
columbia is expected to blast off around dec 2 with the 150 
million astro observatory on a mission that has been on hold since 
may because of hydrogen leaks scientists however are pushing for 
a launch on dec 10 or so 
the science will be much better if its a few days later 
said mission scientist ted gull 
certain objects of extreme interest like the brightest visible 
quasar wont be as close to the sun in middecember and will thus 
be more distinguishable 
also there will be a full moon dec 2 and an astronomy mission 
should take place under a dark sky gull said 
because of the delays in getting columbia off the ground 
weve always jokingly said its going to be a full moon when 
the shuttle finally goes up gull said 
nasa officials are expected to set a launch date after a review 
on tuesday it will be the fifth countdown since may for the 
mission originally scheduled for 1986 but delayed until this year 
by the challenger accident 
columbias seven astronauts four of them astronomers are eager 
to get going they will work around the clock in shifts during the 
10day flight the first shuttle mission in five years devoted 
entirely to scientific research 
were going to be the best trained crew youve flown 
mission commander vance brand jokingly told shuttle directors 
recently 
bascom murrah in charge of columbias prelaunch operations 
said that when the shuttle finally lifts off i dont know if im 
going to cry or dance or feel relieved 
columbias leaks were much more extensive than those plaguing 
atlantis workers replaced columbias hydrogen lines and installed 
new seals both shuttles were found to be free of dangerous leaks 
during a fueling test last month 
scientists have been working seven days a week since columbias 
latest launch delay in midseptember to revise the observing 
schedule 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope 
will probe about 240 highenergy objects including galaxies and a 
supernova 
one observation is planned of comet levy which is on its way 
out of the solar system and less visible than it was in september 
halleys comet was among astros targets when the mission was 
scheduled for 1986 astronomers planned to study comet austin if 
columbia had gone up in may 
every time we try to plan a mission with a comet that mission 
has been postponed were beginning to wonder if its our 
nemesis gull said 
he joked theres not a bright one coming in december so we 
can go

zachariah toungate is a typical 
8yearold hunting for rocks and playing with teenage mutant ninja 
turtles and his grades are excellent 
but his school says zach is a disciplinary problem because he 
refuses to cut his 7inch ponytail and confines him to a 
10by13foot isolation room all day 
his parents are backing him up 
for more than six weeks zach has been parting with his 
thirdgrade classmates when they get off the bus at mina elementary 
school and stepping into what school officials call an 
alternative education setting 
the room has two windows facing into a bigger classroom but 
they are covered 
to zach it is a prison that has given him nightmares about 
being trapped in a room that shrinks until it crushes him 
they put me in jail so why shouldnt we put them in jail 
he says of school officials 
zach is taught alone his mother grandmother and aunt take 
turns going to school and eating with him because he is not allowed 
in the lunchroom 
his parents september and stanley toungate were told the 
ponytail did not comply with the schools dress code 
i like the way my hair is i think the rule stinks because 
girls can have long hair and boys cant zach said monday 
mrs toungate said she offered to pin the ponytail up or even 
have zach wear a shorthaired wig aside from the ponytail zach 
has a crew cut 
ive tried to compromise with them in every way she said 
all i want for my children is to go to a school in a place that 
doesnt discriminate 
the toungates appealed to the school board and it refused to 
budge they took their case to state district court claiming 
sexual discrimination 
the judge denied a temporary injunction that would have returned 
zach to the classroom and back into the choir and art classes he 
misses the toungates attorney charles beall said they will 
appeal to the 3rd court of appeals 
i told zach that if this is ever too much of a problem we 
will drop it beall said he says no i dont want to cut 
it 
zach is taught by substitute teachers he makes excellent 
grades but would rather be with his classmates occasionally 
another student is sent to the room for detention but they 
eventually leave zach remains 
school superintendent paul fleming said zachs case has gained 
more attention then it deserves 
its a matter that has a rather simple solution the mother 
has a right to try and get a policy changed the logical solution 
would be to get the youngster in compliance with the dress code and 
then pursue her battle fleming said 
one of the things that students have to learn is that there 
are rules and regulations in life that you may not necessarily 
agree with but you have to live with he said 
mrs toungate who grew up in a military family says she 
understands some rules are tough to abide by but adds that she has 
learned you are an american first and the rest of it doesnt 
matter 
ironically mrs toungate who is studying to be nurse and her 
auto mechanic husband moved 30 miles from austin to this town of 
5700 people so that zach and his 5yearold sister linzi could 
benefit from the country lifestyle 
now they have become the focus of attention 
mrs toungate said some parents side with her saying the 
schools dress code is ridiculous but she said others accuse her 
of trying to usurp school rules 
i want rules children need rules my children have rules at 
my home i want rules that apply to all students ms toungate 
said

the fun was over practically before it 
started when a couple who had entered a threeway contest to see 
who could be the first to conceive was declared the winner after 
just one week 
james and lisa machamer of des moines will get a 1000 savings 
bond a crib and six months of diaper service as winners of the 
breeders cup promotion sponsored by radio station krnq another 
prize will arrive in nine months 
positive results from a home pregnancy test taken on friday were 
confirmed by a doctor monday said krnq sales manager scott 
schubert 
i dont think the contest made any difference we didnt do 
anything different said mrs machamer 22 thats the first 
question everybody wants to know 
the machamers and two other couples were among about 20 who 
responded to the stations invitation to participate in the 
breeders cup which was open to married couples without children 
the three couples were chosen by lot 
the contestants agreed to talk about their experiences on the 
radio each friday schubert said the promotion was one of the 
hottest ever at the station 
schubert said the station didnt receive any complaints about 
making public the usually private trying part of conceiving 
if its done with taste you can do it he said 
mrs machamer said the publicity far exceeded her expectations 
and i dont know if we would have done it if we had known ahead 
of time 
she said she didnt do much talking on the radio 
it was a little embarrassing she said

when the us marines practice 
war they also practice treating and transporting the wounded 
a mock invasion wouldnt be real without mock casualties 
it does bring back the reality of the whole thing said 
capt robert chaney who is responsible for all of the marines 
medical assets in saudi arabia people get hurt occasionally 
they die we have to learn to handle both 
the marines hav a saying we fight the way we train well we 
treat patients the way we practice chaney said 
even though the amphibious portion of imminent thunder was 
called off monday because of 14foot seas the marines held mass 
casualty drills involving about 80 simulated wounded at five field 
hospitals 
twenty patients were flown by helicopter to foxtrot co surgical 
support the northernmost of the field hospitals 
stretcher bearers scrambled into action after a siren wailed 
they carried the incoming through clouds of powdery sand kicked up 
by helicopter blades practicing skills the way an infantryman 
practices with a rifle 
practice dying said lance cpl jimmy o hall of atlanta 
one of the mock casualties brought to the emergency room 
it took just 20 minutes for the first marine to pass from triage 
to preop to one of five operating rooms theres probably not an 
emergency room in the states that can beat that time chaney 
said 
no matter how much surgeons work on being prepared nothing can 
ready them for the carnage theyll see if real war breaks out 
according to lt cmdr chris kain of bremerton wash 
kain one of four orthopedic surgeons at foxtrot said even the 
knifings and the shootings he treated from the drug wars in us 
emergency rooms cant compare with the killing tools assembled in 
war 
were going to be overwhelmed kain said were used to 
seeing those kinds of wounds but not at such huge huge volumes 
none of us has encountered this tremendous volume 
he described surgery under such conditions this way its fast 
and dirty we used to call it slash and dash are we scared 
absolutely can we handle it yes 
for the marines brought here as part of their training the 
experience of makebelieve wounds was unsettling 
war could start tomorrow i always have that in the back of my 
mind said lance cpl richard flores 20 of anaheim calif 
he had a simulated broken arm and he said from his stretcher 
i hope if we do go to combat i dont see this place again 
doctors take the drills very seriously according to lt cmdr 
steve meister of san diego who runs the triage operation 
we dont want anybody to die because of something we didnt 
do he said 
the field hospital which has fewer than 100 beds but can be 
expanded is lacking in amenities 
the triage floor is desert sand operating rooms and intensive 
care units are under green canvas tents covered with camouflage 
netting the dust kicked up in the desert sometimes settles on 
medical equipment 
you dont have to have tile walls and beautiful furniture to 
make a hospital chaney said 
but there is a sobering reminder of what can happen one tent at 
the hospital is designated as the morgue two corpsmen have 
volunteered to work there 
yes we have a morgue that bottom line is thats a reality of 
war chaney said hopefully well have very few of those war 
is still war

a building construction site in downtown 
washington caved in monday night and firefighters tried to 
determine if anyone was trapped in the hole 
three construction trailers and a van parked on the sidewalk on 
in the street adjacent to the site tumbled into the cavity at 14th 
and h streets northwest two blocks north of the national press 
club and four blocks from the white house fire officials said 
fire chief ray alfred told reporters we think we may have 
seen some movement in the hole with a device designed to detect 
body heat 
but it was not certain that anyone was trapped alfred said an 
employee of the contractor told firefighters he was the last person 
to leave the site 
special teams were readied to descend into the hole on ropes as 
officials sought to determine whether the site was vulnerable to 
further collapse 
the fire department ordered the evacuation of an office building 
next to the excavation containing the headquarters of united press 
international said department spokesman ted holmes 
there is still some movement of soil holmes said pointing 
to a fire hydrant next to the eacuated building 
the subsurface pipe feeding the hydrant was bare but until 
1120 pm nearly three hours after the cavein the pipe had been 
surrounded with earth 
the square excavation appeared to be about 30 yards on a side 
and workers said it was four stories deep darkness and the 
distance spectators were kept from the site prevented detailed 
observation of the rubble inside 
fire officials said the 830 pm cavein apparently was set off 
by the vibrations of a faulty transformer whose spectacular arcing 
could be seen for blocks 
it lit up the whole sky said one construction worker who 
would not give his name 
service was suspended on a subway line running past the area 
with trains turning back at nearby stations on either side buses 
were called to carry passengers between the metro center and 
farragut west stations 
the subway line was in no danger officials rather they feared 
the effect of vibrations from passing trains 
one man was killed in another cavein at the site earlier this 
year

the us economy will no longer get 10 
billion a month in investments from japan germany and other 
nations because they now need the money at home specialists say 
but the money will be less needed here because the federal 
budget deficit is going down and fewer us bonds will need to be 
sold to foreigners the specialists said monday at a meeting of the 
institute for international economics a private study group 
americans are earning more foreign money by selling goods abroad 
because the dollar has declined in value and made the us goods 
attractive for foreigners to buy 
some of the foreign money has gone into such projects as the 
japanese purchase of rockefeller center in new york and made for 
bad feeling between the two countries the japanese had to buy the 
dollars needed for that purchase and many others by selling yen 
americans needed the yen to pay for goods they bought in japan 
as americans sell more goods they will have more yen at their 
disposal 
the need for foreign funds could rise if war starts in the 
persian gulf at a cost estimated as high as 30 billion a month 
said rudolph g penner a former director of the congressional 
budget office 
otherwise penner saw the current slowdown in business as a 
short one although the recovery sluggish if major companies have 
trouble finding the new capital they will need 
robert d hormats a former assistant secretary of state said 
japan and germany will be using more of their money at home 
japanese banks are having problems because the prices of stocks and 
real estate have gone down he explained japan is also under 
international pressure to spend less abroad and more on increasing 
its own peoples living standards 
the estimated cost of german unification has now gone up to 
140 billion marks about 95 billion hormats said probably 
itll go up again 
he agreed with penner that war in the gulf would bring economic 
and well as human and political problems war has a voracious 
appetite for capital said hormats who is vice chairman of 
goldman sachs international a leading investment bank 
william r cline a senior fellow at the economics institute 
said the us need for foreign money has declined because the drop 
in the value of the dollar has made us exports more attractive 
and brought in more cash slower growth for the united states as a 
whole slows down imports and the outflow of money to pay for them 
he noted

postal unions pay raise demands would cost 
50 billion over the next three years and raise the price of stamps 
to 43 cents according to a top postal service negotiator 
we dont take it as a very serious proposal theyre in a 
fantasy land assistant postmaster general david charters said 
monday noting that the services annual budget is 40 billion 
the postal service and its four largest unions which together 
represent 660000 workers were working against a deadline of 
midnight tonight to reach a compromise for a new contract 
moe biller president of the american postal workers union said 
postal service officials are the ones who are not in the real 
world he said management always predicts huge stamp increases 
during contract bargaining to win the publics support 
they predicted a 50cent stamp in 1981 it never happened 
biller said stamps now cost 25 cents 
if no agreement is reached by midnight tonight the two sides 
could agree to continue talks or allow the federal mediation and 
conciliation service to appoint a neutral arbitrator 
under federal law it is illegal for postal workers to strike 
the postal service is offering a twoyear contract that provides 
cash bonuses of 450 the first year and 500 the second year in 
addition the postal service would implement a pay incentive plan 
in which workers could receive bonuses of up to 1100 a year if 
their divisions met certain customer satisfaction and budget goals 
managements plan would provide cost of living increases only if 
inflation rose more than 4 percent for instance if inflation rose 
6 percent workers would get a 2 percent raise so far this year 
the governments inflation gauge has risen 67 percent 
biller whose union has 334000 members has called managements 
offer of cash bonuses but no hourly wage increases a piece of 
garbage designed to pit worker against worker 
biller said the union would reject the postal services offer of 
no cost of living increase before a 4 percent inflation rate 
letter carriers and clerks receive a starting salary of about 
24000 and can earn up to about 31500 employees receive an 
additional 8560 in benefits and premium pay 
the service no longer subsidized by taxpayers must break even 
over time its board of governors has proposed raising the cost of 
mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring 
despite the huge gap in the two sides positions charters and 
biller said they were optimistic a deal could be struck by tonight 
the other unions negotiating are the national letter carriers 
union with 234000 members the national postal mail handlers 
union which represents 50000 mail handlers and the national 
rural letter carriers association with about 42000 members

a top aide to retiring teamsters president 
william mccarthy says he was fired because he decided to run for 
the presidency himself rather than back mccarthys choice for a 
successor 
walter shea a 34year teamsters veteran said monday that 
mccarthy fired him on friday after he told mccarthy he would seek 
the unions top post in next years governmentsupervised 
elections 
the firing has brought new turmoil to the union prompting 
complaints that mccarthy is trying to manipulate the election 
which was ordered by the justice department as part of the 
settlement of its massive civil racketeering suit against the 
union 
next years election will be the first in the teamsters 87year 
history in which rankandfile members vote for union leaders 
mccarthy is on a vendetta he is on a seekanddestroy 
mission he would destroy the entire international union just to 
get his way said jack cox a teamsters vice president from los 
angeles who has been at odds with mccarthy 
phone calls to mccarthys spokesman were not returned 
cox said he believes that mccarthy who decided to retire for 
health reasons fired shea because shea refused to back mccarthys 
handanointed candidate rv durham of north carolina 
shea a teamsters vice president who has served every union 
president since jimmy hoffa said that after he told mccarthy he 
was running for president mccarthy advised me to clean out my 
desk because youre not loyal to me 
the job from which mccarthy was fired paid about 75000 a year 
he will continue to receive his vice presidential salary of about 
75000 
at a teamsters board meeting last month mccarthy announced he 
would retire citing personal reasons that prompted a majority of 
the board with mccarthys approval to endorse durham a union 
vice president as the candidate to replace mccarthy 
the december 1991 elections were agreed to by the union board 
last year as part of the settlement of a massive civil racketeering 
suit brought by the justice department over the last several 
months courtappointed officers have moved to oust local union 
leaders still accused of organized crime ties 
the elections will be secret ballot voting by the 16 million 
union members in previous elections only union leaders got to

barely two weeks in office the prime 
ministers of india and pakistan meet on wednesday in the first 
toplevel contact in two years between their antagonistic 
neighboring nations 
the timing of their meeting at a summit conference of the south 
asia association of regional cooperation so soon after each took 
office is a coincidence no one expects them to start tackling the 
problems which last spring brought their countries to the brink of 
their fourth war in 43 years 
chandra shekhar was installed as prime minister in new delhi on 
nov 10 after the government of vp singh collapsed 
nawaz sharif took office in pakistan three days earlier 
following the ouster of the benazir bhutto government and a general 
election 
the threeday summit brings together two men with no experience 
in foreign affairs who are preoccupied with domestic politics and 
with their still unsettled governments 
under the rules of the association it does not deal with 
bilateral issues officials of both countries also say corridor 
diplomacy will be minimal with neither side ready to get into 
tough questions 
but the encounter could lead to a resumption of talks on 
reducing tensions along the frontier which saw the two armies 
mobilized for war last april 
it can happen that we will be authorized to meet again said 
indias senior diplomat muchkund dubey 
the talks initiated through us diplomacy were interrupted by 
the political upheavals in islamabad and new delhi two previous 
sessions in july and august produced no visible gains 
the differences between us are fundamental and substantive we 
are dealing with big big issues said a pakistani diplomat 
speaking on condition he not be identified 
the latest flareup was over the province of kashmir moslem 
militants there are seeking to splinter off from hindudominated 
india either to join islamic pakistan or to become independent 
the longsimmering insurgency exploded into a guerrilla war in 
january since then more than 1550 people have been killed and 
economic activity has halted in what was once a highly popular 
tourist spot 
india accuses pakistan of supplying arms and training to the 
insurgents and helping them slip across the mountainous frontier 
pakistan denies actively aiding the guerrillas but supports 
their cause diplomatically it also suspects india of stirring up 
troubles in its own sind province 
previous talks failed because india limited them to practical 
steps toward confidencebuilding and pakistan wanted to discuss 
the underlying issue of the political future of jammu and kashmir 
state 
the two armies frequently traded artillery fire during the 
summer both sides dismissed the incidents as minor 
the south asian association was formed six years ago ostensibly 
to promote regional projects and economic cooperation it was also 
a forum for the small countries to band together against what they 
saw as indian domination 
its concrete achievements are meager an antiterrorism 
convention a draft agreement on harmonizing narcotics laws and 
the lifting of visa requirements for supreme court justices and 
members of parliaments 
the conference comes at an unsettled time for all members except 
the maldives a string of 1190 idyllic coral islands south of 
india with 200000 people the other six nations represent 
onefifth of the worlds population and are among the poorest 
countries each is in transition 
president r premadasa of sri lanka declined to attend the 
summit saying he could not leave as long as the ethnic war 
continues between the dominant sinhalese and the minority tamils 
who want their own homeland 
the war has claimed 14000 lives in the last seven years 
bangladeshs president former army gen mohamed hussain ershad 
is facing a renewed challenge from opposition groups demanding his 
resignation ershad seized power in 1982 his foes say the three 
elections that kept him in office were rigged they want him out 
before the presidential vote due next year 
king birendra of nepal yielded this spring to a popular uprising 
for democracy which killed at least 300 people this month he 
promulgated a new constitution relinquishing his absolute power 
bhutans king jigme singye wangchuk is trying to preserve his 
countrys culture in the face of pressures from nepalese 
immigrants who dislike laws demanding that they adopt bhutanese 
dress and language reports from the himalayan kingdom speak of 
dozens killed in clashes with police and of kidnapping by nepalese 
dissidents 
indian political analyst bhabani sen gupta wrote in new delhi 
that stability in each country is a prerequisite for raising the 
region from the economic and social basement 
if the summit can cool down narrow nationalist and 
sectarian passions he said it will have made its name in the 
history of south asia

bankers are getting increasingly cautious 
about making loans particularly to commercial real estate 
developers but also to other corporate borrowers and home buyers a 
federal reserve board survey finds 
compared with a similar poll three months earlier the latest 
survey generally painted a picture of increased credit restraint 
with agencies and branches of foreign banks reporting more 
tightening than domestic banks the central bank said monday 
the pullback was least evident in consumer and home mortgage 
lending and was clearest in commercial real estate lending a 
category for which a large majority of respondents continued to 
raise their credit standards it said 
the october survey of senior loan officers at 60 large banks 
comes as bush administration officials are showing growing concern 
that a shortage of credit is deepening the economic downturn 
financial institutions and some borrowers have complained for 
months that bank and savings and loan examiners have overreacted to 
the thrift crisis by discouraging even sound loans the regulators 
however say they are only urging prudence in response to the 
weaker economy 
president bush met with top administration officials on the 
situation last week chief of staff john sununu commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher and budget director richard darman reportedly said 
the examiners should ease up while treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and fed chairman alan greenspan argued that the closer 
scrutiny of lending is appropriate 
there perhaps have been some regulators that have been 
overzealous at times said michael boskin bushs chief economic 
adviser 
we need to make sure they are prudent and do enforce the 
safety requirements but i think it is likely the case that 
some seeing the sampl situaion have perhaps inadvertently 
overreacted boskin said when asked about mondays survey at a 
national press club lunch 
he added that some banks have been forced to make fewer loans in 
response to stricter capital standards taking effect jan 1 under 
an international accord 
banks that cannot raise additional capital have little choice 
but to restrict the number of new loans they make while they build 
their capital gradually by retaining earnings 
nearly twothirds of the respondents in the fed poll reported 
tightening lending standards for commercial real estate loans 
while almost half of the respondents had tightened lending 
standards for nonreal estate commercial and industrial loans to 
large corporations 
they most often cited a deterioration in the economic 
outlook and problems specific to individual industries for 
the greater restraint the report said about onefifth of the 
banks surveyed said their capital position restricted new lending 
while twothirds said it had no effect 
home mortgage lending remained relatively favored the 
federal reserve said but it noted that more us banks 
particularly in the northeast are reporting tighter standards even 
for those loans 
about one in four of the banks said they were either requiring a 
higher down payment on home mortgages or had raised the household 
income needed to qualify for a loan 
in sum the results of this lending practices survey suggest 
that a deterioration in the general economic outlook since summer 
has prompted a sizable share of domestic respondents to tighten 
credit standards more the central bank said 
in addition to scrutinizing borrowers more closely about half 
the banks said they had raised their loan fees and charged a bigger 
spread over base interest rates between onethird and onehalf are 
requiring better collateral

hawaiis billiondollar marijuana industry has 
been dealt a potentially fatal blow by a federal state and county 
crackdown that used spaceage surveillance and pinpoint aerial 
spraying of herbicide authorities say 
about 90 percent of hawaiis summer marijuana crop has been 
destroyed in operation wipeout the biggest joint agency crackdown 
in hawaii history and one of the largest in the nation state 
attorney general warren price said monday 
law enforcement intelligence sources report that the industry 
is now in shambles with growers leaving the state or turning to 
legitimate businesses price said 
in three months the statewide operation that had the blessing 
of justresigned drug policy chief william bennett destroyed 
785000 plants worth 11 billion on the street officials said 
price said the sweep was made possible by spaceage 
intelligence gathering and photo identification methods 
he declined to say whether that meant military satellites were 
used to pinpoint the marijuana crops saying only that information 
on the pentagons involvement was classified 
marijuana or pakalolo is the states no 1 cash crop and 
is grown yearround mostly on the island of hawaii the state is 
among the biggest pot producers in the nation 
price said the entire state was photograhed in grids once 
marijuanagrowing areas were identified herbicide was sprayed from 
helicopters or officers uprooted the plants 
price said the areas would be checked periodically to ensure 
more pot is not planted checks over the past few weeks turned up 
only one replanted plot he said 
the marijuana industry in hawaii is not yet dead but it is 
severely wounded price said over the next several months we 
feel we can destroy the remnants of the industry and eliminate it 
in its entirety once and for all 
william paty director of the state department of land and 
natural resources said herbicide nozzles developed by the 
department were a key weapon 
the nozzle attached to a hose suspended from the belly of a 
helicopter allows pinpoint eradication of marijuana plants in 
remote areas without harming nearby foliage he said 
joseph parra head of the drug enforcement administration in 
hawaii said operation wipeout has driven the street price of 
hawaii marijuana from between 1600 and 2200 a pound to between 
4600 and 6000 a pound 
hawaii officials have previously been criticized as being too 
easy on marijuana growers 
besides serving as an example for other states operation 
wipeout 
could be used to show foreign governments that were trying to 
resolve our drug problems at home and not just asking them to 
spray their plants parra said

the leaders have come to make peace in europe for 
all but the privileged thousands who have security or press reasons 
to penetrate security barriers its a short television spectacle 
on monday afternoon a few dozen people wanted actually to see 
the leaders step from their limousines at the congress center at 
avenue kleber a few hundred yards from the arc de triomphe in 
paris 
they couldnt even get close one of the 10000 or so policemen 
deployed around paris in uniform or disguised as street sweepers 
and vendors even had the grace to smile 
i know its madness he said but i can do nothing 
 
gorbachev warned in his speech monday that ethnic conflicts 
could have a destructive snowball effect especially if 
separatists achieve changes in the borders adopted after world war 
ii in europe 
the helsinki final act of 1975 the basis of the process 
celebrated by 34 participating nations at their current summit 
aimed to make those borders final regardless of the many border 
changes of the past and still raging rival ethnic claims 
but what of borders inside countries they apparently are not 
included 
and so on monday the foreign ministers of the three baltic 
republics were rejected as summit observers because the soviet 
union of which they are nominally part rejected their claim to 
any kind of independent voice 
 
the baltics and isolationist albania already an observer but 
lacking full membership craved a place at the summit table so 
apparently did an uninvited guest saddam hussein 
the iraqi leader probably aware that president bush would use 
paris as a forum to muster yet more international support for his 
policy in the persian gulf used sunday and monday to announce what 
appeared to be major moves 
questions about iraqs decision to start releasing foreign 
hostages before christmas and its move to deploy up to 250000 more 
troops in kuwait peppered every news conference overshadowing 
peace rhetoric and the historic accord to slash conventional arms 
saddam hussein invites himself to paris the paris daily 
liberation commented monday 
 
and indeed saddams shadow cast a pall not seen from the sunny 
sky in paris on monday it is the shadow of war 
the leaders want to preserve the peace they came to celebrate 
from gorbachev to german chancellor helmut kohl and even bush and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who are more forthright 
than others about the need to use force in the persian gulf if 
necessary they advocated peaceful solution 
but the paris summit in the name of peace and prosperity also 
had to examine the paradoxical proposition that force may be needed 
to preserve both 
gorbachev summed up the quandary facing the leaders in paris 
we all need patience he said at a picture session before 
dinner with bush but that does not mean that we are going to 
weaken or retreat

for any reason says one of the 84 american and canadian refugees 
newly evacuated from the persian gulf country 
the 75 americans and nine canadians arrived monday night at 
dulles international airport outside washington 
three of the passengers were taken to a hospital but officials 
said there were no serious medical problems authorities took the 
rest of the exhausted refugees to a hotel near the airport 
the passengers were not hostages but had been living in kuwait 
since before the aug 2 invasion by iraq 
a kuwaiti accompanying his four americanborn children said 
there are random arrests killings sometimes they can kill you 
for any reason they may arrest anybody maybe they dont like his 
car they may inflict harm on his body torture 
the iraqi government is implementing many internal policies to 
force the people out of their country said the man who would 
not give his name by driving or walking you are putting 
yourself in a position where you could be arrested beaten or 
killed 
one 35yearold woman said she had been hoping for american 
troops to come to her rescue 
for the past three and a half months i have gotten up hoping 
and praying they would come she said but a 36yearold 
palestinian accompanied by his two american daughters expressed 
doubts about the wisdom of using force 
i dont know force will kill a lot of people he said it 
will mean mass destruction the two asked that their names not be 
used 
health and human services department spokesman steve siegel said 
75 americans and their dependents were aboard 16 men 16 women 
and 43 children he said there were nine canadians two men four 
women and three children 
the refugees were among 136 on a flight from iraq that landed 
earlier monday at londons gatwick airport

wheelchair but otherwise everyone seemed healthy 
children who arrived on the flight were sitting in a 
semicircle watching tv its like they havent watched in years 
said berezoski 
most of the passengers on this flight have been qualified to 
depart for some time but have only recently decided to leave 
state department spokesman richard boucher told reporters at the 
airport

citizens and their relatives evacuated since the crisis began

the mayor of leningrad one of the soviet unions 
leading reformers has appealed to the west for emergency aid to 
avoid famine and prevent public opinion from turning against 
democratic reforms 
already a lot of people are saying lets go back to the way 
things were under brezhnev at least then there was food in the 
stores said the leader of the countrys second largest city 
anatoly a sobchak 
in recent days sobchak 53 has been mentioned as a possible 
candidate for the new post of vice president in president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reorganized government 
in an interview with the associated press on monday he said he 
had not been approached about the job he skirted the issue of 
whether he would accept if gorbachev offered it saying he did not 
expect to be chosen and had no desire for a permanent career in 
politics 
sobchak a member of the supreme soviet legislature and former 
law professor is the first highlevel soviet official to appeal 
publicly for food donations from the west 
he said some people in leningrad had accused him of being too 
proud to ask for help but that for the good of the city he would 
be willing to get down on my knees if necessary 
germany promised gorbachev during his visit last week that it 
would provide emergency food aid to help the soviet union through 
the winter and chancellor helmut kohl said monday that rail 
shipments could begin as early as next week 
sobchak said a private us organization americares was also 
preparing shipments 
the mayor visited the united states in october and met with 
president bush at the white house he said he regretted that he did 
not ask for emergency aid at that time 
a month ago i thought we could avoid foreign aid today i 
think we cant he said the food situation has worsened and 
by the time we take steps to increase stockpiles and improve 
distribution we could already have placed our major cities in 
danger of famine 
secretary of state james a baker iii said on monday that the 
us government had not received a formal request for help 
but bush meeting other leaders at a summit conference in paris 
indicated he would favor humanitarian aid 
if there are food shortages for example and the united 
states was in a position to help clearly i would want to try to 
help he said and thats the right and humane thing to do as a 
country moves towards us and relations are greatly improved 
at sobchaks urging leningrads city council voted last week to 
begin rationing meat poultry eggs flour butter and other 
staples starting dec 1 in the city of about 5 million people 
many other cities throughout russia and the ukraine already 
ration food vodka matches soap and other necessities 
sitting under a portrait of lenin in his moscow legislative 
office sobchak said communist party officials are deliberately 
preventing food from being distributed efficiently 
we are facing opposition possibly the last gasp of 
opposition from the old communist totalitarian administrative 
system against the new democratic system that is being born he 
said 
he added that if there is widespread hunger this winter popular 
sentiment could turn against the reforms that gorbachev has 
introduced since coming to power in 1985 
people are asking what good is this democracy to me when 
ive got nothing to eat he said 
sobchak spoke enthusiastically about the government 
reorganization proposed by gorbachev on saturday 
he said eliminating the council of ministers headed by prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov would give the president a clear line of 
administrative authority independent of the communist party 
allowing gorbachev to take more decisive action to improve the 
economy 
at the same time sobchak called for a radical reduction in the 
role of the central government saying its function should be only 
as a coordinator and arbiter between autonomous soviet 
republics that voluntarily remain within the union

the consumer products safety commission 
issuing its annual holiday warning about dangerous toys says it 
may go for regulations requiring labeling of playthings with small 
parts that could choke children if swallowed 
think big in buying toys for children under 3 jacqueline 
jonessmith chairman of the commission said monday at a news 
conference 
the commission said it received reports of 33 deaths related to 
toys between january 1989 and september 1990 in 20 of these cases 
the children choked on balloons marbles small balls or parts of 
toys 
the buyer has to beware and parents have to be careful ms 
jonessmith said 
she said the commission has taken the first steps toward 
developing mandatory requirements for labeling on balloons balls 
and marbles 
in addition she said the commission has begun action that may 
result in a requirement that toys having small pieces intended for 
children aged 3 to 6 be labeled to warn of the choking hazards to 
younger children 
the commissions staff hopes to have these regulations before 
the commission for consideration early next year she said 
ms jonessmith demonstrated two toys with small parts for 
reporters and announced that the manufacturers have agreed to 
voluntarily recall them from the market 
during the past year she said about 198 kinds of toy have been 
recalled or stopped from sale 
in a statement distributed at the news conference the 
commission also said it has seized about 3 million toys at ports of 
entry since it began a cooperative program with the customs service 
in 1987 
the industry itself is policing itself much better in recent 
years partly because of its own sensitivity and party because of 
our work with customs said david schmeltzer director of 
compliance for the commission 
ms jonessmith said most of the toys the commission deals with 
are imported

having mounted a pugnacious campaign 
against a government he largely created lech walesa is presenting 
himself as a man vindicated by events and predicts victory in 
sundays presidential elections 
i was born only for victory so i have to win walesa 
declared in an interview with the associated press at his 
headquarters monday 
polls show walesa ahead of his chief rival and former ally 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki but with four others in the 
field it was unclear if anyone would get a firstround majority 
and avoid a runoff dec 9 
the 47yearold solidarity chairman accused his opponents of 
talking only about his personality and ambitions not substantive 
issues 
i am waiting for a political discussion while my partners are 
saying that i have dirty fingernails and so try to discourage 
people from voting for me walesa said 
walesa who picked mazowiecki for prime minister in august 1989 
after the longruling communists suffered a humiliating electoral 
defeat said he was laughed at early this year when he urged the 
government to pick up the speed of reforms 
he said he saw that dramatic stes were needed including 
purging government and industry of communists 
my colleagues dangerous politicians were carrying out a 
dangerous policy which was on the edge of civil war i made an 
attempt to save us to save reform walesa said 
the mazowiecki camp argues that polands delicate transition to 
full democracy could be thwarted if the government engages in a 
largescale witch hunt for excommunists 
virtually all of walesas former advisers have sided with 
mazowiecki leaving walesa to assemble a new team of unionists and 
lesserknown politicians 
i have been struggling for nine months to regain solidaritys 
position and to regain my position i do not know to what extent it 
worked but from what i see it did walesa said 
a peasants son with a tradeschool education walesa said he 
differs from his former colleagues most of them intellectuals 
because he is not frightened by ordinary people 
if you fear the masses then of course the masses will defeat 
you he said 
i am not afraid of the masses i want to find work for them 
and i want to show them whats possible or impossible and then go 
on with whats possible and probable 
his former allies may quarrel with him now walesa said but 
they will see he was right 
i am playing like a chess player five or six moves ahead and 
my colleagues can see only one move that is why they are scared 
once he is elected walesa said he will move to patch up the 
splintered solidarity movement 
while he has called for faster reforms he said that as 
president he would avoid abrupt changes until a freely elected 
parliament is seated which could take two or three months he 
said 
until the elections as few changes as possible only the 
necessary changes because to the outside world it always looks 
like change upon change from one change to another 
walesa has recently been full of praise for finance minister 
leszek balcerowicz but he sidestepped a question on whether he 
would ask balcerowicz to stay 
walesa said he would offer part of the cabinet the option to 
remain but wouldnt appeal to them with hat in hand 
the point is reform of the country patriotism and full 
devotion and not to me but to poland walesa said 
if someone needs to be asked it means hes useless he 
said 
asked why he had not done more to rebuke antisemitism during 
his rallies walesa said he had reminded poles in recent interviews 
that antisemitism is contradictory to their catholicism 
mazowiecki who contends polands future depends on maintaining 
his course of cautious reforms says hell join the opposition if 
walesa wins

the naval academy said monday the kidnapped goat was one of 
several that had auditioned to succeed bill xxv who was retired in 
1988

initiated the merger of parsons and the new school in 1970 and 
continued as parsons chief administrative officer until last year 
levys appointment was announced in conjunction with a policy 
statement in which the board reaffirmed the corcorans commitment 
to freedom of expression 
the corcoran 120 years old and two blocks from the white house 
attracted nationwide criticism when its former director christina 
orrcahall canceled an exhibit containing sexually explicit 
photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
she said she canceled the show to avoid getting embroiled in the 
emotional debate over federal arts grant policies but the 
cancellation ignited an equally intense debate in the artistic 
community and orrcahall resigned last february

medical researchers say the food and drug 
administration is threatening access to a french abortion drug that 
shows promise in treating cancer and other diseases 
dr george p chrousos of the national institute of child health 
and development told a house hearing monday that scientists are 
being whiplashed by the fda decision to issue an import alert 
on the french drug ru486 
i wont be able to initiate a new study because of the 
uncertain supply of ru486 chrousos said he said the reluctance 
by the french company rousseluclaf to supply it for research in 
this country was unethical 
the drug has shown promise in treating breast and brain cancer 
cushings syndrome and other diseases cushings syndrome is a 
disorder of the pituitary gland 
the fda got carried away under pressure from the 
righttolife movement and may have made a political decision 
chrousos added 
the fda issued an import alert in june 1989 barring the abortion 
drug for personal use after getting inquiries from righttolife 
groups and a dozen members of congress who oppose abortion 
including sen jesse helms rnc and rep robert dornan 
rcalif 
since then some us researchers have had difficulty getting 
the drug from its french manufacturer which fears its business 
could suffer if it becomes embroiled in an abortion controversy 
the regulatory agencys import alert was not a politically 
motivated decision the fdas ronald g chesemore told the house 
subcommittee on regulation business opportunities and energy 
the fda didnt consult leading us researchers before issuing 
the import alert testified dr kathryn horwitz a professor of 
medicine at the university of colorado 
the fda announced the alert 19 days after demands for it from 
members of congress 
this certainly must be a new landspeed record for an agency 
response to congressional inquiries observed subcommittee 
chairman rep ron wyden dore he called fdas action very 
irresponsible 
wyden suggested that health and human services department 
secretary louis sullivan urge the french company to ensure adequate 
supplies of the drug for us research

an oslo university medical student says hes 
determined that soccer players who use their heads to strike at 
balls are risking brain damage 
thirty percent of retired norwegian soccer players were found to 
have signs of minor brain damage from heading balls according 
to the survey medical student alf thorvald tysvaer conducted for 
his doctoral thesis 
tysvaer said in an interview with the news agency npk that 3 
percent of the active norwegian soccer players he studied also 
showed symptoms of brain damage soccer balls can travel at more 
than 60 mph 
but willy simonssen assistant head of norways soccer 
federation said such widespread damage appeared unlikely 
i have not noticed it in my meetings with players he said 
in the study former players complained of headache dizziness 
and irritability and some had problems with pain in the neck 
tysvaer was quoted as saying he said those were symptoms of 
chronic or permanent brain damage 
but the brain changes he recorded were not as severe as those 
suffered by boxers tysvaer said 
npk said in the report monday that tysvaers study included 69 
active norwegian division players and 43 former national team 
members

government critics have taken to the 
streets with charges that a new communist party was created with 
secret support from the governing national salvation front 
more than 3000 people marched two miles down bucharests main 
boulevard on monday shouting anticommunist slogans and railing 
against the government 
the new communist party called the socialist labor party was 
formed last weekend through the merger of the tiny democratic labor 
and socialist parties both created after the december revolution 
that ousted and executed longtime dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the party led by former communist premier ilie verdet 
describes itself as a reorganization on a new basis of the 
former romanian communist party 
in a statement monday the new party deplored intolerant 
movements to discourage our constructive efforts and pledged to 
reject all stalinist and ceausescuist practices 
but critics were skeptical 
the communists have infiltrated all the structures of power 
and quite naturally will try to return us to where we were 
before said constantin ticu dumitrescu president of the former 
political prisoners association 
many in the opposition have charged that the national salvation 
front which took power after the december revolution that ousted 
ceausescu and its leader president ion iliescu are secret 
communists 
the demonstrators monday shouted down with iliescu and 
the blood was spilled for nought 
some carried a large banner that equated the government with 
communism it read romanian communist party national salvation 
front socialist labor party romanian communist party 
iliescu and other front leaders bowing to popular pressure that 
sprung from hatred of ceausescu announced in january that 
communism would be banned in romania later they backed away from 
that position 
a statement issued by the political prisoners group charged 
that almost all the top communist party members were freed 
despite their crimes against humanity it alleged that 
ceausescus feared secret police the securitate is intact and 
on duty 
more than 100000 romanians demonstrated against the front on 
thursday to mark the third anniversary of anticeausescu riots in 
brasov 60 miles north of bucharest which were brutally 
suppressed 
dissatisfaction with the front has grown since nov 1 when 
price reforms introduced by premier petre roman led to the doubling 
and tripling of prices 
the front on sunday criticized romans reform package as not 
doing enough to protect the social welfare of citizens 
it was time the front had openly attacked roman whose 
relationship to the government party is unclear roman said he was 
resigning in july but he has since presided over several meetings 
of a front organization

two of the american fliers she helped save 
attended the funeral of charline chable rotondo a member of the 
french underground awarded the medal of freedom for her world war 
ii exploits 
rotondo who moved to the united states in 1974 died of lung 
cancer thursday at age 78 her funeral was monday 
world war ii fliers john swenson of newton mass and alvin 
little of burlington vt were among the 32 americans rotondo 
sheltered from the nazis 
without people like her we would have been dead swenson 
said we would have starved to death or turned ourselves in to 
the germans 
she went through as much hell as us little said 
rotondo received americas highest civilian honor in paris in 
1945 after she escaped from the nazis who had imprisoned and 
tortured her she was the first foreignborn woman to receive the 
medal 
also attending her funeral were members of the 8th air force 
historical society in massachusetts and the air forces escape and 
evasion society which reunited rotondo swenson and little in 
1985 
swenson was the radio operator and little a gunner on a bomber 
that was shot down over france in 1943 after being rescued by two 
frenchmen they were secretly moved from house to house village to 
village across france 
little spent 12 weeks at rotondos home in esbly outside paris 
swenson stayed there a week 
one evening when germans knocked on rotondos door she kept 
them occupied until i and her niece could slip out another door 
little said 
rotondo a bankers daughter who was then 31 eventually was 
captured herself she was beaten hung from rafters and burned with 
cigarettes but she told her captors nothing about the french 
resistance 
she escaped when a train carrying her to a concentration camp 
was bombed by the allies 
after the war the multilingual sorbonne graduate became a 
fashion designer and lived in southeast asia before moving to the 
united states and settling in salem 
she sought in vain for 10 years to find any of the fliers she 
helped until the escape and evasion society found her her medal 
was displayed in her coffin 
she is survived by her husband alfred rotondo

a 13yearold leukemia victim who was denied the 
possibility of a bone marrow transplant from his 3yearold half 
siblings died without a fair chance against the disease or the 
courts his father says 
jeanpierre bosze died monday at his suburban hoffman estates 
home ending his fathers sixmonth legal battle to have the 
teenagers twin halfsiblings a boy and a girl tested as donors 
for a bone marrow transplant that doctors said might have saved his 
life 
he was a very very brave boy said his father tamas bosze 
its very unfortunate the way the law is now i dont think he 
had a fair chance 
bosze had sought a court order to force nancy curran his 
former girlfriend and the mother of the twins to have the 
toddlers tested 
curran had claimed the tests would be too painful and risky in 
september the state supreme court affirmed a lower courts ruling 
in her favor a request to reconsider its decision was before the 
high court when jeanpierre died 
the boy was released from lutheran general hospital in park 
ridge last week and both his mother and father were at his bedside 
when he died said edward jordan boszes lawyer 
he was at peace jordan said he was as calm as he could 
be he didnt want to die but he knew it was coming 
jordan said bosze feels no bitterness toward curran of suburban 
elk grove 
its not anything like you killed my kid nothing like 
that jordan said its just that theyll never know if the 
twins could have been donors blood relatives are more likely to be 
biologically compatible donors 
when he started out he was a good candidate to receive bone 
marrow from anyone the boys father said his condition got 
worse the twins were the only hope 
currans attorney beverly pekala issued a onesentence 
extending her clients sympathy 
healthy bone marrow must come from donors whose tissue types 
closely match the patients bosze approached curran after tests 
showed that he and three other family members were incompatible 
bosze a tavern owner fathered the twins with curran when he 
was separated from jeanpierres mother to whom he remains 
married curran has sole custody of the twins 
he initially petitioned the courts in june insisting the twins 
would agree to the tests if they were old enough to decide circuit 
judge monica reynolds ruled sept 6 that the tests would violate 
the twins right to privacy 
bone marrow is extracted from the hipbone or breastbone risks 
include pain complications from anesthesia infection and the 
possible need for a blood transfusion

americas no 1 video chain is 
swallowing no 3 in a 40 million deal that gives blockbuster 
entertainment corp a total of more than 1700 stores 
blockbuster agreed to acquire erols inc of springfield va a 
chain of 208 outlets that pioneered the video rental business in 
1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiff 
competition 
the deal provides an outstanding opportunity for blockbuster 
and its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores 
blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer h wayne huizenga 
said monday 
erols the nations thirdlargest chain behind west 
coastnational of philadelphia has stores in philadelphia 
baltimore cleveland and chicago as well as 112 stores in the 
washington dc area where blockbuster has only 48 outlets and 
was looking to expand 
blockbuster based in fort lauderdale opened its 1500th store 
monday in vancouver british columbia in all the chain has 
stores in 44 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico 
canada and england 
erols founder and principal stockholder erol onaran said the 
buyout was in the best interest of his 2600 employees 
it was going to be a fight said analyst drew beja at advest 
securities and blockbuster had the resources to win the fight 
onaron founded erols as a stereo repair shop in washington in 
1963 it was an early pioneer in the video industry opening stores 
exclusively devoted to rentals in 1980 and led all other video 
chains in revenue until blockbuster surpassed it in 1988 
but erols has been stagnating since then and didnt begin to 
sell franchises until last august said frank molstad editor of 
video store magazine 
in contrast blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 stores 
a year since huizenga bought the company in 1987 for 19 million 
and huizenga has said sales this year could top 1 billion 
erols had revenue of 100 million last year said jerry 
falkner an analyst at southwest research partners in boca raton 
while more than 1700 stores by the end of the year blockbuster 
will still have only about 10 percent of the home video market 
said fran blechman bernstein an analyst with merrill lynch

scientists say they see exciting potential 
for the worlds first hightemperature superconducting transistor 
in the development more advanced supercomputers microwave 
components and other electronics 
the new transistor was developed at the university of wisconsin 
and sandia national laboratories in albuquerque nm and operates 
at a relatively high temperature of minus 340 degrees fahrenheit 
the scientists said monday 
while superconductive compounds that function at similarly high 
temperatures have been known for years the transistor marks the 
first successful attempt to use such materials to create a 
transistor 
the department of energy also backed the project which now has 
advanced to the installation of the transistor into a functioning 
electronic circuit 
transistors often the size of pinheads function in 
supercomputers and other electronic devices as the switches that 
control current they also are used to amplify signals from devices 
ranging from stereos to satellites 
superconductivity the loss of all resistance to electrical 
current occurs in dozens of materials when they are chilled to 
minus 452 degrees fahrenheit or close to absolute zero 
devices that become superconductive at higher more easily 
achievable temperatures would allow more practical applications and 
could open the way to faster supercomputers microwave components 
and other electronics products 
the new transistor is etched in a thin film of thalium and 
superconducting copper oxide and is chilled to the temperature of 
liquid nitrogen 
while you still cant keep it in your shirt pocket it gives 
scientists more flexibility because it operates at a higher 
temperature said electrical engineering professor james b beyer 
who directed the project along with professor james e nordman and 
university graduate jon martens 
the new transistor intrigues scientists partly because it 
functions far differently from conventional transistors 
conventional transistors use alteration in the voltage to 
control current the new transistor uses changes in the current to 
control voltage 
ken frazier a sandia spokeesman said the new transistor may 
serve as a bridge between circuitry that functions at room 
temperature and circuitry being developed using superconductivity 
close to absolute zero 
but nordman cautioned that scientists are still studying the new 
transistor and are far fro determining its applications 
the transistor was invented in 1948 and weve been learning 
about it ever since he said

a us military team flew to hanoi 
today to receive 11 sets of remains that the vietnamese say may be 
those of missing american soldiers a us official said 
after a repatriation ceremony at hanois airport the remains 
were to be flown to the armys central identification laboratory in 
hawaii for analysis said james williams spokesman for the us 
embassy in bangkok 
he said vietnam last returned remains on sept 13 when 20 sets 
were handed over none of those have yet been identified 
the pentagon lists 2294 americans as missing in action or mia 
from the vietnam war which ended in the communist defeat of the 
usbacked south vietnam government in april 1975 of these 1676 
are missing in vietnam 529 in laos 83 in cambodia and six in 
chinese coastal waters 
in august 1987 us presidential envoy john w vessey and 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach agreed to new forms of 
cooperation 
since then vietnam has returned a total of 101 remains in 15 
repatriations 
williams said that since 1974 more than 400 sets of remains 
have been returned from vietnam but only 245 americans have been 
accounted for as a result 
most of the remains he said were determined to be those of 
southeast asian mongoloids although a few sets are still under 
analysis 
us and vietnamese experts held talks on accelerating 
cooperation on the mia issue on nov 79 in hanoi 
the vietnam news agency said they discussed plans to conduct 
their 12th and 13th joint searches in coming months in these 
searches investigators inspect plane crash sites interview 
villagers who witnessed crashes and collect other evidence of 
missing soldiers 
late last month thach said he welcomed the idea of the united 
states stationing an official in hanoi to coordinate efforts to 
account for missing americans 
the two countries do not have diplomatic relations and the 
united states has not posted an official in vietnam since the war 
us officials in bangkok said however that it did not appear an 
official would be posted there anytime soon

the us ambassador has written an 
open letter to pakistanis explaining that 573 million in us aid 
has been suspended because pakistan has not made adequate 
assurances about its nuclear capability 
the letter appeared in mondays editions of the englishlanguage 
newspaper the nation and several urdulanguage publications 
washington suspended military and economic assistance oct 1 
demanding greater assurances that pakistan neither possesses nor 
wants to possess nuclear weapons 
pakistan the thirdlargest recepient of us aid behind egypt 
and israel insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes 
the 2weekold government of prime minister nawaz sharif has 
pledged to go ahead with its nuclear program even if it means 
losing american aid 
many pakistanis believe their countrys nuclear program acts as 
a deterrent against possible attack by india its traditionally 
hostile neighbor to the east india exploded a nuclear device in 
1974 
the two uneasy neighbors went to war in 1948 1965 and again in 
1971 fears of a fourth and possibly nuclear war escalated last 
spring over the disputed territory of kashmir which is claimed by 
both 
in his letter ambassador robert oakley tried to explain that 
us law prohibits economic and military aid to any country that 
even possesses the components of a nuclear device 
the definition of possession applies to components of a 
nuclear device not only to an assembled device the letter says 
unless the us president provides certification to congress 
assistance is suspended on oct 1 the start of the new fiscal 
year oakley said 
there is no authority for any action by the president to 
extend this date which only congress can do if the president fails 
to certify he said 
the ambassador said president bush had proposed that congress 
delay the suspension so that us aid would not be an issue in the 
oct 24 parliamentary election 
the rightwing political parties blamed ousted prime minister 
benazir bhutto for the suspension and used the issue not only to 
defeat her at the polls but to fuel antiamerican sentiment 
i know there is a widespread tendency in pakistan to see the 
united states as a huge spider spinning its web and determining 
what happens in all corners of the world but you should not fall 
into this trap oakley said 
nor should you assume that better relations between pakistan 
and india or a mutual reduction in armaments would necessarily be 
at pakistani exepense he said 
a lowering of both the threat level between pakistan and india 
and the amount of money they spend for defense would seem to be a 
good thing for the peoples of both country 
why not explore it seriously rather than suspect that 
pakistans favorite archvillain the united states is plotting to 
weaken and undermine you with such a subversive insidious 
suggestion he said

president saddam hussein said today that he 
would ask the national assembly to meet later in the day and grant 
all german hostages freedom staterun baghdad radio reported 
iraqi officials said passage was certain 
saddam said the germans should go free because of what he called 
the history of excellent ties between germany and the arab world 
there was no indication of when the releases would take place 
german chancellor helmut kohl has expressed a reluctance to 
exercise the military option against iraq 
on sunday he urged president bush to exhaust all other possible 
options before resorting to military force to try to drive iraqi 
forces from kuwait 
earlier this week iraq said all foreigners would be set free 
between christmas and march 25 but information minister latif 
nassiyif jassim indicated monday that some might be allowed to 
leave earlier 
however he also indicated that passage of a un resolution 
authorizing the use of force against iraq might hinder the 
releases 
there are about 280 germans left in iraq and kuwait with some 
held at strategic sites in an effort to ward off an attack by the 
usled multinational forces seeking to force iraq out of kuwait

riot police swinging steeltipped 
batons today dispersed about 200 rockhurling protesters who were 
enforcing a general strike to demand the ouster of president 
hussain muhammad ershad 
the 24hour nationwide strike apparently was successful in the 
capital where businesses shut and streets were deserted buses and 
bicycle rickshaws also stayed off the roads 
at least 20 people were injured in the clash with the police in 
downtown dhaka some of the victims were hit on the head with rifle 
butts 
in another part of the city 15 studets were injured when they 
were attacked by supporters of ershad with sticks and knives 
united news of bangladesh said 
the news agency said the students were opposition activists and 
were forcing shops and offices to close in central dhaka 
government offices were open but few people attended most 
workers walked to work and ministers drove to their offices before 
the strike began at 6 am opposition parties led by the awami 
league and the bangladesh nationalist party intensified their 
antiershad campaign oct 10 calling a series of strikes and 
demonstrations that often turned violent 
at least eight protesters have been fatally shot by police 
since 
todays shutdown was the seventh in a month called by the 
opposition which wants ershad to resign before the national 
elections scheduled next year ershad has refused 
on monday at least 200 people were injured in 13 towns across 
the country during clashes between police and supporters and 
opponents of ershad 
about 100 people were injured when pro and antiershad groups 
fought with crude bombs and rocks in rajshahi 120 miles north of

and tear gas to quell antigovernment demonstrators leaving at 
least 40 people injured 
bengalilanguage newspaper sangbad said another 60 people were 
injured in clashes in 11 other towns 
the 60yearold president seized power in a bloodless coup in 
1982 he quit the army after winning presidential elections in 1986 
that observers said were heavily rigged 
ershad has promised to hold another presidential election in 
1991 but the opposition has vowed to boycott it saying the polls 
are certain to be rigged again 
they demand that ershad resign and hand over power to a 
caretaker government until the elections decide the new leadership 
opposition leaders also have rejected ershads assurance that 
the 1991 elections will not be rigged and that he will invite 
foreign observers including former president jimmy carter to 
monitor the polls

burmas military rulers have sentenced 
two opposition leaders to 10year jail terms in the toughest move 
yet against the party that won national elections in may a 
political source said today 
a military tribunal sentenced kyi maung and chit khaing of the 
national league for democracy on monday said the source who was 
contacted in rangoon from bangkok and spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
at the time of his arrest kyi maung 72 was acting leader of 
the league which won the may 27 elections by a landslide but has 
been barred from taking office by the military government most of 
the rest of the partys leadership also is behind bars 
both men were arrested on sept 6 it appeared they were 
sentenced under the terms of burmas official secrets act the 
source said 
violation of the act carries a maximum prison term of 14 years 
the source said 
western diplomats said at the time of the arrests that the men 
apparently were accused of passing to other league members a 
confidential document given to them by the chief of military 
intelligence maj gen khin nyunt 
kyi maung and chit khaing were among the 392 members of the 
national league for democracy who won parliamentary seats in the 
election both were members of the central executive committee 
political sources in rangoon report that authorities have 
arrested at least 50 other members of the party including about 15 
elected members of parliament since the end of october 
only four of the leagues 10person central executive committee 
remain free 
on nov 9 a leading organizer of the party maung ko died in 
military custody and political sources said relatives believed he 
was tortured to death the head of the military government gen 
saw maung said maung ko had committed suicide 
the general secretary of the party aung san suu kyi has been 
under house arrest since july 1989 its chairman tin oo was 
sentenced in december to three years in prison with hard labor 
saw maungs government came to power in september 1988 when 
troops killed thousands of people to crush a nationwide 
prodemocracy uprising 
his latest clampdown has included raids on buddhist monasteries 
and the arrest of at least 200 dissident monks political sources 
have said 
kyi maung a retired army colonel was considered a moderate 
with the potential to mediate between the military and more radical 
elements of his own party 
chit khaing 69 headed the leagues publications wing 
saw maung indicated in a speech on nov 13 that kyi maungs 
arrest may have been related to an interview he gave to the hong 
kongbased magazine asiaweek following the election 
in the interview kyi maung expressed his views on whether 
military officers would be tried by a future oppositionled 
government for ordering the killings of demonstrators 
kyi maung said there would be no witch hunt but added that khin 
nyunt might reasonably feel insecure about the possibility 
on july 13 khin nyunt called the statement insulting and said 
he could sue kyi maung

hungarian prime minister jozsef antall said today 
he hopes the warsaw pact can be dissolved by 1992 
new democracies in middle and eastern europe are now standing 
before the task of a new formulation of their relations and of 
their security policies antall told the conference on security 
and cooperation in europe 
we hope that the conditions for the complete dissolution of 
the warsaw pact within the european security process will be 
created by early 1992 he said we are happy that the 
participating states of the warsaw pact have shown agreement over 
the dissolution of the military organization 
the warsaw pact was founded in 1955 
antall is the first warsaw pact country leader to talk about the 
complete demise of the pact and to propose a deadline in the past 
the leaders have spoken only of ending the warsaw pacts military 
function

decisions before the end of the year on transforming the

the equal employment opportunity commission has 
filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against a baltimore tv station 
accused of firing an anchorwoman because she demanded the same pay 
as her male counterparts 
officials said the lawsuit monday against wbal and parent 
company hearst corp is the first such action by the federal agency 
against a tv station 
eeoc chairman evan kemp jr said the agency found that former 
anchorwoman ruth ann rudy miller was paid less than her male 
counterparts for similar duties and fired in 1989 because she 
demanded equal pay 
miller earned 141000 a year when she was fired compared to 
170000 and 180000 for two male anchormen the eeoc said 
the lawsuit filed in federal court also claims miller was 
given different assignments and faced increased scrutiny of her 
clothes and hairstyle because she is a woman the lawsuit seeks 
back wages and an equal amount in damages 
miller filed her own lawsuit in january alleging similar 
violations she demanded 200000 in damages 
it is ironic and disturbing that an organization devoted to 
protecting the publics interest paid so little attention to 
illegal discriminatory activities within its own ranks kemp 
said 
the lawsuit should send a message throughout the country to 
tv stations he said 
david barrett station vice president and general manager 
denied the allegations he said miller earned less because she 
refused to anchor the 11 pm newscast she had been anchoring the 
noon and 5 pm newscasts when her contract was not renewed 
miller 41 is now host of a daily radio talk show in baltimore 
and publishes the monthly maryland family magazine she said if the 
lawsuit helps other women god thats great 
gerald kiel eeoc regional attorney said the commission sued 
after negotiations to reach a settlement failed

social unrest 
with the end of the cold war divisions there must now be no 
borders which perpetuate the prosperity divide kohl told the 34 
leaders of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
the newly united germany is placing aid to the soviet union high 
on its agenda of shaping the postcold war world order germany is 
coordinating emergency international food deliveries to help the 
soviets overcome severe shortages and alleviate the winter cold 
president bush said monday he would be willing to send food 
too 
unlike his american soviet and british counterparts kohl in 
his speech avoided direct mention of the persian gulf crisis 
he expressed worry about growing nationalism in parts of eastern 
europe and the plight of ethnic minorities outmoded hostile 
stereotyping from the days of cold war confrontation must not be 
replaced by backwardlooking nationalismsaid kohl 
kohl also formally pledged that the reunited germany will only 
use its global muscle for the pursuit of peace and wont repeat 
mistakes of the past 
peace alone will emanate from german soil said kohl

soon said kohl adding that ec leaders have already told him 
they are ready to help out

week 
kohl and gorbachev have been steering their countries closer 
together in the past few months the chancellor wants to help 
gorbachev keep the soviet union from collapsing at least partly 
because of the economic shock waves it could send into europe

sure food shipments from the west are not backed up at the border 
by the soviet unions slowmoving bureaucracy

summit before the oct 3 unification kohls west germany already 
was europes mightiest economic machine and german economic power

housing starts plummeted 60 percent in 
october to their lowest level since the last recession the 
government said today and as a portent of things to come building 
permit applications plunged to their lowest level since the 198182 
downturn 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 104 million units 
following declines of 21 percent in september and 19 percent in 
august 
housing starts through october have declined for nine straight 
months the first time that has occurred since the department began 
keeping records in 1959 
and the number of october starts was the lowest since 902000 
units got under way in june 1982 
the housing industry has been in a slump for more than a year 
with starts during the first 10 months of 1990 down 124 percent 
from the same period of 1989 
the department also said applications for building permits 
often a barometer of future activity fell 68 percent to 925000 
it was the lowest level since 913000 applications were filed in 
june 1982 
tighter credit conditions and plummeting demand continue to 
take their toll on the residential housing industry economists 
with the mitsubishi bank in new york wrote in their weekly economic 
indicator report 
the weakness resulted in the loss of 80000 construction jobs in 
october the labor department reported earlier over the past five 
months the industry has seen jobs tumble by 185000 
analysts see no immediate improvement 
we look for further deterioration through yearend although 
the pace of decline could moderate economists with fuji 
securities inc in chicago wrote in their weekly perspectives 
no upturn is expected until next spring at the earliest 
said michael k evans head of evans economics inc in washington 
construction of singlefamily units dropped 10 percent to 
854000 units following a 32 percent increase the previous month 
multifamily starts plunged 233 percent to 187000 units after 
a 173 percent drop in september 
the northeast which has seen some of the slowest housing 
activity recently posted the only gain in starts up 385 percent 
to 144000 units 
starts were down 169 percent to 266000 units in the west and 
104 percent to 395000 units in the south starts were off 25

the governing socialists pledged today to settle 
scores with their former communist allies after prime minister 
michel rocard squeaked through a noconfidence vote in parliament 
the communists normally allied with the socialists in the 
national assembly defected monday and voted with three opposition 
conservative parties in favor of the noconfidence motion 
but the coalition fell five ballots short of the absolute 
majority of 289 needed in the 577seat assembly 
socialist party first secretary pierre mauroy in a radio 
interview today pledged revenge on the communists 
were going to go to all the city halls controlled by the left 
to say to the communists we had agreements you didnt keep them 
you mixed your votes with those of the right said mauroy a 
former prime minister 
the vote came while france hosted the 34nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
the noconfidence vote was the most serious challenge to 
rocards leadership since the socialists returned to power in 1988 
the main conservative parties the rally for the republic 
union for french democracy and union of the center filed the 
noconfidence motion over a social security tax proposed by rocard 
the socialists normally rely on the communists to abstain from 
such votes allowing the government a comfortable margin of 
security 
but the communists pledged this time to vote with the right 
bringing a combined potential of 286 votes behind the measure the 
coalition needed just three independent deputies to win 
the socialists who have only 272 seats managed to get support 
from some independent deputies and some stray conservatives and 
communists leaving the opposition five votes short 
conservative leader charles millon predicted that a wave of 
troubles besieging the government would continue including 
demonstrations by high school students demanding better education 
their protests occasionally have turned into riots 
other troubles include a slowing economy a campaign 
fundraising scandal implicating justice minister henri nallet and 
rioting by youths in suburban ghettos outside paris and lyon 
rocard had no comment after the vote except to thank the 
parliamentarians for their support 
the effort to oust rocard was prompted by a dispute over his 
proposal for a 11 percent social security tax it would replace 
part of the existing social security fund which is subsidized by 
employers and employees 
the communists and conservatives opposed the plan saying it 
would levy taxes on some previously exempt retired and unemployed 
people they also say the tax could be raised in coming years 
rocard says the tax would streamline the social security system 
and reduce the tax burden on most poor and middleincome people

the army and marine corps are ordering to 
active duty 26625 additional reservists many for combat roles as 
the military reaches into hundreds of communities nationwide to 
bolster its persian gulf deployments 
the callups announced monday were the largest on a single day 
since president bush authorized the use of citizensoldiers in the 
gulf crisis in august 
it also was the armys first call to arms for reserve combat 
units which some critics have said may not be adequately prepared 
for desert warfare against iraq 
since the start of operation desert shield on aug 7 a total of 
77126 reservists have been called up most in noncombat roles 
such as transportation and cargo handling it is the biggest 
callup of reservists since the berlin crisis of 1961 
the army said monday it ordered 20129 national guard and 
reserve members from 41 states puerto rico and the district of 
columbia to report for active duty wednesday the army had put 
those units on alert for possible callup last friday 
the pentagon initially said the army units included three 
national guard combat brigades totaling about 12000 troops the 
48th infantry brigade mechanized of georgia the 155th armored 
brigade of mississippi and the 256th infantry brigade mechanized 
of louisiana but today it said they were not included 
maj doug hart a pentagon spokesman said he had misunderstood 
the makeup of the army units being activated and that while they 
included some combat reservists such as the 1st battalion 158th 
field artillery of the oklahoma national guard they did not 
include elements of the georgia mississippi and louisiana 
brigades 
elements of those three brigades were alerted last friday that 
they would be called up soon but none has been officially ordered 
to active duty hart said today 
each of those three brigades is a roundout unit for a 
regular army armored or mechanized division but none was called up 
in the initial deployment of more than 230000 forces to the gulf 
its still not certain that the three brigades will be sent to the 
front lines they are scheduled to undergo desert warfare training 
in the united states before a deployment decision is made 
reservists normally train one weekend per month plus one 
twoweek exercise a year 
the marine corps said it was ordering 6496 reservists to active 
duty for desert shield most are expected to be deployed to the 
gulf as part of marine reinforcements totaling about 45000 men 
about 45000 regular marines already are in the gulf area 
the marine reserves from units in 23 states and the district of 
columbia will report for duty starting saturday with the 2nd 
marie expeditionary force at camp lejeune nc that unit is 
expected to deploy to the gulf 
the missions of the marine reserves in the latest callup 
include air defense mechanized and infantry operations close air 
support radar and artillery 
bush has authorized a maximum callup of 125000 reserves from 
all services the reserve forces total more than 11 million men 
and women

the national assembly has declared a 
government monopoly on the trading of wheat barley rice corn and 
other cereals and mandated the death penalty for anyone violating 
the law the state press said today 
the 250member parliament passed the law late monday saying it 
was necessary because of shortages caused by the un embargo 
the assembly said the law was needed to deter greed 
the law bans sales of grains for trading by both private sector 
middlemen and farmers the government will have a monopoly on both 
sales and storage 
farmers will be allowed to keep 1000 pounds of wheat for their 
personal use and 400 pounds of rice but the rest must be turned 
over to the goverment within two weeks of harvest 
the annual rice harvest is just starting the wheat harvest 
usually begins in april 
before the invasion iraq imported 70 percent of its food iraq 
has two rivers and abundant fertile land but the government gave 
agricultural development a much lower priority than industrial 
growth 
the un embargo imposed as part of efforts to force iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait cut off most imports 
during the debate some assembly members suggested that the 
penalty be life in prison but the majority voted for the death 
penalty the report said 
the parliament is dominated by members of the ruling arab baath 
socialist party and generally viewed as a rubber stamp for policy 
initiated by the ruling command council under president saddam 
hussein

stanislaw tyminski a millionaire who 
returned to his homeland after 21 years abroad to wage a strong 
campaign for president today rejected charges that he slandered 
the government 
tyminski told reporters his statements are from the heart 
and he will not apologize 
the justice minister on monday announced a preliminary slander 
investigation of tyminski a polishborn businessman who recently 
returned after making a fortune in peru and canada the inquiry 
stems from his statements to voters nov 17 in the southern resort 
of zakopane 
polls indicate tyminski who is backing his candidacy with his 
personal wealth is running a surprisingly strong third behind lech 
walesa and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
tyminski today accused mazowiecki of ignorance of the best 
interests of the country in the economic sense 
earlier tyminski accused the prime minister of betraying the 
people on a nationwide television broadcast monday he tried to 
back up the charge by showing documents purportedly proving the 
government plans to sell state assets at greatly undervalued 
prices 
however it turned out that tyminski was mistaken the figures 
on the documents were not the selling prices for enterprises to be 
privatized but summaries of sales turnover 
nonetheless he said he did not intend to withdraw his 
accusation adding i made the statement because i was right 
tyminski says he is a selfmade millionaire who left poland at 
21 spent several months in sweden and then moved to canada in 1970 
to seek his fortune 
he says he spent the early 1980s in an amazon river port in 
peru operating a cable television outfit and a restaurant before 
returning to canada where he runs transduction ltd a computer 
automation company outside toronto he says he is the leader of the 
libertarian party of canada 
a poll by the stateowned polling service friday showed tyminski 
was supported by 17 percent of those who intend to vote behind 
mazowiecki with 19 percent and solidarity leader lech walesa with 
35 percent a second poll sunday produced similar results 
a fresh face promising to apply his business wizardry to the 
shattered economy tyminski seemed to appeal to disenchanted poles 
looking for an alternative to walesa and mazowiecki 
while tyminski had been written off by most media in poland 
until his latest surge in the polls he is now the center of 
attention 
a liar or a fool was todays headline about tyminski in the 
nations largest newspaper gazeta wyborcza

iraqs announced plan to send 250000 more 
troops to kuwait is a publicity ploy and may hurt rather than help 
the iraqi armys warfighting ability gen colin powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff said today 
the staterun iraqi news agency reported monday that president 
saddam hussein had decided to form seven additional army divisions 
and call up more than 150000 reservists and regulars adding to 
our forces over a quarter of a million fighters 
iraq already has about 430000 troops in kuwait and southern 
iraq according to pentagon estimates facing off in the gulf area 
against 230000 american forces and at least 100000 forces of us 
allies and other arab nations 
president bush two weeks ago announced plans to send us 
reinforcements to the gulf that are expected to increase the 
american force to about 430000 by january 
in an interview today with cbs this morning powell said the 
announced iraq reinforcement plan didnt trouble us military 
planners who are preparing for a possible order from bush to 
launch an offensive to liberate kuwait 
its not clear that large numbers of additional probably less 
capable units significantly adds to his combat power in theatre 
and in fact might present him with new vulnerabilities rather than 
added strength powell said 
the fourstar general also said it is possible that saddam is 
planning to use the extra troops as replacements to allow weary 
soldiers to rotate back from the front lines 
he may be thinking of doing some rotations and some reliefs in 
place powell said well see but at the moment its just 
part of his headlineoftheday program where he tries to divert 
world opinion from his own aggression yesterday was a troop 
buildup the day before that it was a hostage release i think we 
always have to keep coming back to the fundamental point that he is 
trying to divert attention from his aggression the fact that he 
invaded a neighboring country and now he is threatening peace in 
the region

about 150 homeless people who sought 
shelter in a national guard armory were evicted to make room for 
200 guardsmen mobilizing for service in the middle east 
its part of the craziness of these times philip mangano 
executive director of the greater boston adult shelter alliance 
said monday operation desert shield takes precedence over the 
sort of basic shield for people its a bizarre situation 
the homeless sheltered in the armory in the west newton section 
were moved about seven miles to an armory in cambridge guard 
officials said 
mangano said such a move is traumatic for people who must now 
get used to new surroundings 
the time to warehouse people has passed and nothing shows 
that more than the events of this weekend when we were forced to 
deal with human beings as though they were less important than the 
weapons being brought here mangano said 
a dozen shelter workers spent monday stacking cots moving 
office equipment dismantling the health clinic and packing kitchen 
supplies 
about 200 members of the 972nd military police combat unit of 
the army national guard are to be processed through the armory

a fire that triggered the launch of two 
antiaircraft missiles in the soviet far east was deliberately set 
possibly by a discharged officer a newspaper today quoted 
investigators as saying 
komsomolskaya pravda the communist youth newspaper said an 
investigating committee determined an arsonist set fire to a bucket 
of gasoline underneath one of the missiles engines in the nov 15 
incident in the amur region near the chinese border the committee 
is headed by im tretyak commanderinchief of the air defense 
troops 
the fire set off the launching system and the missile struck and 
destroyed a radar station the newspaper said the launch of the 
first missile triggered a second missile which hit a barracks 
where servicemen were sleeping 
the official tass news agency reported last week that the second 
missile killed one soldier and injured eight soldiers tass 
reported safety devices on the missiles prevented their warheads 
from exploding 
a bucket full of gasoline was put under the solid propellant 
engine of one missile and set on fire komsomolskaya pravda 
said 
but another missile was fired too there could have been many 
more casualties 
the newspaper said investigators believe the fire may have been 
set by a discharged officer or may have been an act of revenge 
although it did not say by or against whom 
finally the criminal could have been one of the draftees 
called up last may and not willing to serve in the army it said 
komsomolskaya pravda said that three months before the incident 
a new commanding officer was assigned to the air defense unit 
which it said was lacking discipline and showing a low degree of 
combat preparedness

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
all of the evidence that has been admitted as i understand 
now that lies over there some 44 volumes this information 
contains heresay it contains rumors unfounded allegations 
about all the senators i dare say 
now mr chairman i regret that i have to mention and make 
reference to mr bennett special counsel robert s bennett 
because of the manner in which he presented the case thursday and 
friday he wants a victory he wants to nail somebody he wants 
to get somebody im sorry to say he wants another trophy on the 
wall 
but it has been said many times this is not a trial this is 
supposed to be a factfinding hearing where we get an opportunity 
to lay our case out for you and the american public 
constituent service to me is very important and when a 
constituent someone from arizona walks in to my office we have 
no discrimination whether they are republican democrat liberal 
conservative rich poor even if they are not registered voters 
if theyve got a complaint we listen to them 
what is wrong with intervention from someone who sends you a 
check to your campaign nothing no more different than what is 
wrong when american continental or their employees sent checks to 
our campaigns they didnt hand the checks to us and talk about it 
weve handled 75000 constituent cases in the 14 years that i 
have been a senator and we havent discriminated and we dont 
talk money with them 
now let me talk about the case of american continental and 
lincoln they came to me as they did to other people argued their 
problem and their case saying they were being mistreated and i 
said to them give me some evidence so what did they do 
they got me some pretty powerful evidence all us pretty 
powerful evidence 
i decided to intervene thats right i got in there with my 
sleeves up and decided to go for it 
all the regulators pointed out we did nothing improper 
there was no change made by what we attempted to persuade them 
to do or bring to their attention we didnt do anything wrong 
in any meetings we acted as senators should have they werent 
intimidated until a couple of years later when they got darn 
worried that they hadnt done their jobs 
i was asked to make a status inquiry and i did there were 
jobs involved this was a major employer 
ive had to say some things that are difficult to say about a 
brother lawyer a fine prosecutor as far as i know by reputation 
but ive been mistreated by him in this process 
to do other than dismiss the charges against me is unjust i 
broke no law i broke no rule i broke no standard i committed no 
improper conduct 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in essence what we have heard in response to my very detailed 
opening is me my conduct my conduct all of this all of this 
is my fault 
now members of the committee i have swum in senate legal 
waters for a long time and like a fat old brown trout in 
yellowstone river i am not going to rise to that artificial fly 
senator and i ask that you not be distracted by it 
the only trophy that i want is a is a real big brown trout i 
dont find this particularly enjoyable in fact i find it very 
stressful ive been asked to do a job and ive done it i feel 
like im in a lions den 
the issue in this case is not me the issue in this case 
is the conduct of the senators 
these are the standards that were written by this committee 
when it cited as its subject matter jurisdiction the code of ethics 
for government service which says that you should never accept for 
yourself or your family favors or benefits under circumstances 
which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the 
performance of their governmental duties 
the one thing ive learned in my investigation is this 
case is an aberration and that you spend each day and every hour 
of every day with ladies and gentlemen of this united states senate 
that manage to deal with these very difficult issues of constituent 
service and fundraising and they do it with honor and they do it 
with integrity

those being allowed to leave are all the westerners who worked 
on the dredging project run by the dutch companies volker stevin

the 60 million dredging project was commissioned by president 
saddam husseins government before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
it was completed despite the un trade embargo imposed aug 6 
the dutch government said at the time it regarded the project as 
a service not covered by the embargo 
although dredging was finished several weeks ago the workers 
were not allowed to leave until iraqi officials verified the depth 
of the channel earlier this week anneveldt said 
the two dutch companies dredged a 36milelong channel 
connecting the southern iraqi port of umm qasr to a waterway 
leading to the persian gulf 
about 150 dutch nationals remain in iraq and kuwait including 
those working on the dredging project hundreds of other foreigners

americas crime capital imposed the citys 
strictest curfew since the atlanta child murders of the early 
1980s threatening to jail parents of youngsters caught on the 
street after hours 
three children were caught violating the curfew which went into 
effect at 11 pm monday police said today two youths were picked 
up by their parents from police stations the third a 12yearold 
girl was taken home after her parents refused to pick her up said 
deputy chief wj taylor 
the girls parents were issued a warning taylor said he did 
not say what time the children were picked up 
the american civil liberties union has threatened to challenge 
the law but city officials say it is needed to help the reverse 
the highest rate of serious crime in the nation 
mayor maynrd jackson praised the curfew adopted by the city 
council 131 on nov 5 as an excellent way of keeping youngsters 
from being used as drug runners or lookouts 
the measure requires those under 17 to be off the street between 
11 pm and 6 am weeknights and between midnight and 6 am 
weekends unless participating in school activities returning from 
work or accompanied by an adult 
parents of repeat offenders could get up to 60 days in jail or 
1000 in fines 
police chief eldrin a bell said officers would focus on known 
drug locations nightclubs and places of ill repute 
fbi statistics show atlanta had 210 reported serious crimes per 
1000 residents during 1989 higher than any us city there were 
246 murders in atlanta last year but 106 between january and june 
this year down 14 percent 
the curfew is the latest move in the citys effort to control 
crime including the hiring of bell as police chief three months 
ago 
during his 29 years on the force bell was twice demoted and 
developed a reputation in some quarters as a cop willing to bust 
heads first and let a judge sort things out later he was cleared 
of charges of using excessive force during a 1984 incident in which 
he allegedly pistol whipped a motorist 
the curfew is similar to one adopted at the height of a series 
of 29 slayings of young blacks in metropolitan atlanta that 
terrorized the city in the early 1980s the original curfew applied 
to children 15 or younger and did not penalize their parents it 
had rarely been enforced in recent years 
wayne williams was convicted in 1982 of murder in two of the 29 
slayings of young blacks in metropolitan atlanta between 1979 and 
1981 investigators have blamed him for 22 more of the slayings he 
is serving two life sentences 
officers who spot curfew violators are to take them home if they 
live nearby youths from outside the area will be taken into 
custody until they can be picked up by a parent 
what we have asked is for parents to ultimately have 
responsibility for their children said city councilwoman davetta 
johnson who proposed the curfew penalties 
but michael hauptman president of the local aclu chapter said 
his organization has notified city officials that it considers the 
curfew unconstitutional 
in the event we receive any complaints from parents and or 
children it is our intent to take this matter into court he 
said

a south african woman who 
spent four years in a zimbabwean prison for spying on the african 
national congress said the ordeal changed her attitude toward 
blacks and the antiapartheid movement 
odile harington 30 met with reporters friday for the first 
time since her release nov 1 and she blamed herself for getting 
caught spying 
i was naive i was an idealist harington said 
she said she decided to spy on the anc in 1986 after a 
terrorist blast injured two white children at the time i 
thought that acting against the anc was in the interests of the 
country she said 
harington was arrested in zimbabwe that same year while posing 
as an anc supporter and she confessed to giving pretoria 
information on anc activities in zimbabwe 
the anc the largest black opposition group in south africa was 
illegal in south african at the time and many anc guerrillas lived 
in exile in sympathetic neighboring countries such as zimbabwe 
my attitude toward the anc changed in prison harington 
said i was reading newspapers and seeing things from the point 
of view of the zimbabwean government also living with blacks 
changed my attitude in a way that wasnt possible in the south 
african situation before i left 
harington has refused to say who recruited her and has not 
commented on her experiences in jail it has been widely reported 
that she was tortured 
the former spy praised the changes that occurred in south africa 
during her incarceration zimbabwes government said it freed and 
pardoned harington because of president fw de klerks reforms 
which include legalizing the anc and promising to end apartheid 
things have improved and i have matured she said i think 
its wonderful that the government and anc are negotiating 
harington has not said what she will do in the future she said 
she didnt get paid for her spying services the south african 
government said it will help her adapt and find a job 
harington was originally sentenced to 25 years in prison after 
her 1987 trial but the sentence was reduced to 12 years on appeal

cable news network today handed over to a federal 
judge tapes of manuel noriega talking on the telephone from his 
prison cell 
after receiving the tapes from a team of cnn lawyers us 
district judge william hoeveler gave them to federal magistrate 
william c turnoff 
cnn unsuccessfully appealed hoevelers earlier temporary order 
barring the network from airing the tapes some of the tapes were 
broadcast before an appeals court and the us supreme court upheld 
the order 
hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal 
magistrate so that hoeveler who will preside over noriegas 
drugtrafficking trial is not tainted by any disclosures about 
noriegas defense strategy 
noriegas attorneys claim the tapes disclose defense maneuvers 
and have damaged the deposed panamanian dictators chances for a 
fair trial 
hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and 
translated from spanish then would be studied by turnoff hoeveler 
said he didnt know how long that would take 
the tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage 
noriegas right to a fair trial if the judge then orders a 
permanent ban on further broadcasts cnn can again appeal 
eventually to the us supreme court 
we are confident that when magistrate turnoff reviews these 
tapes and reports to the judge cnn will be found not to have 
violated the court order said steven korn lawyer for turner 
broadcasting system inc cnns owner 
korn said the conversations aired were not covered by the 
judges order against the broadcast of conversations protected by 
attorneyclient privilege 
on monday a noriega attorney jon may also said he would ask 
for an immediate contempt hearing aimed at forcing cnn to pay fines 
of up to 300000 for each violation of the judges order he said 
he would ask the allnews network for a log of how many times it 
aired the tapes 
were certainly going to suggest that might be one way of 
solving a lot of problems and i think an appropriate one 
considering the fact that general noriegas defense was damaged by 
cnn may said of his proposal that fines against cnn be used for 
noriegas attorneys 
cnns attorney said the network doesnt expect to pay any fines 
he said that the conversations aired were not covered by the 
judges order against the broadcast of conversations protected by 
attorneyclient privilege 
the fines could help solve another problem plaguing the defense 
a freeze on noriegas bank accounts that has kept him from paying 
his lawyers 
the private attorneys have said they cannot stay on the case 
without some money hoeveler said last week he would decide soon 
whether to give noriega governmentpaid counsel instead 
the dispute over the tapes has raised questions about 
attorneyclient confidentiality the right to a fair trial and the 
first amendment 
noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the 
taping the freezing of his assets and other alleged government 
misconduct 
the fallen dictator is jailed outside of miami on charges of 
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade his trial isnt 
expected to begin before the spring

an israeli officer and four palestinian 
guerrillas died in an eighthour firefight in southern lebanon 
after the israelis ambushed the guerrilla squad police said today 
police said two palestinians including the commander of the 
raiding party were wounded in the ambush by about 75 israeli 
soldiers and allied lebanese militiamen near this village in the 
foothills of mount hermon 
a lebanese army corporal driving along a nearby road was also 
hurt 
in jerusalem the israeli army said 1st lt yaron yogev 23 was 
shot and killed after his unit spotted and attacked the guerrilla 
squad on monday night 
the army statement also said that a fifth guerrilla may have 
been killed in the firefight it did not mention the participation 
of israeliallied lebanese militiamen 
police said the battle with machine guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades raged under parachute flares for eight hours before the 
israelis and the militiamen of the south lebanon army pulled back 
three to five miles south to the security zone israel maintains 
north of its border 
the bodies of the four slain palestinians remained on the 
battleground near ain atta at daybreak after the israelis and 
militiamen withdrew at 4 am a police spokesman said 
they may be boobytrapped explosive experts are needed to 
examine the corpses before removing them said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
he said israel and the south lebanon army must have been tipped 
in advance about the raid to lay the ambush for the 14 raiders who 
belonged to samir ghoshes palestine popular struggle front 
the group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed in 
beirut 
the front backed and financed by libya is among the most 
militant hardline factions of yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization but the group had seldom been involved in attacks 
against israel or its security enclave in southern lebanon in the 
past 
the front commander and his assistant who was also wounded 
were seen heading back with eight surviving attackers to the 
syriancontrolled bekaa valley in eastern lebanon 
we belong to the palestine popular liberation front and 
libyas revolutionary committee one guerrilla shouted to a small 
group of reporters flashing the vforvictory sign ill shoot 
you if you take pictures 
israel has controlled the zone since it withdrew the bulk of its 
army from lebanon in 1985 after three years of occupation it said 
it needed a buffer area against guerrilla raids but lebanon 
frequently accuses israel of seeking to expand its territory 
permanently 
the enclave covers 440 square miles from the mediterranean coast 
to mount hermon slopes it is controlled by the 3000member south 
lebanon army supported by 1000 israeli soldiers 
a senior israeli official said the israeli army would continue 
to operate beyond the security zone to foil guerrilla actions 
when we think there are going to be terrorist attacks on 
israel from outside the security zone we feel that we have a free 
hand to act in order to prevent in advance attempts to 
infiltrate said yossi olmert director of the government press 
office 
olmert said there had been 17 infiltration attempts by land and 
sea this year in which 36 arabs and two israelis were killed 
none of them has reached israel itself and this is exactly why 
it is vitally important for us even more than before to emphasize 
the significance of this security zone as an effective buffer he 
told reporters

the army will distribute hundreds of thousands 
of balloonlike gas mask attachments to observant jews who cannot 
wear the standard mask because of their beards an army official 
said today 
the daily maariv said the special attachments will ensure a 
tight fit despite facial hair and will cost the government 20 
million 
israel began distributing gas masks to the entire population on 
oct 15 because of the persian gulf crisis and iraqi president 
saddam husseins threat to attack israel with chemical weapons 
the problem for observant jews comes because religious law 
forbids men from shaving and the standard gas masks dont seal 
properly over facial hair 
the army official who spoke on condition of anonymity under 
military regulations said the attachment is a flexible covering 
that extends out from the mask to include the beard within the area 
sealed from contamination 
the civil defense corps developed the attachments despite a 
ruling by one of israels chief rabbis mordechai eliyahu saying 
ultraorthodox jews could shave their beards to save their lives 
in issuing the ruling in august eliyahu urged men to carry 
razors in their pockets to be prepared for a chemical attack 
rabbinical rulings notwithstanding maarive noted the special 
attachments were developed because the defense ministry was under 
pressure from small but influential ultraorthodox political 
parties 
the army official said distribution of the special attachments 
would begin next week in bnei brak a religious suburb of tel aviv 
maariv said a total of about 600000 attachments would be handed 
out 
the army official said the civil defense corps had been flooded 
with special requests since the gas mask distribution began 
every time a different group comes with different problems 
he said we have the children with asthma and the beardwearers 
were also a problem

san marino liechtenstein luxembourg smaller than 
many state parks in the united states these tiny european nations 
have an equal place at the paris summit table with the mighty 
united states and soviet union 
tuesdays session symbolized the egalitarian principles on which 
the 34nation conference on security and cooperation in europe is 
based 
a key speaker was chancellor helmut kohl of germany the master 
of europes economic powerhouse the chair was held by gabriele 
gatti head of government of sanmarino population 21000 
it may seem like a joke that tiny states surviving largely on 
the sale of postage stamps or on quirky tax laws attracting 
visitors to cheap dutyfree shopping take their place in such a 
lofty forum 
san marino has seven embassies but is normally represented 
abroad by italy which surrounds it liechtenstein has ceded 
diplomatic representation to neighboring switzerland 
but the presence of small states at this summit reminds mightier 
leaders of two crises they now face iraqs invasion of kuwait and 
the rising nationalism of numerically small peoples all over 
eastern europe 
edward fenechadami prime minister of tiny malta summed up the 
perils of ignoring small states in his summit speech monday 
the aggressive action by iraq is an eyeopener to the 
essential need for small states to receive special consideration in 
devising a realistic system of security he noted 
a common theme of many summit speeches has been the need to 
confront the enflamed ethnic passions in eastern europe where 
nationalism could undo the gains of democracy in the past year 
in its 15year history the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe has advanced by accepting that the borders 
drawn by world war ii which plonked millions of people in eastern 
europe outside the nations to which they culturally belong are 
final 
it must therefore now find a way to give voice to the demands of 
europes many ethnic minorities and accommodate emerging states 
such as the baltic lands of estonia lithuania and latvia 
soviet objections have guaranteed so far that the three baltic 
republics whose 1940 annexation remains unrecognized by the 
united states cannot attain even observer status at the 
conference 
washington says only that the baltics should eventually take 
their place at the csce but that it does not wish to meddle in 
moscows affairs by demanding recognition of baltic independence 
as so often in the 15 years of the csce it took smaller nations 
to bring the issue into the public eye czechoslovakias vaclav 
havel lauded by many speakers for his role in last years east 
european revolutions and denmarks premier poul schlueter 
this symbolized the vital part often played by the smaller 
states in bringing europe to the consensus that protects the 
interests of all csce participants and thus remains the principle 
of all its decisions 
at virtually all csce conferences the neutral and nonaligned 
nations those not in nato or the nowcrumbling warsaw pact have 
worked to mesh the rival demands of east and west on everything 
from human rights to the environment 
the tiny citystate of the vatican is another important player 
cardinal agostino casaroli the popes secretary of state gently 
reminded the summit monday that the holy chair is in fact a 
power 
although occupying a tiny corner of european territory casaroli 
noted the vatican is a power engaged in every part of the 
world exercising its universal mission

norway intends to set up a fund financed by a tax 
on its offshore oilfields to help less wealthy countries combat 
global warning norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland told 
leaders from 34 nations tuesday 
she told european and north american leaders attending the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe that environmental 
protection should be a significant part of any plans for regional 
or world security 
the rehabilitation of our european environment will be a test 
case of whether we are capable of dealing with our common 
responsibilities she said 
she called on the leaders to take the lead in the effort to 
save our common future such as in the negotiations in a world 
climate convention 
to implement environmental agreements wealthier countries must 
make financial and technological resources available she said in 
announcing the norwegian fund 
in oslo press spokesman egil helle at the oil and energy 
department said the tax would be on natural gas coming from 
norways extensive north sea oilfields 
norway is one of europes largest producers of oil and gas two 
of the principal hydrocarbons that when burned produce carbon 
dioxide a greenhouse gas that scientists say appears to be 
causing a rise in global temperatures 
mrs brundtlands minority labor party has said the tax would 
generate several hundred thousand dollars a portion of which would 
be used to finance the climate fund 
environmentalists have urged an international accord setting up 
a multilateral climate fund to help less affluent countries develop 
cleaner energy technologies and develop energy efficient systems 
earlier this year a global fund was set up at an international 
conference in london to help developing countries cut their 
emissions of ozonedepleting chemicals 
the united states which produces about onefourth of the 
worlds carbon dioxide has led the countries opposing a similar 
fund to deal with global warming

the city may be in danger of going broke 
but one facet of its economy is booming tourists are showing up in 
droves 
bookings are nearly double at the convention and visitors bureau 
and the trolley tour company tha takes people to the liberty bell 
and independence hall has added a second line and is considering 
two more 
visitors to independence hall last weekend said theyd heard 
about the citys fiscal mess but they had no second thoughts about 
making the trip 
that wouldnt keep us away said jamie robinson of san jose 
calif we traveled 3000 miles and were going to see all we 
can 
the only question is what happens if the money crunch gets so 
bad that trash pickup police and fire protection are affected 
short of that happening said bruce wolfepacke manager of the 
american trolley tour co i dont see the city going broke as 
affecting us 
the city isnt due to run out of money until after the 30 
million payroll on dec 14 the mayor the council and the state 
havent been able to agree on a rescue plan 
that doesnt worry tom muldoon president of the convention and 
visitors bureau 
the amount of money that the city is short is not an enormous 
amount muldoon said 
eventually they are going to work this out at city hall its 
just a question of who bites the aspirin or who owns the 
aspirin 
from july through october the bureau booked 134 convention and 
tourist groups in philadephia for a total of 127000 roomnights 
muldoon said thats up from the same fourmonth period of 1989 
when the bureau booked 101 groups for 65000 roomnights 
pat walsh of centipede tours a source of guides and 
transportation for tour groups all over the city said business is 
looking good for next year too 
we already have 500 tours booked for next year she said 
adding that her company averages 2000 to 2500 tours annually 
its early to have that many bookings she said i cant 
figure it out but ill take it 
all that brisk business comes in spite of direct economic 
effects on tousit attractions 
cityowned attractions like betsy ross house and the 
philadelphia zoo have suffered problems unseen by tourists such as 
hiring freezes and slightly curtailed hours 
and eight historic buildings at independence national historical 
park remain closed because the national park service didnt budget 
enough money 
in 1989 tourists spent 142 million in the philadelphia area 
of which 81 million went to local governments according to a 
report for the convention and visitors bureau 
the more than 4500 people employed in tourism contribute 
directly to city coffers through the wage tax of 496 percent on 
city residents and 43125 percent on nonresidents who work in the 
city 
nearly half of the citys 22 billion general fund comes from 
the wage tax no breakdown was available of how much tourism 
industry workers contributed but the overall tax raised 9182 
million last year and is projected to raise 9549 million in 
fiscal 1991 
other tourismrelated contributions to the city treasury include 
a 5 percent amusement tax on sporting events and concerts which 
raised 6 million for the 12 months ended june 30 and is projected 
to bring in 62 million this fiscal year 
a 5 percent hotel tax raised 78 million in fiscal 1990 and is 
expected to raise 87 million this year

here are the latest developments in the persian gulf crisis 
 
saddam hussein called on parliament to free all germans held 
hostage in iraq in releasing the germans the iraqi president 
contrasted bonns attitude with that of washington and london 
the decision of banning some foreigners from travel was 
adopted on the hope of giving reckless minds in the administration 
of president bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
an opportunity to delay in carrying on the procedure toward the 
abyss of evil ina quoted him as saying iraqi officials said 
approval was certain 
 
a group of 45 house democrats filed suit tuesday to try to force 
president bush to seek authority from congress before ordering a 
us military attack to drive iraqi troops out of kuwait 
the lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar bush from launching or 
initiating an offensive military attack by united states forces 
against iraq without obtaining a declaration of war or other 
explicit authorization from the congress 
 
in baghdad there was another sign tuesday that the trade 
embargo is having an impact the state press said the countrys 
legislature had voted to impose the death penalty on anyone 
hoarding wheat barley rice corn and other grains for trading 
purposes 
 
indian news reports said tuesday that iraq is refusing to allow 
an indian ship its crew and 14 red cross workers to leave until it 
unloads more than 4700 tons of rice the ship docked at the iraqi 
port of umm qasr in september with 10000 tons of food for indians 
in iraq and kuwait it had been scheduled to leave with some of its 
cargo 
 
iraq will release 122 dutch belgian and british nationals who 
completed a governmentcommissioned dredging operation a spokesman 
for the project said tuesday those being allowed to leave are all 
the westerners who worked on the dredging project run by the dutch 
companies volker stevin and koninklijke boskalis project spokesman 
gerard anneveldt said 
 
in a joint new york timescbs poll published tuesday 47 percent

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president 
bush are planning a january summit in moscow us and soviet 
officials said today 
us officials in washington said they were confident obstacles 
to a longrange nuclear weapons treaty could be resolved in time 
for the meeting and that setting a summit date could spur 
negotiations 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said bush is 
keeping to his plan only to hold a moscow summit if a strategic 
arms reduction treaty was ready for signing but they expressed 
confidence the outstanding issues could be resolved by the first 
half of january 
the two leaders discussed the treaty which would reduce their 
longrange nuclear missiles by up to 50 percent at a dinner 
meeting monday night said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
soviet spokesman vitaly ignatenko did not tie the summit to an 
arms reduction signing 
he said only us president george bush will pay an official 
visit to moscow at the beginning of january 
asked about an agreement he said if its ready they will 
sign it 
it would be the fourth summit for bush and gorbachev not 
counting their monday dinner 
its obviously within our grasp an official said of the 
elusive pact to reduce longrange bombers missiles and submarines 
if you dont use the summit as an opportunity it may slide 
away 
bush and gorbachev are in paris participating in a 34nation 
summit charting the course of the world now that cold war divisions 
have ended 
on monday leaders of nato and the warsaw pact attending the 
summit signed an agreement drastically reducing their conventional 
forces of tanks and other weapons throughout europe it is the most 
farreaching arms control accord in history 
bush had hoped to go to moscow in december to sign the start 
pact but negotiators are still wrestling with three major 
unresolved issues they are 
the kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the 
154 heavy groundbased ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles 
the soviet will retain under the treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against numerical weapons limits established in 
the treaty 
the restrictions to be imposed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies this issue primarily 
concerns arms washington would like to turn over to britain outside 
the treatys limits 
the two leaders held their first summit to get to know one 
another on board ships moored off the mediterranean island of 
malta in december 1989 
they met again in may 1990 in washington where bush and 
gorbachev signed agreements to eliminate chemical weapons and 
complete a treaty to slash longrange nuclear arsenals 
their last summit was in helsinki on sept 9 that oneday 
meeting was devoted largely to iraqs invasion of kuwait

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has no 
plan to resign from the cabinet his chief spokeswoman said 
tuesday denying speculation he would soon step down 
rumbles have sounded on capitol hill and elsewhere that yeutter 
was headed for greener pastures following completion of the 1990 
farm bill and the conclusion next month of international trade 
talks 
one of the latest to surface is that yeutter might be in line 
for an ambassadorship perhaps to germany if that should become 
available 
kelly shipp who has been yeutters press secretary since 1987 
when he was president reagans us trade representative said 
reports of his leaving the cabinet soon perhaps within 90 days 
are not true 
specifically on yeutter seeking or being touted for an 
ambassadors job shipp said that is not true absolutely 
patently false 
yeutter with shipp in his entourage just returned from a week 
of meetings in europe where the uruguay round of talks under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade is stalled over agricultural 
strategy 
the us view advocated vigorously by yeutter for years is 
that tradedistorting policies including export subsidies and some 
internal price supports are bad for everybody 
some countries share the us position but others notably the 
european community are still balking as a result the uruguay 
round of trade talks could wind up at an impasse on some of the 
major agricultural issues 
people have always speculated that the secretary was going to 
leave after the uruguay round shipp said but he never said 
that he doesnt feel that way he hasnt even focused on life 
after usda whenever thats going to be 
when presidentelect george bush chose him as secretary of 
agriculture in december 1988 it was reported that yeutter had 
really wanted to get back into the private sector after 3 years on 
the trade job 
there was also talk at the time that yeutter and bush had agreed 
the agriculture department commitment would last only through the 
formulation of the 1990 farm bill which is awaiting bushs 
signature and the conclusion of the gatt negotiations 
but shipp said yeutter made no such deal with bush he and the 
president never talked about his departure she said 
yeutter who will be 60 on dec 10 has an interest in a 
2500acre family farming operation in nebraska he holds 
doctorates in law and economics and has held many public and 
private posts including agriculture department service in the 
early 1970s and president of the chicago mercantile exchange from 
1978 to 1985

in his cartoons jules feiffer is a master at 
analyzing relationships between men and women 
he can capture the peculiarities of their anxieties with a few 
words and a few frenzied line drawings whats more his 
observations are scalpelsharp very funny and quick to the point 
but the writer runs into trouble trying to extend those 
observations into a whole evening of theater that was the problem 
with his last play elliott loves and it is the problem with 
carnal knowledge an older feiffer work that became a 
wellknown mike nichols movie some 20 years ago 
now the stage version finally has arrived in new york opening 
monday at offbroadways tiny 99seat kaufman theater and its a 
tedious evening of theater 
carnal knowledge the play seems like a darker more 
morose version of one of feiffers fine comic strips but stretched 
beyond endurance it flattens the actors and exhausts the audience 
the 1971 film version starred jack nicholson art garfunkel 
candice bergen and annmargret this production has the lure of 
three young stars jon cryer judd nelson and justine bateman plus 
one newcomer karen byers in pivotal roles none is shown to good 
advantage particularly in a disastrous second act 
carnal knowledge covers a nearly 20year period following 
two amherst college graduates from the late 1940s into the swinging 
60s the play is at its best in the opening scenes when the two 
college students sandy played by cryer and jonathan played by 
nelson solemnly discuss the mysteries of women and more 
specifically sex 
are you going to let your wife work goes one discussion 
is it better to love or be loved goes another 
sandy is a naive romantic jonathan a cynical lout whose vision 
of women never gets much beyond the bedroom sandy meets susan a 
woman who ends up being much too smart for him but who eventually 
is bedded by jonathan 
act 2 jumps nearly 20 years but the two lead actors dont seem 
to age at all the babyfaced cryer who is quite affecting in the 
first act as the innocent sandy looks completely out of place 
after intermission as an older successful doctor who does marry 
susan and has three children 
nelsons character is more intriguing but the actors 
performance doesnt vary jonathans repulsive onenote treatment 
of women eventually becomes boring and nelson emphasizes that 
relentless quality justine bateman gives a zombielike performance 
as susan and when the woman disappears after the first act she 
isnt missed 
but the women who replace her in the lives of sandy and jonathan 
a neurotic model played by karen byers and an aggressive mannish 
girlfriend played stridently by mimi quillin are even less 
sympathetic the evening degenerates into a series of unhappy 
conversations between two unhappy men about their unhappy love 
lives 
the barebones evening directed by martin charnin has the feel 
of a glorified workshop production the setting is minimal except 
for an unnecessary turntable that spins around several times for no 
discernable reason on the small stage 
charnin uses his actors remarkably well with the action 
shifting very quickly from conversation to conversation but the 
problem with carnal knowledge is that what these characters are 
talking about isnt very interesting in the first place

in a hollywood time warp a filmmaker 
is unearthing an ancient egyptian city built and buried not by 
pharaohs but by legendary director cecil b demille 
archaeologists are uncovering the city of the pharaohs erected 
for demilles 1923 silent film the ten commandments with as 
much enthusiasm as if it were a real egyptian city 
this is utterly unique said jarell jackman executive 
director of the santa barbara trust for historical preservation 
it gives you a sense of time having passed that movies are now 
part of history 
some archaeologist may be uncovering disneyland 500 years from 
now 
the movie city one of the largest sets in film history 
included walls 110 feet high and 75 feet wide the entrance was 
flanked by four 35foot pharaoh statues and 21 huge sphinxes 
when he was finished with the movie demille had the set buried 
in the local sand dunes 
a search of the northern santa barbara county site with 
groundpenetrating radar shows that much of the original set 
remains intact said archaeologist john parker who compared the 
readings with old charts of the movie set 
the readings show large objects in the place where the sphinxes 
should be leading excavators to believe the statues remain intact 
peter brosnan a los angeles screenwriter and documentary 
filmmaker is spearheading the campaign to get financing for the 
excavation project and secured a 10000 grant from the bank of 
america 
brosnan dug up one of demilles horse heads on a 1983 trip to 
the dunes about 150 miles northwest of los angeles and then 
started to preserve the site as a historical treasure 
its a hobby that got out of control he said 
on monday brosnan proudly showed off some unearthed treasures 
take a look at this guy he said thats the pharaoh 
brosnan will use the excavation to help complete a documentary 
video on demille and the buried set

plans to crack down on crime and boost the 
quality of education in new york city could be gutted by the 
states financial woes say city officials bracing for the loss of 
millions of dollars 
a plan unveiled saturday to wipe out a state budget deficit of 
nearly 1 billion will cost the city about 100 million this year 
gov mario cuomo said but mayor david dinkins said an initial 
review suggests these costs may be greater 
the cutbacks come after dinkins already announced plans for 
layoffs and service reductions to close a city budget shortfall of 
400 million this fiscal year and 16 million next year 
we have no buffer left lamented city budget director philip 
michael theres nothing left under a rock 
officials also say the lost revenues could cripple dinkins 18 
billion plan to hire 6500 more police officers and the citys 
agreement to increase teacher salaries 55 percent 
the plan to beef up the police department was to be paid for by 
a payroll tax on city residents and commuters that would require 
the state legislatures approval it already faced stiff opposition 
before cuomo announced his proposed cutbacks 
this is not the most positive climate for seeking any tax 
increase noted thomas reppetto director of the citizens crime 
commission 
cuomos plan also seemed to generate new pressure on dinkins to 
back out of the citys oct 1 agreement with its teachers for 55 
percent pay raises 
cuomo wants to reduce state aid to the citys schools by more 
than 70 million money city officials were counting on for the 
teachers raises 
schools chancellor joseph fernandez also said the budget cuts 
could result in the layoffs of as many as 4000 school employees 
most of them teachers 
united federation of teachers spokesman bert shanas said the 
union would fight to keep the increases 
as far as we are concerned we have a legal binding 
contract he said

president bush is considering rep lynn martin 
of illinois to succeed outgoing labor secretary elizabeth dole an 
administration source said tuesday 
martin who earlier this month lost a bid for the senate seat 
held by sen paul simon dill told bush last thursday that she 
was interested in the secretarys job said the source who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
a 10year house republican martin had talked to bush about the 
job immediately after she lost the nov 6 election and then again 
last week before he left for his thanksgiving trip to europe and 
saudi arabia the source said 
martin has also discussed the matter with presidential chief of 
staff john sununu the source said 
constance newman director of the office of personnel 
management is the other candidate most frequently mentioned to 
replace mrs dole who is stepping down this week to become 
president of the american red cross 
mrs newman one of the bush administrations highest ranking 
women is not discussing her job prospects said an opm spokesman 
he said he did not know if she had been contacted by the white 
house 
the administration source who said martin had been contacted 
said he did not know if the white house had discussed the job with 
anyone else 
martin was unavailable for comment tuesday because she was in 
oman representing bush on a ceremonial mission 
martin who gave up her house seat to make the failed effort to 
unseat simon would give the bush administration a cabinet 
secretary with strong congressional ties 
however martin has never had a close alliance with organized 
labor her best voting score from the aflcio came in 1988 when 
she got a 46 out of a possible 100 on issues tracked by the 
142millionmember labor federation 
when bush tapped mrs dole for the labor post two years ago his 
action was seen as a way for republicans to mend fences with 
organized labor leaders who had endured a hostile relationship with 
the reagan administration 
both martin and mrs newman would also give bush the opportunity 
to replace mrs dole with another woman martin is white mrs 
newman is black 
the source said he did not know when bush would make a decision 
about mrs doles replacement 
mrs dole 54 will officially leave office friday deputy labor 
secretary roderick dearment will serve as acting secretary until a 
replacement is named and confirmed by the senate congress does not 
return until january

budget cuts at massachusetts fairs 
have left some blueribbon winners seeing red 
dear mr dukakis what did you do with it all 
10yearold melissa belski wrote to the governor after learning the 
78 she won this summer for several entries would not be 
forthcoming due to a 300000 budget cut at the division of fairs 
melissa of great barrington felt she had earned that money 
she had entered two lambs a crossstitched sachet flower 
arrangements handdipped candles and photos 
she eventually got her prize money partly through donations 
from wellwishers who had read about her situation but others were 
not so fortunate said division director stephen f quinn 
the fairs were allotted the money after the fairs were all 
held and all was said and done i was informed that the monies were 
gone quinn said 
the cuts which came in a year when millions were slashed 
didnt attract much attention at first but since then the 
reaction has ranged from the girls letter to winners in greenfield 
giving their prizes back in a gesture of support for their local 
fair 
barber harold sears was among those who turned 200 back to the 
franklin county fair after learning it was having to come up with 
the prize money itself 
agriculture is the last thing that our politicians are 
thinking about and they control the purse strings this is one way 
of kind of satisfying ourselves a little bit that we are doing 
something worthwhile sears said 
larger fairs dipped into reserve funds to make good on prizes 
smaller outfits couldnt afford that quinn said 
many of the fairs hardest hit were in the berkshires including 
the great barrington fair said state sen peter webber webber 
hopes to get at least part of the lost 300000 restored when the 
legislature reconvenes 
its a promise that was made and they had every right to 
expect that if they won the prize thered be a premium paid he 
said 
quinn said he doubted fairs could afford a second year without 
prize money which would discourage exhibitors especially young 
people who rely on the prizes to defray travel and other costs 
everybody in the system is going to hurt he said

a national test should be created so 
graduating high school students can demonstrate to american 
business an ability to read write and compute at worldclass 
levels a business leader told a house panel tuesday 
business has lost confidence that a high school diploma 
reflects actual skills gained william h kolberg president of 
the national alliance of business told a subcommittee of the house 
committee on education and labor 
kolberg said the government must set up a framework for a 
national examination system that would be administered by the 
states student abilities would be assessed on the basis of 
predetermined national basic skills requirements he said 
there is growing controversy over the need to test all students 
leaving high school not just those interested in attending 
college kolbergs comments come less than a week after the head of 
the nations largest testing organization opposed the idea in a 
letter to the presidents education policy advisory committee 
gregory anrig president of the educational testing service 
said a proposed exam to judge students and their schools would be 
unnecessary unwarranted and wasteful 
the presidents panel reportedly is preparing to recommend 
national testing of all students in grades four eight and 12 
business certainly needs assurance that students have 
achieved a certain level of competency upon graduation no matter 
where in the country they went to school kolberg told the 
subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education 
the national alliance of business founded in 1968 by henry ford 
ii and president lyndon johnson is a nonprofit organization with 
2800 businesses as members 
a recent alliance poll of personnel officers at the 1200 
largest us corporations found that only 36 percent were satisfied 
with the competency of new employees entering the work force also 
business leaders thought that both reading and math competency had 
slipped in the past five years 
kolberg said a system of national standards coupled with 
assessment would ensure that every student leaves compulsory school 
with a demonstrated ability to read write compute and perform at 
worldclass levels in general school subjects 
while generally supporting the idea sol hurwitz president of 
the committee for economic development told the panel the 
government first must make sure that all students have equal 
educational opportunities that would require greater financial 
support for such early childhood education programs as head start 
he said 
william lurie president of the business roundtable said his 
association of more than 200 chief executive officers of large 
corporations is considering support in the next congress for an 
initiative to expand use of the national assessment of educational 
progress 
naep popularly called the nations report card is the only 
national assessment of what american students know and can do 
since 1969 nationwide samples have been taken in reading 
mathematics science writing history geography and other 
subjects

it could be a wet christmas for pilgrims in 
bethlehem this year because christian sects are squabbling over who 
should repair the leaking roof above christs birthplace 
there is little disagreement that the roof of the ancient church 
of the nativity needs fixing even last winter worshipers had to 
weave their way among buckets set out inside the basilica to 
collect winter rainwater 
but the question of who should perform the repair work gets 
tangled up in complex rules dating to the 1850s on which sect 
controls which section of the church 
unfortunately repair of the roof is not specifically mentioned 
in the codes 
clerics of the greek orthodox church traditionally clean the 
roof and they argue that this is precedent for doing the repairs 
twice in the past week once in the dead of night greek 
orthodox have sneaked to the roof to do the deed 
both efforts drew letters of protest from the roman catholics 
and armenians and on monday the israeli army intervened 
if youve seen the physical condition of the basilica you know 
the problems shmuel hamburger the israeli military governments 
liaison with the churchmen said tuesday the dispute between the 
three communities over who will do what in repairs means it goes 
unrepaired 
hamburger said the israeli government was willing to do the 
work as israel and other governing powers like jordan and the 
british did before 
now as in the past the three communities could send 
representatives to supervise he said 
greek orthodox church officials could not be reached for comment 
despite repeated telephone calls newspaper reports say the church 
is adamant that the roof is its property and can only be repaired 
by the greek orthodox 
the dark and musty church was built by constantine in the year 
330 and restored and enlarged in the sixth century by byzantine 
emperor justinian it is believed to be the oldest christian church 
in continuous use 
year round but especially at christmas pilgrims flock to the 
stone structure which stands above a grotto believed to be the 
site where the christ child was born 
tourism has been sharply reduced by both the threeyear 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and 
the morerecent persian gulf crisis but israeli tourism officials 
predict some pickup at the holiday 
the church has miraculously escaped most ravages of conquering 
armies legend has it for example that the persians left it alone 
in the seventh century because the garb of the three wise men in 
mosaics on the facade was similar to their own dress 
the roof didnt fare as well in 1482 edward iv of england 
supplied lead for a new roof ottoman turks removed it in the early 
part of the 17th century to make ammunition 
worship and maintainance of the church is regulated by a code 
known as the status quo that was developed by the turks to 
prevent just such disputes as the roof wrangle the code was 
accepted by the british jordanian and israelis 
the code is very specific for example the silver star that 
marks christs birthplace is dusted daily by the greek orthodox 
twice each week the orthodox and the armenians wash it the nearby 
manger is exclusively under roman catholic control 
george hintlian a spokesman for the armenian community 
believes the roof dispute will be resolved amicably 
this is a periodic repair hintlian noted it has been 
done twice under the israelis twice under the jordanians before 
them 
he said the situation called for cooperation when something 
is not part of the status quo it must be done by consensus 
hamburger says israel is willing to get to work asked if it 
could be completed by christmas he said 
it depends on the weather and so on

hiring halls are being revived for the 
citys hundreds of day laborers mostly immigrants who now crowd 
street corners in the largely hispanic mission district hoping to 
catch the eye of passing contractors 
corner job lines provide the best work prospects for unskilled 
often undocumented laborers with little or no english 
but the gatherings draw complaints from residents and businesses 
who say men discouraged by a fruitless day of waiting intimidate 
customers and make neighborhoods unsafe 
and labor advocates say disorganization and desperation leave 
day workers vulnerable to dishonest employers 
when its done in the chaos of the street you have the 
problem of people being cheated and people being hurt said san 
francisco supervisor jim gonzalez were hoping to restore 
dignity to people who just want to get a job if only for a day 
a 70000 pilot project expected to begin in february would 
provide access to jobs with fair wages a record of ones employer 
and services such as toilets telephone numbers where a worker 
could be reached in an emergency and a cup of coffee 
workers would show up at the hiring hall each morning and put 
their names on slips of paper that contractors draw from pools 
divided by skill gonzalez said 
the system is patterned after a program in los angeles 
about 60 of the 300 people who show up at two hiring halls in 
los angeles find work each day said bill molina coordinator of 
the los angeles day labor program by comparison gonzalez 
estimates only 10 percent of casual workers in san francisco get 
work by standing on a corner 
molina concedes that the 13monthold program helps just a small 
fraction of the 3000 workers who gather on los angeles street 
corners each day 
the weak link he says are the employers 
its the employers who still go to pick up day laborers and a 
lot of them are the unscrupulous employers who rip them off because 
they know the men on the street are desperate he said 
but molina and program planners in san francisco say success is 
not measured just by how many people find work each day 
i think the intent is to provide a more secure place to look 
for a job where more protection will be given them community 
services will be given them where contractors will be able to work 
in a much more orderly way said mauricio aviles a spokesman for 
the mission hiring hall one of the community groups working on the 
san francisco program 
chaos rules on street corners where jobseekers wait for 
contractors 
at the sight of a passing truck filled with lumber clusters of 
men rush into the street 
some reach for identification and green cards hoping to gain an 
advantage by their legal status how many people do you need 
they ask what kind of work how much do you pay 
workers have agreed among themselves not to work for less than 
450 an hour and for some jobs not less than 7 an hour said 
lina avidan of the coalition for immigrant and refugee rights and 
services 
by midmorning fewer trucks pass and job prospects wane 
how can 70 people get a job with 10 or 15 contractors a day 
asks jose esparza 21 who for the last 2 months has been crowded 
out in the hustle for jobs by new immigrants from central and south 
america 
before then he worked an average of two days a week said 
esparza who came from mexico when he was 11 
despite the pitfalls many jobless including esparza arent 
convinced that the hiring hall will actually get them more work 
we are not too happy but its a good way to find jobs its 
better than waiting in the employment office in a 50guy line and 
you get to the front and they say well call you said esparza 
here we work he said 
david schermerhorn a business agent at warehouse local 6 of the 
international longshoremens amp warehousemens union said he was 
pleased to see the union tradition being applied to unskilled 
workers 
we certainly need it im not saying the union we need to 
have something so the guys have some kind of organization 
schermerhorn said 
i drive by every day just wondering what it would take to make 
a connection with the guys and how to help them i know they are 
being abused and i havent figured out how to help them

night sky 
weve completed the search and we didnt find anyone and 
weve finished our part of the investigation said district of 
columbia fire department spokesman capt ted holmes 
although fire officials said after an allnight search that they 
doubted there were any victims in the rubble they sent rescue 
crews into the 60foot site to check one construction trailer that 
had been pitched into the hole 
upi spokesman milt capps said the news service was able to 
restore service quickly to its clients by switching some operations 
to other bureaus for example he said the los angeles bureau was 
temporarily filing the agencys main domestic news wire 
he said reuters was helping upi distribute photographs to its 
customers and that national public radio was helping the news 
agency maintain its broadcast and audio network services 
he said it was his understanding that the building housing 
the news service may have been undermined i am told that the 
alley way between the site and our building is virtually no more 
officials also ordered dirt hauled to the site in an attempt to 
secure it from further collapse 
the collapse caused cracks in several adjoining streets and 
forced police to cordon off a threeblock area 
representatives from the occupational safety and health 
administration arrived at the scene early today to supervise the 
investigation 
the cause of the cavein has not been determined said another 
fire department official battalion chief ambrose murphy said osha 
inspectors were schedued to meet with engineers and consultants 
this afternoon to discuss the accident 
three construction trailers and a van parked on the street 
adjacent to the site tumbled into the cavity about four blocks from 
the white house 
fire chief ray alfred said an employee of the contractor told 
firefighters he was the last person to leave the site and extensive 
explorations during the night confirmed no one was trapped in the 
hole 
subway service was closed at the station nearest the site monday 
night out of fear vibration from passing trains could make the 
cavein worse service at the station resumed today 
the cavein left several cracks on the street that serves as a 
major commuter route between washington and the heavily populated 
northern virginia suburbs murphy said several surrounding streets 
would remain closed for several days 
at upi capps said some operations were switched to a upi 
computer center in suburban virginia capps said editors and 
writers would be working from press galleries in the us capitol 
and by laptop computer from various locations around the city 
he said he did not know how long it would take to make the 
building safe for occupancy

an assistant budget director for the citys 
traffic court division has been suspended because of nearly 2000 
in unpaid traffic tickets dating back to 1984 
according to court records t milton street owes 1967 for 19 
tickets violations included running a stop sign reckless driving 
driving without a license and driving an unregistered vehicle 
street a former republican state senator said he had no 
intention of paying the fines and didnt have the money to do so 
streets son t milton street jr also was suspended from the 
department he owes 876 in fines on 11 outstanding traffic 
citations authorities said 
traffic court officials said neither street is legally entitled 
to drive 
the streets and five other department employees were suspended 
without pay monday by traffic court president judge george twardy 
the judge said he ordered a review of all 206 traffic court 
employees for back tickets after learning of the elder streets 
unpaid tickets friday from a newspaper report 
of the seven employees with unpaid traffic fines the streets 
owed the most the judge said 
i think its a disgrace if our people here dont respond to 
traffic citations what are the people on the street going to 
do twardy said 
twardy said the suspended employees could pay their fines or 
request hearings to contest them but even if they resolve the 
fines their reinstatement is still subject to twardys approval 
street was hiring by the traffic court division last year at an 
annual salary of 30000 
i believe that judge twardy wants to get rid of milton street 
junior and senior and he directed a court supervisor to go through 
old tickets and find anything in milton streets name street 
said 
he said the fight is really a disagreement over policy he said 
he disagrees with the requirement that poor people who want to 
fight a ticket must post collateral first street said the practice

burmas military rulers have sentenced 
two opposition leaders to 10 years in jail their toughest move yet 
against the party that won mays general election a political 
source said tuesday 
in new york on monday the un general assembly took up a 
resolution demanding that the government free its political 
prisoners and expressed concern about its failure to hand power to 
the national league for democracy after its landslide poll victory 
a military tribunal in rangoon sentenced the leagues kyi maung 
and chit khaing on monday said the source who was reached in the 
burmese capital from bangkok and spoke on condition of anonymity 
kyi maung 72 was the partys acting leader and a retired army 
colonel he was considered a moderate and a potential mediator 
between the military and more radical opposition elements chit 
khaing 69 was in charge of the leagues publications 
most of the leagues other leaders are behind bars 
the source said it appeared the two were sentenced for violating 
burmas official secrets act an offense which carries a maximum 
14year term the government detained them under the act on sept 
6 
western diplomats said then it appeared they were accused of

the weakening ruble would become the only legal 
currency in the soviet union under legislation tentatively approved 
tuesday by one chamber of the national legislature 
the official tass news agency said the proposed law was aimed at 
halting dollarization of the soviet economy the rapidly 
growing use of us dollars in both the official and underground 
economies 
yuri blokhin a legislator who introduced the bill in the soviet 
legislatures council of nationalities said a national currency 
policy was necessary to boost the rubles purchasing power 
but it was unclear how the legislation if enacted would effect 
the scores of jointventure businesses now operating in the 
country or how it would fit into president mikhail s gorbachevs 
plan to create a market economy 
it was also uncertain how the law would be received by the 
secessionist republics such as the baltic states which have been 
considering establishing their own currencies 
to become law the legislation requires approval by both 
chambers of the supreme soviet parliament no date was set for 
further consideration 
ivan ivanov deputy chairman of the governments foreign 
economic commission acknowledged the bill was a temporary measure 
that would have to be replaced once the ruble becomes convertible 
on foreign exchange markets 
officials have said they intend to make the ruble convertible in 
stages they have not announced a timetable 
soviet citizens hold an estimated 324 million worth of foreign 
currency acquired mostly from tourists and work for foreign 
companies 
ivanov said the law would let banks and soviet citizens buy and 
sell foreign currency only at stock exchanges and auctions at 
marketdetermined rates current law requires all currency 
transactions to be conducted through the governmentrun banking 
system 
since aug 1 soviets have been permitted to spend the foreign 
currency at special stores without telling the government where 
they got the money only certain soviets are permitted to have 
foreign currency bank accounts such as those who have worked 
abroad or for foreigners 
such stores range from governmentrun beriozka stores 
selling food alcohol and luxury goods to the foreignowned 
christian dior fashion outlet two westernstyle supermarkets and 
two pizza hut restaurants they accept only foreign cash or credit 
cards 
ivanov said the legislation would prevent foreign currency from 
being circulated as legal tender within the soviet union 
tourists can buy about 55 rubles for one dollar but the black 
market rate is closer to 20 rubles per dollar for some 
transactions such as taxi rides dollars or american cigarettes 
are preferred to rubles 
the government recently slashed by 70 percent the exchange rate 
for international commercial transactions to spur exports and cut 
imports the rate since nov 1 has been 18 rubles per us dollar 
compared with the previous rate of 56 rubles to the dollar 
the demand for dollars has soared in recent years because 
thousands of soviets are taking advantage of newly relaxed border 
controls to travel abroad for the first time 
the government has its own huge foreign currency reserves but 
no official statistics exist on it and the law apparently would not 
affect it

home building plunged 6 percent in october 
the government said tuesday extending the longest construction 
slide on record and sinking housing starts to their lowest level 
since the 198182 recession 
industry observers pointed to shrinking consumer confidence and 
the growing inability of builders to obtain credit as causes of the 
ninemonth decline the longest since the government began keeping 
track in 1959 
many believe the slide will continue into mid1991 especially 
in light of broader weakening in the us economy 
consumers are scared to death economist martin regalia of 
the national council of savings institutions said echoing the 
sentiments of many analysts theyre concerned about their 
incomes 
business confidence is just as bad added thomas holloway 
an economist with the mortgage bankers association were also 
seeing the adverse impact of builders unable to get credit 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
in october fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 104 
million units that was lowest level since construction of 902000 
units began in june 1982 
the details of the october housing starts statistics indicate 
that the industrys condition is even more dire than had been 
thought said marilyn schaja an economist with donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette a new york securities firm 
she noted that applications for building permits fell 68 
percent to 925000 the lowest level since 913000 applications 
were filed in june 1982 indicating that a rebound in starts is 
not foreseeable in the immediate future building permits are 
often a barometer of future activity 
construction of singlefamily units dropped 10 percent to 
854000 units a level regalia said was approaching recessionary 
levels which are the low 700000s 
but for dan pincus a builder in brick nj its almost 
better to admit were in a recession so we can start talking about 
how to get out of it 
customers are just running into holes pincus said forcing 
his firm to lay off most of its workers and cancel projects the 
crews that remain and his suppliers and subcontractors are being 
asked to wait for payment until his houses are sold 
my cash flow has been stretched to the limit he said 
were down to building one house now where we would have had 
three or four previously 
the construction industry has lost 185000 construction jobs 
nationally in the last five months including 80000 in october 
the labor department reported recently 
analysts also point out that declining construction often means 
declining sales of appliances furniture and other home furnishings 
as well as building supplies 
construction of multifamily units such as apartments and 
condominiums plummeted 233 percent to 187000 units after a 173 
percent drop in september 
analysts point to high vacancy rates in many areas of the 
country which make builders hesitant to begin new projects and 
lenders reluctant to make new money available 
the vacancy rates the overbuilding have left us with 
inventories that suggest this weakness will continue regalia 
said 
in addition some contractors are waiting for the government to 
issue regulations designed to make apartments more accessible to 
the handicapped before committing themselves to new projects 
starts in the northeast scene of some of the slowest housing 
activity recently shot up 385 percent to 144000 units but 
starts were down elsewhere 169 percent to 266000 units in the 
west 104 percent to 395000 units in the south and 25 percent to 
236000 units in the midwest

dan peter tom ted and sam are 
on the duty roster bryant and willard have come and gone but the 
juice has just arrived for thanksgiving football 
they are part a multinational force invading saudi arabia no 
its not a military exercise for operation desert shield its an 
influx of media soon to be joined by white house reinforcements 
for thanksgiving day 
as of tuesday 517 journalists had registered with the joint 
information bureau the media center run by the american military 
and the saudi government since operation desert shield was 
deployed in august more than 1200 journalists have signed on 
more than 300 are flying with president bush due to meet and 
greet the troops on thursday 
from abc to the voice of america from the american spectator to 
the wall street journal reporters are combing the sands theres a 
veritable cornucopia of alphabets cbs nbc cnn bbc itn and 
paos which is militaryspeak for public affairs officers whose job 
is to escort the media 
its not just an american show there are reporters from 
britain france germany japan italy greece portugal brazil 
and egypt among others 
nobody is making a bigger splash than abc which has nearly 50 
people on the joint information bureau registry the network is 
running five shows out of saudi arabia including its nightly news 
program with peter jennings 
dan rather of cbs and tom brokaw of nbc fill out the anchor 
spots while cnn has a current crew of 19 
its been a major commitment on our part weve earned our 
stripes said jim miller who heads cnns operations in saudi 
arabia 
willard scott of nbcs today show broadcast live all last 
week and bryant gumbel was here earlier former football star oj 
the juice simpson arrived tuesday and will appear with us 
marines on thursdays nbc program that precedes pro football 
the onslaught has turned the miniature golf course and a garage 
roof of the main media hotel into satellite alley because so 
many of the dishes are bouncing signals off orbiting electronic 
stations 
nearby is a carpeted and air conditioned tent that will serve as 
the white house media center joint information bureau officials 
have told some paos they will be so busy that they should postpone 
their turkey dinners for a day 
the media glare is a bit bewildering to the saudis whose 
islamic kingdom has never before been under such scrutiny 
the government has entertained heads of state and accompanying 
reporters and hundreds of moslem reporters come to saudi arabia 
each year to cover the pilgrimages to mecca and medina 
but there has been nothing like this and requests for 
additional visas by american newspapers and organizations run in 
the thousands according to mohamed khayat of the ministry of 
information 
some of those awaiting admission may be disappointed and others 
may only get visas good for two to four days 
friendly countries have sent their children here to defend 
saudi arabia and they want to get news about their children we 
understand this khayat said 
there is no limit but we think the number is sufficient it 
covers the major media organizations he said 
privately saudi officials are edgy over the number of 
journalists one government official who asked not to be identified 
said no more visas would be issued at least until bush and the 
white house press corps are long gone 
another official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
restrictions were imposed on new visas because of reports about a 
protest in which saudi women drove their own cars 
women sent to cover the story must observe some restrictions 
imposed on saudi women like the driving ban but it hasnt 
stopped them from working 
women now represent the washington post los angeles times wall 
street journal philadelphia inquirer national public radio voice 
of america dallas morning news new york newsday associated press 
and all the us television networks 
transportation can be a problem for women reporters if military 
escorts arent available 
molly moore of the washington post said she spent about 200 for 
a cab to take her to a military base and wait for her for six 
hours 
the biggest headache for me is not being able to drive or rent 
a car ive spent a fortune in cab fares but other than driving 
they havent stopped me from anything i wanted to do ms moore

the iraqi parliament acting at the behest 
of president saddam hussein voted tonight to free all the 
remaining germans held in iraq and occupied kuwait 
parliament speaker saadi mahdi saleh said there were 124 germans 
still in iraq and kuwait no specific arrangements were made for 
their departure and there was no indication when they would be 
freed 
it was not known how many member of the 250member national 
assembly attended the session to consider saddams request only 
one lawmaker jamil sheik issa voted against the measure 
earlier this week saddam said all foreigners would be allowed to 
leave between dec 25 and march 25 but information minister latif 
nassiyif jassim indicated monday that some might be allowed to 
leave earlier 
earlier reports said there were about 280 germans in iraq and 
kuwait with some held at strategic sites to ward off a possible 
attack by the usled multinational force the vote today referred 
to 124 germans and there was no explanation for the discrepancy 
hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving iraq and 
kuwait since iraq seized the emirate aug 2 
saddam told delegations from france and switzerland on monday 
that more europeans would be allowed to go free the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
the report today on the meetings with a fivemember swiss 
parliamentary delegation headed by christian democrat opposition 
member edgar oehler and by french politician jeanmarie le pen did 
not say how many europeans would be released or when they would be 
allowed to leave 
on monday iraq announced an unspecified number of swiss would 
be allowed to leave in appreciation of the swiss delegations 
visit to baghdad 
ina said saddam told both delegations that dialogue should be 
used to solve the persian gulf conflict 
as human beings we are flexible in our way of thinking and 
behavior but on the basis of the right path humanitarian 
relationship and dialogue not threats the president said 
saddam again accused the united states of seeking to control the 
worlds oil reserves he also repeated his aug 12 statement that 
all the regions problems were linked to a solution of the 
palestinian problem 
the united states and its allies have said saddams attempt to 
absorb kuwait should not be linked to the palestinianisraeli 
dispute 
concerning the german hostages saddam said a recent statement 
by chancellor helmut kohl calling for a peaceful solution to the 
persian gulf crisis as well as the historic friendship between the 
two peoples prompted his decision 
the western allies have accused saddam of trying to use the 
hostage issue to try to split the alliance against him in 
releasing the germans the iraqi president contrasted bonns 
attitude with that of washington and london 
the decision of banning some foreigners from travel was 
adopted on the hope of giving reckless minds in the administration 
of president bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
an opportunity to delay in carrying on the procedure toward the 
abyss of evil ina quoted him as saying 
saddam allowed 120 germans to leave with former west german 
chancellor willy brandt earlier this month 
the call to the assembly to free the hostages referred to in 
iraq as guests was the same procedure used to free hundreds of 
french and bulgarian hostages 
iraq announced monday that 250000 more troops were being sent 
to kuwait saddams answer to bushs announcement nov 8 that up 
to 200000 more us troops will be sent to the gulf 
also monday information minister jassim declined to say if 
something short of an attack such as passage of a un resolution 
authorizing offensives would be enough to disrupt the planned 
hostage releases 
we are watching the situation said jassim when asked if 
such a resolution would block the plan 
at a news conference jassim declined to guarantee that 
westerners in kuwait could emerge from hiding without risking 
arrest and relocation to a potential military target five germans 
and two americans were reported arrested saturday in kuwait 
this is a procedural thing that is not related to the 
political attitude said jassim every foreigner should report 
to iraqi authorities so they can be registered and protected by 
iraqi authorities this is a matter of rules and regulations

a member of congress criticized the 
agriculture department tuesday for extending billions of dollars in 
loan guarantees to iraq for food from american farmers throughout 
the 1980s 
today the us is pledging to make war on iraq said rep 
charles schumer dny for the last seven years though we 
pledged the same country free credit 
schumer released a general accounting office report that says 
usda continued to approve credit guarantees even though 
agricultures risk analysis documents for fiscal years 1989 and 
1990 rated iraq as a highrisk market 
it seems that the us desire to build a strategic and 
agricultural trade relationship with iraq outweighed the apparent 
financial risks involved and discounted evidence of iraqs human 
rights violations the report said 
schumer chairman of the task force on urgent fiscal issues for 
the house budget committee requested the gao study he is a 
longtime foe of federal spending on agriculture programs 
export guarantees for iraqs purchases totaled 49 billion from 
1983 to 1989 another 500 million was approved in 1990 
when president bush announced the trade embargo after iraqs 
aug 1 invasion of kuwait a total 2 billion in debts remained 
under the terms of the loan guarantee program the federal 
government must pay the banks that extended the credit to iraq if 
iraq doesnt meet its debts 
the agriculture department has confirmed that private banks have 
begun asking it to make good on the credit guarantees which were 
used to buy wheat rice and other commodities 
not all of the 2 billion is due at once the loans are spread 
out some of them running through 1995 or later 
no money is lent directly by the department once a country is 
approved for the guarantee private lenders and exporters work out 
a plan with the foreign buyer subject to usda approval 
larry mcelvain director of usdas commodity credit corp for 
the foreign agricultural service said the government didnt start 
getting claims on iraqi loans until the trade embargo began

saddam hussein put his key pawns in the persian gulf crisis back 
into play again today by asking parliament to free all germans held 
hostage in iraq the national assembly quickly agreed 
the move came a day after saddam ordered the deployment of 
250000 more troops into kuwait their deployment would boost the 
number of iraqi soldiers in the oilrich emirate to about 430000 
there was only one dissenting vote when the national assembly 
met late today and voted to allow all germans to leave iraq and 
kuwait no specific arrangements were made for the germans 
departure 
parliament speaker saadi mahdi saleh said there were 124 germans 
in iraq and kuwait a number far below the estimated 280 germans 
reported earlier there was no explanation of the discrepancy 
saddam told delegations from france and switzerland on monday 
that more europeans would be allowed to go free the official iraqi 
news agency reported and a dutch company reported today that 105 
dutchmen 14 belgians and 3 britons who completed a 
governmentcommissioned dredging project also will be allowed to 
depart 
hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving iraq and 
kuwait since saddams troops overran the emirate aug 2 and the 
western allies have accused saddam of trying to use the hostage 
issue to try to split the alliance against him

saddam allowed 120 germans to leave with former west german 
chancellor willy brandt earlier this month 
saddams troop buildup was a clear response to bushs 
announcement nov 8 that up to 200000 more troops would be sent to 
the gulf giving the usled multinational force an offensive 
military option and bringing the number of us troops in the 
region to about 430000 
gen colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
told abcs good morning america today that the united states 
would closely monitor troop movements 
it seems to me this is part of saddam husseins 
headlineoftheday program yesterday it was troop buildup the 
day before that it was a hostage release powell said what 
hes trying to do is take the worlds eye off the ball and that 
ball is his aggression against the nation of kuwait his aggression 
in the region his threatening our economic lifeline 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the announcement 
of iraqs new deployment another instance of him saddam 
thumbing his nose at the united nations the un security 
council has passed 10 resolutions including a trade embargo in 
an effort to force iraq out of kuwait 
in baghdad there was another sign today that the trade embargo 
is having an impact the state press said the countrys legislature 
had voted to impose the death penalty on anyone hoarding wheat 
barley rice corn and other grains for trading purposes 
indian news reports said today that iraq is refusing to allow an 
indian ship its crew and 14 red cross workers to leave until it 
unloads more than 4700 tons of rice the ship docked at the iraqi 
port of umm qasr in september with 10000 tons of food for indians 
in iraq and kuwait it had been scheduled to leave with some of its 
cargo 
on monday president bush failed to get soviet agreement on a 
proposed un resolution authorizing force against iraq president 
mikhail s gorbachev went so far only as to agree that force in the 
gulf cannot be ruled out officials said 
bush met with gorbachev in paris attending a summit that 
included the signing monday of an arms reduction treaty by nato and 
warsaw pact members 
his secretary of state james a baker iii has been pressing 
hard in meetings with foreign ministers for a un resolution 
authorizing an attack to drive iraq from kuwait 
bush focused in large part on the issue in a dinner with the 
soviet president 
later fitzwater tried to minimize differences between the two 
leaders on the use of force saying we are united on this issue 
we have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out 
a poll published today meanwhile indicated americans are 
increasingly worried that bush favors the military option over the 
diplomatic route to resolve the persian gulf crisis 
in the joint new york timescbs poll 47 percent of respondents 
said the bush administration has been too quick to get us forces 
involved and has not been diligent enough about seeking diplomatic 
solutions 
only 38 percent felt the same way in august the poll said 
the poll of 1370 adults was done by telephone nov 1315 it 
has a margin for error of 3 percent

the communist party newspaper pravda on tuesday 
took a grim inventory of the soviet pantry for the winter and 
warned that almost everywhere supplies are worse than last 
year 
although it predicted there would be no real hunger in the 
coming months pravda said the food that russians traditionally 
count on such as cabbage and beets will be in short supply 
cabbage soup and porridge is our food its a famous russian 
proverb it appears that now we cant even get this humble 
portion pravda correspondent a platoshkin wrote 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak on monday made a public appeal 
to the west for emergency food aid for his city the secondlargest 
in the soviet union to avoid famine and discontent with the reform 
movement 
president mikhail s gorbachev who is lining up western aid for 
his nation during his current trip abroad admitted in a speech to 
the national legislature friday that the country faces critical 
shortages at the start of winter but insisted the government has 
enough supplies 
the pravda correspondent said he agreed with gorbachevs 
assessment that there were adequate reserves although he also 
wrote that whats in storage doesnt mean it makes it to the 
table 
pravda said there should be enough bread for the nation after 
the government bought 66 million tons of grain which is more than 
last year 
but vegetables potatoes and other foods were in short supply 
the reason for the shortages according to pravda is that 
enterprises in the various republics are disobeying orders from the 
central government to fulfill their quotas 
as the soviet republics push for local control over their 
economies political structures and culture they are disregarding 
orders from the central government this has caused the paralysis 
of power that has stalled gorbachevs reforms and led him on 
saturday to propose restructuring the executive branch of 
government and put it entirely under his control 
he said saturday an emergency program would be drafted within 
two weeks to try to solve the countrys food shortage 
in the vast russian republic which has more than half the 
countrys population the potato supply is little more than half of 
what is needed pravda reported 
potatoes are known as the second bread because of their 
importance in the russian diet 
sometimes it was our first and last bread platoshkin 
wrote it could be called our national love we devote many 
proverbs and songs to potatoes 
but maybe at the present moment were going to have to play 
a funeral dirge he said noting that the many potatoes stored in 
dirty damp cellars will rot before the winter is out 
the article did not address the potato needs for moscow where 
citizens and soldiers helped gather this autumns potato crop 
following heavy rains that hindered the harvest 
pravda said there also were shortages of other basic foods 
fresh and sour cabbage carrots beets tomatoes and the russian 
favorite pickled onions 
only garlic was in oversupply it said 
in the ural mountains cities of sverdlovsk chelyabinsk and 
tyumen there is an critical shortage of meat and dairy products 
pravda said 
at sobchaks urging leningrads city council voted last week to 
begin rationing meat poultry eggs flour butter and other 
staples starting dec 1 many other cities throughout russia and 
the ukraine already ration food sugar vodka matches soap and 
other necessities 
in an interview with the associated press sobchak said some 
people in leningrad had accused him of being too proud to ask for 
help but that for the good of the city he would get down on my 
knees if necessary 
sobchak a member of the supreme soviet legislature is the 
first highlevel soviet official to appeal publicly for food 
donations from the west he said the west german government and a 
private us organization americares already were preparing 
shipments 
a month ago i thought we could avoid foreign aid today i 
think we cant he said the food situation has worsened and 
by the time we take steps to increase stockpiles and improve 
distribution we could already have placed our major cities in 
danger of famine

nothing was so memorable about michael heseltines 
years in the cabinet as his departure 
he resigned in the middle of a meeting in january 1986 walked 
out of the prime ministers residence told reporters he had quit 
and walked down downing street alone 
the videotape of heseltines exit has been shown repeatedly on 
british television every time some ruckus in the conservative 
party hinted prime minister margaret thatchers position was in 
jeopardy 
just as often heseltine would say as he said as recently as 
nov 6 that he could not foresee the circumstances in which he 
would challenge her eight days later he changed his mind and 
launched the most serious political challenge to mrs thatcher in 
her 11 years in power 
on tuesday he forced mrs thatcher into a secondround ballot 
to determine the party leadership and that of the nation 
tall and handsome with flowing blond hair and piercing blue 
eyes the 57yearold heseltine is a selfmade millionaire who 
doesnt quite fit any faction of the governing conservative party 
critics accuse him of volatility and showmanship as his 
challenge to her leadership loomed thatcher aides commented all 
glamour and no substance 
the most famous story about heseltine dates from his days at 
oxford university when he is said to have sketched his future 
decade by decade on the back of an envelope 
according to his unofficial biographer and fellow conservative 
lawmaker julian critchley heseltine marked down his goal for the 
1990s downing street 
as he finally made his move for the prime ministers office and 
the tenancy of 10 downing st heseltine denied the story of the 
back of the envelope but his ambition nurtured for years in 
political exile has not been disguised 
he is a politician with a flair for the dramatic gesture and 
the patience to wait for the prime minister to stumble 
critchley an admirer but no longer a close friend describes 
heseltine as 95 percent calculation and 5 percent celt a 
reference to heseltines passion and his birth in wales 
as defense secretary from 1983 to 1986 at the height of the 
propaganda battle over the deployment of us nuclear missiles in 
britain heseltine donned a flak jacket for a confrontation with 
antinuclear protesters at a missile base 
politically hes dead center in the party while mrs thatcher 
stands well to the right but many on the tory left distrust him 
for views that include an enthusiastic advocacy of a us program 
that requires the unemployed to work for welfare 
he calls his political philosophy caring capitalism which 
contrasts with the robust selfmade stance of thatcherism 
i find it difficult to reconcile with what i understand to be 
the core of tory philosophy that there are people sleeping in the 
doorways of so many central london streets heseltine said in a 
recent interview with the independent on sunday 
mrs thatcher attacked him for his economic views which she 
said smacked of the policies of the socialist labor party and of 
the soviet union 
heseltine was environmental secretary in mrs thatchers first 
cabinet the golden boy who seemed destined for bigger things in 
1983 he became secretary of defense 
the rift came in 1986 in a dispute over the acquisition of the 
financially troubled british helicoptermaker westland plc 
heseltine always proeuropean favored a european consortium while 
mrs thatcher favored a us corporation sikorsky 
the feud culminated in heseltines walkout from a cabinet 
meeting 
heseltine then conducted a patient campaign of a leader in 
waiting he has swept round the country addressing party meetings 
spreading good will and glamour and assiduously avoiding direct 
criticism of mrs thatcher 
subtle criticisms however were always there particularly 
about her combative stance against the rest of the european 
community and a controversial new local government tax the 
socalled poll tax 
michael ray dibdin heseltine was born march 21 1933 into a 
middleclass welsh family his father was a structural engineer 
starting with 2000 from his grandfather he made one fortune 
in property and then another in magazine publishing 
he and his wife anne who have two daughters and a son have a 
magnificent house in londons belgravia district and a country 
mansion where he has planted 2500 species of trees and shrubs it 
also has a lake for his lifelong hobby of birdwatching 
i havent been driven by money heseltine once said i saw 
money as an important part of the process of being independent 
and in enabling me to pursue a political career

the milli vanilli duo said today they made a 
pact with the devil when they pretended they sang on a hit 
album and they contended it was all with the knowledge of their 
record company 
we were scared people threatened us said milli vanilli 
member rob pilatus at a news conference today but were happy 
that its over 
pilatus declined to say who threatened him and partner fabrice 
morvan but he said arista records president clive davis knew about 
the deception that has rocked the pop music industry arista has 
denied the allegation 
arista records and their executives did not know that rob 
pilatus and fab morvan did not sing on the milli vanilli album and 
any assertions to the contrary are false and libelous the 
company said in a statement today 
milli vanilla was stripped of its grammy on monday the first 
act forced to return a grammy in the 34year history of the award 
the national academy of recording arts amp sciences rescinded the 
1989 best new artist grammy one day before the two planned to 
surrender the honor 
pilatus said the album gave them fame and fortune but it came 
at a high cost he said they were seduced by the money and success 
because they were poor and living in a munich housing project 
you get something for that you make a pact with the devil 
said pilatus 
goaded by the media to prove they could sing pilatus cursed and 
said ill do it the two then burst into a few lines from the 
song girl you know its true from their the bestselling album 
by the same name 
the duo admitted last week that they did not sing a note on the 
album they also lipsynced at concerts and on the grammy awards 
show in february the album sold about 7 million copies 
pilatus 25 from germany and morvan also 25 and a native of 
the caribbean island of guadaloupe were stripped of its best new 
artist grammy award following revelations that other singers 
substituted for the pop duo on girl you know its true 
this is the first time this has ever happened in grammy 
history academy president michael greene said i do think its 
an isolated incident we are as upset about it as the public has 
the right to be 
greene said academy trustees voted overwhelmingly to take back 
the award a decision on what to do with it will be made by an 
academy subcommittee dec 5 
greene said the duos wish that it be given to the three singers 
who actually sang was not a possibility 
the academy recognizes packaging groups is part of the music 
industry greene said but misleading record labels are 
unacceptable he said the album label said vocals rob and 
fab that was just absolutely false he said 
milli vanillis german producer frank farian who disclosed the 
deception said in a statement that by returning the grammy rob 
and fab can put this episode behind them and mark the beginning of 
a new career for themselves 
vocalists johnny davis charles shaw and brad howell reportedly 
were the real singers 
im very pleased that its coming out im pleased that 
they are taking action in america shaw said on mondays 
entertainment tonight 
shaw said he earlier tried to persuade people he was one of the 
singers but getting anyone to believe him was like running my 
head into a brick wall 
meanwhile an oakland woman who bought her son a milli vanilli 
tape filed a class action lawsuit in state court monday seeking a 
refund for anyone in california who bought the groups recordings 
or attended one of their concerts 
i want everyone to be able to get money back i dont want the 
producer in germany to profit from what he did to these kids 
sheila stalder said 
the lawsuit also seeks to recover profits and place them in a 
trust benefiting consumer groups as outlined in the states 
consumer protection law said stalders lawyer alan caplan

the pentagon said tuesday that iraqs 
announced plan to send 250000 more troops to kuwait may be only a 
psychological ploy but left open the possibility that even more 
american gis could be deployed in response 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
that because new iraqi reinforcements may lack adequate training 
and supplies their deployment to kuwait could hurt rather than 
help saddam husseins warmaking ability 
its not clear that large numbers of additional probably less 
capable units significantly adds to his combat power in theater 
and in fact might present him with new vulnerabilities rather than 
added strength powell said 
meanwhile 45 house democrats filed suit in us district court 
seeking an injunction to prevent president bush from ordering a 
military attack on iraqi forces in kuwait without first getting a 
goahead from congress 
the issue should be debated in congress because there are 
millions of american people in this country who have serious 
questions about going to war said rep ronald v dellums 
dcalif who organized the lawsuit the president of the united 
states on his own cannot make that kind of determination 
at the pentagon chief spokesman pete williams said officials 
hadnt seen the lawsuit in response to reporters questions he 
added that congress has been kept fully abreast of us military 
actions in the persian gulf 
members of congress have been informed consulted met with 
briefed by the pentagon and the white house on every aspect 
of this operation so far williams said 
on monday the staterun iraqi news agency reported that saddam 
had decided to form seven additional army divisions and call up 
more than 150000 reservists for active duty adding to our 
forces over a quarter of a million fighters 
iraq already has about 430000 troops in kuwait and southern 
iraq according to pentagon estimates facing off in the gulf area 
against 230000 american troop and at least 100000 others sent by 
us allies and other arab nations 
two weeks ago bush announced plans to send us reinforcements 
to the gulf that are expected to increase the american force to 
about 430000 by january 
in an interview today with cbs this morning powell said he 
doubted that bush would answer saddam titfortat with still more 
troop deployments the chairman said the latest iraqi buildup plan 
may simply put fresh troops in kuwait to replace rather than to 
reinforce those that have been there since the aug 2 invasion 
williams however stressed that it was too early to know 
whether saddams latest announcement would require a us response 
of additional troop deployments but he said a further iraqi 
buildup could be a reason to send more american troops 
an increase in iraqi forces in kuwait from about 165000 in 
early september to 430000 in october was a key reason cited by 
the pentagon for bushs decision earlier this month to send in a 
new wave of us reinforcements 
williams said us military authorities would be monitoring 
iraqi troop movements for evidence of a buildup he said there was 
not yet any such evidence 
its hard to know whether this is something iraq intends to do 
or whether this is just a propaganda ploy to get the attention off 
its occupation of kuwait and the hostages williams said 
if iraq does follow through on this announcement it would be 
a further tightening of its grip on occupied kuwait just the 
opposite of what the world has asked iraq to do which is to 
withdraw from kuwait the spokesman said 
williams declined to comment on powells remark that additional 
iraqi troops in kuwait could give saddam new vulnerabilities 
although williams said the deployments could make it harder for 
saddam to defend iraqi territory in the event of a us offensive

praised france for its efforts 
through a french invitation estonia latvia and lithuania were 
able to take part monday in the opening ceremonies of the threeday 
summit meeting of 34 leaders

short by the soviet refusal to allow them status as independent 
states 
lithuanian foreign minister algirdas saudargas in a statement 
signed by his delegation said monday afternoon we were informed 
that our accreditation was no longer valid because of the soviet 
veto 
because csce decisions are made by consensus the soviet refusal 
to allow the baltic representatives to participate was final 
the three ministers said the soviet move rejecting their 
participation as independent states counters principles of the 
helsinki accords they said a growing number of countries supported 
complete and total participation of the baltic nations in the 
csce process

former defense minister michael heseltine today 
forced prime minister margaret thatcher into a secondround ballot 
in their struggle for leadership of the conservative party 
the close vote was a sharp setback to mrs thatcher who has 
governed britain for 11 years she won 204 votes from party 
members of the house of commons and heseltine received 152 votes 
if she had received two more votes from the 16 members who 
abstained she would have won on the first ballot 
if mrs thatcher loses the leadership of the party she would 
step down as prime minister 
i confirm it is my intention to let my name go forward to the 
second ballot a calm mrs thatcher told reporters outside the 
british embassy in paris 
t was expected however that some of her supporters would urge 
her to step down rather than risk a humiliating defeat 
the opposition labor party compounded the political turmoil by 
tabling a motion of no confidence in the government that motion 
which likely would be debated before the second ballot in the 
leadership contest could bring down the government and force a 
national election 
whatever the outcome of the current election in the 
conservative party a substantial proportion of that party will 
continue to have no confidence in whatever leader is chosen 
labor leader neil kinnock said 
a smiling heseltine greeted reporters outside his home i am 
overwhelmed with gratitude to my parliamentary colleagues who in 
such large measure have given me their support said heseltine 
who stood handinhand with his wife anne outside their home 
it is the end for her said conservative lawmaker robert 
rhodes james 
the 204 votes gave mrs thatcher a lead of 146 percent when 
she needed a 15 percent advantage to win outright 
in the second ballot on nov 27 a simple majority would be 
sufficient to win however other candidates would be free to step 
forward foreign secretary douglas hurd has indicated he might run 
against heseltine if mrs thatcher dropped out 
the prime minister learned of the result in paris where she was 
attending the 34nation summit on european security 
mrs thatcher had been at pains to keep up business as usual 
earlier today although the business last weekend included a round 
of lengthy interviews with newspapers about the leadership 
challenge 
mrs thatcher 65 had argued that heseltines economic policies 
were a betrayal of her freemarket crusade 
heseltine 57 portrayed himself as a thatcherite with better 
prospects than mrs thatcher he pointed to a flurry of opinion 
polls that showed voters would be more favorable to the 
conservatives if he were party leader 
he also promised to review an unpopular local services tax 
sponsored by mrs thatcher that is widely deplored as unfairly 
favoring the wealthy 
increasingly they are saying with sadness and reluctance 
that she must go heseltine said monday 
heseltines ambition to become prime minister had been evident 
ever since he walked out of his last cabinet meeting in january 
1986 he had insisted for years however that he could not foresee 
trying to unseat mrs thatcher 
mrs thatcher was first elected in 1979 and reelected in 1983 
and 1987 she has been in office longer than any european leader 
the conservatives burdened by high inflation high interest 
rates and the unpopular local services tax have trailed the 
opposition labor party in opinion polls for 16 months 
the socalled poll tax replaced the property tax with a flat tax 
on every adult millionaires pay the same as laborers and for many 
households the tax burden has increased 
the conservatives have suffered recent embarrassing losses in 
elections to fill vacancies in parliament 
the revolt in the tory ranks followed a 12nation european 
community summit in rome at the end of october eleven of the 
leaders over mrs thatchers vociferous dissent agreed on a 
timetable for establishing a central european bank followed by a 
single european currency 
her deputy sir geoffrey howe predicted that mrs thatcher 
would eventually fall into line with britains european partners 
as she had done in the past but with signs indicating the 
contrary howe resigned nov 1 
a week ago howe delivered a scalding speech in the house of 
commons accusing mrs thatcher of jeopardizing britains vital 
interests 
heseltine who has long advocated closer ties within europe 
entered the race for party lea 
heseltines resignation like howes and that of nigel lawson as 
treasury chief last year involved euroder the next daypean integration 
in 
heseltines case it was a row over whether a european consortium 
his choice or a us corporation would take over the ailing 
helicopter manufacturer westland plc 
all three former ministers also complained of mrs thatchers 
forceful and sometimes abrasive style

israeli troops attacked a squad of plo 
guerrillas near israels selfdesignated security zone in southern 
lebanon and one soldier and four guerrillas were killed in the 
firefight police said tuesday 
ten other guerrillas fled two bleeding of wounds they suffered 
in the nightlong clash with israeli troops and allied militiamen of 
the south lebanon army 
a lebanese army corporal driving on a nearby road in the 
foothills of mount hermon also was wounded 
the military command in israel confirmed the clash near this 
village about three miles north of israels socalled security 
zone 
it identified the dead officer as 1st lt yaron yogev 23 it 
said he was shot after his unit spotted and attacked the 
terrorist squad 
the battle with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades raged 
under parachute flares for eight hours before the israelis and sla 
militiamen pulled back to the security zone police said 
the bodies of the four guerrillas lay on the ground near ain 
atta for several hours after the israelisla force withdrew 
they may be boobytrapped explosive experts are needed to 
examine the corpses before removing them a police spokesman 
said he cannot be identified under standing rules 
he said israel and the sla apparently were tipped about an 
attempt to infiltrate the security zone 
the police spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to samir 
ghoshes palestine popular struggle front 
the group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed in 
beirut it identified those killed as mohammed omar sharif ahmed 
alamed both palestinians and samir izzidin shami and hamadah 
dafi who were lebanese 
the front backed and financed by libya is a hardline faction 
within yasser arafats palestine liberation organization it has 
seldom been involved in attacks against israel or its border 
enclave 
the wounded guerrillas are palestinians police identified them 
as the squad commander and his assistant but did not provide 
names 
they were seen heading back with eight surviving attackers to 
the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in eastern lebanon after the 
battle 
we belong to the palestine popular struggle front and libyas 
revolutionary committees one guerrilla shouted to a small group 
of reporters flashing his fingers in a victory sign ill shoot 
you if you take pictures 
israel staked out the security zone in 1985 when it withdrew 
the bulk of its invading army after a threeyear occupation 
the zone covers 440 square miles stretching from the 
mediterranean coast to the slopes of mount hermon it is controlled 
by the 3000strong sla which is backed by 1000 israeli soldiers 
radical palestinians and prosyrian lebanese leftist factions as 
well as iranianbacked shiite moslem fundamentalists are involved 
in guerrilla warfare to force out the israelis 
the israelis have left the security zone several times in the 
past few months in pursuit of guerrillas and a senior israeli 
official said tuesday the army would continue that policy 
when we think there are going to be terrorist attacks on 
israel from outside the security zone we feel that we have a free 
hand to act in order to prevent in advance attempts to 
infiltrate said yossi olmert director of the government press 
office 
olmert said there had been 17 infiltration attempts by land and 
sea this year in which 36 arabs and two israelis were killed 
none of them has reached israel itself and this is exactly why 
it is vitally important for us even more than before to emphasize 
the significance of this security zone as an effective buffer he 
told reporters

an aide to sen john mccain told the senate 
ethics committee today that sen dennis deconcini tried to coax her 
boss into meeting with federal regulators on behalf of savings and 
loan millionaire charles keating jr 
the committee explored the role of the two arizona senators in 
those meetings with federal regulators as it began a fourth day of 
hearings into allegations five senators improperly intervened on 
behalf of keating and his lincoln savings and loan 
todays testimony while a detailed and tedious contrast to 
dramatic declarations of innocence durig previous sessions 
revealed the divisions and conflicting stories among the five 
senators who are battling for their political reputations and 
futures 
gwendolyn van paasschen an economics aide to mccain testified 
she felt her boss was being coaxed along into a meeting with 
top sampl regulator edwin gray she said she felt deconcini wanted 
mccain there because as a republican he would lend a bipartisan 
aura to the meeting 
she was concerned she said because at the time of that april 
1987 meeting mccain had received more in campaign contributions 
from keating than had deconcini and thus stood to be more 
embarrassed if word of the meeting became public 
mccain went to that meeting but said he did so on his own with 
the understanding the agenda would be limited to a discussion of 
the length of federal regulators examination of lincoln and a 
disputed appraisal of lincolns assets other testimony has 
suggested deconcini went beyond that agenda to propose a deal with 
regulators on lincolns behalf 
it was my view that what senator deconcini suggested was 
inappropriate ms van paasschen said 
in addition to deconcini and mccain the committee is 
investigating sens donald riegle dmich alan cranston 
dcalif and john glenn dohio 
keating was a financial contributor to the senators campaigns 
and favored causes the collapse of his once highflying empire is 
estimated to cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion to cover 
federally insured deposits 
ms van paasschen also testified that riegle who is chairman of 
the senate banking committee was involved in setting up the 
april 2 1987 meeting with gray something riegle has denied 
under questioning by riegles attorney tom green she said 
learned about riegles role from mccain and others despite 
previous statements by her to investigators that she did not know 
the extent of riegles involvement 
ms van paasschen backed mccains assertion that he refused to 
negotiate with gray in the april 2 meeting according to earlier 
testimony mccains refusal prompted keating to call the senator a 
wimp 
committee special counsel robert s bennett has contended 
deconcini went beyond the agreedupon agenda for the meeting with 
gray bennett contends deconcini offered the regulator a deal on 
behalf of lincoln savings and loan saying the thrift would make 
more home loans if federal regulations limiting riskier investments 
were dropped 
mccains administrative assistant chris koch testified that 
mccain gave keating an angry dressing down in a march 1987 
meeting after being told keating was calling him a wimp for 
refusing to negotiate with gray 
mccain told mr keating he had not spent 5 years in a 
prisoner of war camp in vietnam to have his courage or integrity 
questioned koch said john said there were certain things 
he could do and certain things he couldnt do he said i cant go 
in and do your bidding for you i cant go in and break arms 
and legs for you 
in testimony monday bennett ridiculed senators claims that he 
invented ethical standards in suggesting they dealt improperly with 
keating 
in this body with all due respect are your standards a 
double one bennett asked monday are you above everyone 
else 
earlier monday deconcini delivered a fiery emotional defense 
of his own dealings in the last of the five senators opening 
statements 
bennett followed with a rebuttal to the senators in which he 
directly challenged assertions by cranston deconcini and riegle 
that there were no ethical rules that prohibited their efforts on 
behalf of keating a constituent and contributor 
the greatest deliberative body in the whole world you cant 
hack it under my standards bennett said these are not my 
standards these are your standards 
at issue is where the line falls separating appropriate help for 
a constituent from improper intervention with federal officials on 
behalf of a financial contributor 
deconcini angrily defending his honor and his political career 
repeatedly referred to bennett as special prosecutor not his 
correct title and accused him of seizing on rumors lies 
hearsay 
i submit this is disgraceful i submit there is a bias and i

british prime minister margaret thatcher waited 
only a few minutes tuesday to declare that she would fight on in a 
contest for the leadership of britain and the conservative party 
i am naturally very pleased that i got more than half the 
parliamentary party and disappointed that it is not quite enough to 
win on the first ballot she told reporters outside the british 
embassy where she had received news of the voting of party 
parliamentarians in london 
so i confirm that it is my intention to let my name go forward 
to the second ballot she added appearing determined and 
composed 
mrs thatcher failed by only two votes to gain a firstround 
victory over former defense minister michael heseltine she 
received 204 votes heseltine gained 152 and 16 conservatives 
abstained a firstballot victory required 206 votes but a 
candidate needs only a majority to win in the second round next 
tuesday 
mrs thatcher who was in paris for a european summit was 
expected to come under pressure from some of her allies to step 
down rather than prolong the contest the opposition labor party 
also sought to take advantage of the political infighting by 
proposing a motion of no confidence in her government 
after talking very briefly to reporters she went back into the 
embassy she had earlier warned her host president francois 
mitterrand that she might be a little late for the evenings 
entertainment in versailles 
earlier europes longestserving prime minister had busied 
herself with toplevel meetings and according to sources close to 
her avoided telephoning london for updates on the election 
mrs thatcher started the day in talks with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and mitterrand and continued with a series of 
meetings with the heads of state of turkey the netherlands and 
bulgaria the talks were dominated by events in the persian gulf 
sources said 
mrs thatcher voted by proxy so she could attent the paris 
summit of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
sources close to the prime minister said that her domestic 
political problems did not come up during the talks tuesday 
although several leaders did say good luck and all that

the warsaw pacts demise predicted tuesday by east 
european leaders may leave the countries searching for a security 
organization to substitute for the oncemighty military alliance 
hungarian prime minister jozsef antall declared the organization 
an outdated military structure and said it should be scrapped 
shortly 
we trust that the conditions for dissolving the warsaw treaty 
will be available before the end of 1991 but not later than spring 
1992 he said in a speech to a 34nation summit of the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe 
a day earlier czechoslovak president vaclav havel described the 
warsaw pact as an outdated remnant of the past 
it came into being as a typical product of stalinist expansion 
and was an instrument of subordination of the communist countries 
to the soviet union said havel in his speech to the conference 
reflecting antalls remarks hungary has been at the forefront 
of the drive to get rid of the military alliance which the soviet 
union set up in 1955 in response to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
some other members of the eastern alliance however are 
hesitant to get rid of an organization that despite its domination 
by the kremlin has provided security guarantees 
this is a big dilemma at the moment that no one has quite 
solved said jane sharp a senior researcher at the stockholm 
international peace research institute in sweden 
havel said he could imagine the warsaw pact remaining but only 
as a temporary consultative organization on disarmament issues 
antall didnt appear willing to go that far 
he told a news conference that hungary did not see any reason 
for keeping the warsaw pact around as a forum for discussions we 
do not consider the maintenance of a political organization 
necessary either he said speaking through an interpreter 
hungary czechoslovakia and poland are considered the most 
interested in turning closer to the west polish officials mindful 
of their border with a united germany in the strategic center of 
europe have been less forward about doing away with the warsaw 
pact 
the other warsaw pact members are the soviet union romania and 
bulgaria east germany pulled out when it merged with its western 
neighbor 
on monday the 22 nations representing nato and the warsaw pact 
signed a nonaggression pact declaring an end to their military 
rivalry and promising not to attack each other 
there had been some thought that the summit of the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe which opened on monday in 
paris could set the building blocks for an overarching political 
and security organization that would draw in all the 34 nations 
but that ambitious goal seems unlikely now 
the summiteers were expected to wind up their meeting on 
wednesday by promising to meet together more often and agreeing to 
set up a permanent secretariat in prague czechoslovakia 
that still leaves the east european nations in a quandary 
nato the 16nation western alliance has moved quickly in 
recent months to draw the east european countries closer to it a 
new liaison program was set up so that the countries ambassadors 
to belgium where nato is located would have access to the 
alliance 
but nato officials repeatedly insist they cannot invite the 
former soviet satellites to apply for membership because such a 
move would leave the soviet union isolated militarily it would 
be considered too provocative said ms sharp 
there are few alternatives 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis has suggested the 
european community the 12nation trading bloc set up a defense 
arm it could he said adopt the western european union a 
security grouping of nine nato nations 
were the east european nations to join the community in the 
future they would then have automatic security membership 
havel suggested that nato could become one of the supports of 
a new european security system 
if it agreed he told the conference the alliance should 
perhaps proceed at a substantially faster pace in changing inwardly 
and adapting itself to its new future 
with reduced eastwest tensions nato is trying to emphasize its 
political rather than military role 
havel suggested the western alliance might put together 
association agreements with other european countries he 
offered no details but such accords would be designed to bring the 
east european countries even closer to their western neighbors 
the eastern nations could decide to shun any protectors at all 
and go it alone 
but ms sharp said the financially ailing countries may find 
that option difficult 
they cant afford too much in the way of a credible defense 
capability she said it costs a great deal to be credible 
neutrals

the white house said today it was very unlikely 
that president bush would be able before a european summit ends 
wednesday to muster support from the soviet union for a compromise 
united nations resolution on using military force against iraq 
just a few hours earlier bush had voiced optimism that some 
agreement would be found to overcome soviet objections saying 
just be patient and all will be well 
but as the summit wound down its second day white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said it did not appear that bush would 
have a deal in hand before he goes to saudi arabia on wednesday 
despite a lastminute meeting on the subject between secretary 
of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze fitzwater said i think it is very unlikely we 
would have anything specific while in paris 
he confirmed that several proposed draft resolutions are being 
considered for submission to the un security council dealing with 
use of military force in the gulf but he said our 
consideration of the resolution does not have a timetable 
meanwhile both soviet and us officials raised the possibility 
of a summit in january in moscow between bush and gorbachev 
we do not have a specific date at this point fitzwater 
said reiterating an earlier administration insistence that the 
summit be held only if a treaty to limit longrange nuclear weapons 
be ready to be signed 
the soviet statement made no mention of the treaty signing 
fitzwater said that the administration believed the treaty would 
be ready in january for signing thats what weve been hoping 
for and shooting for he said 
summit leaders from 34 countries meeting here on the future of 
europe in the post cold war era held a closeddoor session at the 
end of their business today but participants said the gulf crisis 
did not come up 
furthermore there will be no common declaration by the 34 on 
the gulf said hubert vedrine spokesman for french president 
francois mitterrand 
vedrine said no one brought up the matter 
neither bush nor gorbachev was on the list of those who spoke at 
the closeddoor session participants said that environmental 
concerns and immigration issues were among the topics discussed 
baker met for two and ahalf hours with shevardnadze and 
scheduled a second meeting with him later in the day a meeting 
between bush and the soviet president on monday night failed to 
produce a ussought statement from the soviet president endorsing 
a un resolution authorizing military force 
meanwhile bush conferred with president turgut ozal of turkey 
which is allied with the united states against iraq and accepted 
an invitation to visit turkey in the first half of 1991 turkey is 
letting american bombers use its airfields but has expressed 
little enthusiasm about a military confrontation with its neighbor 
during a picturetaking session bush said that nobody has 
been more steadfast than the turks and mr ozal i have no 
complaints only gratitude and im glad were together on this 
one 
asked if he had any complaints about soviet support bush 
replied just be patient and all will be well 
the gulf crisis has overshadowed the unprecedented summit of the 
34member conference on cooperation and security in europe 
hungarian prime minister jozsef antall told the summit today 
that he hoped the conditions for the complete dissolution of the 
warsaw pact will be created by early 1992 we are happy that 
the participating states of the warsaw pact have shown agreement 
over the dissolution of the military organization 
antall is the first warsaw pact country leader to talk about the 
complete demise of the pact and to offer a deadline in the past 
the leaders have spoken only of ending the warsaw pacts military 
function 
against the backdrop of the conference leaders held a flurry of 
meetings to discuss how best to get iraq out of kuwait gorbachev 
met with british prime minister margaret thatcher who has 
advocated military action against iraq thatcher also met with 
french president francois mitterrand who like gorbachev has 
counseled patience 
meanwhile us and soviet officials said bush and gorbachev 
were planning a moscow summit in early january at which they hoped 
to sign an agreement reducing their longrange nuclear arsenals by 
up to 50 percent us officials said bush would only go if the 
agreement was ready but they expressed confidence negotiators 
could resolve the remaining obstacles in time 
bush is trying to rally support behind a new un security council 
resolution that would authorize military action against iraq 
presumably if it does not end its occupation of kuwait by a 
specified date 
baker has been busy presenting the administrations case to the 
15 members of the security council still the administration has 
been having a hard time finding agreement on the language for such 
a resolution especially given gorbachevs reluctance to get on 
board 
during a picturetaking session with bush monday gorbachev was 
asked by reporters whether he favored force or patience toward 
iraq 
i think we all need patience the soviet leader replied 
but that does not mean that we are going to weaken or retreat 
from earlier un resolutions calling for an unconditional iraqi 
withdrawal 
we certainly will seek to resolve that situation and we must 
be firm in our position on that he added 
nonetheless administration aides said today that the white 
house remains hopeful progress can be made toward the wording of a 
new resolution but on the eve of bushs visit to the middle east 
agreement has yet to materialize 
after the 34nation summit on european security wraps up on 
wednesday bush will fly to saudi arabia for a thanksgiving visit 
with troops deployed in the persian gulf region 
the gulf crisis was the chief topic in 2 hours of talks between 
bush and gorbachev during mondays opening day of the summit called 
to discuss the future of europe in the postcold war era 
the conference resumed today to be capped by a starstudded 
ballet performance and dinner in the famous hall of mirrors at 
versailles palace 
amid the celebration of peace and the collapse of military 
rivalries in europe there was jarring news from the middle east 
iraqi president saddam hussein said he would send an additional 
250000 troops to kuwait nearly doubling the occupation force in 
the oilrich emirate the buildup apparently was in response to 
bushs decision to augment the 230000 us troops now in the 
persian gulf region by 200000 personnel 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called saddams 
announcement another instance of him thumbing his nose at the 
united nations which has demanded that iraq withdraw from 
kuwait 
further fitzwater said the buildup emphasizes that we must 
keep the pressure on with regards to un sanctions it also 
underscores the cynicism with which saddam hussein treats the 
hostages 
baker will take his lobbying to yemen and beyond later this 
week yemen is the only arab nation in the un security council 
and has in the past shown sympathy for iraq it will assume the 
councils rotating presidency in december 
after bushs meeting with gorbachev fitzwater said everyone 
agrees that you cannot rule out that option of military action 
yet he said the united states has not decided to actually seek 
the resolution on military force 
gorbachevs spokesman vitaly ignatenko said the two leaders 
came to the very important conclusion that not all the 
possibilities have been exhausted and the un resolutions already 
approved still have to be tried 
he said bush and gorbachev discussed the conceptual basis of 
what kinds of circumstances might exist that would require this 
option of military force to be pursued

overweight children have greater longterm 
success controlling their weight if their parents provide early 
support for exercising and eating right researchers said 
ten years after participating in a weightloss program as 6 to 
12yearolds children whose parents got similar weightcontrol 
training were significantly less obese than those whose parents 
received less training according to a study published in 
wednesdays journal of the american medical association 
we think the important finding is in the modeling said 
psychologist leonard h epstein head of the university of 
pittsburghs childhood obesity clinic and leader of the research 
team 
if you have children who you dont want to eat potato chips 
you cant sit in front of them eating hohos 
epsteins group also concluded that preadolescent weight loss 
had no effect on height development contrary to the findings of 
several shorterterm studies 
two other childhood obesity experts called epsteins results 
surprisin because previous research has shown that fat children 
will grow into fat adults and that weight lost in treatment 
programs is quickly regained 
those experts said further study was needed on whether treatment 
of obesity in childhood can produce effects that persist into young 
adulthood 
in epsteins project an initial group of 75 obese children and 
their parents were randomly assigned to three groups study 
criteria required the children be more than 20 percent over ideal 
weight for their age height and sex both parents living at home 
one of whom had to be obese and one parent willing to attend 
treatment meetings with their child 
all subjects were to attend eight weekly treatment meetings 
followed by six monthly meetings then by 21month fiveyear and 
10year meetings 
all were instructed to follow a regimen that included a 
1200to1500calorieperday diet and an aerobic exercise 
program 
in the first group both parents and children received 
reinforcement for losing weight and were trained to praise other 
family members for changing eating and exercise habits 
in the second group only the children received reinforcement 
for losing weight but were similarly trained to praise family 
members for weightcontrol behaviors 
parents and children in the third group received reinforcement 
only for attending the meetings they received information about 
social reinforcement without specific training in how to use the 
method 
all subjects lost weight initially at the 10year mark the 
children in the first group were on average 75 percent less 
overweight than at the beginning of the study while those in the 
second and third groups were 45 percent and 143 percent fatter 
respectively 
parents in all three groups were more obese after 10 years than 
at the start of the study 
in a journal editorial dr albert j stunkard of the university 
of pennsylvania medical school and dr robert i berkowitz of the 
philadelphia child guidance clinic cautioned that the treatment 
did not prevent obesity it limited it 
they called epsteins results surprising perhaps because of his 
relatively small study sample intact middleclass families in 
which the parents were likely to be very supportive of their 
childrens efforts 
they said replication of epsteins study is clearly needed 
before the findings can be embraced

a new aids vaccine candidate that has been 
shown to work in one chimpanzee was approved tuesday for early 
human clinical tests the food and drug administration announced 
the candidate vaccine was developed through the cooperation of 
the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases the 
national cancer institute and immunous inc a rochester mich 
branch of an austrian company 
at a news conference tuesday company officials said the 
clinical trials will test the safety of the vaccine and determine 
if the 60 test subjects develop antibodies against human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids this 
first step of human testing called phase i trials will not use 
aids patients 
if the vaccine proves to be safe and shows promise then phase 
ii trials will more thoroughly test for protection against aids a 
final phase of testing would be required before the fda releases 
the vaccine for general use 
the candidate vaccine is a geneticallyengineered synthetic 
glycoprotein that was derived from the envelope or skin of the 
hiv1 virus this part of the virus envelope is called gp160 the 
theory is that the bodys immune system will react to gp160 and 
develop antibodies these antibodies then would trigger an immune 
response in the body should there be contact with the hiv virus 
dr martha eibl director of aids vaccine research at immuno ag 
the parent company of immunous said that two forms of the 
vaccine were tested on four chimpanzees 
the chimps were injected with the candidate vaccine and then 
injected with the aids virus using a dose that is 100 times the 
amount needed to cause an infection in the laboratory 
all four of the chimps developed some immune response and one 
of the animals remained free of aids 
it has protected a chimp from productive infection for nearly 
three years eibl said of the candidate vaccine that is the 
longest protection up to now 
she said the human clinical trials will determine if the human 
immune system can develop a similar response 
dr robert belshe a professor of medicine at the st louis 
university school of medicine and coordinator of the clinical 
trials said that 60 volunteers at five clinical centers already 
have signed up the first in a series of vaccinations with the test 
vaccine will start next month he said 
belshe emphasized that although the candidate vaccine uses a 
synthetic model of a protein from the aids virus you cannot get 
aids from this vaccine 
he said the volunteers are not infected with aids and not at 
risk of catching the disease later clinical trials he said would 
include people who are at risk for aids 
belshe said that it could take eight to 10 years before the 
vaccine would be ready for general use 
fda officials said the candidate vaccine is the sixth to undergo 
early human clinical trials one of the others also involved the 
use of gp160 
the difference with the immuno vaccine is that it has had 
successful tests in chimpanzees said dani bolognesi a duke 
university aids researcher and a member of the niaid aids vaccine 
selection committee 
but he emphasized that the immuno product is still in a very 
early stage of development 
i dont consider it a vaccine as yet said bolognesi we 
need to know the human response 
bolognesi said the immuno gp160 product is much more native 
than other candidate gp160 vaccines he said immuno used mammal 
cells to produce the protein through genetic engineering other 
gp160 candidate vaccines he said used insect cells 
most experts believe it is unlikely that a vaccine based on a 
single aids protein will provide complete protection against the 
virus the virus changes constantly and a working vaccine would 
have to trigger antibodies that would attack the virus no matter 
how it changes 
more than likely said bolognesi the final vaccine will be a 
cocktail that includes several of the viral proteins 
the human clinical trials on the immuno candidate vaccine will 
be conducted at st louis university school of medicine the johns 
hopkins center for immunization research in baltimore the 
university of washington school of medicine seattle the 
university of rochester medical center rochester ny and 
vanderbilt university medical center nashville tenn each center 
will use 12 volunteer subjects

government supporters and opponents 
scuffled tuesday after a progovernment rally at which premier 
petre roman defended his economic reforms 
roman for the first time also demanded tougher legal action 
against those who participated in the brutal communist regime of 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
about 20000 supporters of the governing national salvation 
front some bused in from faroff provinces attended the rally in 
the capitals huge aviation square 
later about 1000 antigovernment demonstrators marched down 
the capitals main boulevard shouting slogans against roman and 
president ion iliescu 
fights broke out with front supporters witnesses said several 
people were injured and one man broke his arm 
state tv showed some people beating others with sticks but it 
was unclear whether they were government supporters or opponents 
front vice president claudio iordache said on the tv news that 
some people had been hospitalized and he criticized the police for 
failing to curb the violence 
we can no longer tolerate such police inefficiency he said 
tensions have escalated in romania since the frontdominated 
government introduced price reforms on nov 1 the prices of some 
basic goods since have doubled and tripled but energy rents and 
essential foodstuffs were not affected 
roman defended his economic reforms at tuesdays rally 
we are a society that is evolving toward prosperity and a 
higher standard of living he told the front supporters we all 
want to live better 
the rally was the fronts answer to last thursdays 
antigovernmentdemonstrations by more than 100000 romanians they 
were organized by the civil alliance opposition group 
the government supporters chanted down with communism the 
rallying cry of the opposition movements which charge that the 
front itself is secretly dominated by communists 
roman said the front had nothing to hide and was not involved 
in anything unclean 
he also acknowledged the governments failure to combat 
corruption saying we did not tackle corruption early enough 
but now we can tolerate it no further 
for the first time since becoming premier during the december 
revolution that ousted ceausescu roman appealed for stronger 
action to bring the countrys former leaders to justice 
we have not succeeded in prosecuting the top communist 
leaders the securitate the police the ones who blindly followed 
the dictatorship that brought the country to ruin he told the 
rally 
they dragged us to the point that all we knew was misfortune 
and sadness and now must be brought to justice he said 
to date relatively few communist leaders have been prosecuted 
earlier this year four of ceausescus closest aides were convicted 
of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment 
ceausescus son nicu was sentenced to 20 years in prison for 
instigating serious crime 
the 23 members of ceausescus politburo are presently on trial 
and in the western city of timisoara 25 local officers are on 
trial for their role in the massacre that sparked last decembers 
revolution 
but the trial of iulian vlad the head of ceausescus feared 
securitate secret police was suspended last month for lack of 
evidence 
all the charges have to do with the attempts to suppress the 
revolution in which more than 1000 romanians were killed

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president 
bush are shooting for a january summit in moscow in hopes that 
negotiators can work out problems with a nuclear arms treaty before 
then officials said tuesday 
gorbachevs spokesman vitaly ignatenko declined to give an 
exact date for the summit saying only that us president george 
bush will pay an official visit to moscow at the beginning of 
january 
bush had said he would not go to moscow until work was complete 
on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty start aides said 
that setting a date for the summit could spur negotiators to clear 
the final obstacles 
if its ready they will sign it soviet spokesman vitaly 
ignatenko told a briefing at the soviet embassy in paris 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said that no date had been 
set for the meeting although the two leaders hoped for a january 
summit in moscow to sign the accord 
the president hopes to conclude a start agreement early next 
year which would be signed in moscow at the beginning of next 
year fitzwater said at a briefing 
we are not aware of a firm date there has been talk of moscow 
in january and a treaty would ready at that time he said 
completion of the agreement remains a us prerequisite for a 
moscow summit and early january was a likely date he said 
thats what we have been talking about shooting for thats 
in the ballpark he said 
it would be the fourth summit for bush and gorbachev not 
counting a dinner meeting monday night when they discussed the 
treaty the pact calls for cuts of up to 50 percent in longrange 
nuclear armed bombers missiles and submarines 
completing it is obviously within our grasp another us 
official said if you dont use the summit as an opportunity it 
may slide away 
bush and gorbachev are in paris for the 34nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe billed as the formal end of the 
cold war and the beginning of a new era in international relations 
the highlight of the paris summit came on monday when leaders 
of 22 north atlantic treaty organization and warsaw pact nations 
signed an agreement cutting their conventional forces of tanks and 
other weapons in europe 
it is the most farreaching arms control accord in history in 
combination with the proposed nuclear pact it would vastly reduce 
the military machines that have been facing each other since the 
end of world war ii 
bush had hoped to go to moscow in december to sign the start 
pact but negotiators are still wrestling with three major 
unresolved issues they are 
the kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the 
154 heavy groundbased ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles 
the soviets will retain under the treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapon as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against numerical weapons limits established in 
the treaty

cnn attorneys on tuesday handed a federal 
magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of manuel noriegas 
telephone calls saying they were confident the recordings would 
show his rights were never violated 
the network acted in the wake of the us supreme courts 
weekend refusal to lift the trial judges order that cnn cease 
broadcasting the tapes and surrender them to determine if their 
use invaded noriegas attorneyclient right to confidentiality 
we hope and are confident that the court will conclude that 
the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances 
said steven korn chief counsel to cnns parent company turner 
broadcasting system inc cnn believes that the conversations 
that were telecast were not attorneyclient privileged 
conversations 
cnn surrendered the tapes to us district judge william 
hoeveler in his chambers but the judge said he did not want to 
hear any potentially privileged conversations he ordered them 
given to us magistrate william turnoff who will make and study 
transcripts and report his conclusions back to the hoeveler the 
judge assigned to hear noriegas drugsmuggling trial 
no time limit was set but noriegas lead attorney frank rubino 
said the judge guaranteed it would done with dispatch it was 
not known if the lawyers would be called in to consult with the 
magistrate or if a hearing would be held when his report was 
issued said rubino 
korn refused to say how many tapes were handed over or to 
describe their contents or origins he said the recordings 
presented tuesday were copies not originals 
he said cnn believes it never violated the judges order because 
the telecast conversations did not deal with privileged matters 
in part because rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he 
identified them on the air 
but rubino who asked hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against 
cnn strongly disagreed although he acknowledged he does not know 
the contents of most of the tapes 
there are numerous conversations with the general wherein 
defense strategies were discussed witnesses were discussed and 
things of that nature rubino said we assume that to be whats 
on the tape 
hoeveler refused to set an immediate contempt hearing against 
cnn he said he must await a decision by chief us district judge 
james lawence king on a motion by cnn asking that the trial judge 
be removed from the tapes case 
rubino has subpoenaed cnn to produce a log of how many times the 
network and its affiliates telecast a tape between noriega and his 
defense team 
noriega is being held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center prison officials routinely tape prisoners phone 
conversations for security reasons unless the inmate indicates 
beforehand that he is talking wiuth his attorney 
the fbi is investigating how the tapes were leaked 
noriega cocounsel jon may noted that the defense has asked for 
contempt penalties of 300000 per airing and said one estimate of 
damages was 12 million that money should go to the cashstrapped 
defense he said 
there is ample precedent for a court to direct a fine to one 
of the parties may said and we are certainly we believe the 
party most injured by cnns actions and would have the 
greatest claim 
hoeveler is considering whether to replace rubino and may with 
governmentpaid counsel the judge had not announced a decision by 
tuesday 
noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the 
taping the freezing of his assets and other alleged government 
misconduct 
the fallen panamanian dictator is jailed outside of miami on 
charges of taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade his trial 
isnt expected to begin before the spring

the persian gulf crisis has intruded into 
the world of the homeless with 200 homeless people forced to move 
out of an armory to make way for national guardsmen preparing for 
action in the mideast 
the transformation of the newton armory was completed tuesday as 
cots were moved out and dozens of guardsmen wearing battle fatigues 
took care of final details in preparation for shipping out this 
weekend for training at a military base before heading overseas 
community activists who ran the homeless shelter at the armory 
had to perform their own mobilization the day before moving beds 
pots pans and other materials to a national guard armory several 
miles away in cambridge 
we can mobilize enormous resources for operation desert 
shield but we cant seem to mobilize the same resources for people 
who are homeless right here in our own country said philip 
mangano executive director of the greater boston adult shelter 
alliance 
when it was learned that the armory would have to clear the 
homeless out to make room for the troops our first concern was 
to find them another place said guard capt jayme 
casgrainguido 
the unit based at the armory is the 972nd military police 
company it was placed on alert last week after president bush 
ordered mobilization of an 72000 more soldiers from the guard and 
military reserves 
the 200member unit received its marching orders saturday 
the armory had served as an overflow shelter housing homeless 
people who could not find space elsewhere activists have been 
trying for months to open smaller shelters that would end the need 
for the armory and offer more personalized attention 
homeless people using the shelter were picked up each day in 
boston and driven out to the armory in the suburb just west of 
boston 
the transfer of the homeless from the newton armory to the 
cambridge armory will prompt community activists to work more 
quickly to find alternative sites mangano said 
do we know when the cambridge armory might have to be ready 
for operation desert shield the word might come down all of a 
sudden he said 
other armories around masssachusetts also have been pressed into 
nonmilitary uses state officials decided this year to let hampden 
county sheriff michael ashe use a holyoke armory as a jail after he 
commandeered another armory in nearby springfield to ease prison 
overcrowding 
col david gavigan of the guard administration said that armory 
likely would remain a jail even if local units were called to 
active duty

bumper crops elsewhere in the world have 
lowered prospects for us grain exports in the coming year an 
agriculture department report said tuesday 
although analysts were not specific on the effects the report 
noted other developments that will have a bearing on farm income in 
1991 and beyond 
the us economy continues to grow very slowly and the 
outlook is for more slow growth or even a brief contraction the 
report said given an orderly unwinding of current problems 
though growth should pick up in 1992 
over the longer haul it said forecasts suggest that inflation 
interest rates and the value of the dollar will drift downward 
lower interest rates would put downward pressure on farmers 
production costs and a lower exchange rate would aid farm 
exports the report said 
but good crops in much of the world have lowered prospects for 
us exports of wheat coarse grains and rice the report added 
global wheat output is expected to rise 11 percent in 199091 
setting a record the report said a smaller gain in coarse 
grain production is likely and world trade will slip a record 
world rice crop is expected and trade will increase only 
slightly 
the monthly report by the departments economic research service 
also showed that the net cash income of farmers this year is still 
expected to be a record probably in the range of 59 billion to 
63 billion 
that is unchanged from previous forecasts by the agency net 
cash income is the difference between gross cash income and cash 
expenses 
another report showed the value of us farm exports in the 1990 
fiscal year which ended sept 30 at 402 billion up from 397 
billion in 1989 that was the first time export values pushed over 
40 billion in a year since the record 438 billion in 1981 
no predictions were made for fiscal 1991 but those forecasts 
will be issued next week at the departments annual outlook 
conference the conference also will hear usda forecasts of 1991 
food prices reflecting the higher energy costs and other factors 
relating to the persian gulf crisis 
the usda agency in a third report issued tuesday said the 
cereal grain needs for 55 lowincome countries in 199091 are 
substantial despite the favorable outlook for supplies globally 
east africa and the relatively populous region of south asia 
will require the most assistance followed by latin america and 
southern africa the report said 
the analysis added that the situation reflects poor harvests 
in ethiopia and sudan good crops in most of asia and declining 
commercial cereal imports in most regions due to foreign exchange 
shortages

atlantis and its five astronauts 
glided to an smooth landing in florida today becoming the first 
shuttle crew to touch down at the kennedy space center in five 
years 
it was the sixth time a space shuttle has landed here the last 
time was in 1985 when discovery blew a tire but todays landing 
on the paved runway was smooth 
atlantis swooped through a brilliant blue sky accompanied by 
the customary twin sonic booms and touched down at 443 pm est 
after circling the world 80 times 
atlantis was diverted to kennedy by wind and damp runways at its 
the california desert landing site 
welcome home it sure was a beautiful sight mission control 
told the crew 
the descent began about an hour earlier when atlantis commander 
richard covey and pilot frank culbertson jr fired the shuttles 
twin braking rockets the firings reduced the spaceships speed by 
156 mph and sent it gliding toward florida 
workers at kennedy had to scramble to prepare for the landing 
assembling a convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra 
personnel 
theres no nervousness involved said bruce buckingham a 
kennedy spokesman weve got everybody in place making preps for 
this its just a matter of implementing our plans 
late monday showers moved across the mojave desert base 
dampening the lake bed runways about a quarterinch of rain fell 
on the hardpacked desert floor stopping before sunrise 
the air force checked the runways and determined they were 
unsuitable for landing said nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato the 
concrete runway would have been the only one open at edwards today 
and probably wednesday 
the outlook appeared to be no better at edwards on wednesday 
prompting nasa officials to choose kennedy as a landing site today 
the sky over kennedy was clear today and winds were well within 
landing limits 
atlantis whose five astronauts put a spy satellite in orbit 
during the pentagons last secret shuttle mission has enough power 
and supplies to stay in space until thursday said randy stone 
chief of the flight directors office the shuttle was launched 
from kennedy last thursday night 
the threemile runway at kennedy provides less room for 
maneuvering than the wideopen desert and the weather there is 
usually more unstable discovery the last shuttle to use the 
kennedy runway blew a tire and sustained brake damage during 
landing in 1985 
on monday nasa had to call off the landing attempt minutes 
before the shuttle was to begin its fiery plunge to earth 
the weather as it sometimes does pulled a dirty trick on 
us stone said 
coveys response to mondays delay was that the crew feels all 
dressed up with no place to go mission control said 
the other crew members are army maj charles gemar air force 
lt col carl meade and marine col robert springer mission 
specialists 
the flight has been shrouded in secrecy since atlantis blasted 
into orbit thursday night but stone said monday the crew was doing 
well and there had been only a few minor problems 
this is just about the cleanest orbiter than i can remember in 
the program he said atlantis and columbia were grounded during 
the summer because of hydrogen leaks but both were cleared for 
flight last month 
sources said the crew deployed a satellite friday that is 
capable of spying on iraq by either photographic surveillance or 
electronic eavesdropping 
the mission is the seventh and last secret shuttle flight for 
the pentagon which will use unmanned rockets to launch classified 
payloads from now on the military will use the shuttle two more 
times but those cargoes will not be classified 
columbia is scheduled to fly next in december with seven 
astronauts and an observatory

an antismoking groups lawsuit that 
accused philip morris co of violating a new state public smoking 
law was dismissed on a technicality tuesday 
but anne morrow donley executive director of virginia group to 
alleviate smoking in public corrected the problem after the 
10minute hearing and filed the lawsuit again the lawsuit alleges 
that philip morris violated the law by allowing smoking in the gift 
shop at its cigarette plant in richmond 
substitute general district judge joseph spinella said the 
lawsuit should have been filed by the state instead of by virginia 
gasp you have a right to try the suit in the name of the 
commonwealth but not in the name of your organization spinella 
said 
a hearing was set for dec 11 after ms donley changed the 
wording to show she was acting for the state 
philip morris attorney lewis t booker who had argued that the 
lawsuit was filed incorrectly declined to comment after the 
hearing 
a state law that took effect july 1 forbids smoking in indoor 
cashier lines along with many other public places violators must 
pay a 25 civil fine 
ms donley said the philip morris gift shop has no sign that 
says smoking is forbidden and a tour guide told visitors this month 
that smoking was allowed in the shop 
there are some procedural problems in the law ms donley 
said however the law is very clear that smoking shall be 
prohibited in cashier lines 
robert moore a spokesman for philip morris said the plant has 
no sign in the shop but believes it is following state law 
we are very gratified by the courts decision the action 
taken against philip morris was a frivolous publicity stunt and a 
waste of taxpayers money moore said 
virginia gasp has had mixed results in challenging alleged 
violators of the public smoking law 
the group has won cases against food lion stores in the richmond 
area but a case brought against a couple for smoking in a winn 
dixie store in colonial heights was dismissed because the judge 
said there was conflicting evidence

three children were caught hanging out on atlanta 
streets the first night the city enforced its new curfew but 
police predicted tuesday that more violators would be out this 
thanksgiving holiday weekend 
thats when the ordinance will be tested said atlanta 
police deputy chief wj taylor 
police said crisp evening temperatures and plenty of advance 
warning probably made those under 17 stay indoors after 11 pm 
monday when the curfew went into effect the city has threatened 
to jail parents of youngsters caught on the street after hours 
of the three violators detained by police two were picked up by 
their parents and the third a 12yearold girl was taken home 
after her parents refused to pick her up taylor said 
the 12yearolds parents were given a warning taylor said the 
other parents were not 
the curfew ordinance signed by mayor maynard jackson nov 8 is 
the strictest the city has had since the early 1980s during the 
atlanta child murders the american civil liberties union has 
threatened to challenge the laws constitutionality but city 
officials say it is needed to help the reverse the highest rate of 
serious crime in the city 
fbi statistics show atlanta had 210 reported serious crimes per 
1000 residents last year higher than any us city there were 
246 murders in atlanta in 1989 but 106 between january and june 
this year down 14 percent 
under the curfew those under 17 must be off the street from 11 
pm to 6 am weeknights and midnight to 6 am weekends unless 
participating in school activities returning from work or 
accompanied by an adult 
parents of repeat offenders could get up to 60 days in jail or 
1000 in fines city councilwoman davetta johnson who proposed 
the ordinance said the penalties are designed to force parents to 
keep track of their childrens activities 
police chief eldrin a bell said officers would focus on known 
drug locations nightclubs and places of ill repute in enforcing 
the curfew 
michael hauptman president of the local aclu chapter said his 
organization plans to challenge the ordinance in court as soon as 
it receives a complaint 
angelo fuster spokesman for the mayor said police do not plan 
to sweep the streets in search of violators the officers would 
not be so busy with the curfew ordinance that they would ignore 
more serious crimes he said 
a similar curfew was adopted at the height of a series of 29 
slayings of young blacks in metropolitan atlanta in the early 
1980s the original curfew applied to children 15 or younger and 
did not penalize their parents it had rarely been enforced in 
recent years 
wayne williams was convicted in 1982 of murder in two of the 
slayings between 1979 and 1981 investigators have blamed him for 
22 more of the slayings he is serving two life sentences

as baby moses had a hospital party tuesday to celebrate his fifth 
year as one of the worlds youngest heart transplant recipients 
eddie anguiano who was born in 1985 with fatal underdevelopment 
of the left side of the heart is healthy rambunctious and a 
little terror at his preschool said his mother maria anguiano 
hes doing really good she said i send him to school so 
they can wear him out for me 
initially identified only as baby moses because of his parents 
concern for privacy eddie was only 4 days old when doctors at loma 
linda university medical center implanted a tiny donor heart in his 
chest on nov 20 1985 identity of the donor was never disclosed 
he was the third infant to receive a heart transplant and the 
first to survive more than a few weeks 
eddie joined his surgeon dr leonard bailey and others on the 
medical center staff for a picnic lunch at the hospital located 60 
miles east of los angeles

baby fae in 1984 baby fae who suffered the same defect at eddie 
died 20 days after the controversial surgery

highlighted by clowns and photos of the surgery were given to 
eddies parents one showed the surgical team working over the 
infant and the other showed bailey reaching into a container 
holding eddies new heart said hospital spokesman dick shafer 
since eddies surgery the procedure has become commonplace 
bailey and his partner dr steven gundry have performed more than 
60 transplants in young children 
eddie must take antirejection drugs twice a day but has enjoyed 
a dramatic improvement in his health during the past year mrs 
anguiano said he now has sufficient resistance to fight off colds 
with overthecounter drugs 
eddie is scheduled to start kindergarten next year 
after preschool he plays with cousins at his grandmothers 
house

that it is in san bernardino county 
tuesdays celebration was eddies fifth in a week counting a 
birthday party last friday although eddie likes the parties he

iraq is casing american military 
installations in the middle east as possible terrorist targets if 
war breaks out in the persian gulf a former cia official said 
tuesday 
i dont believe the iraqis are going to unleash that 
capability against the americans at this time said vincent m 
cannistraro but they are certainly preparing themselves 
positioning themselves to do so once the situation changes 
he spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the national strategy 
information center inc a private group concerned primarily with 
soviet intelligence activities 
iraq he said would like to split saudi arabia egypt and 
morocco away from the usled coalition trying to liberate kuwait 
from iraq 
beyond that iraqi president saddam hussein is casing american 
targets preparing for terrorist attacks against us military 
and other official installations cannistraro said 
they are preparing for an operation in the event a green light 
is given to conduct one cannistraro said that means having a 
good book on the targets they are preparing themselves 
he said saddam would probably order the attacks at the time an 
outbreak of hostilities in the gulf occurs 
cia spokesman mark mansfield declined to address the substance 
of cannistraros remarks hes a retired agency officer who is 
entitled to express his own opinion mansfield said 
and fbi spokesman nestor michnyak said it was not the policy 
of the fbi to confirm or deny any public statements made by a 
private citizen 
cannistraro chief of operations and analysis at the cias 
counter terrorism center for two years until his resignation in 
september said he didnt think the soviets who had close ties to 
baghdad were involved with the operation he described 
all the signals are the soviets are professing a new religion 
on the subject of terrorism cannistraro said 
a specialist on the middle east cannistraro also served as a 
special assistant for intelligence at the defense department and 
director of intelligence programs at the national security council 
he said iraq is providing weapons money and information to 
various groups including one headed by palestinian radical abul 
abbas as well as the iraqibacked arab liberation front 
cannistraro said most terrorist incidents are sponsored by four 
countries iran iraq libya and syria in trying to avert 
bloodshed he said we are unsuccessful more than we are 
successful 
he said there is some evidence that iraq was involved in the 
assassination last month of egypts parliamentary speaker though 
the attack probably was carried out by the small islamic jihad 
movement in the country

lawmakers agreed tuesday to free all 
germans remaining in iraq and kuwait as a gesture that president 
saddam hussein said should encourage dialogue and avert war in the 
persian gulf 
the national assembly voted to approve saddams recommendation 
that the germans be allowed to leave in response to recent 
statements by german chancellor helmut kohl stressing the need for 
a peaceful resolution of the crisis 
german government spokesman hans klein in paris said his 
nation did not conduct any special negotiations with iraq open 
or covert 
earlier this week iraq said all foreigners would be set free 
between dec 25 and march 25 but information minister latif 
nassiyif jassim indicated monday that some might be allowed to 
leave earlier 
a dutch company reported tuesday that 122 dutch belgian and 
british nationals who had just completed a dredging project for the 
iraqi government would soon leave 
and the government indicated it would free an unspecified number 
of other europeans in response to visits by a swiss delegation and 
a group of european parliament members headed by jeanmarie le pen 
of france 
the western allies have accused saddam of trying to use the 
hostage issue to try to split the alliance assembled against him 
after the aug 2 occupation of kuwait 
parliament speaker saadi mahdi saleh said there were 124 germans 
remaining in iraq and kuwait no specific arrangements were made 
for their departure 
only one of the national assembly members jamil sheik issa 
voted against the measure tuesday he declined to give a reason to 
reporters 
at least 10 of the guests as iraq calls foreigners held 
since the invasion of kuwait spoke during the 90minute debate 
they endorsed the presidents recommendation citing the german 
governments recent statements concerning the gulf crisis 
they said the release of the germans would encourage european 
countries and the united states to show willingness to avert war 
and become involved in negotiations 
in paris german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher said 
i believe we should appreciate above all that the hostages are to 
be freed 
wolfgang boetsch another german politician said the release 
would not separate germany from the international alliance opposed 
to iraqi annexation of kuwait and hansjochen vogel chairman of a 
german opposition party said freeing the germans was a step toward 
resolving the conflict without military intervention 
white house spokesman marlon fitzwater in paris with president 
bush said baghdads move was another effort to chisel away 
international solidarity against iraq 
our answer is simply sorry it wont work said 
fitzwater 
the official iraqi news agency quoted saddam as saying iraq 
should encourage mr kohl and the people of germany for taking 
further stances that distinguish between the interests of germany 
and the interests of the callers of war and hegemony 
the president also noted that german experts have contributed to 
many development projects in iraq 
baghdad radio quoted saddam as saying the arabs have always 
maintained good relations with the german people and never in the 
past did the germans do anything against the arabs 
saddam allowed 120 germans to go home with former west german 
chancellor willy brandt earlier this month the national assembly 
vote followed a pattern established with the release of french and 
bulgarian hostages 
kohl told president bush on sunday that there is still a chance 
for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis whoever believes the 
problem can be solved militarily must consider not only the 
mission but the end of the whole undertaking kohl said

tuesday underscoring rifts among the men being investigated for 
their conduct in helping savings and loan owner charles h keating 
jr 
the fourth day of the ethics committee hearings lacked the 
emotion and drama of the two previous sessions when the five 
senators defiantly denied wrongdoing and appealed for exoneration 
that could save their careers 
but the testimony by an aide to arizona republican john mccain 
underlined the deep differences between him sen dennis deconcini 
dariz and sen donald w riegle jr other subjects of the 
inquiry are sens john glenn dohio and alan cranston dcalif 
mccain and deconcini have markedly different versions of what 
they discussed in advance of a meeting on keatings behalf with the 
nations top thrift regulator on april 2 1987 
and riegle contends he played no role in organizing that meeting 
which he did not attend while mccains aide said she and her 
boss believe riegle played a key role in setting it up 
the committee of three republicans and three democrats is to 
determine whether the senators pressured regulators to go easy on 
keating because of the 13 million that he and associates gave to 
the lawmakers campaigns and political causes 
much of the money was given while keating was battling thrift 
regulators and trying to save his failing lincoln savings and loan 
of irvine calif the federal government seized the institution in 
april 1989 and it may cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover 
the losses 
the five senators are no longer attending the entire hearings 
fulltime cranston is in california for treatment of recently 
diagnosed prostate cancer the others tend to appear when their 
particular conduct is discussed deconcini and mccain were there 
tuesday and riegle attended briefly 
the hearings are to resume monday after the long thanksgiving 
holiday weekend 
gwendolyn van paasschen mccains economics assistant testified 
tuesday that during discussions before the 1987 meeting with edwin 
j gray then chairman of the federal home loan bank board i 
believed that sen riegle was involved in organizing the 
session 
riegle told the committee last friday that he met with gray a 
month before the meeting and suggested gray meet with senators 
concerned about treatment of lincoln but he denied organizing the 
meeting 
that session has become crucial to the case because gray and 
the committees special counsel contend that during it deconcini 
offered gray a deal on keatings behalf according to gray 
deconcini proposed that keating would issue more home mortgages if 
the bank board would waive a rule that limited risky investments 
such as those made by lincoln savings 
deconcini denied in testimony on monday that any such deal was 
offered and the three other senators present at the meeting 
cranston mccain and glenn have backed their colleagues version 
in earlier letters to gray 
ms van paasschen also testified that she believed deconcini was 
trying to coax mccain into meeting with regulators because 
mccain was a republican and involving him would show the 
intervention was bipartisan if news of the meeting leaked out 
she added that publicity about the meeting would be more 
embarrassing for mccain than deconcini because mccain had received 
more money from keating 112000 to 48000 
deconcini reminded the committee monday that mccain issued a 
press release in july 1989 that he attended the meeting with gray 
of his own free will 
ms van paasschens testimony also highlighted markedly 
different accounts by mccain and deconcini of their preparation for 
the april 2 meeting 
the mccain staff member said she understood from her boss and a 
deconcini staff member that the two senators agreed to a limited 
agenda that did not involve any negotiations on keatings behalf in 
his battle with the regulators 
she said she and mccain believed the session would be a simple 
inquiry on behalf of a constituent we were not concerned about mr 
keating but about the 2000 employees in the phoenix area of 
lincolns parent company the keatingowned american continental 
corp 
deconcini has denied that he agreed to limit the discussion his 
lawyer james hamilton read from an earlier mccain statement to 
the committee in which mccain said he did not believe there was a 
binding agreement between the two senators prior to the 
meeting 
deconcini told the committee monday i had no word with sen 
mccain about what would be offered and what not 
in afternoon testimony tuesday mccain administrative assistant 
chris koch said his enraged boss threw keating out of his office at 
a march 24 1987 meeting 
mccain had learned shortly before keating arrived that the 
lincoln owner was calling the senator a wimp because he was 
refusing to negotiate with regulators on the businessmans behalf 
koch said 
koch said the senator a former vietnam prisoner of war told 
keating he didnt spend 5 years of his life in a prisoner of war 
camp to have his courage or integrity questioned 
the aide quoted mccain as telling keating i cant go in and 
break arms and legs for you i can go in and see youre treated 
fairly 
koch said the senators desire that a constituent be treated 
fairly prompted him to attend two april meetings with regulators 
despite charlie keating not because of charlie keating

a group of 45 house democrats asked a federal 
judge tuesday to block any order from president bush for a us 
attack on iraqi forces unless he first obtained permission from 
congress 
the lawsuit filed in us district court also seeks a 
declaratory judgment that bush is required by the war powers clause 
of the constitution to seek a declaration of war or other 
explicit authorization of congress before launching an attack 
if the president takes it upon himself as he may at any 
moment to initiate such a war without the unequivocal consent of 
congress the victim of iraqi aggression will be not just kuwait 
but the constitution of the united states the lawmakers said in 
court papers 
rep ronald v dellums dcalif who organized the filing of 
the lawsuit said the court action is intended to force bush to 
give lawmakers a chance to debate the wisdom of waging war on iraq 
were saying the president of the united states cannot on his 
own make that kind of determination dellums told reporters 
there are millions of people in this country who have serious 
questions about us going to war 
lawyers for the center for constitutional rights which 
represents the lawmakers asked us district judge harold h 
greene a liberal appointee of president carter to hold a hearing 
in 10 days 
at issue is whether bush should seek specific authorization from 
congress before launching an attack on iraqi troops who invaded 
kuwait in august 
the war powers clause of the constitution gives congress the 
power to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and 
make rules concerning captures on land and water 
the present confrontation between the united states and iraq 
meets every conceivable test of the applicability of the war powers 
clause the lawmakers said in court papers if congressional 
consent for offensive military action is not required in the 
gulf the war powers clause is a dead letter 
the lawmakers said that bush and other spokesmen for his 
administration notably secretary of state james baker iii have 
repeatedly dodged the question of whether he would seek 
congressional authorization before launching an attack 
attorney general dick thornburgh told reporters that the lawsuit 
involves very complicated questions involving standing to sue 
the executive power and we will respond completely 
we will indicate quite clearly what we think the presidents 
responsibilities are and what limits if any exist thornburgh 
said suggesting the administration would file a hardline response 
to the suit 
unlike other recent court challenges to the presidents power to 
dispatch troops overseas without consulting congress the lawsuit 
does not rely on the 1973 war powers resolution which dellums 
called an extremely weak reed 
michael ratner an attorney in the case said a pure 
constitutional challenge gives lawmakers a firm claim that they 
have standing to sue 
in paris white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white 
house would have no comment on their right to pursue that legal 
remedy and gave the opinion that a challenge based on the war 
powers resolution would result in a declaration of the 
unconstitutionality of the 1973 measure 
courts have been loath to rule against a presidents use of 
military force in previous cases generally ruling that the cases 
presented political questions that cannot be decided by judges 
but ratner noted that two federal appellate courts held in 
vietnam war cases that judges could rule on the issue of whether 
congress had authorized the conflict 
the lawmakers denied their court challenge would undercut bushs 
effort to pressure iraq with a military buildup into withdrawing 
from kuwait before a shot is fired 
our country is built on dialogue said rep don edwards 
dcalif and the chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on 
the constitution 
besides dellums and edwards the complaint was signed by 43 
democratic house members they are

the israeli parliament gave preliminary 
approval tuesday to two bills that would ban nude advertising and 
keep public buses from running on the jewish sabbath 
the legislation touched on one of the thorniest social issues in 
israel the rift between the nonobservant jewish majority and 
religious jews whose political clout outweighs their numbers 
both bills cleared by votes of 42 to 38 with two abstentions 
after an abrasive sevenhour debate punctuated by leftwing charges 
the laws would violate individual freedoms 
the bills move to legislative committee and face two more votes 
in parliament before becoming law 
at one point aryeh eliav of the labor party stood up to read 
excerpts from biblical psalms that included erotic descriptions of 
female nudity 
avraham ravitz of the torah flags party interrupted shouting 
you are violating the name of god 
the ultraorthodox agudat israel party demanded that prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc endorse the two bills in 
exchange for an agreement this week to join shamirs coalition 
agudat holds four crucial seats in shamirs 64member alliance 
in the 120member parliament 
the agudat party is also demanding passage of a law banning the 
sale or pork in israel because of jewish dietary laws that forbid 
pork consumption 
the advertising bill would prohibit nudity or partial nudity 
with sexual overtones from appearing on city billboards or bus 
stops 
religious legislators claim that posters featuring partially 
clad models violate jewish dictates of modest dress for men and 
women 
the transport legislation would tighten restrictions barring 
public buses from traveling on friday nights and saturday the 
jewish sabbath religious law expressly bans travel on the sabbath 
leftwing legislators argued the bills infringed on the rights 
of the 70 percent of israelis who are not orthodox jews 
some compared the legislation to the fundamentalist moslem 
edicts of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran 
this is a war of cultures where one side is conducting the 
campaign using its political weapons it is an attempt to 
impose norms that are alien to the western world said dedi 
zucker of the citizens rights movement 
menachem porush of agudat said his party was only trying to 
preserve the jewish character of israel 
i dont understand what all the jihad is about porush said 
using the arabic term for holy war

saddam hussein faced with possible erosion 
of support from a key ally promised to improve the lot of 
palestinians in kuwait after complaints of iraqi army harassment 
and torture a senior plo official said 
he said saddam made the pledge last week to a delegation headed 
by yasser abed rabbo of the palestine liberation organizations 
executive committee 
about 400000 palestinian workers and their families live in the 
occupied emirate most come from jordan 
the official speaking in an interview monday on condition of 
anonymity refused to say how saddam would improve palestinians 
living conditions 
abed rabbo visited saddam after palestinians returning to jordan 
assailed iraqi brutality against the palestinian community in 
kuwait 
we were very much mistreated by iraqi troops said a 
46yearold palestinian who quit his job as a professor at kuwait 
university and fled to jordan 
to get away with their brutal treatment they accuse us of 
collaborating with kuwaiti citizens against saddams regime 
the punishment is beyond expectations it is either execution 
or torture 
the professor of political science spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
plo chairman yasser arafat threw his support behind saddam early 
in the persian gulf crisis on the premise saddam was the only arab 
leader who could force a solution to the palestinian problem 
three weeks after iraqs aug 2 invasion western diplomatic 
sources in amman claimed a rift had developed in plo support 
because iraq was mistreating palestinians in kuwait a plo source 
at the time dismissed the claims as american propaganda 
another palestinian sami ibrahim alkhalily 35 described the 
situation in kuwait city as complete chaos 
khalily said in an interview that because of their support of 
saddam palestinians were also tormented and attacked by kuwaiti 
citizens 
the only way for palestinians to be safe is by arming 
themselves against personal attacks from both the kuwaiti people 
and the iraqi soldiers said khalily who arrived in amman from 
kuwait this month 
iraqi troops accuse palestinians of training kuwaitis in the 
use of arms to resist the army and soldiers execute any 
suspects 
he said that in late august he saw iraqi troops tying up a 
palestinian mans arms to two cars which drove in opposite 
directions 
the mans arms were torn off as his family watched him not 
daring to make a move khalily said 
the professor who arrived in amman on thursday said it was 
dangerous for palestinians to walk unarmed in kuwait because the 
army makes trouble for them on the streets 
he said iraqi soldiers harass palestinian women at checkpoints 
inside kuwait city and often confiscate jewelry and other 
valuables 
both khalily and the professor said palestinian support for 
saddam was declining there 
now the feeling has changed khalily said you will not 
find many palestinians there supporting iraq because they have come 
under more brutal treatment by the iraqis 
the plo official said we were briefed on all of this and we 
voiced our concerns over the deteriorating situation to president 
saddam 
we have a lot of problems to address but most urgently the 
serious financial problems of the palestinian community 
he echoed statements by labor minister qaseem obeidat that 
jordanianpalestinians lost more than 8 billion in savings and 
property since kuwaits takeover 
more than 300000 jordanians of palestinian origin lived and 
worked in oilrich kuwait contributing hundreds of millions of 
dollars for kin in the israelioccupied west bank and jordan 
these palestinians hold jordanian assports an additional 
100000 palestinians in kuwait hold egyptianissued temporary 
passports 
roughly half of jordans 34 million people come from 
palestinian families who fled or were driven from their homes in 
the 1948 and the 1967 arabisraeli wars

a frozen block of human waste that 
apparently fell from an airliner ripped through the roof of a 
county highway department building nearly striking a worker 
authorities said 
steven kinney a mechanic working in the building said he heard 
a loud crash monday evening and ran into the next room where he 
found blue ice splattered around a tractor and a gaping hole in the 
roof 
the threepound block of ice narrowly missed richard radtke who 
was repairing the tractors engine 
it sounded like an explosion said radtke 55 of elkhorn 
it was really loud im tellin ya it sounded like something 
blew up 
workers called police and gathered some of the ice into a 
freezer to back up their story 
the odds are better of winning the lottery than having a piece 
of ice crash though the roof almost killing a guy whos working on 
a tractor kinney said 
its crazy this thing ive never seen a case like this 
before said walworth county sheriffs detective clay hansen 
hansen said the sheriffs department will try to determine which 
airline dropped the ice chunk a piece of the ice will remain 
preserved in the departments freezer for investigators to take to 
the states crime lab 
in spite of hansens comment chunks of ice colored blue by 
lavatory disinfectant have fallen to the ground before the 
national transportatiohn safety board warned in august that the 
government isnt doing enough to protect airliner engines from the 
same effect 
airliner toilets are designed to be emptied by crews on the 
ground but occasionally one will leak and the liquid will freeze 
on the outside of the fuselage at high altitudes 
in addition to simply falling to the ground the ice chunks can 
fly into the planes engines 
the problem has knocked the engines off two planes in recent 
years and caused others to fail on feb 12 an eastern airlines 
boeing 727 was forced to shut down one engine on a flight from 
atlanta ga to sarasota fla 
on jan 4 a northwest airlines 727 jet flying over madison 
fla lost one engine due to ice from a toilet leak and a similar 
incident tore the engine off an american airlines 727 over las 
cruces nm on april 16 1985 the safety board said both planes 
landed safely

workers union will cooperate in the nations most extensive program 
to combat repetitive motion injuries labor secretary elizabeth 
dole said tuesday 
one hundred thirtyeight plants and an estimated 302000 workers 
will take part in an effort similar to those being undertaken by 
chrysler corp and ford motor co last year and earlier this year 
the labor department said 
the gm pact is part of a settlement of government charges that 
the nations largest automaker violated safety and health rules at 
plants in trenton nj and oklahoma city okla gm will pay

for which the departments occupational safety and health 
administration keeps records 
preventive measures include redesigning work stations to better 
accommodate the body by for example adjusting workbench heights 
also devices can be used to prevent excessive lifting or similar 
exertions tools and training can be redesigned 
under the agreement the company and union agreed to 
convene annual meetings for six years to discuss progress being 
made in combating the disorders 
analyze jobs at each plant with potential repetitivemotion 
hazards and devise ways to lessen the risk including workplace 
redesign where feasible 
training of all emplpyees in avoiding repetitive motion trauma 
provide medical attention to allow early detection and 
treatment the company would move workers falling victim to injury 
to other jobs 
establish procedures for resolving disputes over whether

police say the rapemurder of a young woman rivals 
new yorks central park jogger case in savagery but they and 
residents say it does not reflect the housing project where the 
victim and some of her alleged attackers lived 
franklin field is not a bad place said thelma smith an 
18year resident of the franklin field housing complex adjacent to 
where the battered body of kimberly rae harbour was found the day 
after halloween 
its as nice as any other place to live she said tuesday 
we dont have many problems around here theres a lot more 
places with a lot more bad things happening but you never hear 
about it 
the 26yearold womans body was found in a playing field next 
to the project in the citys dorchester section where she lived 
with her 7yearold daughter 
she was attacked and a mutilated body was found in franklin 
field raped and stabbed stabbed over a hundred times beat with a 
bottle raped repeatedly said dave rodman spokesman for the 
suffolk county district attorneys office 
eight teenagers were arraigned in the case monday three were 
ordered held without bail five juveniles were placed in the 
custody of the state division of youth services 
police detective peter omalley said at the arraignment that a 
bloodied tree limb broken glass and harbours clothing were found 
at the scene some police investigators said she was robbed of only 
1 and her coat 
police superintendent joseph saia declined to say tuesday which 
of the suspects actually live in the housing project 
saia said he wanted to avoid giving the project a stigma of 
being laden with crime and credited residents with assisting in 
the investigation 
this was a result of community help which we used to obtain 
probable cause and gave us enough to make the arrests he said 
we have several witnesses and people who made statements and we 
were able to put it together 
smith 63 chairwoman of the franklin field task force denied 
there were any street gangs in the neighborhood and said the 
arrested youths often participated in activities at the local youth 
center 
i never had no trouble out of them she said they were 
respectful to me whenever i would go to the teen center and if 
they were talking they would stop and say hi ms smith 
kevin sims 19 said he often leaves the complex in search of 
something to do 
sometimes you know they get bored and go and do something 
stupid sims said of neighborhood youths most of the time when 
something bad happens its because of people from outside they 
come and start trouble i dont know if thats the case or not 
lt detective edward mcnelley head of the homicide squad said 
tuesday that harbour was accompanied by a friend laura peterson 
when the two were attacked on oct 31 
the group spilt in two half went after one and the other half 
went after the other and after they finished robbing peterson 
they all went after ms harbour mcnelley said 
mcnelley said peterson was struck at least once but she fled 
she got away from them and fled 
mcnelley and other police officials said monday that the murder 
had similarities to the new york central park wilding incident 
in 1989 in which several youths roamed the park randomly attacking 
joggers and strollers a 29yearold banker was raped beaten and 
left for dead and spent several weeks in a coma 
but saia steered away from such comparisons 
we knew this was an isolated case he said 
harbours 7yearold daughter tatiana has moved to richmond 
va to live with relatives

gov l douglas wilder urged virginia 
military institute tuesday to admit women ending more than a year 
of silence on the statesupported schools 151year tradition of 
allowing male cadets only 
i believe that no person should be denied admittance to a 
school supported by state funds solely because of his or her race 
or gender wilder said at a news conference 
the governor urged the school to settle a federal lawsuit in 
which the us justice department is challenging vmis admissions 
policy as unconstitutional wilder also said the possibility 
could arise that he would withhold state funds to the school if 
the policy is not changed 
attorney general mary sue terry who has been defending vmi 
told reporters later the governor is the ultimate architect of 
state policy and she is ready to cooperate with him 
but joseph m spivey iii president of the vmi board of 
visitors said the lexington school would continue to fight the 
lawsuit 
the board believes that vmis mission policy and system of 
education are on sound constitutional ground and that the justice 
departments attempt to force vmi to abandon those principles is 
misguided spivey said in a statement 
we have just been abandoned by our commanderinchief said 
robert chenery a senior cadet from chesapeake chenery called 
wilders move a wee bit of a knife between the shoulder blades 
since the governor told cadets at their may graduation that the 
school should decide its policies 
sylvia clute a richmond lawyer who founded friends of vmi for 
equality hailed wilders announcement ms clute said her 
daughter a medic with the army reserve has been ordered to 
prepare for possible shipment to the middle east 
i faced the prospect of my daughter going to war while the 
state of virginia was denying her admission to a military 
college ms clute said 
wilder said he decided to speak out because us district judge 
jackson l kiser refused this month to dismiss him as a defendant 
in the lawsuit that is set for trial in april the governor said he 
is not appealing that ruling so he had to give his response to the 
lawsuit 
the justice department filed its lawsuit last winter on behalf 
of an unidentified northern virginia girl who said she wanted to 
attend vmi 
vmi and the citadel in charleston sc are the only two 
statesupported military schools in the country that bar women 
cadets the nations military academies began admitting women years 
ago

the angolan government and usbacked 
unita rebels are close to reaching a ceasefire to end their 
15yearold civil war the chief mediator at their peace talks said 
tuesday 
after five days of negotiations the two sides reached agreement 
on 80 percent of a ceasefire document proposed by the portuguese 
mediating team state secretary for foreign affairs and 
cooperation jose manuel durao barroso said 
he said no date was fixed for signing a ceasefire but he did 
not rule out the possibility of an accord at the next round of 
negotiations scheduled for before january 
durao barroso told a news conference a number of key issues 
remained to be resolved 
we are climbing a very high mountain he said and the 
last few meters yards are the most difficult 
the meeting in this coastal resort 16 miles west of the 
portuguese capital of lisbon was the fifth between the angolan 
government and unita or the national union for the total 
independence of angola in portugal since april 
the two delegations focused on the ceasefire document but also 
discussed a second paper dealing with introduction of multiparty 
democracy in angola 
durao barroso said the complex question of integrating the two 
armies was not discussed at the estoril talks 
he said both sides had agreed on a series of steps to implement 
the ceasefire beginning with the cessation of hostilities and the 
confinement of armed forces in predetermined control zones 
both sides have accepted international verification of the 
ceasefire but differences remain on the eventual role of the 
united nations the united states and the soviet union 
durao barroso said the angolan government had accepted a unita 
demand for recognition as a legitimate political force but added 
divergences existed over details 
in paris on monday rebel leader jonas savimbi expressed 
optimism that an accord was near 
a way is now open nothing more is going to block the 
process savimbi told journalists after a meeting with portuguese 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva in the french capital 
delegations from the united states and the soviet union 
attending the estoril talks as observers durao barroso said their 
presence had greatly helped the talks 
the angolan civil war is one of the last cold war regional 
conflicts both superpowers continue to supply arms to their allies 
in angola 
unita has been fighting the sovietbacked angolan government 
since the southern african nation gained independence from portugal 
in 1975 
according to government figures more than 350000 people have 
died in the conflict

point he had been behaving himself 
back in court tuesday colbath found bryant guilty of three 
counts of contempt and sentenced him to consecutive terms of five

premier bob rae leader of ontarios newly 
elected leftwing government opened the provincial legislatures 
new session tuesday with few specifics for a nervously awaiting 
business community to ponder 
rae repeated his new democratic partys campaign promises to 
introduce legislation on car insurance increase the minimum wage 
and support laidoff workers he also declared a moratorium on new 
nuclear power plants 
but the only figure in the speech read by lt gov lincoln 
alexander was 602 million for a public works project to repair 
roads schools and government buildings a plan he said would 
create critically needed jobs 
rae whose party won 73 of the 130 seats in the legislature in 
sept 6 elections said my government recognizes that it assumes 
office with great expectations and that not all of these 
expectations can be met 
political observers say the ndp won not so much because 
ontarians wanted a socialist government but because of a funding 
scandal involving the liberals and because liberal premier david 
peterson decided to call an election two years early after his 
pollsters told him he would be a shooin 
during the campaign the ndp promised programs that would cost 
more than 17 billion once in office the rae government found 
itself faced with a 21 billion deficit left by the outgoing 
liberals 
since its founding in 1961 the new democrats have formed 
governments in british columbia saskatchewan manitoba and the 
yukon territory but their coming to power in ontario canadas 
richest and most populous province made for some sleepless nights 
for the business community 
rae has tried to calm fears that he will try to spend and tax 
his way out of canadas recession business seems to have taken a 
waitandsee attitude 
to come in here after six weeks and announce whammo were 
going to spend here and spend there that would be 
irresponsible the premier told reporters just before his speech 
the speech made no mention of the minimum corporate tax and 
inheritance tax promised by the ndp and feared by business 
among other measures rae said his government would increase the 
minimum wage from 460 an hour to 60 percent of the average 
industrial wage or 570 to 606 an hour

review of a controversial milkincreasing 
hormone is taking longer than expected and probably wont be 
completed by next spring as originally planned a food and drug 
administration official said tuesday 
the sheer amount of data is more than we expected and is 
responsible for the delay said gerald b guest director of the 
fdas center for veterinary medicine 
the hormone is bovine somatotropin or bst in august the 
agency publiished a review of 120 scientific studies to support its 
contention that the hormone is safe for humans to ingest 
all cows milk contains small amounts of the hormone which cows 
produce naturally it is digested like any protein the fda says 
administration of the hormone produced by genetic engineering 
techniques can increase milk production by 10 percent to 25 
percent 
some dairy organizations and consumer activists have opposed use 
of the hormone on the grounds that its safety in longterm use 
remains in doubt and the last thing dairy farmers need is something 
to improve production of a commodity in surplus supply like milk 
some states have forbidden use 
four companies have applied to the fda for permission to sell 
the hormone 
the current review is aimed at determining whether the hormone 
is safe for cows in august the agency said it expected to finish 
in the spring of 1991 
that deadline guest said is going to slip a little 
asked if the review would last into 1992 he replied i hope 
not but theres always that possibility 
the deadline slippage was first revealed in remarks by guest at 
a dairy industry symposium on monday and reported in the milwaukee 
sentinel on tuesday

chancellor helmut kohls political rivals are 
trying to persuade voters that eastern germany is a time bomb set 
to explode weeks after the national elections on dec 2 
experts say that is true to some extent thirty days after the 
vote the former nations difficult economic road will begin a deep 
dip 
a social expert for the opposition social democrats said tuesday 
that at least 1 million people are holding postdated layoff notices 
that will not kick in until next year 
rudolf dressler said the party trailing badly in most polls to 
kohls christian democrats compiled the information from industry 
councils and personnel offices in the former nation 
an independent economist agreed that hundreds of thousands of 
people still working nevertheless have already received layoff 
notices effective early next year 
the social democrats claim was their latest effort to persuade 
voters that kohl is covering up an impending economic disaster that 
will hurt eastern germans more than they realize and force their 
wealthy western neighbors to pay higher taxes because of it 
such charges have failed to erode kohls status as the man most 
likely to win the first united german elections since 1933 
it is clear however that former east germany is only in the 
early stages of a difficult transition from communism to 
capitalism 
eastern germans already have seen prices for food and other 
necessities kept artificially low by the communists zoom to 
western levels even as their salaries have remained about 
onethird of their wealthier neighbors 
in january many of the remaining subsidies also will begin to 
disappear heavy subsidies for public transportation which allow 
eastern germans to ride subways for only 20 pfennigs 13 cents a 
trip will be lifted 
subsidized rents some of them only 60 marks a month 40 will 
be allowed to begin rising and energy costs also are expected to 
start climbing 
berlin economist heine flassbeck one of the authors of a 
comprehensive look at the immediate future of the eastern german 
economy said 500000 publicsector workers are to be laid off by 
april 
in the private sector he said the question of whether trade 
with eastern european nations will break down could affect 500000 
other workers many firms say their contracts will run out on jan 
1 and wont be renewed flassbeck said 
there is a certain gray area where something like that 
could happen but we have no concrete information he said 
right now eastern germany officially has 537000 unemployed 
people a rate of about 61 percent 
but there are almost 2 million people receiving reduced pay at 
lower hours under a bonnfinanced program to keep unemployment low 
kohls critics say this is just another form of unemployment 
compensation 
flassbeck said it is clear that many of the people in this 
category likely will lose their jobs next year because they work in 
industries most vulnerable to the new western competiton 
his independent institute the german institute for economic 
research and the nations four other leading economic think tanks 
last month published a report that said unemployment could reach 
nearly 4 million by the end of next year for a 50 percent jobless 
rate 
likewise the costs of cleaning up the environment of one of the 
worlds most polluted nations and repairing an infrastructure 
largely neglected since world war ii is expected to reach hundreds 
of billions of marks 
the institute for economic research of the world economic 
archives in hamburg said tuesday that the costs of unification 
could reach 15 billion marks 10 billion next year and that 
higher taxes may be necessary 
kohl has promised not to raise taxes to pay for unification but 
his chief opponent social democrat oskar lafontaine has charged 
that he will have no choice 
the debate mirrors the us presidential election of 1988 when 
president bush based his successful campaign on a promise not to 
raise taxes he recently relented on that stand

an appeals court on tuesday ruled in favor of 
authorities seeking the return of marlon brandos daughter from 
tahiti to testify at her brothers trial on charges of killing her 
lover 
but a prosecutor said he will abandon the effort if independent 
doctors find cheyenne brando is too sick to testify 
we will do nothing to hurt this girl said deputy district 
attorney steven barshop 
christian brando is charged with the slaying of miss brandos 
tahitian lover dag drollet and his trial has been delayed by the 
dispute over cheyennes testimony 
barshop said the ruling by the 2nd district court of appeals may 
assist prosecutors in persuading french authorities in tahiti to 
arrange an independent psychiatric examination of the 20yearold 
miss brando 
she has twice been hospitalized after suicide attempts in the 
past month and charges against her in the french territory in 
connection with drollets death have complicated the issue of 
whether she would be allowed to leave 
the appellate court ruled that a lower court judge does have 
jurisdiction to issue a letter of rogatory an international 
document requesting formal assistance from the government of 
another country they referred the case back to superior court 
judge joel rudof who had concluded he had no such jurisdiction 
every court of this state has power to make all orders 
necessary for the effective conduct of proceedings before it 
said the decision 
barshop said that if the letter of rogatory is issued 
prosecutors would ask not only for miss brandos return but for an 
independent psychiatric examination 
christian brandos lawyer robert l shapiro said he also would 
like to have miss brando examined to prove she is physically and 
mentally unable to testify 
shapiro said he gave prosecutors a letter monday from the head 
psychiatrist at the tahiti hospital where miss brando is under 
treatment saying that her emotional and mental state requires 
her continued hospitalization 
although shapiro expressed a desire to start christian brandos 
trial soon all lawyers in the case said further proceedings cannot 
move ahead until the appeals court decision becomes final in 30 
days 
barshop said the district attorneys office has discussed 
sending psychiatrists to examine miss brando but has no assurances 
the french authorities in tahiti would permit it 
miss brando was seven months pregnant with drollets child when 
the 26yearold tahitian was shot to death at the brando mansion a 
month later miss brando left for tahiti where she gave birth to a 
son 
on nov 1 miss brando was reported to have taken an overdose of 
tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs and was hospitalized in a 
coma on nov 11 she was again reported hospitalized after trying 
to hang herself

the national fire prevention association

separate fires because they start from the same source rekindled 
fires are ones that flare up after firefighters believe theyve 
been put out 
numerous fires that were not included in the count were 
extinguished by police public works employees and residents 
structure fires accounted for 209 of the blazes over the three

the disgraced pop music duo milli vanilli 
surrendered their best new artist grammy award on tuesday and 
claimed their phony act as lipsyncing front men was a pact with 
the devil that victimized them 
rob pilatus and fabrice morvan whose stardom was shattered last 
week with the revelation that they never sang on the debut milli 
vanilli album said they were seduced into the deceit because they 
were poor young and naive 
you get something but for that you make a pact with the 
devil pilatus said at a news conference 
we feel really really sorry about our fans he said we 
really love our fans we just hope that they understand that we 
were young that we just wanted to live the life the american 
way 
the pair and manager carsten heyn charged that arista records 
president clive davis knew they were faking arista has repeatedly 
denied the claim heyn also said recording industry officials 
worldwide knew of the deception 
the pair presented a videotape of themselves recording the hit 
song girl you know its true in a studio last weekend but that 
was greeted with skepticism and yells from reporters to prove they 
really could sing 
pilatus belted out a few lines from the song and morvan joined 
in with the rap portion of the tune 
trustees of the national academy of recording arts amp sciences 
voted monday to rescind milli vanillis grammy the pair held up 
their trophies tuesday and declared they were returning them with 
recommendation they go to the real singers 
academy president michael greene said giving the trophies to the 
singers who actually sang was not a possibility 
voice coach seth riggs who said his clients include michael 
jackson madonna and stevie wonder gave a testimonial to the duos 
singing abilities saying they were better than the men who 
actually were recorded 
pilatus claimed he and morvan were victimized because they were 
living in poverty in a munich housing project when german producer 
frank farian offered them the deal he said that at the time they 
even had to steal food 
pilatus who was born in new york and raised in germany 
described in broken english a growing sense of guilt that came 
along with stardom and money 
there was everytime something that we had to lie he said 
we had very guilty complexes 
the album girl you know its true sold 7 million copies 
worldwide and made the two unknowns international stars pilatus 
and morvan a native of the caribbean island of guadaloupe are 
both 25 
farian last week confirmed growing rumors that the duo did not 
sing on the album it actually featured the voices of vocalists 
johnny davis brad howell and charles shaw pilatus said shaws 
role was minimal and the grammy really belongs to davis and howell 
the pair also lipsynced through an appearance on februarys 
grammy show in los angeles when milli vanilli was honored as best 
new artist of 1989 
singing coach riggs said he was there and that pilatus and 
morvan were ready to sing but were told to fake it he did not know 
who gave the order the duo also did not say who it was 
the duos attorney alan mintz supported their claim that they 
had pressed the producer to be allowed to actually sing and that 
the producer only came forward with the truth because pilatus and 
morvan were about to 
meanwhile an oakland woman who bought her son a milli vanilli 
tape filed a class action lawsuit in state court monday seeking a 
refund for anyone in california who bought the groups recordings 
or attended one of their concerts 
in illinois chicago college student karen l smith on tuesday 
also sued in cook county circuit court claiming fraud because the 
cds she bought named pilatus and morvan as performers

a businessman who has emerged from nowhere 
into the spotlight of polands presidential campaign is a citizen 
of canada and peru who claims to have made a fortune bringing cable 
tv to the amazon 
candidate stanislaw tyminski placed a strong third in the latest 
polls for sundays election giving new weight to his attacks on 
established political leaders 
the darkhouse candidate is being investigated for slander for 
some of his comments newspapers are attacking him and questions 
abound about the pole who came home to run for president after 
making a fortune in the west 
according to bob spanski a tyminski campaign aide in canada 
the candidate was born in a warsaw suburb in january 1948 he left 
poland at age 21 first going to sweden then arriving nearly broke 
in canada in 1970 he became a canadian citizen in 1975 
according to his campaign he spent the early 1980s in iquitos 
peru 
after a gasoline barge on the amazon was confiscated tyminski 
decided that the people of iquitos needed cable tv said frank 
ollie partner in tyminskis toronto computer company tranduction 
he got a couple of vcrs from miami and a couple of tapes and 
began going from dwelling to dwelling with a coaxial cable and a 
staple gun and that grew overnight into a very reputable 
company 
tyminski then returned to canada where he heads transduction 
and leads the libertarian party of canada 
tyminski decided to run for president on a lark during a visit 
to poland in september to attend to his company and promote a book 
of his political and economic ideas titled sacred dogs ollie 
said 
the freespending 42yearold was a surprise entrant among the 
six candidates who managed to collect 100000 signatures for a 
place on sundays ballot for polands first free presidential 
election 
a fresh face who said he would apply his business wizardry to 
the shattered economy tyminski appealed to disenchanted poles and 
played on their admiration of the wellheeled polished leaders of 
the west 
it didnt seem to matter that his polish was rusty at best that 
his peruvian wife spoke no polish at all or that he hadnt lived 
in poland for the two decades when poles struggled to throw off 
communism 
poland is willing to allow emigrants to keep their citizenship 
even if they become citizens of other countries 
tyminskis attacks on the familiar politicians have played well 
the antiinflationary plan threatens to bring civil war he 
told audiences struggling under the economic reforms creating high 
prices unemployment and uncertainty the country has been 
engulfed by recession we have neither a government nor a 
parliament 
tyminski was largely dismissed as an alsoran until an opinion 
poll friday it showed his support had nearly doubled to 17 
percent of those who intend to vote compared with 19 percent for 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and 35 percent for solidarity 
leader lech walesa a second poll sunday produced similar results 
in a speech saturday tyminski accused mazowiecki of betraying 
the nation through policies creating recession inflation 
poverty and exhaustion that pose a threat to national 
existence he claimed the government was issuing false statistics 
that showed inflation and unemployment to be only half as serious 
as they are 
the charge from the outsiderturnedcontender went beyond the 
bounds of the normally heated political discourse in polands 
fledgling democracy 
a liar or a fool the promazowiecki gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper said in a headline tuesday a week before the 
elections we know as much about tyminski as he has told about 
himself and from what he says and how he says it an image of an 
imbalanced individual emerges the newspaper said 
attorney general aleksander bentkowski ordered a slander 
investigation 
i consider the accusation of national betrayal to be fully 
justified by the attempt to sell our best enterprises to foreign 
capitalists tyminski said during a nationally televised 
advertisement monday 
he cited an addendum to a draft law on privatizing state 
industry saying the prices were dramatically undervalued 
but reporters pointed out to tyminski at a raucous news 
conference tuesday that the numbers he was challenging were 
actually the total sales of the companies not their selling 
prices 
tyminski whose replies in polish and english often seemed 
incoherent would not withdraw his accusation saying it came 
from the heart he said mazowiecki showed ignorance of the best 
interest of the country in the economic sense 
in iquitos there is excitement about whether a local woman 
might become polands first lady a respected peruvian news 
magazine caretas profiled tyminski mentioning a photo in his 
former restaurant showing him barechested with two live snakes 
hanging around his neck 
tyminski says he is a polish patriot back to stay at least 
until the vote is in 
i am doing everything to win and i cannot think of losing 
he said

a federal grand jury investigating alleged police 
corruption has asked to see records from mayor coleman youngs 
private consulting company the mayors lawyer said 
attorney peter kelley refused to say if the mayor has been 
subpoenaed but said the grand jury subpoenaed records from his 
business detroit technology and investments inc 
federal court briefs filed monday in the 6th circuit us court 
of appeals showed the grand jury is investigating the disposition 
of 24 million from a detroit police undercover fund 
earlier this year city auditor roger short told the city 
council that a twoyear audit of the fund ending june 30 1987 
found no documentation for 847500 in expenditures 
the grand jury again subpoenaed undercover police officer 
sylvester chapman who refused at july 18 and oct 24 hearings to 
disclose what happened to 100000 to 300000 from the fund 
chapman kept no records of money given to informants funds he 
received under an arrangement with police chief william hart the 
records said 
chapman faces up to 18 months in prison for refusing to tell the 
federal grand jury how he spent the money he contends that naming 
informants would harm future police operations 
the federal government said in its brief that allowing chapman 
to retreat behind the informers privilege would be tantamount to 
giving undercover police officers and their commanding officers a 
license to steal 
the gran jury was reported to be investigating the police 
department and former civilian deputy police chief kenneth weiners 
connection to youngs company no charges have been filed in 
connection with the police fund

the conservative party staggered prime minister 
margaret thatcher with lukewarm support tuesday forcing her into a 
second round of balloting in a fight for leadership of party and 
country 
mrs thatcher fell two votes short of a quick defeat in the 
sternest challenge of her 11 years as party leader she rejected 
calls by some to step down and vowed to battle on in another round 
of voting next tuesday 
former defense secretary michael heseltine smiling and looking 
very much like the winner after the vote by his conservative 
colleagues in the house of commons also declared himself ready for 
round two 
it is my intention to let my name go forward for the second 
ballot a calm and determined mrs thatcher told reporters 
outside the british embassy in paris where she was attending a 
summit on european security 
if mrs thatcher loses the leadership of the party she would be 
expected to step down as prime minister the conservatives have a 
98seat majority in the 650seat house 
the opposition labor party moved to capitalize on the turmoil in 
conservative ranks by introducing a motion of noconfidence that is 
likely to come to a vote before tuesday the motion would bring 
down the government if it carries 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in paris noted that 
mrs thatcher has been the closest ally of the reagan and bush 
administrations but said the vote was an internal british matter 
we feel very positive about our relationship with her and with 
that country fitzwater said but beyond that we really cant 
have any comment 
mrs thatcher the longestserving prime minister in europe has 
suffered a loss in popularity because of a local services tax that 
is widely viewed as favoring the rich her government also has been 
blamed for high inflation and high interest rates the 
conservatives have trailed labor in opinion polls for 16 months 
heseltine also focused his campaign on mrs thatchers attitude 
toward europe which has caused strains within her party 
heseltine standing handinhand with his wife anne outside 
their home told reporters i am overwhelmed with gratitude to my 
parliamentary colleagues who in such large measure have given me 
their support 
heseltine forced the issue by winning enough votes to deny mrs 
thatcher a firstballot victory in an unprecedented ballot among 
the 372 conservative members of parliament 
because 16 lawmakers abstained mrs thatcher needed 206 of the 
remaining votes which would have given her a winning margin of 15 
percent out of the total 372member conservative caucus as party 
rules stipulate she received 204 votes to heseltines 152 
in the second round a simple majority can win but other 
candidates now are free to join the race if necessary a third and 
final ballot would be held nov 29 
partisans on each side urged the other to give up mrs thatcher 
faced pressure to resign rather than end her career in defeat 
i suspect she may have polled her maximum number of votes 
today said conservative legislator ivor stanbrook who supported 
heseltine 
i am absolutely astonished that he got so many and that so many 
of my colleagues should have been so disloyal conservative 
lawmaker ivan lawrence said on sky television 
the party is obviously in trouble and there is no point in 
hiding it said teddy taylor one of mrs thatchers most 
outspoken supporters in the house he urged her to continue 
mrs thatcher has been the conservative leader since 1975 and 
was the only tory leader in this century to lead her party to three 
consecutive election victories in 1979 1983 and 1987 
despite being embroiled in a fight for her political life the 
woman known as the iron lady changed into a formal gown and 
smiled as she went to a summit banquet at versailles 
mrs thatcher 65 put the best face on the result saying im 
naturally pleased that i got more than half the parliamentary party 
and disappointed that its not quite enough to win 
the pound fell nearly half a cent from 19695 dollars to 
19650 following the vote 
mrs thatcher was to return wednesday to address the house of 
commons on the summit and to have her weekly meeting with queen 
elizabeth ii 
heseltine 57 pledged during the sixday campaign to overcome 
tory factionalism to win the next general election in 1992 he 
pointed to a flurry of opinion polls that indicated voters were 
more enthusiastic about the conservative party with him as the 
leader 
a selfmade millionaire heseltine had been a member of mrs 
thatchers first cabinet in 1979 as environment secretary and was 
named defense secretary in 1983 he quit bitterly and abruptly in 
the middle of a cabinet meeting in january 1986 
the leadership contest erupted unexpectedly following a european 
community summit meeting in rome at the end of october at which 
mrs thatcher was once again all alone against the 11 other 
leaders she vociferously rejected an agreement in principle for a 
single central bank and single currency for the ec 
fed up with such views and her autocratic style deputy prime 
minister geoffrey howe quit nov 1 then delivered a scathing 
resignation speech last week that inspired heseltine to make the 
challenge

a european ariane rocket blasted 
off from the northeastern corner of south america tuesday carrying 
two us telecommunications satellites into outer space 
the rocket loaded with gstar4 and satcomc1 satellites lifted 
off at 811 pm 611 pm est from the ariane facility here 
it was the 40th launching of an ariane rocket since the european 
space program began 10 years ago and the final launch of 1990 
the rocket deployed the satcomc1 19 minutes after takeoff at an 
altitude of 188 miles and the gstar4 four minutes later at 438 
miles high 
satcomc1 and gstar4 were built by general electrics 
astrospace division and launched respectively for gte spacenet and 
ge american communications inc 
they are expected to remain in service for about 13 years 
providing communications links for the continental united states 
hawaii and alaska 
the launch countdown proceeded in recent days despite a strike 
by some workers at the launch facility who did not accept work and 
salary conditions agreed upon by four unions 
ariane launches resumed in july after a fivemonth suspension 
following the explosion of a rocket less than two minutes after 
takeoff in february 
two japanese communications satellites aboard were destroyed an 
investigation showed a clogged pipe was responsible for the 
accident but a french magazine reported the rocket was sabotaged 
the claim was never proven 
the last launch was last month when two satellites made by 
hughes were put into orbit 
the next launch is scheduled for january when an ariane will 
lift into space two satellites a eutelsatiif2 for european 
telecommunications and an italsat1 for italys space agency 
arianespace the commercial branch of the european space agency 
plans nine ariane launches in 1991 it has signed contracts worth 
3 billion to launch 34 more satellites 
tuesdays launch used for the first time the ariane42p one of 
the six versions of the rocket which uses two boosters of solid 
rocket fuel the ariane42p can place a payload of up to 26 tons 
into geostationary orbit 22500 miles above the surface of the 
earth 
the last several launches have used four strapon boosters of 
liquid fuel

a man convicted of murdering three women who 
disappeared more than a year ago and whose bodies have never been 
found was sentenced tuesday to four life prison terms 
richard grissom jr was sentenced in johnson county district 
court by judge william gray after an emotional appeal from the 
father of a victim 
mr grissom has been given all the courteous treatment and 
rights due him under kansas law ralph butler said the 
cowardly and premeditated crimes and the evil intent of these 
crimes requires that richard grissom be given the absolute maximum 
sentence that the law allows 
grissom 30 showed no emotion when he was sentenced 
district attorney paul morrison said it will be 105 years before 
grissoms case could come before a parole board 
grissom was convicted on circumstantial evidence he was driving 
a car rented by one of the victims shortly after she disappeared 
and a few drops of blood were found in that car he also had credit 
cards and some personal belongings of all three women he also had 
copies of keys to their apartments and had worked as a painter at 
the apartment complexes where they lived 
prosecutors contended the motive for the killings was the 3600 
withdrawn from their bank accounts shortly after they disappeared 
the defense called no witnesses during the threeweek trial and 
argued that prosecutors had not proved their client committed any 
crimes or that the women were dead 
the jury deliberated about 12 hours before convicting grissom 
grissom was sentenced to a minimum of 90 years and a maximum of 
360 years for the murders of 34yearold joan marie butler of 
overland park and roommates christine rusch and theresa brown both 
22 and of lenexa both towns are kansas city suburbs grissom also 
lived in lenexa 
he was given a fourth life term for the aggravated kidnapping of 
miss rusch 
grissom was convicted nov 4 of three counts of firstdegree 
murder 
grissom is expected to appeal jessica r cunen the chief 
appellate defender for the state was appointed to represent him 
the judge urged grissom to tell the families where they could 
find the bodies 
none of them can be brought back gray said but your part 
in the lives of the remaining victims the families is still up 
to you 
you have to consider whether you have any consideration or any 
compassion for these people i encourage you to think about it 
the sentences were a relief but the families still want to 
know where the bodies are said harold brown father of theresa 
brown the pages arent completely closed yet maybe someday he 
will find it in his heart to tell us what he did with the girls 
gray sentenced grissom after rejecting a defense motion for a 
new trial 
defense attorney tom erker argued grissom received ineffective 
counsel from the public defenders office for several months after 
his arrest in july 1989 a month after the disappearances 
grissom also was convicted of two counts of aggravated burglary 
burglary misdemeanor theft and four counts of robbery

a perjury indictment that cost former police chief 
mack vines his job was thrown out tuesday after a judge ruled its 
allegations were too vague 
former texas court of criminal appeals judge john onion quashed 
the misdemeanor perjury indictment in a hearing a court 
spokeswoman said referring all other questions to assistant 
district attorney ted steinke 
steinke said the das office was drafting a new indictment that 
would be filed wednesday this happens every day in the 
courthouse its not unusual at all he said 
vines said he was relieved the perjury charge was thrown out 
i hope and pray that the assistant district attorney and 
the district attorneys office will see the wisdom in not 
refiling he said 
well review the new indictment if they file and see if its 
properly done said his attorney bill boyd if not well file 
to quash again if theyve done it right well prepare for 
trial 
vines was fired by dallas city manager jan hart on sept 12 
hours after being indicted on the perjury charge he is accused of 
lying to a special panel investigating the june 1989 firing of 
officer patrick lemaire who fatally shot an unarmed man last year 
lemaire was reinstated in july by an administrative law judge but 
declined to return to the police force 
the perjury charge alleged that vines lied to the panel about a 
telephone conversation he had with assistant police chief greg 
holliday on aug 2 the night before holliday was to testify before 
the panel holliday said vines tried to influence his testimony 
vines has maintained his innocence 
boyd said the indictment was quashed because the law in texas 
requires that if you allege perjury you must first show the 
statement that you allege to be false and then state what you claim 
the truth to be 
they made a general allegation in the indictment as to what 
they claimed to be false and they made no allegation as to what 
they claimed the truth to be he said 
tuesdays action was the latest setback in the district 
attorneys prosecution of vines who had been police chief for two 
years 
prosecutors initially filed the case in state district court 
but were told last month that the court had no jurisdiction because 
official misconduct was not alleged 
the case was moved to dallas county criminal court where judge 
john mccall stepped aside and asked onion to preside 
the city began a nationwide search for a new police chief after 
vines dismissal sixtytwo candidates have applied for the job 
including acting chief sam gonzales

hundreds of rebel fighters 
attacked more than a dozen military positions in el salvador on 
tuesday at least 27 people were killed and 141 were wounded 
authorities said 
the fiercest fighting was in the eastern provincial capitals of 
san francisco gotera and usulutan where combat lasted more than 
five hours fighting was reported in seven of the nations 14 
provinces 
leftist guerrillas attacked the main air base on the outskirts 
of the capital damaging one aircraft and an airmans dormitory 
and several military positions within a 15mile radius of san 
salvador 
a telephone survey of hospitals first aid centers military 
officers in the field and town officials provided the casualty 
figures victims included guerrillas soldiers and civilians the 
officials said 
rebel sabotage damaged electrical installations and power lines 
affecting about twothirds of this central american nation of more 
than 55 million people the government electrical company said 
a rebel communique said the coordinated attacks in eastern 
northern and central el salvador were meant to punish the army for 
human rights abuses and inflexibility at the negotiating table 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln attacked 
major garrisons in the east at usulutan and san francisco gotera 
shortly after 2 am with mortars rocketpropelled grenades and 
rifle fire 
a resident of usulutan city reached by telephone said combat 
was fierce until 7 am he said two air force helicopter gunships 
and c7 combat planes lent support to soldiers battling rebels on 
the citys outskirts 
the guerrillas also hit military detachments in santa elena 
puerto parada and concepcion batres all in usulutan province 
heavy combat was reported from guatajiagua in morazan province 
near san francisco gotera

apopa nejapa quetzaltepeque and zacatecoluca in central el 
salvador near the capital 
in a communique signed by its senior five commanders the fmln 
called the attacks a limited operation to prod president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government back to negotiating the

the rebel communique described the offensive as a military 
response to the armed forces impunity repression military 
operations and the intransigence of the government which refuses 
to demilitarize society and clings to a criminal army 
it warned that a largescale offensive may be launched if the 
administration still refuses to negotiate 
an fmln spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
foreign correspondents after holding talks with national groups 
and foreign governments it was decided not to launch an offensive 
that had been planned but a military operation instead to push the 
negotiating process 
he did not specify which groups or foreign governments were 
consulted 
a government official told a news conference the offensive 
cannot be interpreted as isolated attacks we have observed 
relief columns and seen that the fmln is in a position to beef up 
its units that carried the initial attacks 
the attacks followed the anniversary of the armys massacre of 
six jesuit priests on nov 16 1989 during a rebel offensive in 
the capital 
those killings cost el salvador half of its 85 million in us 
military aid planned for 1991 
rebel and government negotiators have held five rounds of peace 
talks since may the talks have bogged down amid mutual charges of 
intransigence 
the rebels express willingness to demobilize and join the 
political process only if the current armed forces are disbanded

congressional investigators say the usbacked armed forces murder 
and torture political opponents and are corrupt

officer has been convicted of a crime involving politically 
motivated human rights abuse 
in all more than 73000 people have been killed in the war

atlantis and its five astronauts 
safely returned home from a secret military mission tuesday 
gliding smoothly to the first space shuttle landing in florida in 
five years 
the shuttle diverted from the california desert because of high 
winds and damp runways swooped through a clear brilliant blue sky 
and touched down at kennedy space center at 443 pm its arrival 
was heralded by the customary twin sonic booms 
welcome home it sure was a beautiful sight mission control 
told the crew 
it was kennedys sixth shuttle landing the last one was in 
1985 when discovery blew a tire 
workers had to scramble to prepare for the landing assembling a 
convoy of support vehicles and bringing in extra personnel 
atlantis had begun its mission thursday with an unusual nighttime 
liftoff 
were here in florida and we didnt expect to be here when we 
left atlantis commander richard covey said before leaving with 
his crew tuesday night for johnson space center in houston 
the ksc folks did a good job of getting ready for us and they 
did a super job of getting us out of town last thursday night when 
we said we were going to go covey said 
about 250 people including two busloads of workers from the 
launch control center watched the landing from bleachers and a 
grassy strip adjoining the paved runway they whistled and cheered 
waving small american flags 
launch director bob sieck was among about a halfdozen nasa 
officials who greeted covey pilot frank culbertson jr and the 
rest of the crew 
its very special just like the launch sieck said you 
have to remember that half the workforce at kennedy has never 
seen a shuttle landing 
they worked so hard to get it off its only fair that they 
should see it land said nasa safety official al parrish 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program said a 
quick check of the shuttle showed it to be very clean with 
dings on only a few of the heatresistant tiles 
atlantis was supposed to land monday at edwards air force base 
calif but high wind forced mission control to call off the plan 
and extend the shuttles flight flight director randy stone said 
atlantis had enough power and supplies to stay aloft until 
thursday although its doubtful nasa would wait until then to 
bring the shuttle home 
a quarterinch of rain fell on the mojave desert lakebed late 
monday and early tuesday creating pools of water on the natural 
surface runways and making them unsuitable for landing the 
concrete runway would have been the only option there on tuesday 
and probably on wednesday 
the outlook for wednesday at edwards was no better prompting 
nasa to opt for kennedy the sky over kennedy was clear tuesday 
and wind speed was well within landing limits 
kennedys 28milelong paved runway which has 1000feet 
overruns on both ends and is 300 feet wide provides less room for 
maneuvering than the wideopen desert discovery the last shuttle 
to land at kennedy blew a tire and sustained brake damage during a 
1985 landing 
atlantis had been orbiting amid a pentagonimposed silence since 
thursday sources said the astronauts deployed a satellite friday 
to spy on iraq by either photographic surveillance or electronic 
eavesdropping 
in addition to covey an air force colonel and culbertson a 
navy commander the allmilitary crew has three mission 
specialists army maj charles gemar air force lt col carl meade 
and marine col robert springer 
the mission was the seventh and last secret shuttle flight for 
the defense department two more pentagon missions are planned for 
the shuttle but the cargoes are unclassified 
atlantis was supposed to lift off in july with the spy 
satellite but was grounded by hydrogen leaks the spacecraft 
reportedly was modified to observe the persian gulf while the 
shuttle was being fixed 
the national aeronautics and space administration is preparing 
for its next shuttle flight an astronomy mission that has been on 
hold since may columbia is scheduled to lift off with seven 
astronauts and the 150 million astro observatory in early 
december 
nasa saved 1 million by landing atlantis at kennedy and about a 
week in shuttle processing time since the ship does not have to be 
transported now across the country the agency has modified 
kennedys landing strip and developed new shuttle brakes with the 
intent of landing on a regular basis in florida in the next year or 
so 
twentynine of the 37 shuttle flights to date have ended at 
edwards columbia was diverted to white sands nm in 1982 
because the desert lakebed was flooded 
the shuttle challengers jan 28 1986 flight ended 73 seconds 
after liftoff in an explosion that killed seven astronauts

the soviet union said tuesday the un security 
council should take stock of its sanctions against iraq and 
decide whether a new course of action is necessary but the soviets 
again rebuffed president bushs efforts to rally support for a 
resolution authorizing military force 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze emerging from a 
90minute meeting with secretary of state james a baker told 
reporters we need to consult with our colleagues and partners in 
the security council 
but he stopped considerably short of backing any measure that 
would advocate the use of force 
shevardnaze said the council should take stock of things and 
pass appropriate judgment on what it has been doing 
then if necessary he said the body should adopt new 
resolutions with a view to implementing all the previous 
decisions 
the persian gulf crisis dominated the unofficial agenda at the 
34nation conference on cooperation and security in europe 
although french president francois mitterrands spokesman said the 
conference would not issue any statements on the crisis 
there will be no common declaration by the 34 on the gulf 
hubert vedrine said after a 45minute private meeting of the 
leaders 
discussion in the closed session focused on such matters as 
immigration from one european country to the next and the 
continents environment 
german chancellor helmut kohl speaking to a public session of 
the summit called for action to ensure that the democratic process 
in eastern europe does not collapse 
following the opening of national borders there must now be 
no borders which perpetuate the prosperity divide kohl said 
kohls spokesman hans klein said that in a closeddoor session 
a number of nations expressed concern about an uncontrollable 
refugee stream from the east 
on other topics 
norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland said her country 
intends to set up a fund financed by a tax on its offshore 
oilfields to help less wealthy countries combat global warming 
the foreign ministers of the three baltic republics estonia 
latvia and lithuania protested at the soviet move excluding them 
from the work of the conference summit 
hungarian prime minister jozsef antall said he hoped the 
conditions for the complete dissolution of the warsaw pact will 
be created by early 1992 antall is the first warsaw pact leader to 
talk about the complete demise of the military alliance and to 
offer a deadline 
in another distraction british prime minister margaret thatcher 
learned that former defense minister michael heseltine won enough 
votes from conservative members of parliament to force a 
secondround ballot next week that will decide if her 11 years in 
office will come to an end 
thatcher has been americas steadiest ally on a range of issues 
including the effort to rally support for sterner action against 
iraq 
baker had been pressing a lastditch effort to strike a deal 
before bushs trip to saudi arabia on wednesday however the 
soviet leaders statement indicated that the two sides were still 
far apart 
even so baker said the united states and the soviet union 
have been united in their approach to this problem since iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait we are united today we intend to 
remain united he added 
as the paris summit wound down its second day both us and 
soviet officials unveiled plans for a superpower summit in moscow 
early next year to sign a treaty on reducing longrange nuclear 
weapons 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there was no firm 
date for the summit although he said both countries were shooting 
for january fitzwater said having a nuclear arms treaty to sign 
was a prerequisite for the summit but holding the session in 
january is what we have been talking about and shooting for 
even before the end of the baker and shevardnadze meeting 
fitzwater said it seemed very unlikely that support could be 
rallied for a resolution to step up pressure before the presidents 
trip to the middle east 
the united states is seeking a new resolution giving advance 
authority to using military action to drive iraqs saddam hussein 
out of kuwait although officials said exact language has not yet 
been drafted 
shevardnadze in effect agreed that the matter should be 
reopened by the united nations but declined to go beyond that 
resolutions already approved by the security council impose an 
economic boycott on iraq and occupied kuwait call for iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of kuwaits 
previous government 
the resolutions do not authorize military action as such but do 
leave the door open to other measures if iraq fails to respond to 
the steps 
fitzwater refused to confirm a report that one resolution being 
discussed would call for automatic military action if saddam had 
not withdrawn in what fitzwater called a month or two months or 
three months or something like that the spokesman said there 
are any number of approaches that are being considered we will not 
comment on any one of them 
bush had failed to break the impasse during a twohour private 
dinner the night before with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
he flies to frontline saudi arabia on wednesday to meet with 
saudi leaders and the exiled emir of kuwait on the crisis he will 
spend thanksgiving with us forces in the region and will meet 
with egyptian leaders on friday 
baker will travel to yemen and possibly beyond to try to drum up 
support for us moves officials said tuesday night 
kim hoggard a state department spokeswoman said baker would 
fly to yemen on thursday to discuss the situation in the persian 
gulf and further steps we can take within the united nations 
framework 
sources demanding anonymity said baker might travel on to oman 
where he would confer with malaysian officials both yemen and 
malaysia are members of the 15nation security council 
yemen is the only arab nation on the council and has in the past 
shown sympathy for iraq it will assume the councils rotating 
presidency in december taking over from the united states 
meanwhile fitzwater criticized saddam husseins decision to 
release german hostages saying he has spawned a cottage industry 
of political ploys 
earlier in the day there was a flurry of separate meetings among 
leaders 
gorbachev met with thatcher who has issued calls for military 
action against iraq stronger even than bushs thatcher also met 
with french president francois mitterrand who like gorbachev has 
counseled patience 
ignatenko announced the bushgorbachev summit at a briefing 
here on the subject of a strategic arms reduction treaty 
ignatenko would only say if its ready they will sign it 
us sources said a summit seems likely early in january but 
for the record deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said we have nothing to announce 
it would be bush and gorbachevs fifth facetoface sessions as 
leaders monday nights dinner and four summits including 
meetings earlier this year in helsinki and washington and one a 
year ago in malta 
bush may visit turkey on the same trip after bushs meeting on 
tuesday with turkish president turgut ozal the white house 
announced bush would pay a state visit to turkey in the first 
part of 1991 
turkey is letting american bombers use its airfields and has 
closed a pipeline used by iraq but it has shown little enthusiasm 
about a military confrontation with its neighbor 
bush also met with polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
according to white house spokesman marlin fitzwater mazowiecki 
promised a polish hospital ship and rescue ship in support of un 
persian gulf policy

iraqi lawmakers voted tuesday to allow all german hostages to 
leave iraq and occupied kuwait and saddam hussein was reported to 
be patching up his ties with a key ally by promising better 
treatment of palestinians living in kuwait 
meanwhile a former cia official said iraq was casing us 
military installations in the middle east as possible terrorist 
targets if war breaks out in the gulf 
i dont believe the iraqis are going to unleash that 
capability against the americans at this time said vincent m 
cannistraro who resigned as a terrorism anaylst in september 
but they are certainly preparing themselves positioning 
themselves to do so once the situation changes 
saddam last week pledged to halt iraqi army harassment of the 
estimated 400000 palestinian workers and their families who live 
in kuwait a senior palestine liberation organization official 
said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said saddam 
made the promise in a meeting with yasser abed rabbo of the plos 
executive committee 
palestinians returning to jordan have complained of torture and 
executions in kuwait 
the iraqi lawmakers approved the special treatment of germans 
following a personal request by saddam there was only one 
dissenting vote 
the vote came after 90 minutes of debate during which the 
lawmakers heard from at least 10 of the guests as iraq calls 
foreigners barred from leaving since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the hostages who addressed the national assembly said freeing 
the germans would encourage european countries and the united 
states to show their willingness to avert war and negotiate a 
settlement to the persian gulf crisis 
parliament speaker saadi mahdi saleh said there were 124 germans 
remaining in iraq and kuwait no specific arrangements were made 
for their departure 
in paris german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher said of 
iraqs action i believe we should appreciate above all that the 
hostages are to be freed 
the gulf crisis continued to dominate the unofficial agenda in 
paris at the 34nation conference on cooperation and security in 
europe french president francois mitterrands spokesman hubert 
vedrine said the conference would not issue any statements on the 
crisis 
the january contract for light sweet crude the benchmark blend 
of us oil fell 181 to 2891 a barrel tuesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange erasing a 172 gain from the previous 
session 
president bushs failure to secure an agreement with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev on the un resolution to authorize 
military action was viewed as indicating war was unlikely soon 
analysts said 
bush flies to saudi arabia on wednesday to meet with saudi 
leaders he plans to spend thanksgiving with us forces in the 
region supply officers are trying to assure that all 230000 
americans deployed in the gulf will get fresh thanksgiving dinners 
the president voiced optimism that he would be successful in 
overcoming soviet objections to a un resolution authorizing the 
use of military force against iraq just be patient and all will 
be well he told reporters when asked about gorbachevs 
reluctance 
also tuesday the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
said saddams order sending 250000 more troops to kuwait was a 
publicity ploy 
gen colin powell said it was possible that saddam plans to use 
the extra troops to replace weary soldiers at the front lines 
but at the moment its just part of his headlineoftheday 
program where he tries to divert world opinion from his own 
aggression the fourstar general told cbs this morning 
yesterday was a troop buildup the day before that it was a 
hostage release 
in washington on tuesday a group of 45 democratic lawmakers 
filed a lawsuit to try to force bush to seek authority from 
congress before ordering a us military attack to drive iraqi 
troops out of kuwait 
we believe the president has a responsibility to send to 
congress a declaration of war said rep ronald v dellums 
dcalif 
the issue should be debated in congress because there are 
millions of american people in this country who have serious 
questions about going to war dellums said the president of 
the united states on his own cannot make that kind of 
determination 
saddam met in baghdad with delegations from france and 
switzerland on monday and told them more europeans would be allowed 
to leave the official iraqi news agency reported a dutch company 
reported that 105 dutchmen 14 belgians and three britons who 
completed a governmentcommissioned dredging project will be 
permitted to depart 
hundreds of foreigners have been prevented from leaving since 
saddams troops overran kuwait and the western allies have accused 
saddam of trying to use the hostages to split the alliance against 
him 
the official iraqi news agency quoted saddam as saying that 
freeing the germans would encourage others to distance themselves 
from the western allies pushing for war with iraq 
german chancellor helmut kohl told bush this week that a 
peaceful solution was still possible whoever believes the 
problem can be solved militarily must consider not only the 
mission but the end of the whole undertaking kohl said 
germanys constitution prohibits the deployment of german troops 
outside the countrys borders germany provided merchant ships to 
transport us troops to saudi arabia and contributed 2 billion to 
support the usled multinational force in the gulf

muhammad ali who converted to islam in the 
mid1960s flew to iraq to share a thangsgiving meal with us 
hostages in baghdad an antiwar group said tuesday 
the threetime heavyweight boxing champion who changed his name 
from cassius clay in 1964 after adopting the moslem faith was 
scheduled to arrive in the iraqi capital wednesday said gavrielle 
gemma spokeswoman for the coalition to stop us intervention in 
the middle east 
the retired boxer from louisville ky will meet with 
unspecified iraqi leaders before sharing a thanksgiving meal with 
several americans refused permission to leave iraq she said 
ali was not representing the antiintervention coalition but 
the group had helped him with travel arrangements gemma said 
ali also planned to visit athletes local schools and other 
groups during the viit expected to last through the holiday 
weekend she said 
mike brennan of the us state department in washington said ali 
would not have to check in with them before traveling to iraq as 
long as he intended to spend no money there 
this would mean for example that his expenses would be picked 
up by someone in iraq he said 
since its aug 2 invasion of kuwait iraq has prevented 
thousands of westerners from leaving the two countries in an effort 
to deter an attack by a usled multinational force massing in the 
persian gulf region

an ethics bill hailed as one of the 
toughest in the country cleared the state legislature unanimously 
tuesday as lawmakers sought to restore public confidence amid a 
criminal investigation 
the bill would prohibit gifts over 100 from lobbyists and 
political action committees to more than 32000 state and local 
public officials it makes exceptions for food and drink and for 
gifts from relatives fiances and roommates 
the measure which would take effect jan 1 would impose a fine 
of up to 5000 and a twoyear lobbying ban on lobbyists who 
violate it officials could be removed from office 
the measure passed the house 1190 with little debate then was 
approved by the senate 390 the legislature then adjourned its 
3hour special session on the subject the bill was sent to gov 
bob martinez who is expected to sign it 
the bill was sparked by an investigation into legislators 
acceptance of trips to hunting lodges ski resorts and foreign 
countries from lobbyists and their failure to report them as the 
law now requires 
state attorney willie meggs has subpoenaed records from dozens 
of lobbyists as part of the probe 
i believe its one of the toughest pieces of ethics 
legislation ever written in this country said rep everett 
kelly a democrat who chaired the joint committee that drafted the 
bill 
senate republicans led by minority leader ander crenshaw tried 
to amend the bill to prohibit officials from accepting any gifts 
from lobbyists no matter their value 
under this bill a lobbyist couldnt give you a 400 set of 
golf clubs said sen richard langley a republican but he 
could give it to you one club at a time 
but sen tom brown a democrat who was the chief senate sponsor 
urged no changes so the bill wouldnt have to return to the house 
for further consideration he said the 100 limit could be changed 
by the legislature in the future 
bill jones of the common cause government watchdog group said 
the bill was a good first step but paled in comparison with 
the need for campaign finance reform 
the measure clearly defines what a gift is and makes several 
exceptions most importantly allowing lobbyists to pay for food and 
drink of any price if its consumed at a single sitting 
government entities such as state commissions school boards 
and city councils could give officials gifts but universities 
and colleges could not that would end such perks as football 
weekends for legislators 
gifts such as those from government entities and from a person 
who isnt a lobbyist would have to be reported quarterly if over 
100

auburn universitys faculty senate on 
tuesday asked president james martin to explain his refusal to 
grant tenure for a roman catholic priest rebuked by the vatican 
martin however balked at discussing his denial of a permanent 
position for rev charles e curran and told the senate to take its 
complaint to the board of trustees which already has expressed 
support for the president 
i totally reject even the slightest insinuation that i or my 
decisions have violated anyones academic freedom martin told 
the senate 
curran the only american barred by rome from teaching catholic 
theology accepted a oneyear appointment at auburn where he now 
teaches in an endowed professorship 
the school initially advertised the post as being tenured and 
curran said he learned the job was not tenured only after he had 
already decided to accept it 
in the spring martin overruled two faculty committees that had 
recommended curran for the tenured position as goodwinphilpott 
eminent scholar of religion martin has refused to explain his 
decision either publicly or to curran 
the faculty senate which could have asked martin to reverse his 
decision adopted a resolution that asked the president to make 
arrangements by dec 7 to meet with the tenure promotion committee 
and discuss his denial of tenure 
if martin fails to comply with the request the senate will ask 
its executive committee to call a meeting of the entire faculty 
which could lead to a formal censure or a vote of no confidence 
university senate chairman gary mullen said before the meeting 
that the senate was not concerned with why martin denied tenure for 
curran our worry is the subversion of the tenure process he 
said 
but miller soloman an english professor and former senate 
chairman said we want to give martin every chance to explain 
what his reasons were for not granting dr curran tenure the 
fact that he would not divulge his reasons taints dr currans 
reputation 
curran 56 had said he did not plan to attend tuesdays 
meeting 
i am not really a player in this anymore curran author of 
20 books on christian ethics and morality said in an interview 
last week it is all going on around me 
curran has been involved in disagreements with rome since the 
1960s he led opposition to a 1968 vatican decree against 
artificial birth control and also disputes the churchs stance 
against abortion 
in 1986 the vatican cited curran for his disagreements with 
church doctrine and barred him from teaching catholic theology 
since then some 750 catholic theologians have signed a statement 
supporting him and the university of notre dame press still 
publishes his books

the wife of a former contra leader 
accused the sandinistarun police of torturing her husband to force 
a confession in which he implicated the vice president in an 
antigovernment conspiracy 
the government of president violeta chamorro denied her claim 
but the nations roman catholic archbishop was quoted as saying the 
purported plot was just a show and raising questions about her 
presidency 
aristides sanchez was released monday after spending four days 
in el chipote prison on suspicion of planning a 2weeklong series 
of protests by former contras and their sympathizers 
before his release sanchez signed a confession implicating vice 
president virgilio godoy which was read on national television 
monday night by security officials sanchez and his wife left 
monday on a plane for miami without speaking to reporters 
cecilia rodriguez de sanchez in an interview by phone from 
miami with a managua radio station tuesday claimed her husband was 
drugged kept in cells full of rats in 100degree heat and in 
a drawer like they have in the morgue 
la prensa newspaper which is owned by mrs chamorros family 
ran a frontpage story quoting cardinal miguel obando y bravo as 
calling sanchezs alleged confession and the televised appearance 
of government officials a show 
he said mrs sanchez told him her husband was tortured and 
drugged while in custody and i am worried about that according 
to the paper 
it quoted obando y bravo as saying he spoke to mrs chamorro 
about the political situation and believes she does not have all 
the information that she should have and all the control that a 
person who guides the destiny of a country should have 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo said sanchez 47 was 
treated well and kept in an airconditioned office because of his 
heart condition 
there was no answer at sanchezs residence in miami before 
returning to nicaragua this year he was a leaderinexile of the 
usbacked rebel forces that tried for 10 years to oust the 
leftist sandinista government 
the sandinistas lost februarys elections to a coalition headed 
by mrs chamorro and godoy since taking office in april mrs 
chamorro has kept sandinistas in control of the army and police to 
the chagrin of godoy and other coalition members 
mrs sanchez said her husband was forced to sign the confession 
and go into exile or face a lengthy prison stay 
he was held at el chipote the maze of rotting cells and torture 
chambers where dictator anastasio somoza kept his political foes 
before he was ousted by the sandinistaled revolution in 1979 
lacayo said sanchez was free to return from exile if he wished 
to face conspiracy charges he said sanchez was visited by 
representatives of the church the organization of american states 
and his wife 
oas representative santiago murray said he saw sanchez on 
thursday 
we spoke for about 15 minutes he seemed to be in good 
health murray said but he couldnt vouch for sanchez overall 
treatment 
in sanchez confession he accused godoy and other leaders of 
the fractious 14member government coalition of organizing the 
protests to force mrs chamorro to resign 
godoy who has praised the antigovernment demonstrations said 
sanchezs accusations were a tragicomedy 
they are trying to involve me in everything if tomorrow there 
is an eclipse theyll probably blame me for that too godoy 
said 
godoy and others claim that mrs chamorro is being manipulated 
by her chief of staff antonio lacayo who they believe is too cozy 
with the sandinistas 
since late last month demobilized contra fighters and 
disaffected members of the governing coalition have blocked roads 
and seized town halls mostly in southeastern nicaragua to demand 
that sandinista officials resign at least 10 people have died in 
clashes between protesters and armed forces 
the protests have eased a bit in recent days 
sanchezs confession as read by sandinista police commander 
javier lopez said the conspirators hoped to whip up discontent and 
make nicaragua ungovernable through fomenting chaos and 
anarchy 
all these pressures would force mrs chamorro to resign and 
thus dr virgilio godoy reyes would be able to assume the 
presidency of the republic the confession said 
godoy mocked the broadcast as following the most exact 
sandinista style 
the sandinistas often paraded accused conspirators before 
television cameras to read confessions to the nation

a group of harvard law school students 
filed a lawsuit tuesday against harvard university charging that 
it discriminates on the basis of sex and race in hiring law school 
faculty members 
wed like to sue our school secondyear law student linda 
singer cheerfully told the clerk of the middlesex county superior 
court 
the 38page lawsuit alleges that harvard law school has failed 
to hire any minority women asian americans native americans 
disabled latinos or openly homosexual men or women to tenured or 
tenuretrack faculty positions 
the lawsuit also charges that harvard laws faculty includes far 
fewer blacks and women than are represented in the general 
population of lawyers 
the universitys hiring practices operate to 
disproportionately exclude qualified women and minority candidates 
for tenured and tenuretrack positions the lawsuit claims 
these hiring practices constitute a continuing pattern and 
practice of discrimination in violation of state law 
the law schools dean robert c clark said the lawsuit has no 
merit 
the issue of diversity on the faculty is an important one and 
the law schools record is strong clark said in a statement 
in the past decade 45 percent of those whom the law school has 
hired in tenuretrack positions have been women or members of 
minority groups 
the lawsuit signed by 11 harvard law students was filed by a 
student group called the harvard law coalition for civil rights 
under a state law which bars discrimination in hiring by businesses 
or institutions with 15 or more employees 
according to the coalition five of 66 tenured and tenuretrack 
faculty members at the law school are women or 758 percent 
nationwide at law schools approved by the american bar 
association 237 percent of faculty are women the students 
maintain that women make up 3675 percent of the law graduates 
since 1980 
of the law schools four tenuretrack faculty members two are 
black but none are women the lawsuit says and three of 62 tenured 
positions or 484 percent are black 
clark did not challenge the students figures but said that the 
lawsuit failed to mention that about onethird of the schools 
parttime lecturers are women or minorities 
last year law students occupied clarks office for two days to 
protest harvards hiring policies 
the lawsuit asks the court to order harvard to give weight to 
diversity in its hiring decisions establish an affirmative action 
hiring plan and allow visiting faculty members to be hired 
immediately without going through a oneyear waiting period 
derrick bell who in 1971 became the first black appointed to a 
fulltime faculty post at the law school attended a sidewalk news 
conference after the students filed the lawsuit he took an unpaid 
leave of absence in april to protest harvards hiring policies 
bell rejected the argument advanced by harvard and other 
universities that affirmative action plans dilute the quality of 
faculty 
the diversity vs quality argument is a smoke screen intended 
to obscure the fact that these schools faculties remain 
predominantly white and male and that the quality of their teaching 
and scholarship covers a wide range from excellent to abysmal 
bell said

volunteers scouring detroit for people missed by 
us census counters helped push the city over the 1 million mark 
needed to retain bigcity political clout and federal and state 
dollars census officials said tuesday 
preliminary census figures released in august estimated the 
citys population at 970000 a tally city officials challenged 
sending out volunteers to search every street for uncounted 
detroiters 
while the final count still isnt in census bureau director 
barbara bryant told mayor coleman young that the city had topped 1 
million included in the recent tally were such people such as 
military personnel stationed elsewhere during the first count 
bryant said 
it includes people who might have been in a winter home on 
april 1 that for example added 22000 people to the count she 
said 
hooray hooray hooray rep john conyers a democrat said 
from his office in washington the powers that be finally got the 
message that the oppressed the homeless and the impoverished 
dont always have phones and houses from which to be recorded 
the preliminary count would have continued a steady decline from 
12 million in 1980 15 million in 1970 17 million in 1960 and a 
high of 19 million in 1950 according to census bureau figures 
officials have estimated that falling below 1 million would cost 
detroit about 16 percent of its annual operating revenue of 19 
billion 
for example about onefourth of the citys 11 billion general 
fund budget is from shared portions of state sales income 
intangible and single business taxes and other levies that would 
be cut if population dwindled 
the city would lose 38 million to 50 million in stateshared 
tax revenue in the first year new formulas were adopted according 
to michigan citizens research council figures 
young mounted a massive detroit were you counted campaign 
to round up uncounted residents 
by oct 24 the deadline for submitting additional names to the 
census bureau young said the volunteer forces had found 121350 
uncounted residents and estimated the final count would be at least 
11 million 
census spokesman jerry blocker said agency officials found that 
some of the names fed into the computer had been already counted 
but if they were missed they will definitely be counted 
blocker said tuesday we dont have a final figure but we will 
tell you its over a million

saddam hussein has again raised the stakes ordering another

in another frustrating development for us gulf policy bush

millions of americans will be sitting down to 
thanksgiving dinner and charles kuralt will be well the cbs 
commissary isnt that bad honest at least hell be off the road 
he and coanchor lesley stahl will be working as usual on 
america tonight the latenight cbs news series that began in 
october as an outgrowth of cbs specials on the persian gulf 
crisis 
kuralt who reckons he has logged a million miles for the on 
the road tales of american life hes done for the cbs evening 
news since 1967 returned last week from three weeks of 
campaigning and working 
the campaign was a publicity tour for his fifth book a life 
on the road a chronicle of his youth and life at cbs since he 
joined the network as a writer in 1957 
unlike most scriveners wandering the booktour desert kuralt 
56 continued at his regular job he coanchored america 
tonight from chicago los angeles and san francisco 
it was an experience as odd as it was exhausting he reports 
id run around and praise myself all day then work on that show 
all night 
he also continued anchoring cbs news sunday morning 
the campaign and tour wouldnt have come to pass had he not 
agreed to write a life after his last book the bestselling 
on the road with charles kuralt a collection of the road 
pieces hed done for cbs 
it helped though that he took the liberty of spending the 
advance for the new book before writing it of course dont you 
always first you spend the advance then finally you learn you 
have to write the book 
the last is a horrible moment for most authors facing the 
prospect of demands for a return of the publishers advance money 
they commence tussling with the muse 
thanks to the patience of his publisher kuralts tussle came in 
bits and pieces then in a flurry of typewriterpounding when the 
publisher said the book was coming out this fall ready or not 
the book emerged three years after kuralt agreed to write it it 
got a nice prepublication boost last month when the new york 
times travel section excerpted part of it 
suprisingly the part didnt concern the reports on smalltown 
america for which kuralt is best known 
instead it was his lamentation that its no fun to fly on 
airlines anymore that travellers face cramped seats unsmiling 
flight attendants and airport hubs that are little more than 
treadmills to oblivion 
he readily agreed with a suggestion that the fun started to fade 
when propellordriven dc7s were phased out and the era of jets 
particularly jumbo jets began 
maybe its his age he said but i used to find flying 
somewhere kind of romantic now its become an ordeal 
there is the possibility that next year kuralt may return not 
to airlines but to his cbs bus 
there could be more on the road pieces his last was in 
january should cbs decide at the end of december to park its 
halfhour america tonight series 
of what will happen kuralt said i dont know for sure i 
assume that it depends on part on events in the persian gulf if 
that heats up thats just my assumption nobodys ever told me 
that 
but the word is that its going to go off the air at the end 
of the year because the network has all these actionadventure 
shows they want to try out in that time period 
he referred to the fact that cbs is considering installing a 
revolving set of series in january against nbcs tonight abc 
news nightline and arsenio halls syndicated ventures in 
admiring visiting celebrities 
no decision has been made yet and america tonight has not 
been told definitely that its off at the end of december a cbs 
spokeswoman said 
if the series continues im going do this as long as its on 
or as long as they want me to kuralt said 
but if it gets a closing notice the bus on which he does his 
on the road pieces is parked in chicago waiting for me to 
come back to work if i can manage it and thats my fervent hope 
because thats the thing ive enjoyed most wandering around 
and doing those little stories 
 
elsewhere in television 
connie faces stars connie chung whose scheduled face to face 
with connie chung series was put on hold when she said she wanted 
to try to have a baby tonight has a face to face special 
featuring interviews with joanne woodward and her husband paul 
newman and with kevin costner on dec 10 shell anchor another 
face to face but instead of celebrity chats itll have two 
investigative reports

teller speaks 
penn is silent 
ha got your attention those two swindlers of sleight those 
houdinis of hustle stick to their usual roles for their nbc 
special tonight penn amp teller dont try this at home but for 
this interview teller speaks penn doesnt 
penn last name jillette tall wide loud boots bracelets 
funny haircut usually handles the talking for their act teller 
no last name shorter slighter mild and innocenteyed is 
eloquently silent 
his last speaking role on television was the 1987 madeforcable 
movie long gone before that he acted in an episode of miami 
vice 
hes usually the bemused smiling object of their crazed 
perilous magic for the grand finale of their nbc show teller gets 
driven over by a 70000pound truckload of concrete blocks 
miraculously he is not squished 
its something we always wanted to do teller said in a 
telephone interview from the daring duos midtown manhattan 
workshop for five years weve been saying wouldnt it be fun to 
drive a truck over teller 
it is not a pretty sight even teller admits he was a bit 
squeamish when the trick first was tested on penn amp tellers 
director of covert activities robbie libbon i nearly jumped 
out of my skin teller said 
it will give you the creeps and the boys cling to their 
tradition of revealing how they do it they also perform a 
beautifully choreographed illusion to music then give away the 
secret of that too 
penn performs a silent very romantic fireeating duet with the 
lovely model carol perkins who learned fireeating in about a 
half hour teller said ive tried to learn fireeating for 
about five years 
theres also a great bit where penn loudly declares that all 
magicians who produce animals onstage are wimps and the two 
isolate themselves inside a glass booth and produce thousands of 
live bees honest 
you learn to move very slowly and deliberately teller said 
its not really a trick he explained bees sting only when 
theyre protecting their nest or if theyre pushed teller said he 
was stung only twice while teller got 20 stings it is creepy in 
the extreme 
we worked up to it gradually teller said at first we 
wore the full beekeepers outfit then just the headgear then ok 
well take gloves off now then we were covered in bug repellent 
by the time we got on the air we thought part of the 
entertainment value for the audience was watching bees all over our 
heads and faces 
the lads also took the precaution of testing themselves and 
their crew against the venom of a full range of stinging insects 
their guest jane curtin performs a classic sleight of hand 
with audience members her patter is warm and sweet until shes 
compelled to do a penn amp tellerdesigned trick called the 
infected ear she gets nasty its great 
one cannot pigeonhole the art of penn amp teller as comedy 
horror suspense magic or the new vaudeville teller isnt 
interested in trying 
figuring that out isnt my job he said 
i do know a couple of things one is that were basically 
selftaught we really arent following anybody elses rules were 
doing stuff that penn likes and i like thats the only 
qualification penn likes it and i like it 
we just put together what we thought was good without putting 
it into a classification without worrying about the terminology 
he said 
and now for the silent portion of our interview in which penn 
large loud funny hair does not speak 
teller handed the phone to penn 
penn remains silent in the background teller can be heard 
shouting hes smiling hes nodding i think he thinks youre an 
ok guy now im going to put his head underwater 
what is penns expression under water teller 
hes trying to do a bemused smile and its not quite 
working 
 
elsewhere in television 
still crazy after all these years television never tires of 
giving us characters and situations that would play better in 
looney tunes and certainly with a greater sense of realism 
broken badges is one such 
it aspires to be an action drama about a team of police on 
psychiatric leave from their jobs this is reassuring imagine 
emotionally disturbed people with guns and badges 
new orleanians will wince at seeing miguel ferrer try to play a 
new orleans policeman of cajun ancestry who pronounces the term of 
enderament cher like the entertainers name instead of halfway 
between shay and sheh and theyll scream when another 
supposed new orleans policeman pronounces the city new 
awleenz instead of noo orlins as the locals say it

the chatter resembles that of any beauty 
salon women tease each other about their ages and their graying 
hair as they sit under hair dryers and flip through timeworn 
magazines 
posters of the latest hairstyles cover the battered walls and 
the pungent odor of the solution used for permanents fills the air 
the tools of the beauty trade at the mediumsecurity 
florencecrane womens facility are nothing special but theyre of 
some concern scissors electric razors and chemicals can be 
dangerous especially in the hands of convicted criminals 
some of these women are locked up for life some can receive no 
visitors but still inmates say the prison beauty shop serves an 
essential purpose 
everyone feels better even if theyve had a bad day said 
beautician diane carter serving 20 years on drug and escape 
charges its just like going shopping you get depressed and 
you go shopping 
its not a privilege its a necessity for a lot of us said 
sherron butler who is serving up to 14 years for writing bad 
checks and escape 
were also still human beings and if you love yourself youre 
going to take care of yourself when i got here i said great 
they have a beauty shop i can continue to be me 
butler was getting this seasons favorite style the 25 wave 
nouveau in addition to the curl she often comes in to have her 
hair colored autumn mist is her shade and to buy cocoa butter 
lotion 
rather than chip off her nail polish she can spend a quarter to 
dip her fingers and toes in nail polish remover inmates can have 
nail polish outside the shop but the remover contains alcohol and 
stays put 
the shop has its regulars but most inmates cut each others 
hair in the housing units where theyre permitted to check out 
bluntended scissors 
each state prison has a hair care area where inmate barbers are 
supervised by a civilian cosmetologist said gail light a 
spokeswoman for the michigan department of corrections 
in federal prisons basic haircuts are free said dan dunne 
assistant public information officer for the us bureau of prisons 
in washington dc inmates who want something special like a perm 
or dye can buy the materials at a commissary and bring them to the 
prisons cosmetology unit for application he said 
the beauty shop at the florencecrane facility is cramped one 
authentic cosmetology chair is joined by a host of outdated barber 
equipment bought used or donated hairdryers line the wall near the 
window sill where a newly arrived air conditioner blows comfort on 
feverish summer days 
mildred perry one of four inmate beauticians remembers 
converting the space from junk room to beauty shop when she was 
transferred to florencecrane in 1985 
there was a desperate need for a beauty shop said perry 
who is serving a life term for seconddegree murder we knew the 
selfesteem would go down they didnt care about themselves any 
more 
this was the only chair there was one working spigot with 
cold water and one bucket it just grew and grew we had to get a 
crochet needle to pull the hair through the cap for the first 
frostin job we did 
most of the cosmetology units operating costs are covered by 
what they charge customers and its prices are competitive with 
outside shops a price list hangs near the rinse sink 14 for 
jazzing color 20 for a frosted perm 6 for hot oil and 
condition treatment 5 for a plain cut 
money never changes hands women contact the cosmetology unit 
for an appointment and the civilian cosmetologist who operates 
mostly as an observer checks their accounts to make sure they have 
enough 
the shop in the main prison is open two days a week and the 
four prisoners serve about a dozen customers each day an annex 
salon is open saturdays 
some of the workers had cosmetology experience before being sent 
to the prison others picked it up in prison inmates have asked 
for a certification program so theyll be able to get cosmetology 
jobs when they leave prison but there is no money to pay for it 
the beauticians who get 150 a day and a free hairdo a month 
must hand in their nurselike smocks and are searched before they 
leave work said assistant deputy warden terri baker 
no incidents other than minor thefts have been reported 
probably because corrections officers and the civilian 
cosmetologist always are watching 
beautician serena gordon serving a life term for seconddegree 
murder said shes never been threatened with violence by a 
customer who didnt like the way her hair turned out 
she recalled a young woman with black hair who wanted it 
frosted 
when i got done she just started crying gordon said she 
didnt realize it was going to make her look that old 
gordon also gave a professional bleach job to another inmate 
whose hair temporarily turned green 
that time she said i cried

an alleged drug baron and two men 
suspected of opium dealing are members of the new parliament 
creating speculation that pakistans already sluggish antidrug 
campaign may founder 
officials say about 30 tons of heroin are shipped from pakistan 
every year domestic and foreign narcotics officers have criticized 
successive governments for failing to stop the trade 
they have not been able to successfully prosecute and imprison 
what you would call a major drug figure a narcotics agent said 
on condition of anonymity 
the united states frustrated by the lack of action has 
threatened to cut off more than 500 million in economic and 
military aid that already has been frozen because of suspicion that 
pakistan is developing nuclear weapons 
ayub khan afridi said to be one of pakistans main drug 
traffickers won a national assembly seat in the oct 24 elections 
at least two other successful candidates are suspected of 
largescale involvement in the opium trade 
a diplomat said also on condition of anonymity weve told 
them you have a handful in the national assembly that everyone 
recognizes are eardeep in the heroin trade its only going to get 
worse 
its the national assembly that passes the laws and if 
criminals are influencing how the law is written you can pass some 
pretty ineffective laws 
in 1983 afridi was convicted in absentia and sentenced to one 
year in jail after failing to show up in court to answer charges of 
drug trafficking records also show at least five outstanding 
arrest warrants on similar charges 
several antidrug agencies in pakistan and abroad have sought 
afridis arrest but with no success afridi dismisses the 
allegations as a baseless slander campaign conducted by former 
prime minister benazir bhutto during her 20 months in power 
thats rubbish said zahid sarfraz interior minister in the 
caretaker government that replaced ms bhutto when she was 
dismissed in august sarfraz who was in charge of narcotics 
control said the drug charges against afridi had nothing to do 
with politics 
prime minister nawaz sharifs new government created a narcotics 
ministry and put rana chandar singh in charge 
analysts doubt that singh a hindu will be able to penetrate 
the orthodox moslem tribal country where the drug trade is based 
the diplomat said perhaps thats why he got the job 
drug raids and arrests are made periodically and some are 
impressive 
narcotics agents confiscated more than 3800 pounds of heroin 
with an estimated street value of 130 million an 800 tons of 
hashish chemicals used for making heroin and a cache of 
semiautomatic rifles and missile launchers 
at least one person charged after the raid is a member of the 
baluchistan provincial assembly and of the provinces governing 
party 
such raids are highly publicized but pakistani and foreign 
narcotics officials say only smalltime operators and couriers go 
to jail 
the tribal area where opium and heroin are produced is a 
lawless strip of rough terrain along the border with afghanistan 
where pakistani authorities have little authority 
as one narcotics agent described it the tribal area is a 
sanctuary where they can operate virtually with impunity 
sarfraz the former interior minister found one of the 
outstanding arrest warrants for afridi shortly before turning the 
ministry over to his successor but could not order the arrest 
after he left office 
in an interview he said of afridi is he bigger than the 
government of pakistan either we let the name of the government of 
pakistan be dragged through the mud or we arrest him 
although a spokesman for the sharif government said afridis 
arrest was imminent he apparently is back in the sanctuary of the 
tribal area

former president augusto pinochet still 
is the army commander but has been losing political ground to 
patricio aylwin the elected civilian who succeeded him 
even rightwing politicians who supported the 74yearold 
general during his 16 years of military rule which ended in 
march are saying he should stay out of politics 
the annual revision of the armed forces high command this month 
gave aylwin the opportunity for a clear demonstration of his 
political authority 
for the first time since the political coup that brought him to 
power in 1973 the makeup of the high command was not determined by 
pinochet alone 
aylwin vetoed the promotions of two generals pinochet 
challenged his right to do so but aylwin was upheld by the general 
comptrollers office which rules on the legality of government 
decisions 
pinochet retained command of the army after leaving the 
presidency under a clause in the 1980 constitution the military 
regime wrote and aylwin cannot fire him 
before the transfer of power aides to aylwin predicted the 
general would retain great political authority and threaten chiles 
newly restored democratic rule that has not happened 
most observers acknowledge pinochets power has faded for 
several reasons a financial scandal involving army officers 
aylwins skillful handling of relations with the military and the 
disciplined nonpolitical attitude of the other service 
commanders 
in occasional comments to reporters pinochet insists he now is 
totally out of politics but some of his public actions suggest 
otherwise 
last may he publicly criticized aylwins establishment of a 
commission to investigate human rights abuses under the military 
regime 
in response aylwin summoned the general to the presidential 
palace and rejected the political connotations of his remarks 
later pinochet caused an international incident by saying the 
german army was made up in part of marijuana smokers drug 
addicts longhairs hommosexuals and unionists 
after aylwin condemned the comments pinochet withdrew them and 
apologized 
on sept 11 the 17th anniversary of the coup pinochet caused a 
political uproar by saying he would do it again under the same 
circumstances 
even some old supporters are putting distance between themselves 
and the general saying he has has no legitimate political role 
gen pinochet is no longer a political option in chile said 
sebastian pinera a leading rightwing senator 
another senator who was an ambassador under pinochet sided 
with aylwin in the dispute over the high command progoverment 
politicians who once feared the continued presence of pinochet as 
army commander now say they may have been wrong 
pinochet is not yet checkmated but he is nearing the end of 
his match said camilio escalona a socialist congressman 
loyalty to pinochet and support for him are believed to be firm 
in the army but only in his militare capacity 
aylwin told an interviewer on state television he does not think 
he will have trouble with the army and said of pinochet 
i understand that he who ruled the country as an absolute 
master for nearly 17 years now has trouble accommodating to his new 
role subordinated to the president of the republic and to the 
minister of defense 
the conflict with aylwin on the high command caught pinochet in 
a weakened position a congressional commission is investigating an 
army payment to one of his sons of the equivalent of 3 million 
apparently for the purchase of a metallurgy plant 
newspapers have reported in recent weeks on an illegal savings 
and loan organization in which several army officers participated 
many chileans expect a decisive moment in relations between 
pinochet and the civilian government in february when the 
commission investigating human rights abuses issues its final 
report 
trials are expected to result many of them involving military 
officers 
before leaving office pinochet said repeatedly he would not 
accept trials of military men on human rights issues

yes there is a future for homeowners distressed 
by falling housing prices and oddly the good news is the bad news 
the latest report on housing starts was even weaker than glum 
forecasters had anticipated falling to an annual rate of just 104 
million units in october a level not seen since the deep recession 
of 19811982 
it was also the ninth straight month of contraction in the rate 
which has fallen 27 percent this year alone bringing the latest 
level of new housing construction to half the rate that existed in 
1978 
thats only part of the bad news among the other elements of a 
miserable housing picture are declining economic confidence 
layoffs and job insecurity and various unknowns associated with a 
recessionary economy 
the good news is that housing and real estate are cyclical the 
down cycle generally creating conditions for the next up cycle 
when current construction fails to meet demographic needs it tends 
to strengthen future demand 
that situation may not exist now because too much housing may 
have been built in the 1980s and because growth in the lower age 
level of homebuyers has slowed but should the low rate persist it 
could lead to future shortages 
almost every homeowner understands the supplydemand factor 
because it made such an impression on 1980 markets denied a chance 
to buy because of high interest rates in the 1970s homebuyers 
swamped the market in the mid1980s 
the supplydemand equation was upset by the rush of buyers 
which in some regions reached levels never seen before as so often 
occurs in housing builders caught up with the demand just as it 
was headed back down again 
if the current downturn persists well into next year a change 
in the equation could occur again artificial incentives to build 
such as big tax deductions have been removed from the marketplace 
making it a less attractive area of enterprise it could mean 
starts will be slow to rebound 
still another factor might develop it is being widely forecast 
in the form of lower interest rates history has shown a very 
direct correlation between falling interest rates and rising 
housing sales 
how much rates are likely to fall is now one of the biggest 
guessing games in the entire marketplace historically a slowdown 
of economic activity brings down interest rates too but dont 
expect any plunge 
among the reasons why 
the united states has borrowed a lot of money from foreigners 
and it behooves the federal reserve to be wary of the exodus of 
dollars because of low returns 
continuing inflation fears 
too much existing debt 
but what seems to be a growing number of economists are 
convinced that america has had its fill of debt that the desire 
for it has been muted by the dangers and that borrowing as a way 
of life will decline 
one economist robert barbera of sherson lehman bros even 
foresees an antidebt environment he refers to debts 
demise and the ending of the 30year debt cycle if so 
interest rates should fall 
the news has indeed been bad for homeowners who cannot sell 
their houses or cannot afford their interest payments but if the 
past is a criterion and the forecasts can be believed better times 
are coming

john klein weeds a row of beets and white 
radishes with a turnofthecentury woodandiron push hoe 
nearby tall zucchini plants sprout limp yellow blossoms his 
mother barbara sells corn cucumbers tomatoes and fruit to 
passersby from a stand on the street 
this is new york citys last family farm two green acres in the 
fresh meadows section of queens surrounded by small brick 
apartment houses an elementary school paved ball court and a 
broad street noisy with buses and traffic from nearby expressways 
a couple of weeks ago these guys from florida got off the 
clearview expressway and came down the street asking directions 
and they couldnt believe there was a farm in the middle of queens 
they thought they were in the twilight zone said klein 25 a 
fourthgeneration farmer 
the two acres slightly bigger than a square city block with a 
chainlink fence on three sides and a lawn and tall oaks in front 
are all thats left of a 100acre spread that was sold off piece by 
piece over the years 
the kleins grow beets carrots scallions radishes basil 
dill parsley cucumbers squash and kohlrabies stuff that 
doesnt need that much room to grow klein explained 
the rows are so short he has to weed them by hand its too 
small to use a tractor he said by the time you got there 
youd have to turn it around 
but the family also grows corn melons and produce that needs 
more space on 100 acres in riverhead on long islands eastern tip 
its trucked in each day to the farm stand 
open july to november seven days a week from 9 am to 6 pm 
the farm stand on 195th street and 73rd avenue does a brisk 
business 
in queens to find a farmers market this is really an 
oasis said sylvia ehrlich as she examined tomatoes 
i come here all the time the stuff is delicious agreed 
michael morache who was buying zucchinis 
freshness is key i go out and pick it in the morning and by 
the end of the day its home in their refrigerator said klein 
we run out and pick the basil and dill and parsley right away for 
people because if you leave it out for a halfhour it gets 
wilted 
his greatgrandfather adam began farming in fresh meadows in 
the 1890s his greataunts margaret and stella live in two brick 
houses on the remaining two acres 
why keep the queens land when the family owns 100 acres in 
riverhead 
its definitely a tradition but its making a living also 
said klein if you go out to riverhead on every corner theres a 
farmstand but were the last ones here 
certainly queens is better known as home to the mets archie 
bunker and 2 million of the citys 75 million residents than as an 
agricultural community 
but queens like the other four boroughs has a rich farming 
past dating to the 1600s only in the 1800s did industry and 
housing begin to replace open space around the city narrow 
winding streets in lower manhattan recall cowpaths bleecker street 
in greenwich village harks back to the bleecker farm of colonial 
times in the 1830s trains chugged through miles of rocky 
wasteland overrun by pigs and goats from what is now little italy 
up to harlem according to the works progress administration guide 
to new york city 
small farms called truck farms because their produce was 
trucked into urbanized areas to be sod remained common in 
brooklyn queens staten island and the bronx until after world war 
ii when developers gobbled up land to build housing 
henry ludder the queens borough historian recalled cutting 
across vegetable fields as he walked home from school in bayside 
queens in the early 1940s i can remember pulling a carrot or a 
beet out of the ground rubbing the dirt off on my pants and 
chewing it as i went along he said 
about 20 farmhouses dating from 1679 through 1871 around the 
city are designated landmarks most are owned by historical 
societies two the queens county farm museum in floral park and 
the decker farm owned by the staten island historical society 
remain working farms 
but the klein enterprise is the last family owned farm within 
city limits even the klein farm in riverhead is one of a vanishing 
breed 
i imagine another 25 years riverhead will be like here and 
youll be out there writing about the last farm said kleins 
father also john 47 
after adam klein sold most of the queens property he bought 
farmland in hicksville long island and then was pushed out 
further east to melville and again out to riverhead 
i guess we cant go too much further or else well be in the 
ocean said the younger klein 
theres no farms in hicksville now and theres only four or 
five farms left out in melville and property is worth a million 
dollars an acre out there so the guys holding it are just dumb 
his father said 
would he consider selling the two acres in queens 
if i didnt want to farm anymore id just plant it with 
grass put a big swimming pool in the back he said if you 
dont have to sell it why sell it

james beard often called the dean of american 
food rose early most days not to get to the markets or his stove 
but to talk on the telephone a morning constitutional of gossip 
that could last two hours 
now beard himself five years after his death at 81 is at the 
center of a roiling kettle of gossip 
fermenting the gossip is a pair of biographies both a tribute 
to his pivotal role in the development of an american cuisine one 
of the books is a celebration the other is a portrait warts and 
all 
there is a bonfire of the foodies quality about this said 
robert clark who is writing a third biography of beard these 
are all goodhearted people who are competing to sit on his throne 
and then competing for status and stature in the food business 
beard was the genius behind the discovery of american 
cooking reveling in the fine preparation of simple local 
ingredients the same qualities that have become watchwords of 
good eating in this country many people who knew him called him a 
walking encyclopedia of gastronomy food he preached should 
always be fun 
he gave up hope of a career in the opera after nodes developed 
on his vocal cords and turned to acting but soon found few parts 
for a man his size 6foot4 and 200 to 300 pounds according to 
evans jones book epicurean delight 
so he brought drama to an early love food 
like theater offering food to people is a matter of 
showmanship and no matter how simple the performance until you do 
it well with love and originality you have a flop on your 
hands he once wrote 
stylish and outgoing beard also had a remarkable ability to 
attract all sorts of people willing to help him cook write 
organize his life and in later years get around 
james gave to everybody but the bargain implied giving in 
return wrote barbara kafka the editor of the other beard book 
the james beard celebration 
people would do unbelievable things for jim in work and in 
personal service things he accepted with such ease and lack of 
selfconsciousness that any notion of burden was eschewed she 
wrote 
beard traveled frequently and found friends students and 
colleagues everywhere he spent time oregon california new york 
london and france there were cooks restaurateurs writers 
childhood friends theater movie and opera people 
he wrote 22 books and countless newspaper and magazine articles 
consulted for restaurants catered opened cooking schools and was 
a spokesman for kitchen equipment and food products he was a 
pioneer of backyard cooking and of television cooking shows though 
he lacked julia childs affinity for the camera 
to oversimplify matters he was the person who almost 
singlehandedly transformed americas eating habits from salt and 
pepper and ketchup on the table to much more complex pleasures 
said george lang owner of the new york restaurant cafe des 
artistes and also a food columnist and friend of beards for 35 
years 
until beard cooking in america was essentially european said 
kafka whose book is full of reminiscences and recipes from those 
who knew beard 
her book is an invitation to join beard and his friends and 
their food and was published to raise money for the james beard 
foundation established four years ago in beards greenwich village 
townhouse by child peter kump its president and others 
the foundation offers workshops book parties dinners and 
exhibits of food photography and art a scholarship program is 
expected to begin granting money next year 
both books are really quite wonderful in their own way lang 
said the question is what youre interested in if youre 
interested in recipes for your main course then barbara kafkas 
book will be for you and the anecdotes will be dessert the 
opposite is true for jones book 
clark who edits the journal of gastronomy said his book will 
include no recipes but will be the story of american food over a 
100year period as told through the life of james beard 
beard grew up an only child in oregon where his mother had run 
a hotel and where she instilled in him her fascination with fine 
food 
i cooked fairly seriously by the time i was 14 and 15 beard 
is quoted as saying in kafkas book i never really learned i 
had a funny feeling that i could take something i ate and reproduce 
it like a musician with music 
it was a time beard also documented in delights and 
prejudices his 1964 memoirs at least in part beards efforts 
to write a sequel inspired jones and kafka 
he apparently tried to break his writing block with several 
people said kump a beard friend who opened peter kumps new 
york cooking school 
jones wife and editor judith jones of alfred a knopf inc 
said beard made some tapes with her husband which became material 
for his book and kafkas book begins with a transcript of a tape 
he made with her 
beard the gossip might have delighted in beard the topic of 
gossip friends said 
jones writes of friendships that fell apart business 
difficulties and the effects of beards domineering mother 
some people were unhappy that both books mention beards 
homosexuality clark said 
in kafkas book beard himself brings it up in a tape he made 
saying by the time i was 7 i knew that i was gay i think its 
time to talk about that how 
jones has heard the accusation that his book is homophobic 
perhaps in part because the subject is introduced in a footnote 
but he insisted he was merely being discreet and that beards 
sexuality is irrelevant 
there is a strong feeling of wanting to protect his memory and 
wanting to inherit his reputation on the part of a lot of people 
clark said he made people feel like he was totally theirs and i 
think the world is full of people who feel that they knew him 
best 
we didnt quite know how sticky that would be mrs jones 
said 
kafka wont discuss jones book asked why she said have you 
read it to the end 
in the final chapter jones describes her as a writer who at the 
time she and beard met may have known more about courts of 
intrigue than she did about the world of food 
i havent read what barbara calls her book jones said 
but beyond the gossip and the disagreements kump said its 
important that so much is being written about beard 
jim made a tremendously significant contribution to gastronomy 
in this country kump said 
and he noted all but two of beards own books are back in 
print

the first few storms of the rainy season have 
arrived in california bringing a little moisture and a torrent of 
hope that the state will dodge a disastrous fifth year of drought 
the fouryear drought the worst in 60 years in some areas 
already has cost the nations most populous state hundreds of 
millions of dollars in losses hitting farmers the hardest 
worstcase scenarios for another dry year call for business 
shutdowns heavy crop damage wildlife losses and devastating brush 
fires lawmakers also envision one of the fiercest water wars in 
state history between cities and farmers 
the states top weather forecasters have been running numbers 
through their computers all summer and the best they can come up 
with is that nobody knows what the winter will bring 
the only thing left is to appeal to the higher being to bless 
us with rain said ralph klages a nursery owner in the los 
angeles suburb of monterey park its frustrating and its scary 
because we have a lot to lose 
the rainy season which began nov 1 has gotten off to an 
unsettling start 
a series of midnovember storms people hoped would dump lots of 
rain and snow petered out leaving precipitation levels in most 
areas well below seasonal averages 
even in the absence of storm clouds many californians see a 
silver lining water experts say the drought might accelerate water 
management plans to avoid the day fastgrowing california wants 
more water than it can get 
but many of the solutions from additional water storage to 
desalination plants are too far in the future to help most 
californians who are bracing for the worst if the winter of 1991 
comes up dry 
in the southern california mountains ski lift operators who 
have had to make do with small snow packs in the past worry that 
shrinking water supplies could even keep them from making fake 
snow 
we havent had a good snow winter in a few years said 
monica bandows with bear mountain ski resort near big bear lake 
but now there is a chance that if the lake falls below a certain 
level well no longer be able to pull water out for manmade 
snow 
ron klievoneit who operates french gulch marina on lake 
isabella in kern county said business has declined 25 percent 
since the lake level dropped some store owners have gone out of 
business he said 
a lot of them have not had enough of a cushion and have gone 
defunct said klievoneit weve owned this place for nearly 10 
years weve been successful at it and i will just have to find 
ways to be successful for years to come 
farmers also could have to find a way to get through another dry 
year 
agriculture suffered an estimated 480 million in 
droughtrelated losses this year according to the state department 
of water resources 
in california farmers get their water from several sources 
including their own wells and state and federal water projects 
unless the 1991 water year is wetter than last season farmers 
could have their government water supplies cut by onehalf to 
twothirds federal and state officials say 
tree crop farmers are having particular problems said mike 
henry spokesman for the california farm bureau federation in 
sacramento last year they started seeing trees beginning to 
stress the roots are searching for water and theyre not finding 
any the tree itself starts to change its metabolism to survive and 
not produce fruit 
urban residents also face water cutbacks state deliveries could 
drop as much as 13 percent and federal deliveries could decline 25 
percent to 50 percent officials said 
some cities already have imposed rationing most notably santa 
barbara on the hardhit central coast where some residents paint 
their dead lawns green and wash their cars with dry rags that area 
has no access to government water supplies and relies solely on 
local sources 
los angeles the states largest city had voluntary water 
conservation this summer after early success the water use inched 
back up near the end of summer and mandatory rationing next summer 
could be imposed 
a cut in water supplies to industrial users would be 
devastating a 24 percent reduction could cost los angeles industry 
25 billion and 350000 jobs according to estimates by william s 
wade a consultant to the metropolitan water district a southern 
california water broker 
electronics manufacturers for instance rely heavily on water 
and even a small cutback in their already tight supply could force 
them to reduce production 
with water in short supply the competition could turn ugly 
some lawmakers say southern californians could lobby state and 
federal water authorities to pressure central california farmers 
into giving up more of their supplies 
it could get very cannibalistic for awhile said assemblyman 
jim costa dfresno 
humans arent the only ones who suffer in a drought in the 
angeles national forest the drought is hurting wildlife by drying 
up water sources and making the plants less nutritious 
mule deer are having fewer fawns black bears are coming down 
from the hills to the campgrounds looking for food and water and 
smaller less mobile animals such as wood rats and ground squirrels 
are dying said forest biologist bill brown 
animals also have gone beyond the campgrounds and into 
neighborhoods in san diego county people have reported foxes 
eating cat food raccoons slurping pool water and bobcats lurking 
around jogging trails 
the dry brush also increases the possibility of wildfire the 
state had one of its worst fires in history this summer when 
hundreds of homes were destroyed in a santa barbara area fire 
water officials say they have no idea how much precipitation the 
state can expect this winter but even a normal winter wont solve 
all the states problems they say experts say the state needs a 
wetterthannormal winter and even a second normal winter 
if we get a normal water year we can make all the state water 
deliveries said state water resources engineer bob fingado 
however that would leave our reservoirs at the same level and 
thats low 
and even after the state gets out of the current drought 
californias problems arent over the population explosion is 
straining the basic water system 
officials now are drafting longterm water plans including 
better conservation improving the coordination between water 
agencies and finding ways to reuse water 
california could become the leader in building plants that make 
sea water drinkable although a very expensive source of fresh 
water desalination facilities are under construction or in the 
planning stages in los angeles santa barbara and marin counties 
this drought should really serve to be a wakeup call for all 
of us said byron buck director of water resources planning for 
san diego county

the campaign season for local government offices 
in beijing opened with plenty of hoopla the city communist party 
chief shook hands at the main department store 
a brass band played vans with loudspeakers cruised city streets 
and the official xinhua news agency reported volunteers gave out 
1 million pamphlets 
only the candidates were missing 
they are chosen weeks later but there is no suspense for 
voters only members or supporters of the ruling party are 
nominated incumbents who supported last years prodemocracy 
movement already have been purged 
its like taking part in a play performed for the 
communist party a woman voter said on condition of anonymity 
we dont put much value on our voting rights 
for the communists the elections are a deadly serious play the 
basis of their claim to be the peoples choice 
all other officials are appointed in some fashion so chinas 
assertion of democracy rests entirely upon popular elections held 
every three years for the lowestlevel representative bodies 
district peoples congresses in urban areas and county peoples 
congresses in the countryside 
the congresses make no laws and function mainly as conduits for 
passing citizen complaints and ideas to higher levels beijing has 
18 such congresses with a total of 17000 delegates 
other parts of the country held elections in the spring but 
balloting in beijing was delayed until dec 26 the reason given 
was that everyone was too busy getting ready for the asian games 
held in september 
officials also may have wanted to keep the elections from 
coinciding with the anniversary of beijings massive prodemocracy 
demonstrations which the army crushed in june 1989 among other 
things the marchers wanted more say in picking government 
officials 
voters say they have little part even in choosing the local 
congresses god knows how the candidates are chosen the woman 
said 
after the single burst of citywide publicity that opened the 
election season in late october preparations reverted to 
closeddoor committees that take nominations from such official 
groups as the communist youth league and allchina womens 
association 
a group of at least 10 voters can put a candidate forward but 
few do the candidate would be unable to organize publicity 
activities and would have little chance of success 
the law allows two candidates for each seat but voters say 
there usually is just one 
because there are no competing parties television ads or 
debates campaigns are placid events it is not mandatory to vote 
but failure to do so is frowned upon and would be noticed 
chinese officials insist the system is more democratic than 
multiparty elections in the west which they say keeps power in the 
hands of the rich 
our election rights may not be the same as in the west but 
equality is a basic principle xu jingyu chairman of the 
election commission in beijings chaoyang district said in an 
interview 
he acknowleged not everyone can run for office only those with 
correct ideological views but said this was in keeping with the 
constitution 
delegates have to be able to represent the views of the 
masses he said how can someone who opposes the partys four 
basic principles do that 
the emphasis on ideological correctness is especially strong 
this year in keeping with the countrys conservative turn after 
the democracy movement was crushed 
a public notice addressed to comrade voters in the chaoyang 
district called for vigilence against bourgeois liberals who 
might seek to sabotage the election there have been no reports of 
any such plots 
bourgeois liberals are people who favor westernstyle 
democracy with more than one party 
xu was unable to explain why some people accused of being 
bourgeois liberals were elected to past peoples congresses 
the most prominent example is astrophysicist fang lizhis wife 
li shuxian a physics teacher at beijing university who shares her 
husbands dissident views and was elected in 1987 
she was expelled from the haidian district peoples congress in 
1989 soon after police accused her and fang of 
counterrevolutionary crimes they since have been allowed to go to 
the west 
people change xu said maybe when she was elected she 
didnt have this problem

in the middle ages french feudal lords bedded the 
wives of their serfs and called it a noblemans right nowadays 
male executives prey on female employees but some women are 
fighting back 
it is a new difficult battle for french women 70 percent of 
whom work outside the home 
according to a survey by the european communitys executive 
commission 36 percent of working women in france reported being 
harassed sexually by bosses or coworkers 
sexual harassment has been around for centuries yet its 
still a taboo subject said marievictoire louis a sociologist 
and cofounder of the association to fight violence against women 
at work 
any woman who brings charges of sexual harassment against her 
employer runs the risk of being ridiculed isolated not believed 
and naturally of being fired if she hasnt been already 
prospects of better treatment on the job are improving for 
women who make up 41 percent of the work force the national 
assembly is working on legislation expected to pass in the spring 
that would make sexual harassment a crime punishable by large fines 
and prison terms of two to five years 
the government agency that monitors womens rights is looking 
for ways of changing labor laws to enable inspectors to intervene 
in harassment cases and make employers responsible for the security 
of female workers 
only the employer can put an end to sexual harassment mrs 
louis said by law employers are required to provide working 
conditions which respect the employees health and safety and that 
includes an environment free of sexual harassment 
she said the campaign against sexual harassment got an 
unexpected boost from a satirical film about two female postal 
workers who turn the system to their advantage 
promotion canape couch promotion written and directed by 
didier kaminka has attracted about 1 million viewers since it 
opened in october xavier gelin the producer said negotiations 
were under way for a hollywood remake 
for me sexual harassment can be defined as repeated advances 
that end up turning into blackmail kaminka said in an interview 
sexual harassment is rampant when theres high unemployment and 
young inexperienced women without specialized training are afraid 
to lose their jobs 
kaminka said he spent four months inside the postal service 
where he found the expression couch promotion to be part of the 
vernacular one scene shows actress grace de capitani obtaining a 
desirable apartment from the postal services housing administrator 
only after promising sex 
officials said publicly that everything in the film is 
fiction but i can tell you its all true kaminka said 
mrs louis criticized the film for playing down the violence 
that accompanies many acts of sexual harassment 
in her small office in eastern paris she pointed to a pile of 
dossiers of women who had been abused verbally and physically 
beaten and raped by their male employers 
she described mrs a a dental assistant who submitted to her 
bosss repeated advances because she had an unemployed husband and 
a baby when she finally rejected him he reduced her salary 
bullied her and slapped her 
charged with assault he denied sexual harassment and said mrs 
a had consented to his attentions she later withdrew the charges 
in exchange for a letter of dismissal and 40000 francs 8000 in 
damages 
another case involved mrs b 24 hired by a town official who 
abused threatened raped and blackmailed her for two years 
mrs b finally went to authorities and the official was charged 
with several sex and assault offenses involving other women 
including a minor 
despite a statement of support from the mayor the official was 
convicted and sent to jail he was released however and the case 
is still pending 
fannypinching skirtchasing males have been french theater 
fare for centuries from molieres tartuffe to the heroes of 
slapstick boulevard comedies but mrs louis said 
theres nothing funny about the abuse of an employers 
power

six weeks after delivering thousands of 
dayold chicks to forest powells poultry houses a conagra truck 
rumbles back to pick up the flock now grown to fourpound 
broilers 
the process usually is simple the truck returns to the 
processing plant pulls onto a scale is unloaded and then weighed 
again the difference determines how much powell gets paid it also 
can help decide whether he gets another flock whether he stays in 
business 
though his birds seemed as plump as ever a few years ago 
powells flock weights were mysteriously falling or so the 
records from the conagra scales said he couldnt sleep for 
worrying about the debt he owed on his three chicken houses and 
equipment more than 80000 at the time 
powell consistently a toprated grower was told hed get just 
one more batch of chicks one sixweek chance to save his 
livelihood under his contract hed have no appeal 
i could have just lost my whole farm he said 
again and again he and his wife dorothy pored over the 
company weight charts and finally we come up with it 
what they came up with was evidence of systematic underweighing 
evidence amplified in the trial one year ago of a fraud suit filed 
by powell and 267 other growers for conagra the nations 
secondlargest chicken processor 
witnesses testified that conagra workers hiked the weights of 
empty trailers with such tricks as loading them with heavy 
steel drainage grates or standing on the scales 
a us district court jury in dothan ala awarded the growers 
136 million including 9 million in punitive damages it was a 
case said judge myron thompson of the rich seeking to get 
richer by stealing from those who could least afford to be stolen 
from conagra has appealed 
that isnt the only example of the rich seeking to get richer at 
the expense of independent growers according to some agriculture 
officials and growers themselves 
companies sometimes lure farmers into making huge investments in 
chicken houses with ads boasting of easy money waiting to be made 
but the reality of the business today is that contracts afford 
growers no protection against unexpected expenses ordered by the 
company such as extra fans and no protection against sudden 
firing they say 
contracts that companies offer to chicken growers generally run 
flocktoflock and permit termination without stated cause often 
with as little as 20 days notice 
what youve got said vreeland g johnson a lawyer for the 
growers is a feudal system almost these people are at the 
total whim and mercy of the processors 
consider 
underweighing and other alleged inequities have prompted 
complaints from north carolina to texas the heart of the 
broilergrowing belt everybody has the same problems 
everywhere said mary clouse who edits poultry grower news a 
newsletter its david and goliath 
state agriculture authorities in florida texas and minnesota 
have zeroed in on contract problems an oligopoly is developing 
in which a handful of megacompanies will soon control over 43 
percent of the total us poultry meat products market said a 
january study by the texas department of agriculture 
a lawsuit by fired growers in louisiana which ended in a 
sealed cash settlement accused conagra of maintaining oppressive 
and onesided contracts the suit said that after growers 
invested in chicken houses conagra imposed contract terms that 
hadnt been previously agreed on it also contended the companys 
standards for production were illdefined conagra contended 
the fired growers had performed poorly 
we have and have had for a number of years good grower 
relationships throughout the country said lynn phares conagras 
vice president for public relations we want happy growers the 
vast vast majority do indicate satisfaction 
in arkansas the leading chickenproducing state 200 growers 
turned out in october to organize for better contracts the meeting 
in nashville ark was a first growers have been afraid to 
speak out for fear of being laid off said bill fritts a leader 
of the group 
arthur gaskins president of the northeast florida broiler 
growers association was one who spoke out and got laid off by 
cargill the minnesotabased agribusiness conglomerate 
gaskins who had grown chickens for cargill for nearly two 
decades charged that he was cut off in retaliation for a suit the 
growers group filed alleging weight falsifications 
in april us district judge john h moore ii in jacksonville 
fla ordered gaskins reinstated the judge found substantial 
likelihood that the growers would succeed in their claims against 
cargill including unlawful coercion intimidation and 
discrimination against agricultural producers based on the exercise 
of their legal rights 
no trial date has been set in the case attorneys said 
we have done nothing to defraud or manipulate growers said 
greg lauser a spokesman for cargill which is appealing the 
injunction and denies intentional wrongdoing some improper 
weighing was done by lowlevel employees who since have been 
fired he said adding that growers were compensated with 
interest 
but gaskins maintains lowlevel employees are not the problem 
the whole contract system is wrote to benefit the integrator 
its a takeitorleaveit contract the farmer said 
the industry denies being unfair and insists that relations 
between companies and all but a minority of growers are 
satisfactory and mutually profitable 
its not one of these deals where you get rich in a hurry but 
its been a very stable type of situation where whether the market 
goes up or down the guy on the farm gets his money so the market 
risk is taken out for him said bill roenigk vice president of 
the national broiler council a washingtonbased poultry industry 
group 
we have a waiting list for growers noted ms phares the 
conagra spokeswoman 
grower advocates agree that the job can make money especially 
for growers whose chicken house loans are paid and who operate in 
areas such as maryland where they have a choice of processors to 
contract with 
but most areas of the country dont have much competition among 
the chicken processors so growers are left at the mercy of one 
firm they say their risk comes when they sign 15year mortgages on 
chicken houses that can cost 65000 each or make expensive 
companymandated improvements with no guarantees beyond a 
sevenweek contract 
lengthening contract periods to match growers mortgage periods 
was among reforms proposed by the texas agriculture department 
study the report also called for grievance procedures bonded 
weighers and flexible contracts with a set minimum operating 
margin of profit it found growers return on a 20000bird flock 
ranged from 579 to 4835 
but money was not the biggest problem the study found growers 
have no due process and they dont have any recourse and they 
dont have many rights said the texas agriculture departments

in august a reform law took effect in minnesota mandating that 
companies give 180 days notice and compensation for cancellation of 
an agricultural contract that required an investment of 100000 or 
more it also established a state office to investigate complaints 
and settle disputes 
the minnesota law apparently is the first of its kind florida 
legislators considered a bill after the gaskins case that would 
have required 60 days termination notice 
after hearing testimony from both sides including some growers 
who said they were happy with present contracts a committee 
shelved the bill but state sen karen thurman the chairwoman 
said it would be reintroduced if companies dont make changes 
you really dont want to get involved with free enterprise 
she said but at the same time you want to make it fair

terry howell figures he got nothing 
out of the chickengrowing business except some hardlearned 
lessons 
i lost everything i had said howell 32 who borrowed about 
100000 at age 19 to set himself up with chicken houses 
equipment a pickup truck and a trailer home for himself and his 
new wife 
i lost my vehicle my house my land everything he and his 
wife divorced because of the money problems at one point he 
said they pawned their television for cash to buy groceries 
when he went into the chicken business howell was following his 
father who cosigned on his loan the younger howell insists he 
built chicken houses and conducted his business just as required by 
the company he contracted with conagra 
he blames his failure on underweighing of the flocks he raised 
he is one of 268 chicken growers who sued conagra and won 136 
million last year 
conagra has appealed denying any intentional wrongdoing and 
saying it compensated growers fairly when the weighing mistakes 
were discovered 
howell would like to use his share of the award which averaged 
nearly 51000 for each grower to go to college and pick up 
something that i can make good money at i was totally relying 
on the chicken business 
even without weighing problems such reliance is a mistake 
grower advocates say 
farmers considering the business should be skeptical they say 
of company promises a perdue farms ad published last year in a 
maryland newspaper announced in large type this investment comes 
complete with a 218000 security blanket 
perdue spokesman brian taws said the figure represents revenue 
for 444 production weeks more than eight years he declined to 
comment on complaints about the ad 
gregg wilbanks who runs a louisiana financial consulting firm 
for farmers spoke to potential chicken house investors at a recent 
meeting sponsored by a bank a lot of people had the idea they 
could quit work and make a lot of money he said

when he was cast in the cbs series the 
flash john wesley shipp said he had second thoughts about 
playing a fantasy superhero in bright tights 
one of the issues i wanted to address before i took the job 
was how much time he spent out of the costume said shipp who 
was selected from about 50 actors who auditioned 
when i first heard about the flash i said no thanks i 
thought id just be running around in a union suit but they are 
taking the character of barry allen his alter ego very seriously 
so there is something in it for me as an actor it has a fantasy 
element but we also try to deal with social issues weve done 
shows about drug addiction and the homeless 
nevertheless the attraction of the new cbs show airing 
thursday nights is the fantasy of the flashs incredible speed 
and the startling special effects that make it look real 
other comic book heroes have found success in television 
including superman batman the incredible hulk and 
wonder woman 
but captain america and the amazing spiderman were less 
successful and the flash is struggling to find an audience 
the flash comic book made its first appearance in january 
1940 but never achieved the fame or the appeal of such comic book 
classics as superman and batman and disappeared by 1950 
it was revived and modernized in 1956 and the cbs series is 
based on that version a third incarnation currently is running in 
comic books 
the flash also is barry allen a young scientist who comes 
from a family of irish policemen allens father is none too happy 
that he hasnt become a policeman too 
one of the things i liked is that when barry gets the super 
powers in a laboratory accident his first reaction isnt ok im 
going to save the world shipp said he goes to another 
scientist played by amanda pays and asks her what it means he 
worries that it might mean premature aging he decides to use the 
powers after his policeman brother is killed 
shipp said he thinks some comic book characters have been 
treated in a ludicrous manner by television 
you have to create a world of your own he said you cant 
put a guy in a red suit with wings on his head on hollywood 
boulevard 
i dont want the flash to become a vigilante i dont want 
him to abuse the power im after the writers to explore its 
effects on barry some people just want to make it the good guys 
vs the bad guys 
the show is expensive the pilot cost 65 million and each 
episode costs 14 million shipp said 
a great deal of the technical wizardry goes into making 
superhuman speed look authentic 
we walk a thin line between something that can be 
sophisticated and something that can be laughable shipp said 
we do a lot of night shooting we use a lot of wet streets and 
reflected lights you have to be careful how you use the suit to 
me it has to be used as a visual effect it has to be carefully 
lit and photographed 
the look of the flash is a mixture of vintage styles with 
the 1990s completely omitting the 1960s 70s and 80s the 
wardrobes combine long coats and fedoras from the 1930s with 
contemporary clothes the vehicles are from the 30s 40s 50s 
and 90s 
the look of speed comes from an unusual smear effect it 
requires a long exposure of the main scene and a second film in 
which shipp recreates his movements exactly in front of a blue 
screen the two images then are combined on digital videotape to 
give the appearance hes moving at 600 mph while everyone else is 
moving at normal speed 
the special suit shipp wears is a type of body appliance that 
gives him an imposing heavily muscled appearance its in 30 
pieces and takes about 30 minutes to put on and its so hot that 
its equipped with a cooling system 
before beginning the flash shipp played the father in the 
sequel to the film the neverending story he also worked in 
such soap operas as the guiding light as the world turns 
and santa barbara 
the sequel takes the fatherson relationship further he 
said of the neverending story 
its funny in that fatherson relationship i was the father 
in the flash im the son in the fatherson relationship the 
actor in the neverending story who plays my son jonathan 
brandes plays a street kid in the flash episode were shooting 
now

if instead of heading for las vegas a 
highroller in 1980 bought a typical acre of us farmland for 750 
in hopes of turning a fast buck the profit would hardly have been 
the stuff of a gamblers dreams 
the speculator could have sold the one acre in 1982 for a record 
823 that would have been a profit of less than 5 percent a year 
but it would have been a profit and there are more losers than 
winners at roulette tables 
after the us farmland boom of the 1970s peaked in 1982 
however it was downhill for years with the bottom in 1987 at an 
average of 599 per acre 
by 1990 according to the agriculture department farm real 
estate prices nationally including buildings as well as land 
had recovered to around 693 per acre 
these are only averages no doubt there have been some 
speculative land deals that have resulted in somebody getting rich 
but did speculators help run up farmland prices in the 1970s so 
much that the bottom was bound to fall out of the market in the 
1980s 
a usda analysis says it is doubtful that speculation and easy 
credit policies led to the farmland bust there is little doubt 
however that the slide in land prices was a huge factor in the 
financial crunch that gripped the nations agriculture in the 
mid1980s 
land is the main asset of farmers and when values crumbled 
their collateral shrank and so did their borrowing power 
many market observers said farmland prices reflected a 
speculative mania rather than expected farm income the report 
said speculative manias often called bubbles occur when 
investors buy an asset intending only to sell it later at a higher 
price rather than using it to generate income over a number of 
years 
the report was written by fred kuchler and abebayehu tegene of 
the departments economic research service and is in the november 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
while there is some circumstantial evidence of a speculative 
bubble in the 1970s the longrun stable relation between farmland 
prices and returns as measured by cash rental rates leads to the 
conclusion that bubbles have most likely not occurred in farmland 
markets the report said 
rather it added expectations about future farm incomes 
and other economic factors have determined and continue to 
determine farmland prices 
the report also said that many analysts believe aggressive 
lending policies touched off a speculative bubble in farmland 
prices during the 1970s 
that conclusion appears to be incorrect but the evidence does 
not rule out the possibility that aggressive lending reflected in 
lower mortgage rates or greater volumes of credit could have 
caused investors to reevaluate their expectations the report 
said the lenders probably made farmland a much better 
investment 
recently the american bankers association released an 
independent study that said a liberalization of farm credit system 
lending policies nearly 20 years ago led to the boomandbust era 
in agriculture 
according to the study the cooperatively owned farm credit 
system which includes federal land bank associations was 
authorized by congress in 1971 to raise its collateral limit for 
farm real estate loans that meant larger loans to buy land 
the bankers study said the liberalization unleased a boom in 
land prices in rural america that saw the inflationadjusted value 
of farmland nearly double from 1971 to 1980 
but the bankers study said the boom was unsustainable and that 
by the mid1980s the average real value of farmland after allowing 
for inflation was almost down to its 1971 level 
the usda reports it is impossible to prove conclusively that 
speculative bubbles exist or do not exist one reason is that 
economists do not agree exactly on how much income should be 
attributed to land 
if there was no speculative bubble the runup in farmland 
prices during the 1970s must reflect big shifts in expectations 
the report said farmland investors might have believed that farm 
income would rise at a faster pace or that income would continue to 
rise at the rate of the 1950s and 1960s

here are some facts figures and details about 
asbestos and the manville personal injury settlement trust which 
is to be reorganized under a plan presented to a federal judge 
monday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
asbestos is a flaky white mineral with natural fire heat and 
electrical resistance it was used widely for decades in various 
industries predominantly shipbuilding boilermaking and 
construction during world war ii asbestos manufactured by what 
was then known as johns manville co and several other companies 
provided the bulk of asbestos used in shipyards nationwide 
hundreds of thousands of workers were exposed to asbestos but it 
wasnt until the 1970s that a definitive link between the mineral 
and severe respiratory diseases including lung cancer was 
established asbestos today has been removed from public buildings 
nationwide 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
manville corp which was the nations leading asbestos maker 
entered chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings in 1982 because it 
couldnt meet its legal liabilities from thousands of asbestos 
health lawsuits the manville trust was formed as part of the 
companys 1988 court reorganization dozens of other companies 
nationwide face mounting legal problems due to asbestos liability 
several have entered bankrptcy court others are financially 
burdened by the liability and many are looking to the manville 
settlement as a possible model for resolving claims asbestos cases 
comprise the biggest product liability issue in us history 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
plaintiffs and defendant companies have been wrangling over 
asbestos compensation since the mid1970s and well over 2 billion 
has been paid out to workers or their families thousands of 
claimants have died before being paid companies have been held 
liable predominantly for a failure to provide adequate health 
warnings to workers today more than 90000 asbestos lawsuits crowd 
federal and state court dockets nationwide mass trials often are 
held resolving hundreds of cases at a time jury awards have ranged 
from nothing to more than 1 million for individual plaintiffs

the manville trust is the biggest claims resolution mechanism in 
the country it was set up with about 3 billion in cash and 
manville securities the washington dcbased trust has paid more 
than 11 billion to settle over 23000 claims to date but it has 
another 130000plus claims pending and faces an estimated 100000 
future claims earlier this year the trust declared it had run out 
of cash and said some claimants wouldnt get any money until well 
into the 21st century us district judge jack b weinstein 
ordered an overhaul of the trust to meet its claims the trust 
blames the cash drain on the fact that it received more claims 
resolved cases faster and paid more than it had expected critics 
say it was badly managed and squandered its cash 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the trust previously had settled cases based on the time of 
filing rather than the type of disease and victims need the 
restructuring scraps that plan dividing claims into two 
categories serious ailments such as lung cancer and less severe 
problems claimants will receive only about 45 percent of their 
settlements value annual payments will be made dividing the 
total amount owed to a claimant by the total amount of the trusts 
available resources claimants in the first group will receive 
priority during the plans first two years the second group wont 
receive any payments until the third year of the plan the plan 
caps plaintiffs lawyers fees at 25 percent of settlements and 
dismisses all litigation against the trust the plan still must be 
approved by weinstein and is expected to face legal appeals from 
dissatisfied parties 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
manville corp has agreed to inject an additional 520 million 
over seven years into the trust which owns 80 percent of the 
companys common stock manville is to pay 280 million in 
dividends over four years to the trust and another 240 million in 
years four through seven the trust also holds 18 billion in 
manville bonds which it plans someday to sell manville is to make 
75 million a year in bond payments to the trust starting next year 
and give the trust 20 percent of its annual profits beginning in 
1992 participants in the restructuring envision using the stock 
dividends for three years and then selling the bonds and some 
common stock to finance payments to victims all agree there still 
is not enough money to meet victims demands

the overhaul of the cashstarved manville trust 
fund is designed to guarantee compensation for tens of thousands of 
american workers made sick by asbestos but payments arent likely 
to resume for a year or more 
the proposed restructuring unveiled monday slashes fees for 
plaintiffs lawyers and ensures at least some payment to all 
claimants within three years of its enaction 
but the plan submitted to us district judge jack b 
weinstein already is being criticized by some attorneys for 
plaintiffs and companies with asbestos liability a key victims 
advocacy group also said it will oppose the reorganization 
it is a terrible compromise said heather maurer executive 
director of the asbestos victims of america an advocacy group for 
18000 victims based in soquel calif i dont think giving an 
individual 3000 or 4000 is in any way just compensation for 
their diseases and deaths 
the restructuring effort is designed to help resolve the biggest 
product liability issue in us history 
asbestos once considered a miracle fiber has caused thousands 
of deaths from lung cancer and other ailments and resulting 
lawsuits have sent several companies into bankruptcy court and 
strangled court dockets nationwide 
the manville trust is the biggest asbestos health claims 
resolutions mechanism formed as part of manville corps 1988 
bankruptcy reorganization the trust has paid more than 11 
billion to settle about 23000 claims since its formation in 1988 
but it faces another 130000plus claims and was ordered 
restructured after running out of cash earlier this year 
the restructuring plan calls for paying claimants based on the 
severity of their illnesses cancer and other serious diseases are 
in one group with lesser ailments in the second 
the plan caps lawyers fees at 25 percent of clients 
settlements and orders dismissal of tens of thousands of lawsuits 
against the trust both steps should produce hundreds of millions 
of dollars more for plaintiffs 
its architects defend the plan as the only way to deal with a 
severe cash drain during the trusts first two years of operation 
when it settled claims on a firstcome firstserved basis 
there is not enough money to compensate everybody as if the 
funds were unlimited said christopher placitella a woodbridge 
nj plaintiffs lawyer who helped negotiate the plan the 
objective is that hopefully everyone will be treated equally 
the plan is certain to face opposition weinstein today is 
expected to appoint an independent outside reviewer and schedule 
court hearings in new york new orleans chicago and san francisco 
for within 60 days 
payments will remain suspended until the restructuring takes 
effect in addition to the hearings potentially lengthy court 
appeals are expected that lawyers said could take a year or more 
the plan was approved by a committee of plaintiffs lawyers by 
52 the dissenting attorneys argued that the plan treats claimants 
with lesser illnesses unfairly by deferring their payments 
the trust also is to rely on its 80 percent ownership of 
manville stock for funding after the first three years of the plan 
if the depressed stock price doesnt rise the trusts assets will 
be hurt severely 
lawyers for companies with large asbestos liabilities said the 
plan attempts to increase other defendants payments to victims by 
prohibiting juries from learning the size of manville settlements 
it also will make other companies pay full settlements to 
plaintiffs then wait in line to collect the trusts share 
manville once the nations largest asbestos maker via the trust 
generally has been assessed the largest share of jury settlements 
the net effect is reducing manvilles share and trying to make 
the other companies pay more than their fair share said andrew 
berry a newark nj lawyer for several defendants 
payments would be made annually to claimants based on a 
percentage of the trusts available resources 
claimants are to receive a maximum 45 percent of settlements 
until all claims are at least partially met manville trust 
payments have averaged about 43000 but are forecast to fall more 
than half for serious diseases and even more for less severe 
ailments under the new scheme 
payments would be made only to an estimated 23000 firstgroup 
claimants during the plans first two years the group includes 
relatives of workers who died before being compensated 
the more than 100000 claims in the second group would begin 
receiving payment in the plans third year payments are to be made 
first to those with hardships then according to disease severity 
then to claimants over 70 years old and finally to those who filed 
first 
payments to all manville claimants except those with urgent 
health or financial needs were suspended in july 
the washington dcbased trust originally was funded with 
about 3 billion in cash and manville securities manville a 
denverbased manufacturing and minerals maker has agreed to pump 
up to 520 million into the trust over seven years

an unprecedented fourday strike by floor 
traders is paralyzing italian stock markets dashing a trading 
volume of hundreds of millions of dollars daily and possibly 
scaring off foreign investors 
the national association of bourse floor traders says its 1000 
members chief gripe is government inaction on longawaited 
regulatory reforms intended to make the markets more competitive 
internationally 
the reforms would regulate public tender offers insider trading 
and financial intermediaries 
another change merging floor traders with security 
intermediaries including brokers commission dealers and banks 
would be aimed at making stock trading smoother and upgrading the 
italian bourse 
the floor traders also are protesting the increased paperwork 
associated with a proposed 30 percent tax on capital gains 
rino formica the socialist finance minister called the 
blockade of stock operations a revolt against the proposed tax 
the traders reject the claim that they are upset over the tax 
the idea of a tax on capital gains has been long digested by 
italian markets we are protesting slowness in implementing reform 
which is hurting the competitiveness of italian markets and 
prompting investors to flee said a member of the milanbased 
association who spoke on condition of anonimity 
italys stock business is confined to about 200 brokers it is 
considered a relatively weak market in europe because of the 
limited number of listed companies 220 and because there isnt a 
law against insider trading 
the association is increasingly worried that londons seaq 
trading circuit could siphon a significant amount of business from 
italian exchanges 
some analysts predict that up to 40 percent of the trading in 
italian stocks would be done in london unless the italian 
parliament passes reform laws 
several italian blue chip companies such as fiat generali 
olivetti pirelli montedison and sip are traded in london and 
have been quoting prices during the strike in italy 
the strike initiated friday is scheduled to last through 
wednesday when a delegation of traders and the government are set 
to meet in rome to discuss the case 
in the meantime picket lines outside the two largest italian 
markets in milan and rome prevented trading in equities and bonds 
only foreign exchange quotations by bank officials were 
completed 
although several floor dealers emphasized that they were seeking 
protection for their jobs the labor action did not get full 
support from leftist trade unions 
lunita the organ of the italian communist party called the 
stock market strike a protest by the rich against a most sacred 
tax 
albert alonzo an italy analyst with barclays de zoete wedd of 
london noted that to close the market down does not endear the 
market to foreign investors 
the blockade in fact comes at a difficult time for italian 
financial markets already in deep malaise following a drop in 
trading volume and in prices due in part to the gulf crisis 
the milan stock market index fell about 25 percent from last 
january to midnovember while quotations of blue chips such as 
fiat and olivetti hit the lowest levels in years 
the worst problem however is the confusion about the capital 
gains tax and about when reforms will be enforced said a milan 
broker

the mirage hotel celebrates its first 
anniversary as the premier showplace on the glitzy strip this week 
and chairman steve wynn says it has exceeded his heady forecast of 
a year ago by miles and miles 
at a time when gaming competitors donald trump and bally corp 
are facing mounting financial woes wynns mirage is the talk of 
the industry 
well do 40 to 50 percent better than our best expectations 
wynn said in a weekend interview 
even prophets of doom in the financial community are backing off 
dire predictions made a year ago when wynn opened the 630 million 
3100room resort which features a flaming volcano white tigers 
and bottlenose dolphins 
hotel revenues the first year will run between 600 million and 
650 million wynn said his fingers sweeping across the latest 
monthly balance sheet 
before his resort opened a year ago thursday wynn was 
forecasting cash flow of 130 million to 140 million gaming 
analysts projected 110 million to 120 million 
now wynn says that figure will be closer to 180 million to 
200 million 
the amazing thing is that we keep expecting it to slow down 
and it doesnt dan lee a gaming analyst with first boston inc 
said monday 
ordinarily the second year a casino is open is more profitable 
than the first but with the year they had that will be hard to 
top lee said 
the success of the resort has prompted wynn to borrow another 
100 million for upgrades at the property such as a 14 million 
15 million gallon home for five dolphins 
the idea of 500 millionplus in debt doesnt bother wynn 
youve got a property here thats appraised at somewhere north 
of a billion probably 12 billion wynn said 
wynn estimates 25000 to 45000 people visit the mirage daily 
surpassing hoover dam as the most popular attraction in southern 
nevada the estimates mean that 13 million of the 19 million people 
who visited las vegas the past year stopped by an estimated 
750000 people overwhelmed the resort on opening weekend a year 
ago 
wynns mirage has had a domino effect on this gaming community 
which mesmerized him when he visited as a 10yearold boy 38 years 
ago 
the mirage has transformed the strip and has sparked a 
multibilliondollar building boom of new hotels and massive 
additions to existing properties the hotel boom has spread to the 
rest of the citys economy making it one of the fastestgrowing 
cities in the country 
wynns hotel and casino was the most expensive in the world 
until trump opened his 12 billion taj mahal earlier this year 
the taj has been unable to meet its debt service and faces 
financial reorganization 
wynns parent golden nugget corp sold its atlantic city 
property to bally in 1987 for 440 million 
he thinks the sale was a smart one as new jersey gamers face 
increasingly tough times 
we saw the outcome of the atlantic city process pretty much 
the way it worked out wynn said thats why we wanted to sell 
we became very concerned about the atlantic city market in 86 we 
thought it was going to run out of steam that the regulatory 
policies of state law were going to kill it the politicians are 
the ones who screwed it up 
the failure is atlantic city not donald trumps ego wynn 
said of problems at the taj mahal theyre all in trouble it 
isnt just the taj its the town the trouble is the guys there 
have to overcome the city whereas here the city helps make the 
hotel 
the problem is much deeper than whether donald trump or 
ballys or anyone else is smarter the guys who knew the town 
havent had a way to get out or they would have 
he would have been much stronger if hed left the taj alone 
wynn said of trump who once called wynn a classic 
underachiever

greyhound lines inc has tied its bankruptcy 
reorganization to a dispute with the national labor relations board 
over treatment of its striking drivers 
in a chapter 11 plan filed with a bankruptcy judge in corpus 
christi monday greyhound said it will restructure itself and issue 
new stock most of which will go to unsecured creditors 
the plan must be approved by us bankruptcy judge richard s 
schmidt and greyhounds creditors its completion also hinges on 
how schmidt views the nlrbs charges against greyhound on behalf of 
6000 drivers who went on strike in march 
the nlrb has charged greyhound with unfair labor practices and 
says the company owes the drivers more than 80 million in back pay 
and damages attorneys say the filing says greyhound will not 
proceed with the reorganization if drivers win more than 40 
million 
the company earlier asked schmidt to define any amount of money 
the nlrb wins for strikingdrivers as an unsecured claim at the 
bottom of greyhounds list of obligations 
if those two conditions are not met we would not try to 
confirm this plan we would pull it back and relook at it said 
george w hanthorn senior vice president and general counsel for 
greyhound 
attorneys for the drivers received copies of the plan late 
monday and had no immediate comment 
under the plan all of greyhounds routes will keep operating 
i think really the key to the plan is the way our operations 
have come back since the strike hanthorn said without those 
improved and good operations a plan like this we have proposed on 
this fast a track couldnt happen 
passenger revenue fell below half of 1989s monthly levels 
during the first part of the strike but steadily increased over 
the summer and in october was 90 percent of the 1989 figure 
the company would like to complete the reorganization process by 
next spring or early summer hanthorn said 
greyhound filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code in early june three months after the 
drivers went on strike over wages and benefits the expense of 
fighting the strike and a fall in revenue after the strike siphoned 
cash greyhound needed to operate the company said then 
the plan shows greyhound placing less emphasis on its charter 
service its food subsidiary will be liquidated and travel service 
subsidiary which is assigned no value in the plan will be 
dissolved 
reducing its charter business eliminating some routes and 
consolidating others allowed greyhound to hire substantially fewer 
drivers to replace the members of the amalgamated transit union who 
struck the company 
about 600 drivers crossed the picket line and the company hired 
more than 3000 other replacements

defense lawyers in the lincoln savings 
securities fraud trial will challenge a revised indictment that 
increases the number of criminal counts from 42 to 46 against 
charles keating jr and three others 
a grand jury handed up the original indictment and only a grand 
jury not prosecutors should be allowed to make major changes in 
it said abbe lowell an attorney for keating codefendant judy j 
wischer 
you cant add more counts without a grand jury voting on it 
said lowell 
prosecutors filed the revised charges monday against keating in 
an attempt to salvage 22 of the original 42 counts they had been 
set aside by a judge who said they were too vague or failed to 
state an offense supported by evidence in nearly 4600 pages of 
grand jury testimony 
among other things the amended indictment provides more 
specific examples of alleged wrongdoing by keating and three top 
executives of his companies in the sale of 200 million in 
nowworthless junk bonds at lincoln branches 
deputy district attorney william hodgman said the revised 
charges correct flaws cited by superior court judge lance ito on 
nov 9 when ito ordered the 22 counts dismissed 
defense attorneys are expected to challenge the new charges on 
many grounds the earliest ito could rule on the matter is dec 3 
the next hearing date in the case 
the charges ito set aside involve 20 counts of selling 
securities without government approval one count of lying to 
regulators and one count of advertising securities for sale without 
filing copies of the ads three days in advance with the department 
of corporations 
however the heart of the case is contained in 20 counts ito let 
stand those charges contend elderly investors were misled about 
the safety of highyield highrisk bonds they purchased at lincoln 
branches 
the junk bonds were issued by american continental corp of 
phoenix a development company owned by the keating family 
american continental in turn owned irvinebased lincoln 
about 250 million in bonds most of them sold at lincoln 
branches became worthless on april 13 1989 when american 
continental sought bankruptcy protection 
lincoln was seized the next day experts say its failure will 
cost taxpayers 2 billion the biggest sampl bailout yet in civil 
suits including a 1 billion racketeering action keating is 
accused of looting the thrift

a lawsuit filed by a group of popeyes famous 
fried chicken franchise owners in 20 states claims chain owner al 
copeland violated state and federal antitrust laws by forcing 
franchisees to purchase products from his companies 
the suit filed monday also alleges copeland has transferred food 
items and confidential company information to churchs fried 
chicken a larger competitor which copeland bought last year 
quite simply given the financial drain that churchs 
represents it has caused popeyes to forget the people who made it 
what it is today said brent barriere attorney for independent 
popeyes franchise group 
ipfg is made up of more than 50 people who own more than 200 
popeyes franchises in 20 states 
al copeland enterprises inc and a subsidiary called diversified 
foods amp seasonings inc which sells spices beans gravy biscuit 
base and other products to popeyes franchises are also named as 
defendants in the 33page suit 
we do not have a statement there is no response at this 
time said copelands spokeswoman kit wohl of the publicity firm 
watts wohl amp associates inc 
she said there are nearly 800 popeyes in 39 states and nearly 
1200 churchs restaurants in 24 states around the country as of 
june she said al copeland enterprises owned 130 popeyes and had 
646 popeyes franchises it owned 752 churchs outlets and had 
franchises with 444 
the lawyer for the franchise group said popeyes in part at 
least because of its swallowing of churchs has failed to respond 
to the interest of franchisees has been distracted with promotions 
and has not given the type of support and advertising 
that franchisors are required to give under the franchise 
agreement 
the lawsuit said that ipfgs members never expected popeyes to 
change the fundamental nature of its system 
in addition to the distraction caused by churchs we think 
popeyes is engaged in direct competition with popeyes 
franchisees barriere said he said that churchs outlets within 
popeyes franchise areas guts the exclusivity which franchisees have 
bargained and paid for 
the suit asks for 15 specific orders including ones to

boeing co a contractor on the space station 
has scrapped plans to expand its work force next year on the 
project 
boeing is working with nasa on potential cutbacks in the project 
required by congressional budget trimming 
we expect growth on the space station program to remain 
relatively flat for the next few years boeing spokeswoman peri 
widener said monday from huntsville ala where boeings space 
station program is based 
widener said the company has dropped plans to increase its 
1000member work force on the project by 10 percent to 15 percent 
in 1991 
the space station is designed to be constructed on earth and 
carried into space aboard roughly 20 shuttle flights 
mcdonnell douglas corp is the main contractor on the space 
station 
boeing has a 10year 16 billion contract to build several key 
elements of the space platform including a 44foot habitation 
module for the eightmember permanent crew and a second module to 
be used for experiments with commercial materials such as 
electronics and medicinal drugs boeing will also build the 
nodes that will connect the modules 
the entire platform is to be reassembled in space by shuttle 
astronauts 
boeing had been counting on the space station to boost its 
faltering military defense program the companys defense and space 
group lost 474 million last year and anticipates additional heavy 
losses for this year 
but last month congress ordered the national aeronautics and 
space administration to trim 6 billion out of the 37 billion 
space station budget over the next six years nasa was also ordered 
to cut spending for the current fiscal year to 19 billion from a 
budget proposal of 245 billion 
nasa which planned to spend up to 4 billion annually on the 
project in coming years was also given an annual spending cap of 
26 billion 
nasa spokesman mark hess said the agency began a 90day review 
last week to come up with ways to slim down the original version of 
the ambitious project all contractors have been asked for their 
suggestions he said 
widener said boeing has submitted a preliminary proposal to nasa 
that suggests possible alterations that could help the program meet 
its budget constraints widener declined to elaborate on the 
proposal

bellcore researchers say an electronic 
notary public they developed can tighten electronic security 
systems by proving when a document was created and whether it has 
been altered 
customers could submit any type of document electronically for 
timestamping under the bellcore timestamping service or the tss 
computer experts said monday that no electronic security system 
is impenetrable but they say if the tss works as touted it will 
be the most secure system of its kind 
with other computer security systems you cant maintain the 
level of security that they claim you can maintain here said 
paul zorfass director of computer research at the yankee group in 
boston it sounds like something that would have great appeal to 
individuals who have a careful requirement for control 
as technology has advanced and more records have been 
computerized such security systems have become highpriority items 
for businesses and researchers 
if you have an important researcher you have a situation 
where a notary public stamps his notebook say every two weeks 
said scott stornetta a research scientist at bellcore who 
developed the system along with stuart haber what this is is an 
electronic notary public 
the system will be installed at bellcores headquarters in 
morris township within the next six months for testing he said 
the company has applied for a patent and will probably license the 
product soon after the patent is granted stornetta said 
bellcore provides research and other technical support to the 
companies of ameritech bell atlantic bellsouth nynex pacific 
telesis southwestern bell corp and us west 
costs have not been determined but stornetta said the 
electronic security program would be within a range acceptable to 
virtually anyone who needs such a device 
in the case of an invention a company could submit a 
description of the product while still keeping the idea secret from 
the tss stornetta said 
that would be done by sending only a small representation of the 
original document to the timestamping service a mathematical 
process called hashing would be used to create a digital 
fingerprint that represents the entire data changing even one 
character in the original text would change the digital 
fingerprint showing that the document had been altered 
bill garvin a product manager at computer associates in garden 
city ny said bellcore appears to be improving an already 
existing security system 
computer associates a leader in the electronic security field 
already has a system called caexamine that can detect whether a 
computer file or program has been altered what it cannot do is 
verify when a particular file originated 
i can see it having use garvin said but it doesnt sound 
like something that would be a headtohead competitor 
bill strapko a senior consultant at international data corp in 
framingham mass said the bellcore system will be watched closely 
by the industry 
for example in the area of software people are saying i 
did this before they did and there are all kinds of problems like 
that strapko said the timestamp sounds like it could prove 
that they did develop something first 
he cautioned however that no electronic security system has 
been developed that is foolproof 
if somebody is sharp enough they can probably go into this 
system and beat it too strapko said no matter what security 
system you have there is a backdoor into it unfortunately

higher oil production in texas is no longer needed 
because world supplies currently exceed demand federal energy 
officials have told the texas railroad commission 
the commission voted unanimously monday not to renew an 
emergency order allowing oil wells across most of texas to pump at 
maximum capacity 
the department of energy did not think it was still a 
necessity said commission chairman kent hance 
the commission had approved the 90day emergency order 
increasing oil production in august at the request of the us 
department of energy the agency said the additional oil was needed 
to make up for losses resulting from the us trade embargo against 
iraq 
although there was a fear that oil supplies would dwindle after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 several other nations led by 
saudi arabia stepped up production to fill the loss 
now railroad commissioner jim nugent said there is an 
oversupply of oil in the world 
we dont want to be endangering any of our texas reservoirs by 
overproduction nugent said if the nation is in danger and 
theres a critical shortage were certainly willing to work with 
producers and the federal government to up production but not when 
there isnt an urgent national need 
in a memo to the commission friday agency official ronald 
schultz jr said the energy department had decided additional 
production was no longer needed because oil supplies exceed world 
demand by 100000 barrels of oil per day and are expected to exceed 
demand by 1 million barrels per day in march if a war does not 
break out in the persian gulf 
commission spokesman brian schaible said officials had estimated 
texas could produce an additional 20000 barrels of oil a day under 
the emergency order but he would not know for another month the 
actual production in september 
after nov 29 the wells will go back to their normal production 
levels schaible said the rate in august was 17 million barrels a 
day

the german automaker volkswagen and a chinese 
factory signed a contract tuesday to establish one of chinas 
largest automotive joint ventures 
construction will start next year on an 800 million auto plant 
in the northeastern city of changchun with the capacity to build 
150000 golf sedans each year the official xinhua news agency 
reported 
volkswagen already operates a joint venture in shanghai that 
produces santana sedans that facility can produce 60000 cars 
annually but has been limited by the government to less than 
20000 because the cars are made basically from imported kits 
parts are being localized gradually 
volkswagens partner in the new venture is the no 1 motor 
vehicle plant of changchun which has been making audis under a 
licensing agreement xinhua did not say what proportion of imported 
and locally made parts would go into the new golfs 
it said volkswagen had agreed to transfer to the joint venture 
all the manufacturing technology needed to make golfs in addition 
the german corporation will buy engines and spare parts from the 
joint venture 
volkswagen will be responsible for selling 15 percent of the 
cars on the international market xinhua said a potentially 
difficult target china has always pressed its joint ventures to 
export but the technology of chinesemade cars is too outdated and 
prices are too high to compete on world markets 
volkswagens shanghaimade santanas are sold in china for about 
27000 
chinas no 2 automobile works recently formed a joint venture 
with the french carmaker citroen that also is expected to produce 
150000 cars annually by the year 2000 
frances peugot usbased chrysler and japans isuzu already 
operate jointventure car plants in china and domestically made 
cars have begun to outnumber imports on beijing streets

cbs inc today announced plans to cut payments 
to television network affiliates for carrying its programs by 20 
percent next year in a move that will save the media company about 
30 million 
the announcement comes a day after cbs announced that it expects 
to post a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings next year 
it cited the deteriorating national advertising climate and the 
costs of entertainment and sports programs for its financial 
forecast 
cbs executives met privately on monday with representatives of 
the 208 tv stations that are affiliated with the cbs television 
newtork to discuss the proposed compensation reductions 
cbs paid its affiliates 153 million this year in compensation 
the company said that was more than either major network 
competitor nbc or abc paid their affiliates cbs estimated nbc 
pays 132 million a year to its affiliates while abc pays an 
estimated 110 million 
as part of its latest budgetary reviews cbs said steps were 
taken to control costs in every area of the company including 
affilate compensation 
cbs said that in an effort to reduce the impact of the 
compensation cuts it was planning to give the local stations more 
commercial time in news and sports programming to sell to local 
advertisers in addition cbs said it would increase local 
commercial time on broadcasts of the 1992 winter olympics 
we have a mutual stake in each others financial health and 
viability said tony malara president of cbs affliate relations 
given our improved programming performance we need to insure 
that our financial picture will be sufficient to continue to 
support it 
spokesman george schweitzer said the 20 percent compensation cut 
scheduled to take effect jan 1 was an acrosstheboard for all 
affiliates 
some stations particularly smaller ones rely more heavily than 
others on the payments and are expected to resist it 
a call was placed to berry smith head of the cbs affiliate 
advisory board and an executive at schurz communications inc in 
south bend ind for reaction to the cbs plan but he was said to 
be traveling

did your mother throw away all your baseball 
cards would you like to get some of them back 
you may get the chance next year topps chewing gum inc is 
celebrating the 40th anniversary of its first card by giving away 
300000 vintage cards including the 1952 mickey mantle worth 
8000 with its regular 1991 packs that sell for 50 cents 
the promotion is a marketing coup for the leader in the sports 
card business at a time when the competition has never been so 
hot half a dozen companies are after a share of the 
multimilliondollar industry which no longer caters just to kids 
but adult investors reliving those days when they bought cards to 
flip on the playground or stick in the spokes of their bicycles 
its ferocious fierce said ed deke a parttime collector 
who runs a sports card show in fairfield conn a lot of people 
have gotten into it 
baseball cards still make up 80 percent to 90 percent of the 
business but some of the companies have expanded to or deal 
exclusively in football basketball and hockey cards as well as 
nonsport cards featuring heroes real and imaginary 
the industry is so lucrative that the nba has its own line of 
cards this season pro set inc dallas maker of football and 
hockey cards will add a line of golf cards in middecember upper 
deck co is adding hockey cards 
next years baseball cards from score of westport conn will 
feature 13 dream team players in various stages of dress from 
a barechested jose canseco to will clark in a doublebreasted 
suit 
and more companies are expanding into nonsport products like 
pro sets music superstar cards and upper decks comic ball cards 
looney tunes characters in baseball garb 
topps makes cards with batman the simpsons and teenage mutant 
ninja turtles 
among other competitors in the card business are fleer corp of 
philadelphia donruss a division of the bannockburn ill 
candymaker leaf inc and the canadian firm opeechee 
opinions are split on whether all these companies can survive 
with the glut of products on the shelf while analysts think the 
industry will thrive in the 1990s the same may not be true for 
individual companies 
the metoos the ones that dont really have a strong 
franchise and a very big base of customers are going to find it 
extremely difficult to exist said stanley lanzet an analyst 
with arnhold and s bleichroeder inc in new york 
topps egan in 1951 with a deck of baseball cards that could be 
used to play a game it made its first individual cards in 1952 
such as the mantle card the roy campanella card worth 1300 and 
the eddie matthews card worth 1750 
fleer and donruss entered the scene in 1981 upper deck joined 
in 1989 but topps is still the big kid on the block with 246 
million in revenue in its latest fiscal year up from 198 million 
the year before 
the other companies are private except fleer which went public 
in june and reported 119 million in sales in the first nine months 
of 1990 
topps customers could make some bucks of their own with next 
years promotion which will give away one of every topps card ever 
made with the 1991 packs 
most of the cards will go directly into the 1991 packs although 
the company will insert redemption certificates for the more 
valuable cards like the 1952 mantle the 1953 willy mays worth 
1600 the 1954 ted williams worth 2800 and the 1955 roberto 
clemente worth 1050 
even a common player card from 1967 is worth up to 16 
topps will also give away one complete set from 1952 
spokesman ken liss said the company approached collectors for 
some of the giveaway cards but found quite a few collecting dust 
around its brooklyn ny headquarters 
i think its a great promotion said richard o rieger an 
analyst with ladenburg thalmann amp co inc its like they found 
old cards in a warehouse and held an auction 
in addition to special promotions topps is using television 
advertising to hype its cards as is upper deck 
upper deck also is leasing space on the boards at three nhl 
arenas and using players like wayne gretzky to hawk its upscale 
cards which cost twice as much as topps and are printed with an 
anticounterfeiting hologram 
we have our niche in the marketplace said jay mccracken 
upper deck vice president of sales weve seen a lot of the 
competition come at us this year with new ideas and that means 
well just have to work that much harder 
that may be the companies key to success sports cards are 
cheap enough to make the industry more or less recessionproof a 
pack of 15 topps cards costs 50 cents and the number of hobbyists 
is growing but analysts still question whether theres room for 
all the products 
we do hear stories the product isnt selling through as fast 
as a year ago not necessarily our stuff but the product in 
general and theres a tremendous proliferation of card shows 
these days i think yesterday we had four within 20 miles in this 
area mccracken said from upper deck headquarters in yorba 
linda calif 
when you spread yourself so thin obviously not everyone is 
going to do well there are so many products and so many dealers 
but we are still seeing a lot of people come into the hobby he 
said

tis the season for mailorder giving and more of the gifts 
crisscrossing the nation make for a transportable feast 
fruit in the mail is nothing new but how about six pints of 
assorted gelato packed in dry ice its yours if someone doesnt 
mind paying 10 a pint to get it to you 
and forget the mundane fruitcake select instead a bouquet of 
porcini mushrooms a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly 
pears 
the 3600 companies that tempt the palate with mailorder 
edibles are competing for 12 billion that americans are expected 
to spend on food orders this year according to a recent study by 
the new york market research firm findsvp 
growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent mailorder foods 
are likely to account for more than 3 billion in sales by the year 
2000 findsvp said 
business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter with some 
mailorder companies doing virtually all of their shipping between 
september and january entire 747 jets have been stuffed with 
nothing but thousands of pounds of holiday pears from harry and 
david 
based in medford ore harry and david has sales in excess of 
120 million making it perhaps the largest mailorder food company 
in the nation according to findsvp the top 10 foodbymail 
companies control 45 percent of the market about 3000 companies 
are characterized as momandpop operations each with sales of 
less than 50000 a year 
though the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation 
most of the industrys growth is in overnight and twoday delivery 
services which can guarantee a delicate or perishable item arrives 
intact 
clambake celebrations of cape cod mass for example can 
promise a customer in albuquerque nm that she will have 
lobster mussels a few ears of corn all packed in authentic 
seaweed steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after phoning in 
the order the cost 11995 for two 
san franciscos gelato classico italian ice cream is just 
begining to offer its products by mail six pints which comprise 
a minimum order at 5995 are packaged in dry ice in a foam 
container much like a picnic cooler 
consultant jay walker who heads ridgefield connbased catalog 
media corp said that though foodbymail has been big business 
for a long time overnight delivery allowed a freshness 
perception for millions of people who didnt believe they could get 
food fresh in the mail and it made sure food can be given as a 
gift reliably 
if you ask federal express spokesman brandon davis will tell 
you his company has been a major boost to the food industry our 
business allows them to extend their business season right up 
to dec 21 he said if you do 80 percent of your business in 
one or two months of the year and can extend that selling season by 
just two weeks its a tremendous boost 
companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business 
because they cater to a national rather than local clientele 
franklin foods of north franklin conn for example sells only 
exotic mushrooms like polish cepes shiitakes and porcinis 
smithfield vabased fin n feather will put a smoked pheasant 
buffet on your table 
mr spear inc of stockton calif has cultivated a list of 
25000 fans of its colossal asparagus its sole product its an 
alternative to flowers said president chip arnett his 
superpremium asparagus which has been served at the white house 
simply is not in sufficient enough quantities to make it 
available from a retail standpoint he said 
consultant walker believes the foodbymail business is 
countercyclical to the economy that is as the recession 
deepens business is likely to increase 
consumers who feel pinched for cash typically trade down 
when it comes to buying gifts and food is a popular alternative 
because it has no comparative market price walker said you 
dont know if a dozen apples from an orchard in oregon is a 20 
gift or a 40 gift he said 
perusing catalogs in the coziness of ones own home and ordering 
with the mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational 
pasttime of sorts for many americans 
people are sitting home and theyre bored and so they pick up 
the phone and buy on a credit card said debbie cohen a national 
saleswoman for melissas world variety produce inc a los angeles 
company that specializes in shipping in exotic produce like purple 
potatoes elephant garlic and prickly pears 
though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less 
than 2 percent of the population they are an affluent lot willing 
to pay more for convenience and a guarantee of quality 
a pint of gelato classico costs just 395 in one of the 
companys 32 shops but the minimum 6pint mail order commands a 
36 shipping charge too extravagant to buy for yourself perhaps 
but an exquisite gift to give 
the mailorder business does have its limitations identifying 
customers can be costly and it is difficult to adapt quickly to 
changes in consumer taste a company that must put together its 
christmas catalog by august cant suddenly decide to replace its 
pecan pie if cranberries become the rage 
in addition the threat of higher postal rates always looms 
large thirdclass postage the rate for most catalogs has 
increased more than 350 percent since 1970 and the us postal 
service is planning another rate hike for february 
mailorder companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on 
a higher proportion of their sales forcing them to compete harder 
against local retailers 
finally since the food business is seasonal some companies 
actually are forced to shut down during spring and summer others 
try to round out their offerings with other products harry and 
david for example has a sister company called jackson and 
perkins a gardening and flower concern which helps smooth out 
sales throughout the year 
to further entice customers many companies have a 
thingofthemonth plan for 21995 harry and david will send 
a box of fruit once a month for 720 gelato will send six pints 
of its superpremium ice cream 12 times a year and you get to 
choose among flavors like fresh ginger double espresso and coppa 
mista with swirls of chocolate vanilla pistachio and almond ice 
creams 
among other special services companies provide baskets of 
elegance a california fashioner of gourmet food baskets sends 
customers a color photograph of their orders before theyre 
shipped

earnings fell 94 percent in the third quarter partly because of 
costs associated with its acquisition of marshall field amp co 
the retailer said its earnings in the quarter ended nov 3 
declined to 58 million or 70 cents per share compared with 64 
million or 83 cents per share a year earlier 
revenue rose 16 percent to 362 billion from 324 billion

from its employee stock ownerhip plan and the 104 billion 
acquisition of marshall field from bat industries plc 
dayton hudson said its operating profit which does not take 
into account onetime transactions like the esop or acquisitions 
was up 12 percent 
the company fared somewhat better than other retailers whose 
profits were down because of sluggish consumer spending however 
profits at its department store division rose only because of an 
accounting change connected with the marshall field transaction 
department stores have been among those hit the hardest as 
consumers cut back their spending in response to the faltering 
economy and the middle east crisis 
besides marshall field and daytons and hudsons department 
stores the company owns mervyns stores and target discount 
stores 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year dayton hudson said 
it earned 181 million or 228 per share up from 160 million 
or 206 per share in the same period a year earlier

expected to total about 1 billion the firm plans to open 46 
target stores 15 to 20 mervyns stores and two department stores

worlds largest cable tv franchise which also included hong 
kongbased wharf holdings and other partners it would have cost 
about 700 million to build the system u s west said 
last summer a group led by billionaire hong kong entrepreneur 
li kashing won the right to construct a satellite broadcast system 
that would link hong kongs apartment buildings and bypass any 
cable system

grain and soybean futures prices retreated 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as speculators expressed 
their disappointment in the lack of any export agreement between 
this country and the soviet union 
prices recovered somewhat before the close but at their lows 
soybeans were down 13 cents a bushel from mondays settlement and 
wheat was off 8 cents 
traders had bid prices up the previous two session on the belief 
that the soviets were working out a big grain deal with the united 
states 
it was very very much expected that an announcement would 
come out of the meeting monday between president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev said john frazier agricultural director 
in chicago for gerald inc 
at the close wheat was 6 cents to 8 cents lower with the 
contract for december at 245 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 6 
cents lower with december at 4221 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 
3 cents lower with december at 108 a bushel and soybeans were 
6 cents to 13 cents lower with november at 557 a bushel

shares in the worlds biggest advertising and 
marketing conglomerate wpp group plc tumbled again on tuesday 
stretching their losses over two days to more than 70 percent in 
the wake of a glum earnings forecast 
the owner of the j walter thompson and ogilvy amp mather ad 
agencies announced on monday that its 1990 profit wouldnt match 
analysts expectations 
the announcement raised concerns about the companys ability to 
meet its debt payments next year analysts said tuesday 
wpps shares closed tuesday at 115 pence or 227 a share on 
londons stock exchange down 164 pence or 59 percent from 
mondays close 
the shares dropped 113 pence or 223 a share on monday they 
traded as high as 715 pence or 1409 a share in the past year 
londonbased wpp had no comment on the slide in its stock price 
said a company spokeswoman who declined to be identified 
the speed of the fall indicated that people are worried that 
its going to go bust said david grimbley an advertising agency 
analyst with the london investment firm hoare govett ltd 
analysts said the market was shaken partly because wpp chief 
executive martin sorrell who has a reputation for being an adept 
financial officer had appeared to have created a company 
invulnerable to the recession that has gripped the advertising 
industries in the united states and britain 
sorrell was the top financial officer in the british advertising 
company saatchi amp saatchi plc which grew to become the worlds 
largest ad and marketing services company in the mid1980s through 
acquisitions 
he was credited for perfecting the buyout technique that enabled 
the buyers to keep existing management on the job by making a 
partial payment initially and tying addititional payments to 
earnings performance over several years 
sorrell left the saatchis and shook up madison avenue with the 
first hostile takeover of an ad agency with his acquisition of j 
walter thompsons parent company in 1987 he acquired ogilvy amp 
mather two years later 
the saatchis meanwhile stumbled because of their iversification 
into the consulting business and have forced to put them up for 
sale 
with 161 billion in worldwide billings in 1989 wpp surpassed 
saatchi and saatchi plc as the biggest advertising company 
according to the trade publication advertising age saatchis 
billings of 157 billion ranked it second the publication said 
wpp announced monday that its pretax profit for the year 
wouldnt match the analysts forecast of 110 million pounds or 
217 million because of a general economic downturn although 
results for the normally strong final two months of the year 
werent in yet 
the extent of the downturn in its businesses has only become 
apparent this month it said 
the company posted a 77 percent increase in pretax profit in 
the first six months of this year and said at that time that its 
spread of business interests should insulate it from the worldwide 
economic downturn 
wpp said in its statement that it continues to attract new 
business and expects to operate successfully at significant 
levels of profitability 
mark shepperd an analyst with ubs phillips and drew said 
sorrell has been saying that we wont be affected by the 
downturn that now has proved not to be the case 
the london market in recent months has been nervous about stocks 
of heavily indebted companies which has made trading unusually 
volatile 
analysts say wpps debt amounts to some 320 million pounds or 
630 million 
grimbley said there are extreme worries that the company next 
year might break its banking covenant 
wpps agreement with lenders stipulates that the companys 
operating profit should be 2 times the level of interest it must 
pay the banks grimbley said 
profit forecasts imply that that wont be the case grimbley 
said 
the company is unlikely to generate enough cash to pay off about 
34 million pounds of longterm debt as scheduled next year partly 
because it is required to pay dividends to its preferred

a superior court jury finding fraud and bad 
faith ordered an ohio life insurance company to pay 1438 million 
to 1800 servicemen and veterans 
the classaction suit was brought against nationwide life 
insurance co of columbus ohio and its san diegobased agent the 
nonprofit armed forces benefit amp aid association policyholders 
from nearly every state sued when the life insurance provider 
arbitrarily reduced benefits and eliminated coverage at age 60 
in returning the verdict monday the jury ordered nationwide and 
its san diego branch to pay 1178 million in general damages and 
26 million in punitive damages 
lou fabro a nationwide spokesman said tuesday that company 
officers had no immediate comment on the verdict 
we will be having a meeting next week to consider the verdict 
and our options he said its very probable that we will file 
an appeal 
jurors found the company violated its contract with servicemen 
and veterans when it abruptly decided in 1975 to eliminate coverage 
when policyholders reached their 60th birthday 
only upon turning 60 however did the policyholders learn of 
the change said david patterson a pittsburghbased attorney who 
representedseveral of the plaintiffs 
many had been paying 990 a month in premiums for years 
expecting lifelong coverage he said instead they were left late 
in life with no benefits and had to face the difficult task of 
trying to obtain new policies at affordable rates patterson said 
nationwide also in 1975 decided to reduce the benefits it paid 
on the policy from 10000 to as low as 2000 again there was no 
notification of the change to policyholders patterson said 
in addition the suit alleged that nationwides san diego branch 
falsely promoted itself as an armed services affiliated vendor 
persuading many who purchased a policy beginning in the 1960s that 
the contract was backed by the government when it was not 
patterson said 
the suit was filed in 1988 in san diego where a sizable number 
of the policies were sold 
the jury deliberated just over two days before finding the 
insurance company had violated laws against fraudulent 
misrepresentation fraudulent concealment of facts badfaith 
insurance practices and conspiracy

an engineer serving on an environmental 
protection agency panel on smoking said tuesday he is near 
agreement with the philip morris tobacco company on a 1 million 
research grant 
james e woods jr of the virginia polytechnic institute and 
state university in blacksburg va is a member of an epa panel 
reviewing an agency report that concludes that secondhand 
cigarette smoke causes lung cancer 
the panel will meet in washington dc in december to consider 
the merits of the report 
woods a mechanical engineer said negotiations on the grant 
began six or eight months ago and that he submitted a proposal for 
the money about one month ago he earlier had said philip morris 
had offered him the 1 million a month ago 
steven parrish a philip morris spokesman said no offer had 
been made told of parrishs comment woods then said he was wrong 
about the offer 
the grant provides for construction of an officelike test 
chamber to investigate ventilation effectiveness woods said 
woods said he expects to reach final agreement with philip 
morris on the grant in about two months 
robert flaak an administrator with epas scientific advisory 
board said the grant would not conflict with woods advisory role 
at the epa 
as long as its in public knowledge it does not constitute a 
conflict of interest flaak said the existence of the grant has 
not been officially disclosed flaak said it will be disclosed at 
the epa panels december meeting 
theres always a chance for perceived conflict of interest 
flaak said but is this a conflict with regard to the panel no 
i dont think so is dr woods going to represent himself fairly on 
the panel sure he will 
an antismoking group was sharply critical of the arrangement 
it means that while hes sitting on the scientific advisory 
board reviewing what the epa has come up with hes got this carrot 
dangling in front of him which could affect his judgment said 
julia carol associate director of americans for nonsmokers 
rights based in berkeley calif 
woods said he was trying to set up the grant in such a way that 
it would not affect his objectivity on the smoking issue for 15 
years ive been on record saying that the best way to control 
smoking in public buildings is to eliminate the smoker he said 
but there are situations where that cant happen 
he said the project would be conducted in the open a university 
committee would review the findings for scientific objectivity and 
the results would be publicly available 
we feel at the university we can do open research on this even 
though its been funded by philip morris woods said 
flaak said woods had expressed some concern about the grant 
when i spoke with him at first about this he was uncomfortable 
about the situation flaak said hes unhappy that hes going 
to be getting research funds and having this looked at as a 
conflict which it isnt i said i didnt think it was a problem 
woods said his university is now considering whether to accept 
the grant were working with the university right now to see 
whether thats consistent with university policy he said 
robert axelrad head of the epas indoor air division which 
prepared the passivesmoking report on lung cancer gave woods a 
ringing endorsement 
im not concerned about jim woodss objectivity hes one of 
the leaders in indoor air pollution and we know him to be an honest 
and credible researcher axelrad said 
woods said the comments he intends to make on the epa report 
will demonstrate that he is not biased toward tobacco companies 
wait and see what i say at the hearing he said referring to 
the panels december meeting 
the epa passivesmoking panel has come under attack by 
antismoking groups who have charged that it is biased toward the 
tobacco industry six of its 16 members have ties to the center for 
indoor air research which is largely financed and run by the 
tobacco industry 
epa officials said their lawyers have assured them that panel 
members ties with the tobaccoindustry research center do not 
constitute a conflict of interest 
the executive director of the center max eisenberg agreed 
their association with the center isnt relevant he said 
whats important is theyre the best people we can find 
eisenberg said researchers from the epa and the centers for 
disease control are also affiliated with the center

a federal judge tuesday appointed the aflcios 
top lawyer to review a plan to overhaul the manville trust designed 
to speed compensation to workers poisoned by asbestos 
us district judge jack b weinstein also called for 
establishing a panel of labor management and others to recommend 
ways to devise a single national fund to distribute all asbestos 
settlements 
in a letter to aflcio president lane kirkland weinstein said 
there was a need to stop the hemorrhaging of available assets and 
to substitute a structured compensation system designed to benefit 
claimants and companies alike 
weinstein appointed washington lawyer laurence gold general 
counsel of the american federation of laborcongress of industrial 
organizations to review the plan 
gold 53 has been with the aflcio since 1975 weinstein asked 
kirkland to recommend an independent adviser who was uninfluenced 
by the hope of high legal fees for participation 
in his letter dated monday weinstein said organized labor 
should help solve the asbestos crisis because delays in providing 
compensation undercut the ability of thousands of american 
workers to secure needed financial assistance 
the judge also called on labor to help find a way to consolidate 
the billions of dollars available from dozens of financially ailing 
companies in bankruptcy court and other courts to compensate 
asbestos victims 
weinstein has led an effort to reform asbestos litigation which 
clogs federal and state court dockets according to some estimates 
up to 70 percent of money intended for victims has gone to lawyers 
and others cases can take years to resolve 
tens of thousands of workers suffer from lung cancer and other 
respiratory diseases caused by breathing asbestos fibers on the 
job more than 90000 lawsuits are pending nationwide and several 
companies have been forced into bankruptcy court by their asbestos 
liability 
the manville trust faces about 130000 claims weinstein ordered 
its restructuring earlier this year after the trust ran out of cash 
and offered ious to many victims that would not have been paid for 
decades 
the reorganization plan calls for manville corp to inject up to 
520 million into the trust and allows the trust to sell 18 
billion in manville bonds to raise new cash 
claimants would receive sharply reduced payments but faster 
victims with cancer and other serious disease would get some money 
in the plans first two years those with other diseases would 
begin getting paid in the third year payments would be 45 percent 
of settlement values 
the plan is expected to face legal challenges and hearings are 
planned in new york new orleans chicago and san francisco 
weinstein favors creating a single fund to make payments based 
on a proportion of available assets eliminating long and costly 
litigation 
kirkland agreed to help saying recent events demonstrate that 
the current system for compensating the working people who have 
been injured by exposure to asbestos is seriously flawed 
asbestos and products containing the mineral were used widely in 
many industries for decades with heavy use at shipyards around the 
country during world war ii and the korean war 
asbestos which has natural heat resistance and insulation 
properties later was found to cause lung cancer and other serious 
dieases thousands of victims have died before receiving 
compensation

cbs inc announced a 20 percent slash in 
payments to television network affiliates next year for carrying 
its programs the media giants latest move to cushion the 
financial shock of heavy spending on sports programming and an 
industrywide advertising slump 
cbs spent 153 million on payments to its 208 station affiliates 
this year so the cut on jan 1 should save the media company about 
30 million in 1991 
but cbs also risks alienating or driving away affiliates some 
rely heavily on the network compensation payment as a source of 
revenue 
we know this is not a popular decision said cbs spokesman 
george schweitzer but we are doing this to maintain the 
financial support of the network business so they can benefit 
he said cbs has been spending more than either nbc or abc on 
payments to affiliates nbc spent 132 million this year and abc 
spent 110 million 
the cbs announcement comes a day after the company said it 
expects to post a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings 
next year 
it cited the deteriorating national advertising climate and the 
costs of entertainment and sports programs for its financial 
forecast 
in trading on the new york stock exchange cbs lost 375 to 
156 a share after dropping 4 a share on monday 
cbs executives met privately monday with representatives of its 
network affiliates 
phil jones a former head of the cbs affiliate advisory board 
and an executive at meredith corps broadcasting group in des 
moines iowa said people were really disappointed by the cbs 
decision 
its is a tough environment and some of them already feel 
somewhat battered but their argument about their losses are pretty 
compelling he said 
cbs told the affiliate representatives that they were making 
efforts to control costs in every phase of the companys operation 
in drafting the 1991 budget the company said it was compelled to 
address affiliate payments also 
in some ways the affiliate payment system is outdated it was 
started as a way to ensure that the networks have a wide 
circulation for their programs so they could charge advertisers for 
delivering a national audience 
but the development of cable television has taken a different 
approach cable networks charge system operators for the right to 
carry their services 
nonetheless broadcast tv affiliates have in recent years 
mounted strong resistance to efforts to reduce comnpensation 
cbs feels it is in a better position this year to make the cuts 
however 
schweitzer noted that cbs is the ratings leader in daytime and 
saturday morning television and has shown improvement in prime 
time 
cbs has spent a lot to get better programs he said the network 
has also spent heavily on obtaining sports rights over the past 
year including major league baseball professional football and 
the winter olympics 
nbc has not yet announced plans on affilate compensation for 
next year a spokesman said the abc network plans no across the 
board cuts but is reviwing compensation on a stationbystaion 
basis as it has since 1988 a spokeswoman said 
cbs is planning to help cushion the blow of the compensation cut 
for its affiliates schweitzer said 
cbs will give the local stations more commercial time in news 
and sports programming to sell to local advertisers in addition 
cbs said it would increase local commercial time on broadcasts of 
the 1992 winter olympics 
chweitzer said the extra ad time which would be taken from the 
time the network uses for station identifications and other 
nonrevenue producing activities could mean up to 12 million in 
extra revenue for affiliates 
we have mutual stake in each others financial health and 
viability said tony malara president of cbs affliate relations 
given our improved programming performance we need to insure 
that our financial picture will be sufficient to continue to 
support it

deal was in the works 
there are some pretty dire stories coming out of russia about 
the lack of vegetable oil flour potatoes the lack of bread even 
the lack of salt said john frazier agricultural director in 
chicago for gerald inc 
it was very very much expected that an announcement would 
come out of the meeting monday between president bush and soviet

disappointment was too great for the traders who had bought on the 
rumors

livestock and meat futures were down across the board at the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
the governments sevenstate cattleonfeed report released 
after the close on monday showed an increase in the number of 
cattle placed in feedlots during october 
this pressured prices for the more distant cattle futures 
contracts when the october placements would be coming to market 
said paul hare an analyst in chicago with linnco futures inc 
pork prices broke sharply with bellies losing the daily trading 
limit of 2 cents a pound 
live hog futures were confronted with a weaker cash trade went 
into a decline and triggered sell stops on the way down hare said

wednesday as packers faced with thinner profits resist paying 
more for the animals

any trade deal with the soviets

contract at 7912 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent lower 
to 05 cent higher with january at 8760 cents a pound live hogs

pound and frozen pork bellies fell the 2 cent limit with february 
at 7020 cents a pound 
precious metals futures declined on the commodity exchange in 
new york owing their weakness only partially to lower oil prices 
people expect the metals to follow oil tick for tick but they 
havent and theyre not going to said william oneill an 
analyst in new york with merrill lynch futures 
he also attributed the decline to selling in europe 
optionsrelated selling at the comex and the nations general 
economic malaise

oil prices fell sharply tuesday as events 
surrounding the middle east convinced traders that a military 
confrontation with iraq was unlikely anytime soon 
the january contract for light sweet crude the benchmark blend 
of us oil fell 181 to 2891 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange erasing a 172 gain from the previous 
session 
prices continued to bounce up and down in response to 
developments in the middle east on monday prices shot up after 
iraqi president saddam hussein announced a military buildup 
but tuesday president bushs failure to secure an agreement 
with gorbachev on the un resolution to authorize military action 
was viewed as bearish by the market said andrew lebow an 
analyst with edampf man international futures inc 
the soviets on monday and tuesday rebuffed bushs efforts to win 
support for the resolution authorizing military force against iraq 
and oil traders believed this made a confrontation and a cutoff 
of oil supplies from the persian gulf less likely 
bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev met on monday and 
secretary of state james a baker and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze met tuesday 
peter beutel an analyst with pegasus econometric group inc 
said the oil market also took a second look at iraqi plans to move 
another 250000 troops into kuwait and decided mondays 
announcement by the baghdad government did not really exacerbate

in its latest courtroom fight over copyright 
protection lotus development corp went to trial tuesday against a 
small software firm accused of imitating lotus popular 123 
business spreadsheet program 
the case marked an extension of a trial lotus won earlier this 
year lotus based in cambridge filed suit in 1987 against two 
firms paperback software international of berkeley calif and 
mosaic software of cambridge 
it argued that the keyboard commands and onscreen images the 
socalled user interface were an expression of an idea and 
thus were protected by copyright laws the company claimed the 
defendants virtually duplicated the user interface of 123 
lotus won its case over paperback software in june but mosaic 
had to drop out of that trial because an attorney for the company 
became ill 
michael collora an attorney representing mosaic said on 
tuesday his client was bound by the decision against paperback 
software in the proceedings that began tuesday against mosaic 
but mosaic officials insisted they received permission from 
lotus to develop a program that would be similar to 123 
according to mosaics defense mosaic president richard bezjian 
displayed a software program at a 1983 computer show after the 
unveiling of 123 
mosaic officials said lotus founder mitchell kapor saw the 
program and threatened to sue but then an unidentified lotus 
employee later assured mosaic that lotus would not sue 
lotus argued that mosaic has never been able to produce this 
person 
mosaic continued work on the program and unveiled a different 
version two years later calling it twin classic and praising 
the similarities with 123 
mosaic also argued that lotus had the opportunity to sue earlier 
but waited until other competitors came out with 123 clones 
since its victory over paperback software lotus has filed 
copyright infringement suits against two other competitors santa 
cruz operation inc and borland international inc
