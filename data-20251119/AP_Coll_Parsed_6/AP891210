the director of the kansas bureau of 
investigation resigned after a racist joke he told two reporters 
sparked heavy criticism 
dave johnson announced his resignation saturday the same day 
the kansas city times printed a column about the joke 
johnson told the joke while talking to the reporters about a 
triple murder for which two teenagers a black man and a white 
woman have been arrested within hours of the columns 
publication 22 legislators had signed letters to attorney general 
robert stephan condemning johnsons conduct the chairwoman of the 
state republican party state rep rochelle chronister said she 
was preparing a letter to stephan calling for johnsons resignation 
when he resigned 
im pleased that the man saw fit to resign said rep 
sherman jones one of the states four black legislators who 
drafted one letter

nigger

professor of journalism at the university of kansas who worked for 
the times this fall his tenure with the paper ended friday 
in his letter of resignation to stephan johnson acknowledged 
making the joke but said frederickson took it out of context 
i am sure you are aware that my performance has not indicated 
that i am a racist johnson wrote it is not my intent to cause 
any criticism of the kansas bureau of investigation office of the 
attorney general or law enforcement in general

retired neighbors in topeka the other reporter was associated

who supervises him need to know about the views johnson expresses 
with his racist jokes frederickson wrote 
ferguson said he was discussing the topeka slayings with 
frederickson at the door of the times statehouse office when 
johnson came by and joined them after the discussion turned to the 
question of how a black man from the inner city and a white woman 
from suburban topeka could have hooked up to commit the slayings

one woman in her home while commiting a burglarly that netted 70

congress wastes millions of dollars by loading 
down the defense department budget with special tidbits for 
constituents and by imposing excessive restraints on spending 
programs a pentagon draft report says 
the principles underlying congress control over acquisitions 
and budgets are not in dispute however the principles have been 
implemented in a way that has produced unintended consequences 
the pentagon which is often at odds with congress said in a 
43page white paper 
a copy of the oct 27 draft report which was prepared by the 
office of the secretary of defense was to be released sunday by 
the project on military procurement a copy was obtained early by 
the associated press 
in its study the pentagon speaks in bitter sometimes sarcastic 
terms about the pervasive nature of congressional intervention 
specifically the pentagon said congress approves money for 
thousands of budget items to specific recipients 
these items known as earmarks often mean goodies for a 
constituent and result in cuts somewhere in dods budget request 
these earmarks frequently have little direct relation to 
genuine defense needs the report said in other cases 
earmarks represent mandates to spend funds on what are clearly 
lowpriority items 
in fiscal 1990 congress approved a 305 billion defense budget 
the pentagon study also cited the increase in the number of 
reports required by congress 36 in 1970 at the height of the 
vietnam war 719 in 1988 and the requirements imposed on 
employment levels and technology 
limits on specific programs proved costly according to the 
report in a review of 42 program requirements in the 1989 budget 
cycle the requirements increased costs in 75 percent of the cases 
at a cost of more than 800 million over the life of the programs 
the pentagon cited no examples of program requirements but they 
might include such things as requiring a research project to meet 
certain goals before more money could be allocated 
the pentagon also said congressional instructions on competition 
for defense contracts have led to increases in costs and reductions 
in management options 
the current congressional defense process is characterized by 
a multiplicity of actors frequent decisions lack of finality 
disintegration and lack of accountability the draft report said 
the focus is on details at the expense of broad policy 
functions at the expense of missions and accounting inputs at the 
expense of results the report added 
congressional sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified called some of the complaints ridiculous and noted 
that in 1984 congress tried to cut the number of reports but the 
pentagon balked 
some pentagon offices were upset when told they no longer needed 
to report to congress the sources said 
in addition the budget line items often reflect a difference in 
policy between congress and the pentagon while congressional 
mandates on contracts are meant to encourage greater competition 
the sources said 
the report recommends twoyear budgets and multiyear 
procurements as a solution to the problems between congress and the 
department

state sen craig washington defeated a city 
councilman saturday in a runoff election to choose a successor to 
rep mickey leland who died in a plane crash in africa four months 
ago 
with 100 percent of the vote counted washington received 24120 
votes or 566 percent to 18473 or 434 percent for anthony 
hall 
i claim this victory not for myself but first for our brother 
who died on the side of a hill in ethiopia washington said at 
his victory celebration at a restaurant saturday night 
the winner carred a large brass torch he said represented the 
passing of lelands torch to him 
washington who like hall was a leland ally will serve the 
remainder of the late congressmans twoyear term 
i may not be a champion on the issue of hunger but i will be 
a drum major washington said referring to lelands passion for 
helping to feed the starving of the world 
washington and hall topped a field of 11 candidates nov 7 to 
qualify for the nonpartisan runoff for lelands seat 
in addition to losing to washington hall lost his council seat 
because he sought another elected post 
im not at all dejected i am disappointed but not at all 
dejected hall told supporters as his wife carolyn cried at his 
side 
we just fell a little bit short but have faith because things 
are going to be better in the 18th district because of the issues 
you helped us raise hall said congratulating washington for a 
good and fine victory 
both men are democrats in a district that has been described as 
among the most staunchly democratic in the nation 
although hall was favored in the november balloting washington 
captured 41 percent of the vote to 34 percent for hall 
a poll last week showed the race nearly deadlocked with hall 
ahead 41 percent to 38 percent with 21 percent of the voters 
undecided the poll conducted for kprc television in houston had 
a 5point margin of error 
washington 48 is an attorney and former law school instructor 
he has served in the texas senate since 1983 after a 10year stint 
in the state house 
hall 45 also an attorney gave up his city council seat to run 
for the leland vacancy both men are black 
washington and hall agreed on many issues with both favoring 
increased money to battle drug trafficking and abuse and for 
health care to the poor and elderly and military cutbacks in 
central america 
the race came down to a question of style with the flamboyant 
washington contrasting with the more lowkey and businesslike hall 
hall lost a bitter battle to leland in the congressional race in 
1978 when they sought to succeed the retiring barbara jordan 
in this race washington won the backing of lelands widow 
alison while hall carried the endorsement of houston mayor kathy 
whitmire 
in the early 1970s leland hall and washington represented 
houston districts in the texas house and worked together for civil 
rights fair housing health care and food for the poor and other 
social concerns 
leland and 15 others were killed aug 7 in a plane crash in 
ethiopia while on a hunger relief mission to a refugee camp

visiting us national security adviser brent 
scowcroft on saturday told chinese officials that washington wants 
to end differences over the chinese crackdown on dissent and move 
ahead with good relations 
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping met sunday with scowcroft 
and agreed the two nations must improve relations for world peace 
and stability 
deng said although scowcroft came to brief the chinese on the 
ussoviet summit in malta the importance of the visit is that 
in spite of the disputes and the differences between us after all 
sinous relations have to be improved 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
arrived in beijing earlier in the day as the first highlevel bush 
administration officials to visit since the chinese put down 
prodemocracy protests in june 
we believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in 
placing blame for problems that exist scowcroft said at a dinner 
held saturday by foreign minister qian qichen 
scowcroft said he had come to bring new impetus and vigor into 
our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement we 
come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the 
relationship 
deng 85 retired from his last party post in november but he 
retains great influence he also has cut down his public 
apppearances and his meeting with the americans was a clear sign 
that china hopes to end the feuding 
the chinese who have blamed washington for current friction 
showed their desire to improve ties by arranging meetings with 
chinas top leaders on sunday 
scowcroft and eagleburger also met sunday with premier li peng 
and communist party general secretary jiang zemin the us 
delegation was to leave sunday afternoon for japan before returning 
to washington on monday 
foreign minister qian in his banquet toast said the special 
envoys visit shows the importance president bush attaches to 
uschinese relations for which we would like to express our 
appreciation 
important as our differences are qian said they cannot 
obliterate the major common interests between us 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement that while bush deplores the tragedy of tiananmen 
square last june china nevertheless remains part of the world 
around us the president views china as an important country in 
world affairs 
relations between beijing and washington hit a low after chinese 
soldiers swept into the square to oust prodemocracy protesters and 
went on to crush their movement the united states criticized the 
violence and repression and beijing accused washington of 
interfering in chinas internal affairs 
the chinese government says 300 people mostly soldiers died 
during the violent suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing on june 34 witnesses and western sources say hundreds or 
even thousands died most of the victims unarmed civilians 
in the past three weeks the foreign ministry has lodged three 
official protests with the united states over congressional actions 
to expand economic sanctions against china and to allow chinese 
students to extend their stays in the united states 
but chinese leaders in recent meetings with former president 
richard nixon and former secretary of state henry kissinger also 
have expressed hope that relations could be improved 
there was speculation in beijing that the two sides would 
discuss how to resolve the situation of astrophysicist fang lizhi 
the prodemocracy dissident who has been hiding in the us embassy 
with his wife li shuxian since the crackdown the chinese have 
branded the couple as counterrevolutionaries and issued warrants 
for their arrest 
an embassy official declined comment on whether the americans 
discussed fang in their talks with qian on saturday

president gustav husak the 
nations last oldguard communist leader on sunday swore in the 
first federal government not dominated by communists in 41 years 
and then he resigned 
the coalition government a triumphant victory for the nations 
young but potent prodemocracy movement includes two men who were 
persecuted as dissidents until just several weeks ago the ceremony 
culminated a peaceful revolution led by the nations top dissident 
playwright vaclav havel 
havel was not among the opposition members who went to pragues 
historic castle to be sworn in by husak 76 who led the crackdown 
on the 1968 prague spring reform movement after it was crushed 
by a warsaw pact invasion 
premier marian calfa said in a televised news conference shortly 
afterward that husak had resigned as he had promised to do after 
the new government was named the opposition hopes havel will be 
elected president soon 
husaks last official act was to swear in on international 
human rights day some of the men sent to jail or stripped of all 
but the most menial jobs in the years he ruled as communist party 
chief from 1969 to 1987 
they included jiri dienstbier a dissident imprisoned with havel 
from 1979 to 1982 who became foreign minister and jan 
carnogursky a slovak lawyer and roman catholic activist who 
became a deputy premier in charge of the secret police and other 
state organs 
carnogursky was in jail just two weeks ago when he was among 
the first prisoners released under an amnesty as the communists 
scrambled to make concessions to the mass prodemocracy movement on 
the streets 
the new 21member government contains 10 communists two of whom 
enjoy opposition support seven nonparty members and two members 
each from the small socialist and peoples parties former docile 
communist allies who in the past weeks have joined the opposition 
in breaking the communist monopoly on power 
reformminded communist economist valtr komarek joins 
carnogursky as a first deputy premier meaning oppositionbacked 
men are the most powerful after calfa the relatively weak 
communist premier named thursday 
vladimir dlouhy another oppositionbacked communist economist 
becomes head of the powerful state planning commission and fellow 
economist vaclav klaus a nonparty man becomes minister of 
finance 
the communists retained control of the defense ministry where 
gen miroslav vacek kept the post he won in a government reshuffle 
dec 3 
other members included petr miller the labor and social affairs 
minister who was proposed by the opposition frantisek podlena a 
communist party member who becomes transportation and 
communications minister and kvetoslava korinkova the minister of 
peoples control or treasury who is unaffiliated 
the new government is expected to lay the legal framework for 
the nation to become a constitutional democracy with free 
elections to be held next year 
the swearingin sunday marked the completion of a peaceful 
anticommunist revolt that also swept through poland hungary and 
east germany after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev made it 
clear he would not send troops to prop up unpopular hardline 
communist governments in the east bloc 
czechoslovakias prodemocracy movement was headed by an 
opposition movement that exactly a year ago attracted only 3000 
people to a demonstration for international human rights day 
but that recharged movement is expected to lead hundreds of 
thousands of people back onto the streets sunday for human rights 
rallies that will also celebrate the peoples stunningly successful 
battle for more democracy 
the movement began to regain strength on nov 19 when 30000 
people marched in prague to denounce police brutality at an earlier 
rally 
huge antigovernment demonstations followed some led by 
alexander dubcek the former party chief whose reform movement was 
crushed in 1968 
on nov 24 party leader milos jakes and the rest of the 
communist leadership resigned by nov 29 the communists had given 
up their 41year monopoly on power on dec 3 premier ladislav 
adamec named a government that gave noncommunists only five seats 
in a 21member cabinet and left communists in control of all key 
portfolios 
hundreds of thousands of people immediately took to the streets 
in protest and the opposition threatened a general strike on 
monday if there was no new government by sunday 
adamec tried again to form a new government but he quit on 
thursday after complaining he could not work under opposition 
pressure 
calfa was tapped as premier and on friday the communists the 
opposition and other political parties held talks and hammered out 
an agreement on the government of national understanding sworn 
in sunday

the warsaw pacts denunciation of its invasion of 
czechoslovakia 21 years ago put a finishing touch on soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign to convince the world the 
kremlin is at one with the west in rejecting the tyranny of his 
predecessors 
as one former satellite country after another has yielded in 
recent weeks to public demands for reform after four decades of 
communist rule gorbachev has stuck to his word he has bid for 
membership in a world community of nations and he is making it 
clear he is willing to pay the dues 
those dues include making a break with the past and acts such as 
sponsoring communist uprisings abroad sending troops into 
afghanistan and ignoring treaty obligations 
after the withdrawal from afghanistan foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze admitted to the new soviet legislature that the 
invasion was illegal from the start and he acknowledged what the 
united states claimed for years that a giant radar installation in 
siberia violated the ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty and 
would be dismantled 
the soviet unions expansionism was at the heart of the cold 
war competing ideologies could coexist but soviet hegemony 
particularly in eastern europe after world war ii frightened those 
who would be free from berlin to the fields of the american middle 
west 
nowhere was moscows determination to control its satellites 
more evident than in czechoslovakia where warsaw pact tanks 
crushed the prague regimes attempt in 1968 to ease strict central 
controls and give communism a human face 
soviet leader leonid i brezhnevs rationale for stepping in to 
prevent czechoslovakia from choosing its own course was that there 
could be no retreat from socialism it became known as the brezhnev 
doctrine and kept the kremlins eastern european neighbors in check 
for two decades 
the doctrines thesis of limited sovereignty for countries 
within the soviet orbit became a symbol of the kremlins domination 
over its allies 
gorbachev first signaled his willingness to reconsider the 
doctrine when he visited prague in april 1987 two years after 
taking power 
in a tentative recognition that the ruling parties in other 
socialist countries neednt follow moscow in lock step he said 
foreign parties determine their political course with due regard 
for national conditions 
but it was months later when addressing communist party leaders 
from many countries where they were in and out of power that 
gorbachev said they were free to seek their own solutions to 
national problems 
unity does not mean being identical or uniform he told 
them we have also become convinced that socialism does not and 
cannot have a model with which all socialist systems are 
compared 
just one year ago in an address to the united nations that most 
clearly spelled out his foreign policy goals gorbachev endorsed 
the western idea that all people should have the freedom to choose 
their own political system 
it remained however for the kremlin to live up to his words 
last july after hungary embarked on a course toward free 
elections and the polish government agreed to legalize solidarity 
as an independent trade union leaders of the warsaw pact met in 
bucharest romania and declared they would not interfere in each 
others domestic reforms 
weeks later solidarity controlled the parliament and gorbachev 
spoke with polish communist party officials by telephone 
reportedly assuring them he would not object to a coalition 
government led by solidarity a noncommunist tadeusz mazowiecki 
was elected prime minister ending 40 years of communist rule in 
poland 
gorbachev visited east berlin in october and according to east 
german party sources made clear no warsaw pact troops would be 
called in to quell protests of the hardline regime of party chief 
erich honecker without moscow to prop him up honecker was ousted 
12 days later on nov 9 the berlin wall was ruptured 
in the fall after president bush had visited hungary and poland 
and after washington began to receive reports that gorbachev might 
be in political trouble at home the us administration ended a 
protracted policy review and concluded the kremlin meant what 
gorbachev said 
us secretary of state james a baker iii called it a 
historic opportunity a chance to leave behind the postwar 
period with the ups and downs of the cold war and he declared 
us support for the soviet leaders reform efforts 
gorbachev declared himself sympathetic with all the reform 
movements rending the onceunified east bloc 
they are extremely different in their starting conditions 
economic possibilities in their level of political culture and 
historical heritage tass paraphrased gorbachev as telling a 
foreign visitor but they have a common direction which fosters 
the building of a european home for it makes the countries closer 
more open and creates new opportunities for human contact and an 
equal exchange 
on sunday czechoslovakia formed its first noncommunist 
dominated government in 41 years 
czechoslovakias rush to escape the hardline communist rule 
that has dominated since the soviet invasion 21 years ago received 
gorbachevs public endorsement last week as hundreds of thousands 
poured into the streets to demand reform 
asked at a news conference on the eve of his summit with bush to 
comment on the illfated prague spring reforms of 1968 
gorbachev reminded his audience the crackdown took place in an 
atmosphere charged by the superpower arms race and an deological 
struggle between east and west 
but the reform movement he said was right at that time and 
is right now 
last monday after gathering to hear gorbachevs report on his 
talks with bush in malta the leaders of the warsaw pact nations 
that took part in the czechoslovak invasion agreed the action had 
been a mistake 
a statement by the heads of the soviet union bulgaria hungary 
east germany and poland said the entrance of their troops 
constituted interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign 
czechoslovakia and must be condemned 
romania still run by hardliner nikolae ceausescu was not a 
participant in the invasion and did not join in issuing the 
statement czechoslovakia itself had issued an earlier condemnation

the 75yearold carousel at the minnesota 
state fair is threatened a second time with auction and possible 
dismemberment if preservationists cant pay off a loan by the end 
of the month 
the carousel with 68 handcarved wooden horses was put up for 
sale a year ago by its private owners and was bought at the last 
minute by a nonprofit organization called our fair carousel 
under terms of a 13 million loan guarantee from the st paul 
city council if our fair carousel cant pay off the loan by dec 
29 the city will make the payment and take possession of the 
carousel 
if that happens mayor george latimer wants the city to sell off 
the carousel in pieces if necessary to recoup its losses 
the head of the preservation group peter boehm says 375000 
still must be raised to pay off the loan 
although money continues to trickle in and artists are donating 
proceeds from the sale of some of their works boehm says he 
doesnt think that can save the carousel 
this isnt enough to put us over the top boehm said of the 
efforts which include 100 members of the twin cities decorative 
arts guild who are making note cards and handpainted wooden horses 
to sell but it should demonstrate the kind of support we have in 
the community 
the intricately carved carousel was created in 1914 by the 
philadelphia toboggan co and since then has been ridden just 12 
days a year at the state fairgrounds in northwestern st paul 
boehm believes minnesota companies can save the carousel he has 
asked dozens of companies for contributions of 5000 to 25000 
so far six corporations or foundations have pledged money 
im befuddled i dont understand why they cant understand 
the validity of this project he said the usual response is 
we have more people asking than we have money to give 
he wishes a company would embrace the carousel as a marketing 
tool 
wouldnt this seem to be more marketable than the will steger 
expedition wouldnt a company rather be associated with happy kids 
on a carousel than a guy with a frostbitten nose he said 
steger from ely in northeastern minnesota is leading an 
international sixman ski and sled dog team on a 4000mile trek 
across antarctica 
our fair carousel has raised about 300000 from donations 
tshirt sales and profits from the carousels run at this years 
state fair it also has 623000 in pledges 
st paul mayorelect jim scheibel said hes waiting to see if 
there might be some kind of refinancing options or a way to extend 
the loan 
but boehm said he doubts a delay would be helpful 
if the corporations wont give this year when theres a 
deadline theres no reason to believe that theyll give next 
year he said if i thought they would id plead with the city 
council for an extension

the exact route taken across mississippi 
by 16thcentury spanish explorer hernando de soto may never be 
known say experts who attended a mississippi de soto trail 
commission symposium 
unless something really concrete is discovered i think it 
will be a very flexible route or corridor said james atkinson of 
tupelo an archeologist for the natchez trace parkway 
six of the nations top de soto experts presented differing 
views on the explorers travels through mississippi and the 
southeast during the symposium friday at the mississipi university 
for women in columbus 
de soto traversed 10 states in search of fame and fortune during 
the 16th century instead he found unfriendly indians during a 
winter layover in mississippi and the booty a handful of 
freshwater pearls was disappointing historians say during the 
fouryear quest he lost half of his 600 men and ultimately his own 
life 
the commission is gathering scholarly data to be used in a 
routedesignation study said patricia galloway of the state 
department of archives and history 
the state de soto trail commission was established by the 
legislature in 1988 to study the route an examination of the 
explorers route across the southeastern united states is being 
conducted by the us park service 
galloway agreed that de sotos exact trail may never be known 
she said any designation may only be of a corridor between the 
different locations where de soto is alleged to have crossed the 
mississippi river and where he spent the winter of 1540 
there really wouldnt be any harm in that she said the 
public would then understand that history is just not so simple

there could be a secret microphone on your 
telephone line in your table lamp in that briefcase sitting next 
to your desk or even under your bed 
your neighbors could be listening in on those intimate calls 
youve been making on your cordless or cellular telephone 
or your boss could be eavesdropping on your office at work 
america is caught in a wave of hightech snooping according to 
privacy advocates who blame cheap easily obtainable gadgets that 
can be bought through the mail in electronics stores or in spy 
shops 
some examples 
oneway wireless intercoms these tiny devices which can be 
secreted inside any household electrical device such as a lamp or 
electric clock will transmit conversations to a receiver placed on 
the same electrical circuit such as from a conference room to a 
basement theyre available at electronics stores for 2495 
spy briefcases with a flick of their handles these 
normallooking attache cases will record loud and clear any 
sounds in a room for hours they cost between 600 and 900 
infinity transmitters attach one to a phone and call it from 
another phone the bugged phone does not ring instead it becomes a 
microphone that will pick up everything within 30 feet yours for 
just 9995 
baby tenders these innocuous intercom systems allow parents to 
monitor an infants room from another part of the house trouble 
is these radio devices also put out signals that can be heard by 
neighbors or by snoops 
voiceactivated tape recorders put one under a bed to catch an 
unfaithful spouse or in your pocket to secretly record a 
conversation cost 75 and up 
listening aids designed to look like small portable radios or 
tape players they can as the ads say let you hear what people 
are saying about you across the room 4995 
devices like these plus counterbugging gadgets will be on 
display this week in washington at surveillance expo 89 which 
organizer jim ross says is the first nongovernment show to focus 
on surveillance and countersurveillance 
one exhibitor will show a belt pager that actually is a tiny tv 
camera 
he has a transmitter on his back and a beeper on a belt 
wherever he points the beeper hes broadcasting a picture to a 
receiver the device has a range of a few hundred feet but 
could be boosted ross said in an interview last week 
he also has one built into a tie clip and another that looks 
like a sprinkler head thats a big seller he tells me ross 
said 
another exhibitor will show how to use a touchtone telephone to 
modify computer programs that control sophisticated office phone 
systems the exhibitor used it so he could monitor his boss 
phone calls ross said 
in many workplaces interoffice phone systems have replaced 
traditional clappers and bell ringers with musical tone pulses the 
systems require that the phone receivers stay turned on all the 
time which turns them into microphones ross said 
and employers increasingly monitor employees phones to check on 
efficiency and performance 
what we have here is a massive assault on our constitutionally 
guaranteed right and expectancy of privacy said rudolph 
brewington a washington freelance journalist who claims his 
exwife victimized him as part of a divorce proceeding with a 
voiceactivated tape recorder 
manufacturers say their devices all have legal uses and that it 
is up to the buyer not the seller to make sure laws are not 
broken but brewington and others say manufacturers know these 
devices are being used illegally and are doing nothing to prevent 
it 
manufacturers have not developed any type of inhibiting device 
on these products they merely sell them brewington said in an 
interview even though manufacturers often include warnings about 
illegal use in their advertising they know exactly how the 
products are being used 
brewington along with another journalist robert moore jr was 
instrumental in getting the us postal service to begin warning 
customers in september that it is illegal to mail devices intended 
to intercept wire or oral communications 
title 18 of the us code prohibits the manufacture sale 
possession advertisement mailing and use of devices primarily 
useful for the purpose of surreptitious interception of wire or 
oral communcations 
the phrase primarily useful is a key point of contention for 
manufacturers who say their devices serve legitimate purposes 
but there also is another catch in the law section 2511 which 
was enacted primarily to allow law enforcement officials to place 
listening devices on informants during an investigation 
section 2511 allows recording when one person is a party to the 
conversation and gives prior consent the doctrine of one party 
consent 
the law does not specify who the consenting party is the 
person taping or being taped california pennsylvania florida and 
michigan have enacted laws requiring that all parties give consent 
a bill by rep ron dellums dcalif is pending in the house 
that would require all nonlaw enforcement parties to agree to 
taping while also requiring beep tones on voiceactivated 
recorders 
but ross a countersurveillance expert says the problem is 
larger than surreptitious listening 
people are not really attuned to the fact that they may be 
heard or eavesdropped on he said users of cellular and cordless 
phones often dont realize their conversations are being broadcast 
on radio waves cordless phone users sometimes can overhear other 
cordless conversations and people using police scanners can 
intercept cellular phone calls 
horror stories abound ross said 
ross recalled a man in phoenix using a police scanner who 
intercepted a neighbors baby tender 
the parents had put the baby tender in the babys room and the 
parents were behind a paperthin wall in the next room the baby 
was quiet but the parents werent being quiet ross recalled the 
scanner operator saying what he was hearing shouldnt have been 
broadcast all over north phoenix

a judge decides tuesday whether leona helmsley 
the billionaire hotel queen must exchange her designer clothes and 
country estate for prison garb and a cell 
mrs helmsley the notoriously picky and sharptongued 
executive is to be sentenced in manhattans federal court where 
she was convicted aug 30 at a highly publicized trial of evading 
12 million in federal taxes 
the 69yearold mrs helmsley could receive up to 127 years in 
prison if us district judge john m walker jr were to impose 
consecutive maximum sentences for each of 33 counts 
the judge could give lesser time or spare mrs helmsley from 
prison altogether by sentencing her to probation or community 
service she also faces more than 7 million in fines 
even if walker imposes a prison sentence mrs helmsley will 
likely remain free while she appeals her conviction 
her attorney gerald feffer would not discuss the sentencing 
the last obstacle to her sentencing was lifted last monday when 
walker ruled that prosecutors did not use tainted evidence against 
mrs helmsley at the trial her lawyers had asked that her 
conviction be set aside claiming evidence used against her was 
obtained during 1985 grand jury investigations at which she had 
been granted immunity to testify 
at the time the state was investigating possible sales tax 
evasion by jewelers furriers and other retailers 
the court is satisfied that the governments evidence used in 
the federal grand jury and at trial was derived from sources 
independent of mrs helmsleys immunized testimony on unrelated 
matters walker said in a written decision 
mrs helmsley has avoided personal publicity since the daily 
scrutiny of the twomonth trial she has however continued to be 
featured as a regal perfectionist in advertisements for her hotels 
mrs helmsley and her 80yearold husband harry own a 5 
billion real estate empire that includes 27 hotels the helmsley 
hotels in new york and the harley chain based in cleveland 
helmsley was indicted with his wife in 1988 but was found 
mentally incompetent to stand trial they still face prosecution on 
charges of evading state taxes no trial date has been set 
mrs helmsley was convicted of evading federal taxes from 1983 
through 1985 most of it by fraudulently billing 31 million in 
expenses from the helmsleys greenwich conn mansion dunnellen 
hall to their business empire 
among the expenses were more than 1 million for a pool 
enclosure with a marble dance floor jade figures worth 500000 
and a 130000 indooroutdoor sound system 
mrs helmsleys two codefendants also will be sentenced 
tuesday joseph licari and frank turco both former helmsley 
executives were convicted of helping in the tax fraud

alexandria va would be only the second in the lengthy 
investigation known as operation ill wind into possible 
multibilliondollar procurement fraud

individuals and four corporations 
the indictment against muldoon and ingram charges they were part 
of a sevenyear scheme to funnel payments of more than 80000 to 
sherman for his help getting pentagon business 
in return sherman steered contracts worth more than 62 
million to lee telecommunications which became a subsidiary of 
whittaker corp in 1986 according to court documents 
the contracts were to provide computers and electronic equipment 
for an battlefield airtraffic control system known as atacc 
whittaker command and control systems the whittaker subsidiary 
that absorbed lee telecommunications along with two of its former 
executives and another defense consultant pleaded guilty in 
september to charges of participating in the bribery scheme

bribery scheme to influence the award of pentagon contracts a 
third teledyne executive was acquitted altogether 
on friday justice department prosecutors signaled they were 
zeroing in on three other major figures in the ill wind 
investigation with the guilty plea by loral corp 
the new yorkbased defense company admitted it conspired to 
obtain inside information about a contract to make radar detection 
equipment for f16 fighters and another to build a navy blimp 
the company which agreed to pay 577 million in fines and 
penalties admitted that it paid defense consultant william m 
galvin 578000 to obtain confidential bid information about air 
force and navy contracts from two senior pentagon officials 
galvin obtained information about a radardetection equipment 
contract from victor d cohen then a deputy assistant air force 
secretary according to charges that loral admitted 
cohen was to personally benefit from passing information to 
galvin about the 434 million contract loral was awarded court 
papers said 
a statement of facts filed by prosecutors indicated that cohen 
shared some of the consulting fees loral paid galvin 
on the navy contract galvin also enlisted the aid of melvyn 
paisley an assistant navy secretary for engineering research and 
systems before going into business with galvin in the spring of 
1987

on the same square where soviet 
tanks crushed czechoslovak hopes for freedom two decades ago 
100000 people gathered sunday to laugh and cry and celebrate their 
peaceful victory over communist tyranny 
we have been waiting for this moment for 40 years said vera 
balikova a retired researcher at the national academy of sciences 
who just three weeks ago was standing on wenceslas square demanding 
an end to the repressive regime 
i remember the tanks i remember what happened afterward and 
i am very glad that we have lived to see this day she said 
touching the tiny red white and blue ribbon pinned to her coat and 
seen on nearly everyone in prague in these last dramatic weeks 
the demonstration called to mark international human rights 
day turned into an emotional victory celebration one hour after 
the announcement of czechoslovakias first government not dominated 
by communists since 1948 
the new 21member government contains 10 communists two of whom 
enjoy opposition support seven nonparty members and two members 
each from the small socialist and peoples parties that were once 
allied with the communists 
just three weeks ago two of the new ministers were being 
persecuted as dissidents czechoslovaks are especially proud of 
achieving their gentle revolution without so much as as a 
broken window 
lets make sure this revolution keeps on flourishing but let 
us not allow anyone to smear dirt on its peaceful face 
playwright vaclav havel said speaking from a tiny balcony above a 
sea of faces and flags filled like sails in the frosty wind 
long live havel long live havel voices chanted in unison 
then free elections free elections 
havel a founder of the charter 77 human rights group and the 
new opposition movement civic forum spent more than four years in 
jail for expressing his moral outrage in the face of 
totalitarianism now he is the most popular man in czechoslovakia 
and an obvious candidate for president 
gustav husak aside from romanias nicolae ceausescu the last 
hardline communist president in eastern europe resigned sunday 
we havent won yet havel told the crowd but we have had 
great success and we have great hope 
tears streaked the cheeks of many older people in the crowd who 
remember democracy crushed under the boots of nazi troops in 1938 
the postworld war ii agreement at yalta that pulled the iron 
curtain down on their country and the soviet tanks that killed the 
prague spring on aug 21 1968 
jiri hajek 77 was foreign minister that day later he became 
one of the brave band of dissidents battling for democracy and 
human rights here 
the fact that this beautiful joyful day is also the day of 
international human rights is no coincidence hajek told the 
crowd 
recalling czechoslovakias democratic traditions he noted 
proudly between the world wars we were the only country east of 
the rhine where for the whole time respect for human rights was 
regarded as a foundation of real democracy 
the 1938 invasion occurred after the munich agreement of britain 
and france which hoped to appease adolf hitler by giving him the 
germanspeaking part of czechoslovakia 
but the 1968 invasion shocked the world images of the stunned 
faces of czechoslovaks filled tv screens and newspaper pages and 
drew sympathy from all nations cherishing individual liberty 
miroslava mojzisova was on the square that day and returned 
sunday with her 10yearold daughter 
this is so beautiful she said smiling while her eyes 
filled with tears i wanted to bring radka too because history 
is being written 
radka summing up simply the feelings of all her countrymen on 
the square chimed in this is wonderful i like it all quite 
well

the tidal wave of democracy sweeping eastern 
europe is creating static for the us governments two major radio 
stations whose mission is to beam the virtues of freedom into 
lands that have none 
but both the voice of america and radio free europe synonymous 
with the battle for world public opinion during four decades of 
cold war reject any suggestion their days may be numbered on the 
contrary they argue their task now is more important than ever 
international broadcasters have an important role if we want 
to see these trends continue said robert coonrod voas deputy 
director despite the lifting of censorship in many east european 
media people still tune in to validate information theyre 
getting on their radio stations fortyfive years have made them 
doubtful about their own countries radios he said 
nonetheless a maverick at voa has created a stir with an 
article in the latest edition of foreign policy magazine 
suggesting a consolidation of the two radio services 
voas audience research officer kim andrew elliott says the 
functions of the voa and rfe are becoming less distinct creating 
an opportunity to restructure us international broadcasting he 
estimates that consolidation could save about 50 million annually 
elliott speaking in an interview also said it is reasonable 
to expect that audience numbers will be reduced as domestic radio 
stations improve in east european countries undergoing reform he 
said there were no figures available yet on listening trends over 
the past few weeks of upheaval 
officials at both stations have publicly dissociated themselves 
from elliotts views saying the stations roles are completely 
different 
voas stated mission is to provide news and programs about 
american government and society to the world broadcasting in 43 
languages it also airs editorials prepared under the guidance of 
its parent organization the us information agency 
radio free europe which serves eastern europe and its sister 
station radio liberty which beams to the soviet union were funded 
covertly by the cia until 1971 when congress took over their 
budgets and made them a private corporation under the supervision 
of a presidentially appointed bipartisan board of governors 
the stations which broadcast from their headquarters in munich 
germany in 21 languages have a clear mandate to provide people 
under authoritarian communist rule with information about their own 
countries in an attempt to bring about political change 
wed like to think we played a role in all thats happening 
now through the free flow of information we provided through the 
years said patricia gates lynch rfes director of corporate 
affairs 
the change sweeping the communist world has provided voa and rfe 
with bonanzas a cessation of all jamming and a chance to deploy 
correspondents throughout the soviet bloc but it also presents 
them with unprecedented challenges not the least of which is 
competition from newly liberalized radio stations in eastern europe 
in response voa and rfe have gone into the how to business 
both have been airing programs designed to appeal to the new quest 
for free enterprise in the crumbling communist systems how to 
start a new business how to set up a stock market etc 
rfe also has provided programs on how other countries write 
constitutions design education programs and write legal codes as 
the oncecommunist countries reshape their governments and 
societies 
the stations contend that between them they have an audience of 
more than 100 million in europe 
to generate revenue amid growing us budget austerity voa this 
month began carrying advertising on its programs in western europe 
said coonrod it also hopes to attract european affiliates with the 
promise of advertising revenue 
rfe is considering a similar move said gates lynch 
but as long as both stations enjoy the broad support they have 
in congress which has kept their funding level at an annual level 
of 170 million and 190 million respectively such a move is 
unlikely 
officials at both stations contend that any merger would be a 
bureaucratic and logistical nightmare voa has about 2800 
employees and rfe about 1700 voa operates out of washington 
while rfe is based in germany 
voas standing got an important boost when chinese authorities 
began their crackdown last june against prodemocracy protesters 
the chinese government has been jamming voa for months to deter the 
droves of dissidents tuning in to its mandarin and cantonese 
broadcasts 
the china experience is fresh in everyones mind said 
coonrod changes in eastern europe are evolving but theyre not 
yet rooted we dont know that theyre here to stay

antiapartheid leaders sunday 
announced a militant strategy of civil disobedience and political 
pressure and urged south african whites to join them for the 
final onslaught on apartheid 
the plans were adopted late saturday at a closed session of the 
largest antiapartheid conference ever held in south africa it was 
attended by 4662 black white indian and mixedrace delegates 
from 2128 organizations 
several major black organizations to the left and right of 
mainstream antiapartheid groups either boycotted the conference or 
were not invited 
but murphy morobe one the organizers said the conference for a 
democratic future was a roaring success 
business was concluded in a spirit of unity unprecedented in 
any gathering in the past with such a disparate array of 
organizations he said at a news conference 
one resolution urged whites to break decisively with all 
apartheid forces and side with the majority it urged them to 
conduct solidarity marches into black townships and proposed a 
campaign to create new municipalities by merging white cities and 
their adjoining black ghettos 
another resolution urged an escalation of confrontational 
activity by black trade unions it said workers should be prepared 
to occupy the johannesburg stock exchange if necessary to prevent 
possible privatization of major state enterprises such as the 
postal and transport services 
we call upon our people to reject capitalism and free market 
system a resolution on economics said 
perhaps the most important resolution morobe said was a demand 
for nonracial elections for an assembly that would draft a 
constitution establishing a oneperson onevote system for south 
africa 
president fw de klerk has rejected the concept of such an 
assembly he has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would 
extend limited political rights to the black majority of 28 
million but he wants black negotiators chosen in segregated 
elections 
since taking power in august de klerk has made several 
conciliatory moves aimed at promoting negotiations between blacks 
and the nations 5 million whites who control the government and 
the economy he has freed some prominent political prisoners 
prohibited segregation of beaches and permitted previously banned 
opposition activities including meetings like the conference 
however delegates adopted a resolution saying de klerks 
proposals were designed to enmesh our organizations and people in 
schemes to maintain the status quo 
the conference took the view that president de klerks 
reform initiatives are devoid of substance morobe said 
other resolutions urged parents and students to defy school 
segregation policies demanded land redistribution and urged young 
white men to refuse mandatory military service delegates also 
demanded appointment of an independent commission to investigate 
allegations that police death squads have killed government 
opponents 
another resolution demanded an end to the state of emergency 
imposed in june 1986 many delegates belong to groups restricted by 
emergency regulations 
most delegates were aligned to some degree with the outlawed 
african national congress guerrilla movement and affiliated groups 
in south africa 
the most notable absentees were inkatha a relatively 
conservative zulu organization opposed to the ancs militant 
tactics and socalled africanist groups which oppose the ancs 
philosophy of nonracism 
although black unity remains elusive morobe said the conference 
far surpassed our expectations 
a firm basis was established for the political direction of 
all antiapartheid forces well into the 1990s the decade of the 
final onslaught against apartheid he said 
observers from 19 countries attended the conference and 
organizers said funding was provided by the dutch government and 
church groups from denmark norway and sweden they said the 
canadian government had offered to finance regional followup 
meetings

site 2 thailand ap buddhist monks chanted prayers sunday 
before thousands of cambodian refugees who gathered to appeal for 
the human rights denied them for nearly two decades 
the ceremony marking international human rights day followed 
clashes just outside this border camp thursday and friday that 
killed at least one person and wounded two people aid officials 
said 
officials said the clashes involved thai paramilitary personel 
and cambodian traders along the border also the scene of 
intensifying fighting in the 11yearold civil war 
relief officials have documented numerous slayings rapes and 
beatings of cambodians in refugee camps and their homelands by thai 
authorities the three guerrilla groups and the 
vietnameseinstalled government 
our people have already suffered too much because of human 
rights violations said dr haing ngor who portrayed a survivor 
of the brutal 197578 khmer rouge regime in the film the killing 
fields 
please help the suffering people of cambodia the most 
suffering nation in the world he said during the ceremony 
the ceremonies organized by un relief officials began with 
buddhist monks in saffron robes praying for peace and 
schoolchildren singing a human rights song 
human rights is sometimes seen as a western idea an idea 
alien to cambodian culture one monk yos hut told several 
thousand of the camps 140000 residents this is not true 
on a stage of bamboo and cloth students in traditional costumes 
danced and other refugees acted out a sketch of quarreling 
neighbors who peacefully settle their disputes 
eight pigeons were released and flew outside the camp where the 
refugees are not supposed to go 
after a minute of silence some participants ventured into an 
exhibition of paintings by refugees showing the khmer rouge 
killing victims and dumping them into mass graves and vietnamese 
soldiers bayoneting and raping cambodians 
at sundown about 20 to 25 western relief workers and about a 
dozen refugees at site 2 ended a 24hour fast to appeal for the 
protection of the cambodians 
all of these border camps are human rights violations in 
themselves said an organizer of the fast corinne bowmaker of 
the american refugee committtee 
millions have died in cambodia since the 1970 military coup 
ended the peaceful threedecade rule of prince norodom sihanouk 
the khmer rouge who won the 197075 civil war killed hundreds of 
thousands of people before vietnamese troops drove them from power 
in late 1978 a civil war has raged since 
site 2 is controlled by the khmer peoples national liberation 
front human rights day ceremonies were also held in site b the 
main camp controlled by the forces of prince sihanouk and site 8 
the main khmer rouge camp 
un relief workers recently introduced into the camps judicial 
systems reflecting the principles of the human rights declaration 
which the united nations adopted 41 years ago sunday

a problem with a fuel tank 
pressurization system forced the air force on sunday to postpone 
the launch of a military navigation satellite 
the countdown had progressed to just four minutes before liftoff 
when trouble was detected the launch team had only a 21minute 
window in which to get the delta 2 rocket off not long enough 
to work on the problem 
lt col ron rand an air force spokesman said the culprit was 
a faulty helium pressure regulator helium is used to pressurize 
the rockets fuel tanks 
the launch was tentatively rescheduled for monday at 1254 pm 
the delta 2 is to carry up a 65 million navstar satellite that 
is to join a network of four other spacecraft that tell us and 
allied military forces where they are within 50 feet anywhere in

more than 50000 people chanting 
democracy rallied sunday in the biggest demonstration for 
reform since the communists consolidated power 43 years ago 
thousands of bulgarians many from provincial towns outside the 
capital braved snow and temperatures well below freezing to show 
their support for 19 independent groups that organized the rally 
the number of opposition groups has grown rapidly since the 
start of bulgarias democracy movement less than a month ago and 
the groups unified stance represents a potential threat to the 
ruling communists 
only a few uniformed police guarded the area around the twohour 
rally held in the vast square in front of the aleksander nevski 
orthodox cathedral some officers slumped bored and cold in buses 
on empty sidestreets 
the crowd repeatedly cheered demands for democratic change 
similar to reforms under way in other east bloc countries 
including eliminating the communists constitutional guarantee of a 
leading role in society czechoslovakia and east germany have made 
such a change 
at the end of the rally a speaker read a resolution addressed 
to parliament that recognized moves toward liberalization since 
nov 10 when leader todor zhivkov was ousted after 35 years of 
rule and replaced by former foreign minister petar mladenov 
but it said reforms were occurring too slowly and that the 
communist partys policysetting central committee should resign 
because its members are politically and morally worn out 
the crowd wildly cheered that demand and roared tomorrow 
tomorrow 
the central committee was scheduled to meet monday for the 
second time in four days to discuss organizational matters 
at fridays meeting four people were removed from the ruling 
politburo in a continuing shakeup to purge hardliners associated 
with zhivkov and bring in reformers 
since zhivkovs ouster official papers have been full of 
reports of corruption in the top party leadership and speakers at 
the rally demanded former officials account for any wrongdoing 
the resolution presented also said officials and the opposition 
should hold talks on new laws for free elections and freedom of the 
press and assembly it demanded an end to the communist partys 
presence in the workplace and in police and military organizatons 
earlier the crowd chanted immediately immediately when 
zhiliu zhelev a leading opposition activist said we need a 
dialogue and an urgent program for the country to get out of its 
economic crisis 
officials last week acknowledged that the gross foreign debt 
stands at 10 billon and bulgarians say some basic goods such as 
milk cheese and coffee have become scarce 
about 2000 ethnic turks at the rally chanted we want our 
names back a reference to a government assimilation campaign 
that forced them to replace their moslem names with bulgarian ones 
ethnic unrest earlier this year sparked hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic turks to flee to neighboring turkey 
the resolution blamed the strife on the zhivkov regime and said 
a parliamentary commission including independent representatives 
should be set up to investigate and find a peaceful solution 
hussan belkov an activist of the society for the protection of 
human rights said some people who wanted to attend the rally were 
stopped in several towns where ethnic turks live

in a new government that for the first time in 41 years is 
dominated by noncommunists 
dubcek who is retired from the forestry commission and lives in 
bratislava said a recent opinion poll listed him as the leading 
candidate for the job 
the fact that the spontaneous call comes from the street 
speaks for itself our ancestors used to say voice of the people 
voice of god he said the people will decide what happens 
now 
if he is elected by parliament it would be a rehabilitation 
of a people that was offended by the invasion he said he 
stressed that the current movement toward democracy is a 
continuation of his reform efforts in 1968 
opposition leader vaclav havel also has widespread support for 
president 
dubceks statements were reported a few hours after the new 
government was sworn in 
some political observers say dubcek who was stripped of his 
membership in the party in 1970 but still considers himself a 
communist is virtually the only person capable of taking over the 
presidency as a symbol of national unity 
dubcek said his support so far has come spontaneously from the 
street and not from official parties or organizations such as the 
opposition civic forum however he hinted that he might welcome 
such support

the people on this volcanic 
archipelago of perfume flowers and poverty are struggling to oust 
european mercenaries who have dominated the nation during 14 
bizarre years of independence 
the longsimmering opposition to the 30 french and belgian 
mercenaries boiled over after president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
was assassinated nov 26 
virtually all comorans blame the mercenaryled presidential 
guard the main security force on the nation of four islands in the 
indian ocean 
a protest saturday in moroni the capital was the second in 
three days broken up with tear gas by the 600strong guard headed 
by frenchman bob denard a legendary soldier of fortune and veteran 
of countless battles throughout africa and asia 
the people will not be satisfied until the mercenaries 
leave said a businessman who asked to be identified only as 
abdou the comorans want to choose their own leader 
interim president said mohamed djohar in a radio announcement 
friday told people not to hold public gatherings 
according to a source in contact with djohar the president 
feels he is hostage to the guard all his public statements must be 
cleared by the mercenaries said the source who requested 
anonymity 
the island nations 450000 citizens are mostly illiterate 
exceedingly poor and politically unorganized and they likely will 
find it difficult to oust the mercenaries by themselves 
the french and south africans the two largest aid donors to the 
islands suspended all assistance last week and are pressuring 
denard and his colleagues to leave 
france has sent troops to its indian ocean island of reunion 
but says it is preparing for possible evacuation of french citizens 
from the comoros not military intervention 
the french and the south africans have done the most to entrench 
denards mercenaries through the strange history of the comoros 
the islands declared their independence from france in 1975 and 
abdallah became president within a month denard helped engineer a 
coup that put ali soilih in power 
one of soilihs first acts was to publicly burn all colonial 
bureaucratic records he fired the 3000member civil service and 
replaced it with illiterate teenagers he also tried to ban moslem 
practices in a nation where mosques are the most prominent 
structures in villages of simple grass huts 
soilih once dreamed he would be attacked by a man with a dog 
and his teenage civil servants tried to carry out his order to 
kill every dog on the islands 
in 1978 comoran exiles and the french gave their blessing to 
another coup by denard who took a boatload of 50 mercenaries and 
his pet german shepherd and captured the country in a few hours 
while soilih slept 
abdallah was restored to power and soilih was shot dead two 
weeks later purportedly while trying to escape 
denard now 60 initially was greeted as a liberator hero and 
decided to remain he has become a citizen converted to islam and 
married his sixth wife a comoran less than half his age 
denard and other mercenaries have become extremely wealthy and 
have extensive business interests for example the us embassy 
building is owned by former mercenary roger ghys 
denard began developing ties with south africa in the early 
1980s 
south africa has given the comoros about 5 million in annual 
aid and about half went to the presidential guard sources said 
shortly before abdallahs death south africa told the comoros 
it was ceasing aid for the guard and denard and abdallah argued 
over funding to the force according to sources 
denard has said he was not involved in abdallahs death and has 
no plans to leave last week he arrived at moronis main mosque 
and sought to swear his innocence before senior religious leaders 
they refused to enter with denard more than 1000 men in the 
square chanted assassin assassin when he emerged afterward 
no one has been arrested in abdallahs assassination and the 
government has said only that uncontrolled elements were 
responsible 
the 500man army has been disbanded and the militarystyle guard 
patrols the increasingly empty streets in jeeps mounted with 
machine guns 
the comoros anemic economy is dependent on foreign aid and 
certain to suffer without it 
the nation has virtually no manufacturing and is known primarily 
for their ylangylang a greenishyellow flower exported for use in 
french perfumes 
we want the french to help force the mercenaries out said 
an opposition figure who requested anonymity the mercenaries 
came from there and thats where they should go back

his formal title is police deputy superintendent 
william celester but everyone knows him as billy the former gang 
member who learned early to be quick on his feet 
celester started out as a teenage member of the marseilles 
dukes but today spends 16hour shifts running things down at area b 
police station in roxbury where murder and drug abuse cast a 
constant long shadow 
he has reinstituted neighborhood block watches has his officers 
walking regular beats and meets daily with community activists 
hes at the schools in the churches cruising the streets late at 
night 
the hardwon relationship between the people who live on area 
bs raggedy streets and those who police them has caught the 
attention of leaders nationwide including mayorelect david 
dinkins of new york who has been considering celester for a top 
police post 
gang and drugrelated crimes are still rampant but theres a 
new openness in the neighborhoods wherever he goes celester walks 
into open arms people honk and wave to him on the streets 
residents of the citys housing projects swing open their doors 
when they see him coming 
these are my people celester 46 said during a recent 
interview at his chaotic office my whole life has prepared me 
for this job 
the story could have come out differently 
celester a ninthgrade dropout spent his teens running with 
the dukes he married at 16 divorced a year later and got caught 
up in street fights he was sentenced to six months in jail for 
failing to pay child support for a son born out of wedlock 
by the time hed finished his jail term at age 17 celester says 
he was already embittered 
i came out and sure i was angry i hated the system and 
didnt want anything to do with ithe said i could easily have 
gone the other way but i had support something a lot of kids 
today dont have 
celester drew inspiration from community elders such as former 
state sen royal l bolling who convinced him a life outside the 
law was no life at all 
they convinced me not to hate celester said they 
convinced me to pick myself up and work to make things better 
celester went back to school eventually earning a masters 
degree in criminal justice he joined the police force in the 
mid1960s at the suggestion of civil rights activists who thought 
the 23yearold should take a shot at restoring the communitys 
pride 
billy grew up here and he takes trouble on the streets to 
heart said bolling he knows the people hes dealing with very 
personally and he has a deep understanding of the problems 
during his 25 years with the boston police celester has kept 
the vision of a more simple time one in which grandparents 
strolled the streets at night and mothers were seldom afraid for 
their children 
babies are dying said celester who has three grown 
children i cant get used to seeing kids laying dead in the 
streets 
more than half of the 100 or so homicides committed in boston so 
far this year have been in area b and 3486 drug arrests were 
logged in those same neighborhoods between january and october 
activist georgette watson said street violence is tough to stop 
but celester has had a series of rap sessions with gang members 
and the tenuous relationship could make a difference 
watson said gang members arent open to anyone but they relate 
to celester because he was raised in roxbury and is a black man 
you cant really tell if they trust him or not but at least 
theyre talking she said

sen bill bradley is sounding big themes as 
his 1990 senate race nears and speculation intensifies about his 
presidential aspirations trying on new audiences some images hes 
been testing since may 
when the new jersey democrat addressed more than 1000 
supporters at a 500ahead fundraiser last week most of his 
remarks came from a graduation speech he delivered at middlebury 
college 
then he was telling the vermont students how to strive for 
excellence and use public service to help change the world they 
were entering 
when he spoke last monday in east brunswick nj about 
patriotism and how the united states should set a quiet example for 
other nations through sound domestic policy he came across more 
like the national politician many hope hell become a democratic 
president 
although many supporters privately are champing at the bit to 
see him announce a 1992 candidacy they say loyally that its 
his decision to make 
bradley still treads cautiously balancing his work for new 
jersey and his senate reelection against his broad national aims 
and with that he maintains distance from the inevitable questions 
about 1992 
but as he moved into his reelection year bradley took center 
stage at his 11th annual state fundraiser rather than offer brief 
remarks while another speaker took the spotlight he chose to 
deliver the main talk himself 
the lanky former new york knicks basketball star wove together 
personal anecdotes about his past his political vision for the 
future and his love of new jersey 
my father always wanted me to be a gentleman and my mother 
always wanted me to be a success neither one wanted me to be a 
politician he said 
but recalling one hot summer night between his junior and senior 
years at princeton university when he watched the civil rights act 
of 1964 passed in washington he decided he could help make america 
better by serving in the senate 
as bradley continues raising money for an expected 12 million 
reelection bid contributors and supporters continue discussing 
his prospects as a presidential contender 
hes probably a stellar senator not only for new jersey but 
for the nation said robert menendez mayor of union city nj 
which has the nations secondhighest cubanamerican population 
outside miami 
menendez credits bradley for reaching out to that community the 
assemblyman already is thinking about mobilizing traditionally 
republicanleaning cubanamericans in new jersey and florida behind 
bradley should he enter the presidential arena 
hes the type of candidate that can win for the democrats 
nationally i think you would see massive crossover menendez 
said i would be willing to use my contacts to promote him 
analyzing the bradley appeal ray bramucci head of the 
senators new jersey reelection operations said this is a guy 
who is a senator who doesnt have jobs to give out they sense 
theres leadership here 
steven gross a newark nj attorney from a 140member law 
firm that raises money for bradley said i think hes one of the 
most thoughtful politicians this country has developed in this 
generation my generation 
asked about whether bradley might announce for 1992 he said 
i think it depends on the state of the economy if president 
bush doesnt handle the deficit 
as for holding out until 1996 he said i think there is a 
risk of waiting eight years 
bradleys appeal as a senator and politician also lies in being 
perceived as a centrist 
he has monopolized most of the middle ground to the right and 
the left of him said state assemblyman alan karcher of 
sayreville nj

gustav husak the nations last 
hardline communist leader to lose power plunged czechoslovakia 
into two decades of repression after the failed prague spring 
reforms of 1968 
husak who resigned sunday after swearing in a new government 
dominated by noncommunists was picked by the soviets to take over 
the communist party leadership from alexander dubcek the architect 
of the 1968 reforms crushed by warsaw pact tanks 
husak replaced dubcek on april 17 1969 some eight months after 
the aug 21 1968 sovietled invasion his nearly two decades as 
party chief were marked by rigid control over the arts and the 
harsh suppression of political dissent 
in his farewell address to the nation saturday he alluded to 
the current criticism of that 21year era allowing that some bad 
things had occurred but sticking fast to his lifelong belief in 
the socialist creed 
whatever mistakes occurred were the mistakes of people and 
not of fundamental ideas he said welcoming what he called the 
renaissance of socialism now underway in eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
husak had been five months away from the end of his third term 
he was replaced as party leader by milos jakes in december 1987 
but retained both his seat on the ruling party politburo and the 
largely ceremonial post of president he had held since 1975 
husak jakes and the other men responsible for the crackdown on 
reform after 1968 all lost their powerful politburo posts nov 24 
in a purge prompted by the surging prodemocracy movement 
during the prague spring liberalization period husak 
clearly stood for reform even going so far as to say just days 
after the invasion i stand fully behind dubceks concept 
either i shall stand with him or i shall leave 
but he quickly became a willing executor of the kremlins 
hardline policy 
under continued soviet pressure husak supervised a wholesale 
purge of the party and a crackdown that left most of the reform 
movements brightest advocates in official disgrace and toiling in 
menial jobs 
husak was responsible for sweeping campaigns aimed at crushing 
political dissent and the persecution of members of the charter 77 
human rights movement 
many of those early disidents including czechoslovakias most 
prominent opposition leader vaclav havel have since forced the 
communists to relinquish their 41year monopoly on power 
opposition leaders had demanded husaks resignation as a key 
step toward genuine democratic reforms 
husak was born jan 10 1913 near bratislava the slovak 
capital and trained as a lawyer he became a communist party 
member in 1933 and was a leading member of the communist 
underground in slovakia during world war ii 
he fell into disgrace as a slovak nationalist during the 
stalinist years he was arrested in 1951 and later sentenced to 
life imprisonment for nationalist and antistate activities 
he was released from prison in 1960 given a factory job and 
was later rehabilitated 
under husak czechoslovakia gained a reputation as one of the 
soviet unions most unswerving political allies in the warsaw pact 
his political career became endangered when soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev instituted reforms from the kremlin and 
neighboring poland and hungary followed suit 
early in 1987 after gorbachev outlined a sweeping program of 
political change in january that year husak switched tactics and 
lent verbal support to reforms 
but that was not enough to save him the party leadership in the 
handover to jakes reformers hoped that change would come 
but jakes became what valtr komarek a reformminded economist 
tapped as a probable member of the new government calls a tool of 
the mafia picked by the soviets to run czechoslovakia in 1968 
and in the end appeared even more resistant to change than husak

the 12nation european community 
under pressure to integrate in the face of upheaval to the east 
took dramatic steps on the path toward uniting europe at a weekend 
summit here 
it remains a rocky and uncertain road with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher maintaining a lone stance against plans 
for economic and monetary integration and communitywide welfare 
and workers rights 
but the leaders of the wealthy club encompassing 320 million 
people emerged from the twoday summit declaring themselves united 
in a new role as a single west european bloc committed to reaching 
out toward the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
henceforth there is no longer a europe in two parts acting in 
the shadows or at the initiative of the two superpowers declared 
summit host french president francois mitterrand winding up the 
meeting on saturday 
clearly as of today we can say yalta belongs more and more to 
history he added of the 1945 conference at the end of world war 
ii that divided the continent of europe between east and west 
the rhetoric at least echoed a call by president bush last 
week to the european community to intensify efforts to integrate 
and become a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in 
eastern europe 
but from mitterrand the most flamboyantly outspoken advocate of 
european unity to mrs thatcher the oftenprickly pragmatist the 
leaders displayed a new political will to act together to encourage 
change and guard against anarchy 
despite disagreements what emerges most strongly from this 
summit is the degree to which the community can act as the 
driving force for the development of the whole of europe at a 
turning point in the continents history mrs thatcher said at a 
news conference 
she reiterated her lone dissent from the decisions to press 
ahead with the monetary union and to adopt a social charter 
but she sounded conciliatory compared with her combative 
attitude during past bitter internal disputes over issues ranging 
from farm subsidies to whether the community is supposed to be a 
trading bloc or an embryonic political federation 
mrs thatchers lowkey tone also may have been spurred by polls 
in britain showing most voters now disapprove of her tough line in 
the community a gallup poll published saturday in londons daily 
telegraph showed 49 percent of voters questioned disapproved 
compared with 38 percent approval the rest had no opinion 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who combined with mitterrand 
to override mrs thatchers objections to the monetary union 
conference went home wellpleased with having secured backing from 
the summit for eventual german reunification 
it is a sensitive issue in a continent that was overrun by 
hitlers germany in world war ii and in peace is dominated by the 
powerful economy of west germany alone 
britain apparently raised no objections to a statement of 
support for reunification 
but france the netherlands and italy all expressed reservations 
the final statement was agreed to only after kohl spelled out 
that by a reunified germany he meant only the two existing german 
nations east germany and west germany and not germanspeaking 
areas in neighboring countries 
we seek the strengthening of the state of peace in europe in 
which the german people will regain its unity through free 
selfdetermination the statement said 
on monetary integration the community leaders agreed to convene 
an intergovernmental conference in december 1990 to start 
negotiations on establishing a single currency and one system of 
central banks for the 12 countries 
mrs thatcher said britain would go along to the negotiations 
which are expected to take several years but she indicated that 
britain may veto any final attempt to have one currency and the 
central bank system 
she shrugged off being brushed aside on the issue of the 
social charter which is nonbinding it is a pity but 
the outcome is no great tragedy she said 
the community leaders left strasbourg committed to intensified 
dialogue with the soviet union and other reformminded east 
european nations they also pledged to set up a european 
development bank to assist new european democracies and held out 
the possibility of special trade and other links with them 
said kohl we have made a substantial step forward we have 
said there is no alternative to the promise of european 
unification

premier miklos nemeth said sunday his 
government of communist origins is ready to surrender sole power 
and form a coalition with opposition parties but there are no 
takers 
i dont blame them nemeth said commenting on the refusal 
by other parties to share government responsibilities for a 
deteriorating economic situation after decades of communist 
mismanagement 
nemeth emerged from threeday talks between the government 
opposition parties trade unions social organizations and 
parliamentary leaders they were the first in a series meant to 
ensure a peaceful transition to multiparty democracy and avert 
economic collapse 
sundays talks were restricted to government representatives and 
the chairmen of parliamentary committees prior to the december 
session of parliament 
interim house speaker istvan fodor told reporters that most 
participants agreed on the need to bring parliamentary elections 
originally planned for june forward with parliament likely 
debating a motion for them to be held in march 
the second most important item of the talks focused on the 
economy and nemeth said his government took the brunt of 
responsibility for unpopular austerity measures 
but while refusing to share power the other parties have 
expressed a willingness to share in the responsibility because they 
understand that the governments decisions today will have an 
impact on the postelection situation as well nemeth said 
economic belt tightening planned or already in operation 
includes an austerity budget the liquidation of some 50 major 
unprofitable enterpises and the raising of interest rates on 
homepurchase loans 
nemeth warned over the weekend that unemployment officially 
nonexistent in the 1970s and now at 25000 might double or even 
quadruple because of the measures 
expressing his support for early elections nemeth declared 
it is in the funadmental interest of the nation to cut the 
transition period to the shortest possible 
let the masked ball end let us see clearly which party has 
what kind of support 
nemeth was one of the advocates of terminating the communist 
party in october and replacing it with the hungarian socialist 
party that advocates democratic principles in preparation for the 
countrys first free national elections in more than four decades

crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators saying bush wants to keep 
the chinese in the international community 
fighting criticism that the move was a giveaway to the chinese 
government without any improvement in human rights baker insisted 
china still will be asked to make changes before relations can 
return to the way they were before beijing in june crushed student 
protests in and around tiananmen square 
the trip by national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was to seek to improve 
the relationship to the extent that could be done baker said on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley program 
the president deplores the tragedy of tiananmen square 
baker said but hes of the view that we shouldnt run the risk 
of compounding that tragedy by trying to isolate china from the 
international community 
but the trip which was not announced in advance outraged some 
in congress and the domestic political fallout for bush appeared 
to be growing 
the decision to send these two was clearly designed to send a 
powerful symbolic message to the chinese that the united states was 
prepared once again to engage in business as usual with them 
said rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs asia subcommittee 
it reflects once again that the president has been much more 
sensitive to the concerns of the chinese leadership than to the 
aspirations of the chinese people solarz said 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said through a spokesman that bushs timing 
was poor 
at the very time that freedom is sweeping through eastern 
europe we should be sure the united states stands for freedom and 
democracy in asia as well pell said to my mind the 
administration would have been better advised to wait until basic 
human rights were on the way to return in china for students for 
tibetans for all the people before launching such an 
initiative 
bush himself declined comment on the trip after attending a 
church service sunday he told reporters only that well have 
more to say about that later 
at a chinese students federation in washington the mood was 
glum 
i feel confused shocked and sad said lianchao han 
vice president of the independent federation of chinese students 
and scholars the purge is still going on in china and terror is 
spread all over china 
the chinese government hasnt changed the policy at all but 
bush is sending highranking american officials to beijing added 
the chinese student activist it really will help the chinese 
government 
scowcroft and eagleburger flew from beijing to tokyo on sunday 
to discuss both the malta summit and their talks in beijing with 
japanese officials the two were expected back in washington on 
monday afternoon 
a white house official speaking only on condition of anonymity 
acknowledged that the decision to send the two officials to china 
had been closely held white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the chinese had asked that it not be disclosed until scowcroft 
and eagleburger arrived in beijing at 1 am est saturday 
baker said there remains a host of differences between the 
two governments and he noted that trade sanctions against china 
remain in place unless we are willing to talk and try and 
resolve these problems were not going to be able to preserve this 
relationship which is so very important to both countries and to 
move the relationship forward he said 
he said he had spoken with scowcroft and eagleburger after their 
meetings and was quite confident that they were very clear 
with the chinese to raise the human rights concerns that we have 
we make it clear to the chinese that theyre going to have to 
help us if were going to preserve this relationship and be able to 
move it in the direction whence it came 
the situation of chinese dissident fang lizhi who has taken 
refuge in the us embassy since the crackdown was discussed 
baker said but is being worked on and worked on very quietly 
the situation remains a major irritant in uschinese relations 
he said 
the move was a risky one domestically for bush who in recent 
weeks has vetoed two congressional efforts to turn up the heat on 
beijing a state department authorization bill which would have 
formalized and slightly expanded us economic sanctions and a 
bill that would have granted automatic visa extensions to chinese 
students in the united states 
solarz predicted both measures will be passed quickly again 
after congress returns in january with heavy support from 
republicans and said effective control of our china policy is 
going to be passing to the congress inasmuch as the house and 
senate more clearly reflect the will of the american people 
but baker said without efforts to reestablish ties to china an 
important relationship could be lost 
weve made it very clear even in the aftermath of tiananmen 
that as much as we deplored what happened there this is a very 
important relationship in terms of its geopolitical and 
geostrategic importance to the united states and that we wanted to 
try and find ways to preserve it he said 
i dont think the american people would want to see their 
government compound the tragedy that happened in tiananmen square 
and it is our judgment that thats what might happen if we seek 
to isolate china from the rest of the international community

the united states has replaced its 
aircraft carrier force in the persian gulf region with a battleship 
group and iran on sunday called the new vessel a provocation 
the change in forces signals a quiet shift in policy leaving 
the region without a carrier and its airstrike capability for the 
first time since 1986 however the battleship made the first visit 
ever by a major us warship into the persian gulf itself 
saudi arabia has refused to allow the battleship the uss new 
jersey to call at an oil center where 8000 americans live 
the 58000ton new jersey a world war ii vintage ship restored 
to active duty in recent years on saturday received a lowkey but 
warmer welcome at the island state of bahrain which provides 
regular shore facilities for us warships based in the region 
during a onenight stopover its first of two in the gulf local 
dignitaries were treated to a tour of the 887foot ship most of 
its 1500 crew members went ashore for liberty 
but even at bahrain there was no advance publicity concerning 
the first visit ever by a ship of the new jerseys size most 
bahrainis were unaware of the juggernaut anchored about two miles 
offshore 
on sunday the ship left for dubai in the united arab emirates 
the new jersey homeported at long beach calif arrived this 
month to replace the carrier uss midway which had patrolled the 
indian ocean waters just outside the persian gulf since september 
however us officials said the replacement of the carrier 
force did not lessen the american commitment to safeguarding the 
strategic oil waterway where more than 500 commercial vessels were 
destroyed or damaged during the eightyear iraqiran war 
one of the new jerseys first acts on arrival was its 
historymaking foray into the gulf where it was the largest 
warship of any nation to sail through the strait of hormuz said a 
navy spokesman petty officer joseph bartlett 
during the iraqiran war us jet carriers and battleships 
sometimes entered the outer strait but never the gulf itself us 
officials said such a move would serve no purpose but was sure to 
be seen by iran and possibly by arab states as a provocation 
moreover they said such ships would be highly vulnerable to 
terrorist or closerange military attack in the narrow confines of 
the gulf 
by sending the new jersey through the hormuz us officials 
made clear they now consider those risks minimal there have been 
no armed incidents in the gulf since iraq and iran agreed to a 
ceasefire in august 1988 
us spokesmen also said the arrival of the battleship was not 
related to to the recent successful testfiring of a new strategic 
missile by iraq or with iranian naval manuevers which by 
coincidence began over the weekend 
predictably iran condemned the new jerseys arrival as an act 
of aggression even in peacetime 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted deputy parliament 
speaker hossein hashemian as saying the warships visit is aimed 
at provocation and heightening tension and will not augur well 
for the united states 
original plans included a port call at dhahran saudi arabia 
but saudi officials apparently concerned that the highprofile 
ship would attract too much attention rejected the request 
dhahran headquarters of the saudi arabianamerican oil co has 
about 8000 american residents and is often visited by other us 
warships in the gulf 
john berry a us embassy press officer in riyadh confirmed 
that the saudi government had asked that a proposed visit by the 
new jersey be deferred but said any further comment would have 
to come from saudi officials none could be obtained 
most gulf arab states including saudi arabia balance their 
private support for the us military presence in the region with a 
public stance of neutrality and rejection of foreign intrusion 
especially by the major powers 
naval sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said budget 
concerns may have been a factor in replacing the midway with a less 
costly battleship group major olin saunders a spokesman at us 
central command headquarters in tampa fla said the last time the 
united states lacked a carrier in the indian ocean was a fivemonth 
stretch from april to september 1986

nonpartisan runoff also said saturday night that he would file 
monday for the march democratic primary to run for a full term 
lelands term expires at the end of 1990 
washington received 24120 votes or 566 percent while hall 
garnered 18473 or 434 percent according to unofficial results 
leland dtexas was killed aug 7 in a plane crash while on a 
famine relief mission over a remote section of ethiopia 
washington who could move into lelands old office monday said 
he will wait until the state decides the hotly debated workers 
compensation issue which has forced the legislature into its 
second special session 
washington a 17year veteran of the legislature has been a key 
senate supporter of a workers compensation reform bill favored by 
workers and opposed by business 
gov bill clements has said that unless the legislature approves 
a plan by wednesday he will call an automatic extension keeping 
lawmakers in session through the christmas holidays 
hall and washington both democrats emerged as the top 
votegetters from a field of 11 candidates in the nov 7 special

this election seemed to pull them apart they were anxious for a 
new unity in the district 
we will bring this community back together again because we 
are one people said washington 48 
hall 45 told his campaign workers this is a time for coming 
together a time for healing a time for commitment to the things 
that we said we wanted to go to congress for 
if we do that in spite of the results tonight this will 
indeed be a victory for us the people of the 18th congressional 
district hall said 
hall said he is not sure whether he will run for the full term 
i havent even thought about it he said saturday ill 
think about it in the next week or so

years in 1972 the three successfully ran for the state house of 
representatives on a slate of five black houstonians the other two 
candidates were unsuccessful 
hall served in the house until 1978 then took on leland in a 
bitter battle to succeed us rep barbara jordan in the 18th 
district the next year hall was elected to the city council he 
gave up that seat to seek the congressional post

local officials feared they would get the 
usual hohum response to a survey on how the town should react to 
growth so they added a little incentive a shot at winning 250 
its working 
as one of maines fastestgrowing communities raymond was 
required by state law to adopt a comprehensive plan by 1991 the 
population of the town in southern maine has increased 66 percent 
since 1980 to 3500 as it develops into a bedroom community for 
portland 
local officials decided to solicit residents opinions on such 
issues as which areas should be targeted as growth zones and what 
they wanted the town to be like in a decade 
however town officials had had little luck with surveys when 
they tried to find out how people felt about the town getting its 
own police department only 45 residents responded 
and officials acknowledged that the latest questionnaire is 
complex and lengthy and takes about an hour to complete 
someone suggested a lottery to get peoples attention 
at first we thought this was kind of tacky like an insult to 
have a drawing for money when out of the goodness of their hearts 
and civic duty people should respond said chairwoman jackie 
hewitt of the raymond planning committee 
but we knew that in the past this hadnt worked so we decided 
to try a lottery she said 
questionnaires with lottery tickets stapled on were sent out 
in november residents were asked to complete and return the forms 
with half of the lottery ticket attached the winning ticket is to 
be picked in january 
forms are still being accepted but the response rate is already 
26 percent 
committee members chose the 250 figure because they figured it 
would be large enough to attract attention but small enough to 
not lead to lying and cheating and stealing said town manager 
martin krauter 
and by asking residents to pay their own postage to return the 
survey the town is saving 250 
not good enough say critics 
id say 250 doesnt do much for people these days said jim 
phoenix owner of tommys sandwich shop if theyd have made it 
1000 theyd have gotten a lot more responses

chinese dissidents criticized the bush 
administration sunday for resuming highlevel talks with china six 
months after the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators saying 
there can be no compromise on human rights 
i think being a president he should have a good memory 
said wuer kaixi the student leader who fled china after the 
bloody events of june in tiananmen square 
we are seeing the fact that there is a split between congress 
and the bush administration on the issue yan jiaqi chairman of 
the front for a democratic china said through an interpreter 
when we talk about politics we believe a compromise can be made 
but on the question of human rights we dont believe a compromise 
can be made 
the dissidents spoke at the end of a fiveday conference on the 
future of their prodemocracy movement responding to complaints 
that their efforts were disorganized the leaders took 16 steps to 
improve the fdcs internal workings including the structure of 
committees and budgeting yan said 
the dissidents spent eight of their 60 hours of talks discussing 
complaints about wuer the most widely known of the group and 
issued him a warning for making unauthorized comments to the media 
the conference ended as national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger left 
beijing after meeting with top chinese officials scowcroft and 
eagleburger are the first senior us officials to visit china 
since bush imposed sanctions after the attack on chinese students 
last june 
several leading members of congress criticized the timing of the 
us move 
at the very time that freedom is sweeping through eastern 
europe we should be sure the united states stands for freedom and 
democracy in asia as well sen claiborne pell dri chairman

bush recently vetoed a congressional bill that would have 
allowed chinese students to remain in the united states

since america is a democratic country the bush administration 
should respect the will of the people and the will of congress

washington 
the chinese government hasnt changed the policy at all but 
bush is sending highranking american officials to beijing said

militant moslems holding a cabinet ministers daughter appeared 
deadlocked sunday after the abductors demanded the release of two 
more jailed colleagues officials said

talks were continuing but a solution seemed difficult to reach 
they said the kidnappers were now demanding the release of seven 
jailed colleagues in exchange for freeing rubaiya sayeed the 
daughter of home minister mufti mohammed sayeed 
earlier the group had demanded the release of only five 
militants

militants were holding talks on behalf of the government with the 
kashmir liberation front the militant group that claimed 
responsibility for fridays kidnapping in the city of srinagar 
formed in 1965 the front is demanding that northern 
jammukashmir state either become independent or part of moslem 
pakistan 
the front has threatened in a statement released to newspapers 
to kill ms sayeed if the jailed militants are not released by 7 
pm 830 am est monday 
they also threatened to kidnap relatives of police officers if 
the demands were not met 
a police source said commandos of the paramilitary national 
security guard had identified the place where the group was holding 
ms sayeed the source who spoke on condition of anonymity did 
not reveal the location but said the commandos had surrounded the 
area 
chief secretary moosa raza the states top bureaucrat said the

sayeed the countrys first moslem home minister was appointed 
last week by prime minister vp singh a hindu the home minister

government committee to try to end separatist campaigns in 
jammukashmir and neighboring punjab where sikh militants are 
demanding an independent nation

predominantly hindu india with a moslem majority

countries have fought three wars over the territory since they 
gained independence from britain in 1947

north carolinas first wintry storm of the 
season killed seven motorists knocked out power to thousands of 
households and toppled two television towers before moving out to 
sea sunday 
towers for wptftv and wraltv both raleigh stations collapsed 
sunday within a halfhour of each other spokesmen for the stations 
said the towers stand sidebyside in auburn just south of raleigh 
witnesses said it appeared that melting ice destabilized the 
structures wptf estimated the damage to its 2000foot tower at 6 
million and said it could be weeks before the station would be 
broadcasting at full power 
i heard something it sounded like iceand i saw it 
folding up just like an accordion or folding ladder said sue 
williams a resident who lives near the towers 
adjacent to the two a tower for wtvdtv of durham was left 
leaning to one side under the weight of the ice 
the storm blew in friday dumping several inches of snow in the 
states northern mountains and began crawling across north 
carolina spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice 
the ice wreaked havoc on the states electrical lines which 
broke under the weight of ice and falling tree limbs 
this is one of the most severe storms we have had in some 
areas in roanoke rapids there are probably three possibly four 
inches of ice its not snow its ice said north carolina power 
spokesman randy shillingburg 
shillingburg said 9500 of the utilitys 90000 customers 
remained without electricity sunday most of them in the 
williamston and ahoskie areas and in rural areas adjacent to 
roanoke rapids 
some households and businesses had been without light or heat 
nearly 24 hours he said 
duke power co said 10000 charlottearea customers were 
temporarily without power 
carolina power and light co spokesman wayne ennis said 3600 of 
the utilitys customers remained without electricity sunday 
morning mostly in the fayetteville henderson and warrenton areas 
utility officials said ice is more troublesome than snow 
weve got dozens of strands of wire down hundreds of trees 
and tree limbs you could liken the damage as a result of an ice 
storm to more like a hurricane or tornado than anything else 
shillingburg said 
police across the state reported hundreds of traffic accidents 
at least seven of them fatal as cars slid on streets that 
resembled iceskating rinks four motorists were killd saturday and

tens of thousands of demonstrators on sunday 
demanded more democratic reform in east germany and a staterun 
union called for an end to a 40yearold policy that forbids 
strikes 
gregor gysi east germanys new communist party chief said he 
wants a clear separation of party and government functions a 
radical concept in a country where the party has been allpowerful 
for 40 years 
in another development the four world war ii allies france 
britain the united states and the soviet union announced they 
would meet monday to discuss the role of berlin in eastwest 
affairs 
tens of thousands of east germans took to the streets in 
demonstrations in rostock erfurt and six other cities the 
official news agency adn said the protesters were demanding 
democratic reforms and respect for human rights the agency said 
in the southern city of plauen about 15000 demonstrators 
turned out for a prodemocracy rally called by the new forum 
opposition group 
several hundred people in east berlin demonstrated for human 
rights and against what they see as growing intolerance of 
foreigners 
hartmut krausse a member of new forum told 15000 people in 
the southern city of ilmenau that talk of anarchy chaos and 
violence was out of place 
rather we should be talking about democratic reform on the 
basis of new elections krausse told the cheering crowd 
in the face of such protests the communist party has ousted its 
hardline leaders lifted travel restrictions opened the berlin 
wall and abandoned its constitutionally guaranteed hold on power 
all in the last three months 
leaders of the 160000member scientists union meeting on 
saturday in leipzig issued the call for recognition of the right 
to strike adn said 
the scientists union is one of 16 unions belonging to the 
staterun labor federation freier deutsche gewerskschaftsbund 
the scientists call amounts to a demand for the federation 
leadership to recognize the right to strike embodied in the east 
german constitution 
since 1949 the 86million member federation has rejected the 
right to strike arguing that since the nations businesses are 
owned by the people any strike would be against the people 
themselves 
the federation has been rocked by a growing financial scandal 
and a new leadership took over saturday to make it more independent 
the prospect of strikes clearly alarmed gysi 41 who took over 
as party chief only on saturday in an interview broadcast late 
saturday night on west germanys adr television network he said 
that given the countrys current political instability strikes 
would be irresponsible 
gysi spent sunday preparing for next weekends continuation of 
the emergency party congress that is expected to give the party a 
new name 
late sunday the official news agency adn said soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev had sent gysi a message of congratulations 
that also emphasized the sovereign nature of east germany 
gorbachev whose soviet reform movement prompted the prodemocracy 
revolution in the east bloc recently joined with east german 
leaders in rejecting german reunification a possibility that has 
been debated since the reform movement began transforming east 
germany 
east germany faces its first free elections in may and party 
leaders have said they would be happy to receive 20 percent of the 
vote 
in the interview gysi said he was urging a strict division of 
party and government but he added this cant be done in one 
day it is a longterm job that is being taken very seriously 
such separation would be a striking change in east germany 
where despite recent democratic reforms party members still hold 
most of the important positions in the country 
the government already has begun stripping some of the 
communists influence for example it disarmed the partys private 
militia that had been based in the nations factories but the 
government would have to assert itself much more to be considered 
an equal player with the communist party 
the communists also say they see themselves as one party among 
several political forces in east germany following two months of 
upheaval that started with the downfall of hardline ruler erich 
honecker

the world war ii allies france britain 
the united states and the soviet union will hold a major 
conference monday to discuss the role of divided berlin in 
eastwest affairs 
it will be the first such four power conference since the 1971 
meeting that drew up an agreement on the allies rights in the city 
a joint statement issued sunday said ambassadors from the four 
nations will discuss what the united states calls the berlin 
initiative 
it said the soviet government informed the three western allies 
on friday that moscow was prepared to discuss this initiative 
the initiative outlined by thenpresident ronald reagan during 
a visit to west berlin in 1987 calls for making berlin a center 
for international conferences and youth exchanges it also suggests 
improving air traffic to the city and that berlin be considered as 
the site for olympic games 
londons sunday telegraph said the convening of the 
conference is a direct result of mrs prime minister margaret 
thatchers goslow policy on the possible reunification of 
germany 
the four powers meeting is seen by british officials as 
another way to put a necessary brake on the moves towards 
reunification it added 
but allied sources speaking to the associated press on the 
condition of anonymity discounted the report without elaborating 
they said the conference would be held at the allied headquarters 
building in west berlin 
west germanys zdf television network said the future of berlin 
as well as east and west germany probably would be discussed 
apparently neither the west german government nor the west 
berlin government was notified in advance it said the 
assertion that air traffic is likely to be the main point of 
discussions is hardly believable 
zdf said one reason for the meeting probably is the fear that 
the coming together of the two german states could get out of 
control and the status quo in europe change overnight 
berlin has become the center of intense speculation following 
east germanys nov 9 decision to let its citizens travel freely to 
the west west berlin leaders said that action calls for a revision 
of the citys role 
secretary of state james a baker iii was scheduled to arrive in 
west berlin late monday but it was not known here if his visit was 
linked to the conference 
in the 1971 four power pact the soviets agreed to allow 
unhindered air rail and automobile traffic between west germany 
and west berlin the agreement also cleared the way for closer ties 
between west berlin and west germany and spelled out the rights of 
the four allies 
berlin is 100 miles inside east german territory 
west berlin mayor walter momper has said the crush of visitors 
and resettlers from east germany has overwhelmed the city 
government 
prodemocracy reforms in east germany have caused political 
upheaval that some people fear could lead to violence 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher in a speech 
sunday in saarbruecken called on east germans to maintain their 
responsibility and restraint 
in the east german city of dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer 
said trouble could come from both the extreme right and extreme 
leftviolence has not been dispelled he told reporters an 
escalation is possible at any moment

airport when a welldressed woman walked in wished everyone a 
happy holiday and started passing out 100 50 and 20 bills to 
patrons 
judy kelly of boston said she was driving across the country 
competing against 40 or 50 other people in a national treasure 
hunt that required her to give money away according to a truck 
driver at the bar who asked to remain anonymous 
but the generosity seemed suspicious to tavern owners who 
called police officers questioned the woman and took her to a 
local mental health center for an evaluation but did not arrest 
her police said 
you might call her eccentric said tom tandaric one of the 
officers who questioned the woman 
ms kelly stopped saturday afternoon at the carlton midway motor 
lounge on the citys southwest side walked in and promptly passed 
out three 100 bills to three midway airlines employees sitting at 
a table witnesses said 
merry christmas she said to the confused trio 
she pulled the cash from a brown paper bag in her purse when 
she ran out of 100 bills she apologized and gave out 50s when 
she ran out of those she apologized and gave out 20s 
by one estimate she gave away 5000 the chicago suntimes 
reported in sunday editions 
the bills just have pictures of dead men the newspaper 
quoted ms kelly as saying everybody left in better spirits 
the bar filled as word spread waitresses called friends and 
flight attendants from nearby midway airport rushed back to tell 
coworkers 
all tried politely to make the acquaintance of ms kelly who 
appeared to be in her mid50s 
they were all coming up and playing stupid like they didnt 
know what was going on said jose gallegos 21 an employee of a 
neighboring rental car agency who had to give ms kelly a kiss in 
return for his 100 
ms kelly gave 100 to the truck driver and another 50 to his 
dog she gave 100 to a young woman with two children and when she 
heard the woman wanted to leave an abusive boyfriend she added 
another 400 
police arrived when ms kelly was down to 10 bills they 
escorted her into a back room and asked why she was passing out 
money 
just to do it she replied 
when one officer advised her to save a few dollars for a rainy 
day she replied that she had a substantial bankbook and could wire 
for more 
at the local police station officer burleigh ginkel said sunday 
that police did not arrest the woman its not against the law to 
give money away he said 
however another officer at the station who would not give his 
name said police took ms kelly to the bobby wright comprehensive 
community mental health center 
a man who identified himself as an evaluator at the mental 
health center said ms kelly was brought in by the police and 
evaluated saturday night the man refused to give his name or 
comment on the result of the evaluation he said the woman left 
with police 
both officers at the local station said they did not have a 
report on the incident and did not have any knowledge of a national 
giveaway competition they said the officers who questioned the 
woman saturday would not be on duty until late sunday 
sally mascorro a front desk clerk at the motel said ms kelly 
checked out early sunday morning but her car was still in the 
parking lot 
although it was unclear what happened to the woman she left 
behind some good cheer 
its like miracle on 34th street waitress maria cross 
said referring to the classic movie starring natalie wood it

leader resigned after swearing in the new government which 
includes two men who were persecuted as dissidents until just two 
weeks ago 
in a key compromise the interior ministry which runs the 
nations hated secret and uniformed police will be run by a 
leading dissident the new communist premier and a communist party 
member proposed by the opposition 
the new 21member government contains 10 communists two of whom 
enjoy opposition support seven nonparty members and two members 
each from the small socialist and peoples parties which recently 
broke ties with the communists 
more than 100000 people crammed pragues wenceslas square to 
hear opposition leader vaclav havel 53 and other dissidents who 
battled jail and harassment for 13 years catalogue the successes of 
their fight for democracy 
the embattled communists have granted stunning concessions 
including the opening of borders the promise of free elections and 
the elimination of their monopoly on power 
elsewhere in eastern europe sunday 
more than 50000 people chanting democracy rallied in 
sofia bulgaria in the biggest demonstration for reform since the 
communists consolidated power there 43 years ago 
tens of thousands of east germans rallied in several cities in 
support of further democratic reforms the new east german 
communist party chief said he wants a clear separation of party and 
government functions 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warned communist party 
leaders in moscow that their colleagues fall from power in eastern 
europe proves they must quickly solve soviet domestic problems or 
face similar excesses 
czechoslovakias parliament meets tuesday to pick husaks 
successor and both havel and alexander dubcek 68 the popular 
leader of the crushed 1968 reform movement have said they would 
accept the post if nominated 
we havent won yet havel told the cheering crowd in a 
nationally televised speech but it is a great success giving us 
great hope this is a success for all of us both our nations 
without this spontaneous awakening this success would not have 
been achieved 
this peaceful revolution was against violence dirt 
mafias privileges persecutions havel said let us preserve 
its purity peacefulness love and merry friendly flair 
the yearslong deadly silence of a humiliated people has been 
drowned out by a multivoiced popular choir he said 
referring to the police crackdown on students nov 17 that 
energized the nations prodemocracy movement he said after an 
artificial halt history began moving with breathtaking speed which 
surprised all of us one day historians will study this and tell 
us what happened 
the crowd burst into applause and cheers as havel listed the 
achievements of the civic forum opposition movement and its slovak 
counterpart public against violence which were formed only on 
nov 19 
one hour earlier husak the man responsible for the 21 years of 
repression and stagnation that followed the warsaw pact invasion 
that crushed the 1968 prague spring reforms swore in the new 
government of national understanding the opposition had 
demanded 
the 76yearold hardline leader who ended up conducting the 
ceremony on international human rights day then resigned as he 
had promised to do 
the government he installed includes men he jailed or stripped 
of all but the most menial jobs when he was communist party chief 
from 1969 to 1987 
the new cabinet ministers includes jiri dienstbier who was 
jailed with havel from 1979 to 1982 for battling for human rights 
and jan carnogursky a slovak lawyer and roman catholic activist 
freed from jail only two weeks ago dienstbier became foreign 
minister and carnogursky a first vice premier

the interior ministry will be run by the new premier marian calfa 
first vice premier valtr komarek a communist party member proposed 
by the opposition and carnogursky 
parliament which meets tuesday has two weeks to choose a new 
president 
if the premier remains calfa a slovak the new president should 
be a czech according to tradition but calfa who is viewed as a 
weak caretaker premier said it had not yet been decided who would 
be president and that if a slovak was chosen a czech would become 
premier 
he told a news conference that a prime objective of the new 
government was to pave the way for new elections which he said 
could be held by july 
the opposition backs havel to take over arguing that he is an 
untainted symbol of national unity the 100000 people cramming 
wenceslas square on sunday also expressed support for the 
internationally renowned playwright

all the other hardliners responsible for the post1968 crackdown 
lost their seats on the ruling politburo later they gave up all 
their other positions of power

thencommunist premier ladislav adamec named a 21man cabinet that 
contained only five noncommunists and left his party dominating 
all key ministries 
hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets the next day 
to back an opposition call for a general strike if a new cabinet 
was not named by sunday

chanting abortionrights and aids activists lay 
down in the aisles of st patricks cathedral sunday forcing 
cardinal john j oconnor to interrupt his sermon while police 
carried protesters out on stretchers 
more than 4500 demonstrators marched outside along a stretch 
of fifth avenue normally crowded with shoppers and sightseers 
chanting teach safe sex and just say no is not enough 
police said 111 people were arrested 
gay activists have staged a variety of actions at st patricks 
since 1987 when oconnor barred a gay roman catholic group 
dignity from using church facilities for meetings 
church officials anticipating the wellpublicized 
demonstration took the unusual step of clearing the church after 
the 9 am mass then searching the bags of everyone entering for 
the 1015 am mass 
the cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after mass 
started said archdiocese spokesman joe zwilling police were 
stationed all around the massive cathedral including at the rail 
in front of the altar 
police said 43 people were arrested inside the packed cathedral 
when they jumped from their seats near the start of oconnors 
homily and stretched out in the center aisle some chaining 
themselves to pews 
oconnor was forced to distribute copies of his sermon rather 
than read it and he asked the congregation to stand and join him 
in reciting prayers to drown out protesters chants 
he continued the mass while dozens of uniformed and plainclothes 
police walked up and down the aisle ferrying the protesters out on 
bright orange stretchers 
police sgt peter sweeney said 68 were arrested outside where 
protesters marched with signs such as curb your dogma and 
pope john paul for ayatollah 
in 1988 two months after 11 silent protesters were arrested 
inside the cathedral a state judge issued an injunction barring 
demonstrations inside 
those arrested sunday were charged with disorderly conduct and 
trespassing sweeney said some also were charged with resisting 
arrest 
the protest was organized by the aids coalition to unleash 
power or act up and womens health action and mobilization or 
wham 
act up and wham both have a history of forceful loud 
demonstrations organizer victor mendolia said we demand to 
bring our issues to the cardinal directly and thats what we did 
they criticized oconnor for his opposition to abortion and his 
vocal support of operation rescue a group that stages blockades 
and sitins at abortion clinics nationwide for lobbying against 
education about safer sex and condoms especially in schools and 
for his opposition to gay rights legislation 
at the end of the mass oconnor praised the congregants for 
showing restraint and said the protest left him anguished 
the archbishop of new york must of course always preach what 
the church preaches teach what the church teaches oconnor 
said i cannot believe that anyone even those who hate what the 
church teaches would respect me for a moment if i taught anything 
else

the archbishop of san salvador 
on sunday accused us federal agents of brainwashing and 
blackmailing a witness in the case involving the massacre of six 
jesuit priests 
monsignor arturo rivera damas the highest roman catholic 
authority in el salvador denounced the alleged fbi coercion of 
lucia barrera de cerna 
us ambassador william walker said the accusations by rivera 
damas were incorrect 
the archbishop in his sunday homily said that mrs cerna who 
was flown to the united states after it was believed she was 
possibly the only witness in the case was subjected to 
aggressive and violent interrogation 
mrs cerna a cleaning woman at the jose simeon canas central 
american university was flown to miami on nov 23 and placed under 
the protection of us federal agents 
mrs cerna had testified in a salvadoran criminal court that 
before dawn on nov 16 she saw men in army uniforms enter the 
campus residence of the six priests shortly before shots were heard 
and the bodies found 
the slayings of the priests all involved in education came 
during a major offensive by leftist guerrillas also killed were a 
servant and her daughter 
the killings brought outrage in the united states and elsewhere 
some human rights groups and others have blamed rightwing military 
death squads for the killings 
several us congressmen called for a reappraisal of american 
aid to president alfredo cristianis rightwing government 
cristiani on friday offered a 250000 reward for information 
leading to the prosecution and conviction of the jesuits killers 
at a new conference he asserted that mrs cernas original 
testimony was false and she had been discredited as a witness 
sources close to the us investigation who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said mrs cerna was given six liedetector tests in 
three days at the fbi offices in miami provided three different 
versions of events and failed all six tests 
rivera damas said in his homily 
instead of being protected as was promised by the us 
embassy in el salvador the witness lucia barrera de cerna was 
subjected in that country to an authentic brainwashing and to the 
blackmail that she would be deported if she did not tell the truth 
according to the jesuits lawyer scott greathead the 
interrogation to which mrs cerna was subjected was aggressive and 
violent after this psychological torment mrs cerna vacillated 
and retracted what she had said in el salvador but fortunately 
once again free from the pressure of her protectors she has 
returned to the hallways of truth 
in a briefing for several foreign correspondents on friday 
walker asked why does anyone think we would go to all this 
trouble just to discredit her mrs cerna 
we think our salvador policy is in danger if this case is 
not resolved he said fredy cristiani is also very aware 
that his political future is in danger if the case is not 
resolved 
walker issued a statement sunday saying i am saddened that 
the archbishop does not believe that the united states government 
and he are in the same quest for the truth of what happened to and 
who was responsible for the slayings 
from the moment that this outrage occurred there have been a 
great many misinformed and unsubstantiated statements offered by 
persons in positions of authority the version that was provided to 
the archbishop is incorrect it said 
however the rev jose maria tojeira the head of the jesuits 
society of jesus for central america told the associated press 
the witness was in the hands of the fbi for several days and we 
have very serious evidence that she was mistreated personally i 
think she was psychologically tortured 
he said the society of jesus would protest the treatment of mrs 
cerna 
some rightwing militants in el salvador accuse the jesuits of 
aiding the leftist rebels

any effort to rush the reunification of east 
and west germany would risk instability and violence secretary of 
state james a baker iii said sunday before leaving for urgent 
talks with allied leaders on the rapid changes sweeping the 
communist east 
if it happens too abruptly you run a greater risk that it 
might not happen peacefully baker said 
speaking on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley baker also predicted an increasing emphasis on the 
political aspect of the nato alliance as its military might becomes 
less important in the new atmosphere but he said there is no 
danger that us forces will pull out entirely 
political uncertainty in east germany tends a bit could tend 
toward instability baker said weve made it clear all along 
in this process that we do not seek to take unilateral advantage of 
whats going on there at the expense of the soviet union and we 
want the process to continue to unfold in a stable way 
in an interview on the cbstv program face the nation 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze voiced his own concerns 
about a reunified germany the security of postwar europe has been 
built on the assumption of a divided germany he said and that 
structure will not be changed easily 
is it right is it appropriate that the germans would like to 
have a unified state i think thats logical he said through an 
interpreter but what would be the circumstances in what kind 
of europe those are the kinds of questions that should be 
answered 
in the meantime it is reasonable to expect a certain 
rapprochement between east and west germany based on treaties and 
agreements part of an overall process of political legal and 
economic integration sweeping europe that will lead eventually to a 
disbanding of military alliances 
this process should not be in any way interfered with 
shevardnadze said it should not be slowed down 
during his trip baker plans to visit the berlin wall and to 
make a foreign policy speech to the berlin press club 
the sixday trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful winter 
meeting with the foreign ministers of the 15 nato countries in 
brussels the headquarters of the western alliance 
but a sequence of political upheavals in east germany and 
czechoslovakia following the sharp detour from orthodox communism 
in poland and hungary caused baker to consult with his western 
partners in an atmosphere of uncertainty 
they will try to figure out whether soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting in 
east germany and the abolition of the communist partys monopoly of 
power in the soviet republic of lithuania 
managing economic aid for poland and hungary and pondering the 
future of nato as a military alliance as eastwest tensions recede 
are also on bakers agenda in brussels 
baker said more us aid likely will flow to other east bloc 
countries as they establish democracies and political pluralism and 
adopt freemarket economies 
then there is the overriding issue of german reunification and a 
sharp warning recently from moscow that the plan set forth by west 
german chancellor helmut kohl and praised by the state department 
was fraught with dangerous consequences 
french president francois mitterrand also has cautioned west 
germany not to push for reunification with east germany saying it 
could upset the delicate balance in europe 
other us allies also are known to be nervous about the 
prospect of a reunited and mighty germany even though they are not 
as outspoken as the french leader their concerns are partly rooted 
in the devastation of europe at the hands of the germans in world 
war ii 
baker had planned to travel to bonn to meet with kohl but 
instead will meet with kohl in berlin tuesday baker will join 
president bush in a meeting with mitterrand in the caribbean island 
of st martin on saturday 
they of course will want to know if reports that baker thinks 
kohl moved too fast are accurate 
the bush administration has deferred most decisions on german 
reunification to the west europeans but the allies would not want 
to get out of step with the united states 
baker begins his trip with a visit to london and meetings with 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and foreign secretary 
douglas hurd 
the stop was a lastminute addition and is designed primarily 
to straighten out a squabble with the closest us ally 
at a nato meeting last monday with mrs thatcher and other 
allied leaders bush proposed an intensified effort toward the 
political integration of western europe 
mrs thatcher has had doubts even about the current pace 
bakers visit follows moves by bush and brent scowcroft the us 
national security adviser to placate the british leader and assure 
her the special relationship between washington and london is 
intact

president bush gained more respect for 
mikhail s gorbachev at the malta summit and thinks he can trust 
the soviet leader bush said in interviews released sunday 
gorbachev is up against some tremendous problems and is 
determined to solve them bush told newsweek magazine 
asked if his view of gorbachev had changed bush replied 
there is certainly an element of respect for the way he has 
managed the change in eastern europe and his determination to 
fight for perestroika reform at home i have more respect for him 
than i did back when he first came into office back when i first 
met him or when i saw him last year 
perestroika the russian word for restructuring is shorthand 
for the economic changes that gorbachev is pushing to revive the 
ailing soviet economy 
i think i can trust gorbachev bush said in an interview in 
time magazine i looked him in the eye i appraised him he was 
very determined yet there was a twinkle he is a guy quite sure of 
what he is doing he has got a political feel i could tell by the 
way he was laughing with us a little wink now and then i had 
the feeling that i could bring up any subject at all 
i told him that i never had favored this kind of meeting 
before but that i had changed my mind i am going to keep the 
personal part of this going ill find ways to contact him in a 
quiet fashion i can write i can call now im not going to become 
a pen pal but we can communicate 
in the newsweek interview the president said malta showed that 
gorbachev is firmly in control and determined to see 
perestroika succeed 
gorbachev is absolutely dedicated to it and determined to see 
it succeed no matter how tremendous the problems are inside the 
soviet union and how unpredictable the changes outside the soviet 
union bush said 
asked if gorbachev felt threatened by the prospect of german 
reunification bush replied i think he is very much concerned 
about borders the president added that he told gorbachev as 
far as the united states goes we were not going to be advocating 
border changes 
both interviews took place last week and appeared in the 
magazines dec 18 issues advance copies were released sunday

boeing co scientists engineers and technical 
workers booed their unions president sunday at a meeting on 
contract offers that are smaller than production workers won in a 
48day strike 
take a stand several in the crowd of 2000 to 3000 shouted 
when charles bofferding president of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association said negotiators had made no 
recommendation on how they should vote on the proposed contracts 
ballots were mailed to 17593 union members on friday with a 
vote count scheduled for dec 18 
the meeting at the seattle center coliseum took place late 
sunday afternoon less than three weeks after settlement of the 
strike by the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers the longest strike against the worlds largest commercial 
jet builder in 41 years 
in another development sunday boeing helicopters union workers 
ratified a contract similar to that accepted by the machinists the 
company said in a statement 
the pact covering about 3000 united aerospace workers local 
1069 workers at the boeing co division outside philadelphia is 
retroactive to oct 5 when the old contract was set to expire 
before being extended daytoday as talks continued 
the statement did not give a ratification vote union officials 
could not be reached at their headquarters 
speea which claims to be the largest outside the aflcio 
representing engineers and technicians has never called a walkout 
and has no strike fund but many at the meeting carried signs 
calling for members to reject the contract and authorize a strike 
one banner read thanks ebeneezer 
the booing got loudest when bofferding spoke 
quite honestly it is the wage proposal that keeps us from 
recommending this contract he said it is everything else that 
keeps us from recommending against it 
daniel m mahoney the unions general counsel said before the 
meeting that the bargaining team had determined that speea members 
are literate and well educated and could decide for themselves 
how to vote 
one threeyear offer covers 15245 scientists and engineers and 
the other is for 12796 technical support workers 
engineers and scientists with average pay of nearly 40000 a 
year would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity bonus 
of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no further 
increases 
technicians with average pay of about 28000 would get annual 
wage increases of 3 percent 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of 
10 percent 5 percent and 4 percent 
in his 14 years with the union mahoney said the last time he 
could remember a recommendation to reject a contract was in 1980 
and it was approved anyway he also said neither side expected a 
strike this time 
members also are voting on whether to authorize union leaders to 
call a walkout so they could reject one or both offers without 
granting strike authorization leaving leadership in a quandary 
mahoney said 
thats a definite possibility he said weve kicked that 
around a lot 
boeing officials have expressed satisfaction that the offers 
announced dec 1 are going to a vote and say they expect approval 
the machinists settled for a threeyear contract with wage 
increases of 4 3 and 3 percent bonuses of 10 5 and 4 percent of 
gross pay and an improvement in the costofliving formula from 
about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent the bonus 
package represented an 8 percent increase over boeings last 
prestrike offer 
the machinists represent about 57800 boeing workers

a congressional panel charged sunday that the 
federal government has failed to report evidence of the relative 
safety of abortions for women 
a report released by a house committee also claimed the federal 
centers for disease control has censored research on abortion and 
urged the department of health and human services to assure public 
health research is not affected by political judgments 
it also recommended increased federal support for contraceptive 
research to help decrease the 15 million abortions obtained by 
american women every year 
this report provides important evidence of the relative safety 
of abortion for women since more than 90 percent of abortions 
performed in the us are much safer than pregnancy and childbirth 
and even the most dangerous types of legal abortions are equal in 
risk to carrying a pregnancy to term said rep ted weiss dny

americas 1988 drought captured attention 
everywhere but especially in washington where politicians pushed 
through the largest disaster relief measure in us history the 
associated press went back to track where the 39 billion went and 
found the money spread far beyond the drought 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the record 39 billion drought relief program of 1988 hailed 
as salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell 
became much more an unexpected electionyear windfall for 
thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for natures 
normal quirks 
an associated press study conducted over seven months found the 
drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from 
haildamaged kiwi fruit in california to heatstressed radicchio in 
massachusetts rainbloated tomatoes in new jersey and washedout 
bird seed in colorado 
payments went far beyond the initial intent to save midwestern 
grain growers from bankruptcy an effort supported by almost 
everyone that simply grew and grew and grew 
at each step the program was broadened congress began with a 
bill to aid drought victims the lawmakers added hail to the relief 
package then floods 
next came heat an addition from the agriculture department 
by the time checks were being written at the county level the 
ap found fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal 
agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils 
as insects sand wind cold and fungus even ineffective 
herbicide 
none of those conditions should have been ruled eligible 
administrators in washington say nothing in federal procedures 
however requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for 
routine approval or checking 
by the end of this october about onequarter of all us 
farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and 
just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states the taxpayers 
tab ran to 39 billion 
we lucked out last year on account of the boys up north 
said travis turnipseed a levelland texas cotton farmer whos had 
hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years but collected cash for the 
first time in 1988 
loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major 
reasons for the government generosity the ap found by examining 
federal records in 14 states through the freedom of information act 
the politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought 
received a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of 
shriveled cornstalks and cracked dusty fields played key roles 
in rushing through the nations largest ever disaster relief 
measure 
being an election year there were a lot of concessions to 
farmers said dan otto a professor at iowa state university 
the politicians were trying to get recognized as a friend of 
agriculture 
in the end drought relief became a onetime bonus for thousands 
of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed 
good crops at higher prices and wouldnt have qualified as disaster 
areas including parts of california arizona new mexico texas 
oklahoma maryland and new jersey 
although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility 
requirements exceeding the allowed gross annual income for 
example their requests for aid were approved anyway by local 
officials most farmers simply took advantage of a generous 
program as tough as farming is theyd be fools not to take what 
was offered they said 
it was there so i took it said melvin przilas a wheat and 
corn farmer in the texas panhandle who collected 2254 because 
hail and russian wheat aphids damaged his 1265acre irrigated 
farm which grosses 300000 to 400000 a year 
government officials say they did the best they could with a 
rushed program loopholes were tightened in 1989s smaller 1 
billion drought relief program 
some farmers just got grandfathered in thats true said 
dan shaw deputy administrator of the agricultural stabilization 
and conservation service which administers payment programs for 
the agriculture department what percentage we dont know but 
that is part of the beast i guess that was created whenever you do 
this for the whole nation there are some people that luck out 
the ap found some farmers who did better than just luck out 
those growers profited by tripledipping reaping crop 
insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops then replanting 
the same ground for a successful harvest all perfectly legal 
under the 1988 program 
disaster payments in several states also went to banks 
corporations investment firms churches and even local governments 
such as the city of littlefield texas despite regulations 
designed to match benefits to small farmers 
in several cases corporations ineligible for drought relief 
because of the bills 2 million cutoff on gross annual income 
collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm 
santa fe pacific co the railroad giant with annual revenue of 
3 billion received a check through its energy division the 
american cancer society got a check as did a unit of texas aampm 
university and the midatlantic headquarters in baltimore of the 
jesuit order 
pryslak farms of great meadows nj a 9 millionayear 
produce garden and truck farming operation collected 100000 for 
losses on endive escarole and leaf lettuce because the local 
agriculture department official said he thought the 2 million 
ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation 
wrong say washington officials the ceiling applies to revenue 
from all operations 
despite all the apparent misapplications of aid the program did 
provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought 
in north dakota the hardesthit state farmers lost an 
estimated 11 billion to the drought but direct federal aid cut 
that by 36 percent to 706 million in iowa the aid calculated by 
the federal government at 335 million went a long way state 
agriculture secretary dale cochran said 
without that money it would have meant substantially more 
losses to main street cochran said drought legislation saved 
businesses from having to close their doors 
to examine the program the ap interviewed agriculture experts 
in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought 
payments were matched county by county in a computer database from 
those results the ap selected 120 counties for further study 
farm entitlement reports the ascs summaries of individual 
farms participation in the program were requested for about 
12000 farms in those counties under the freedom of information act 
because much of the ascs paperwork never leaves the counties 
reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to 
examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific 
farmers also available under the foia 
one such farmer was don gresham who raises cotton on 4000 
acres near levelland gresham readily offers that he and his son 
operate their farms under five different names precisely because of 
federal payment limitations in the case of drought aid 100000 
per farmer 
because of hail damage gresham and his companies collected 
248662 from the drought program plus 159478 from federal crop 
insurance and he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with 
milo and made a good crop 
according to government program formulas gresham grossed nearly 
100000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully 
ill be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for 
me gresham said you cant farm without the government you 
play their game
