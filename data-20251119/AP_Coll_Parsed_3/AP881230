other labor leaders shun eric hammond and 
he rivals margaret thatcher as a hate figure for the left but many 
see the maverick union boss as a natural product of the prime 
ministers age of enterprise 
hammond is the polecat of organized labor particularly since his 
electricians union was expelled from the national labor federation 
and he appears to enjoy the role 
his eyes twinkle as he lauds laws that have emasculated the 
oncemighty labor movement since mrs thatcher and her conservative 
party won power in 1979 
im only halfjoking when i say well be erecting statues to 
the tories before the end of the century he said why because 
they will have saved the trade union movement from itself 
labor legislation in the thatcher decade has outlawed sympathy 
walkouts forced secretballot membership votes before strikes are 
called and empowered employers to sue unions for damages resulting 
from illegal strikes 
a revolution was wrought in british working practices and 
hammonds 360000member electrical electronic telecommunication 
and plumbing union joined it 
in his office at the unions elegant headquarters a converted 
mansion in commuter country 10 miles from london hammond continues 
the unionbaiting that got him banished from the trades union 
congress the 9 millionmember british labor federation 
he is accused of splitting organized labor making cozy nostrike 
deals with employers invading the territory of other unions and 
through a 1986 deal with publisher rupert murdoch to run his 
hightechnology presses breaking the power of newspaper production 
unions 
hammond 59 is a sharp contrast and constant provocation to 
leftwing leaders of old traditional unions arthur scargill and 
his national union of mineworkers for instance and the huge 
transport and general workers union with its 1250000 members 
hard times have been forced upon the unions and the way eric 
hammond has tried to solve this is through sweetheart deals with 
employers said andrew murray an official of the transport union 
a strike is always a weapon of last resort the question is 
whether union officials have the right to surrender that resort 
in september the trades union congress expelled hammonds 
electricians for refusing to abandon singleunion nostrike deals 
with a japanese electronics company in wales and a british food 
chain 
hammond unrepentant delivered his credo in a final speech to 
the federations annual conference and walked out before the 
expulsion vote was taken 
our members he thundered reveal an enthusiasm for the 
market system and its values and infuriate the sherryparty 
revolutionaries with their model resolutions and conferencehall 
rhetoric 
he is negotiating a merger with the amalgamated engineering 
union which has 800000 members and is the nations second largest 
after the transport workers 
if that goes through next year the trades union congress must 
either take the electricians back in their new form or risk the 
emergence of a rival federation of the highestskilled workers 
although hammond is isolated at least for now he sees himself 
as the smart kid on the block the adapter to modern realities in a 
bleak time for organized labor 
membership in unions belonging to the trades union congress has 
declined from nearly 13 million to under 9 million since 1979 
nearly 50 percent of british workers belonged to unions then but 
only 35 percent do now 
hammonds background is impeccably working class he is the son 
of a papermill timekeeper grew up in a modest home at gravesend 
20 miles east of london and became an apprentice electrician at 16 
he began as a leftist he said but moved right 
communists took over the union but were kicked out in a 1962 
ballotrigging scandal and the right has controlled it since frank 
chapple hammonds cockney predecessor was the scourge of the left 
in the socialist labor party which unions founded and finance 
chapple now a life peer sitting in the nonelected house of 
lords warned his many enemies in the tredes union congress when he 
retired four years ago you think im rightwing wait till you 
see eric 
experience bore him out 
hammond has excoriated the london labor party for as he put it 
consorting with terrorists lesbians and other queer folk 
he has pushed singleunion deals with or without nostrike 
clauses that stipulate binding arbritration 
unions have made more than 30 such arrangements mainly with 
japanese electronic companies often after several unions vie to 
offer managers the most attractive package 
hammonds alliance with murdoch revolutionized the newspaper 
industry in less than two years when murdoch fired 5000 production 
workers in january 1986 for striking against new hightech 
machinery hammond and his electricians moved in to run the presses 
with the production unions vanquished the rest of the national 
newspaper industry quickly followed suit 
the other unions were demanding jobs for life and murdoch 
said get lost hammond said in the interview i dont see how 
we could have acted any differently 
these deals are what our members want and thats what its all 
about membership were operating in a tough environment

a nation known for its squeamishness about sex is 
paying for its prudishness with rampant divorce and abortions and 
an increasingly frustrated and puzzled populace a soviet sex expert 
says 
despite a spirit of openness and a freer discussion of once 
sensitive subjects philosopher igor s kon believes the soviets 
desperately need to engage in some frank banter about the boudoir 
things that newspapers in the west already are writing about 
and which even have become sensations arent even known by 
specialists here said the 60yearold doctor of philosophy 
although the social chill on discussing sex is thawing a bit sex 
is still a taboo topic in a country known for its puritanism where 
even the russian language lacks a polite word for love making 
on a recent televised discussion between panels of soviet and 
us students the americans spoke freely about the problems of 
teenage pregnancy and other sexrelated subjects 
but when an american asked whether there were similar woes in the 
soviet union the halfjoking answer was we dont have sex 
evidence points to the contrary in this nation of nearly 285 
million people however western specialists say soviet women 
average nine abortions and the number of aids cases while small 
is growing 
such problems makes it necessary to deal openly with sex said 
kon who is trying to take president mikhail s gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or openness behind the bedroom doors 
if we dont do anything we will create new difficulties 
the stability of marriage will suffer he said at a recent lecture 
to an overflow crowd at moscows house of actors 
kon recently returned from a 3month stay in the united states 
where he visited aids clinics and family planning centers he told 
his audience that the soviet union is far behind the west in 
discussing sex 
his frank talk goes against the mainstream and his comments 
raised many eyebrows among an audience that ranged from young men 
and women clad in jeans to people in their 80s 
with little poll data available to judge the soviet publics 
attitude toward sex the audiences questions offer some clues most 
expressed concern over a perceived rise in pornography and 
homosexuality 
but kon said he does not consider recent sexually explicit soviet 
movies to be pornographic and told the audience that homosexuality 
is natural for some people 
he noted that rightwingers in the united states once condemned 
sex education as a communist plot but he said that sex 
education is desperately needed in this bastion of communism 
kon blamed soviet authorities for the publics ignorance about 
sex and the resulting health and family problems 
if a woman comes into a clinic even a solid one in moscow and 
asks how to become pregnant they will tell her kon said in his 
lecture but if she asks how to receive pleasure from this they 
will say we cant help you its not our speciality 
traditionally soviet women are expected only to be good mothers 
and housewives 
sexual pleasure was considered not important to marriage he 
said today however soviet women are demanding happy sex lives 
there have been some changes however 
this year after a 10year struggle with censors kons book 
introduction to sexology was finally published in the soviet 
union a new book which he says will include illustrations of 
sexual positions is slated for publication early next year 
sex clinics have been opened in several soviet cities and the 
health ministry is beginning to realize that aids the high rates of 
divorce and abortions cannot be reduced without the help of 
psychologists and sociologists kon said 
this year the health ministry newspaper meditsinskaya gazeta 
decried a chronic shortage of condoms and printed a readers letter 
saying some people were so desperate they were using balloons as a 
substitute the same newspaper called for repeal of the law making 
homosexuality a crime 
although kons talk was largely philosophical and he did not 
provide many specific sex tips one woman confided to a friend 
afterward 
if i had known this before id be a normal person now

secretary of state george p shultz in one of 
his last official acts will undertake an international effort next 
week in paris to roll back the proliferation of chemical weapons 
technology 
he will represent the united states at a multinational conference 
in the french capital that is expected to reaffirm a 1925 protocol 
banning the use of chemical weapons and to encourage completion of 
negotiations among 40 nations in geneva of a new agreement 
prohibiting production 
some 20 nations by us estimate either have produced chemical 
weapons or are capable of manufacturing them among them the state 
department includes libya whose leader moammar gadhafi is accused 
by the department of supporting terrorism 
libya is one of the more recent ones and one of the more 
irresponsible ones to reach the edge of production said a us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at one time the civilized world abhorred poison gas but iraq 
discovered in the persian gulf war that chemical weapons were 
effective against numerically superior iranian forces and some 
third world countries resent interference with their chemical 
industries 
the united states stopped production in 1969 then resumed 17 
years later on the grounds the soviet union and other potential 
adversaries had chemical weapons programs currently chemical 
components and artillery shells to contain them are being produced 
but stockpiled separately 
president reagan proposed the paris conference in a speech to the 
un general assembly last september presidentelect bush said 
during the election campaign in october that the united states must 
take the lead in making sure that nations using chemical and 
biological weapons are punished 
the barriers against chemical warfare breached as weve seen 
during the iraniraq war must be repaired and raised even higher 
he said bush vowed to make nations that use such weapons pay a 
price 
realistically though the 1925 protocol to which 130 nations 
are parties has no enforcement provisions iraq which denied using 
the weapons is one of them 
bush proposed a global ban in 1984 while twice casting 
tiebreaking votes in the senate to continue financing us 
production an aide explained that bush felt that as long as the 
soviets produced chemical weapons the united states should keep up 
the soviet union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical 
weapons then claimed to have ceased production a foreign ministry 
spokesman said 50000 tons would be stored the rest destroyed 
officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in geneva 
to plan ways to restrict proliferation 
so far the united states and the soviet union are the only two 
countries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons 
but in recent weeks the reagan administration has accused libya 
of having a chemical weapons plant reagan in a recent television 
interview said the government has not ruled out a military strike 
against the plant 
the paris conference is expected to reaffirm the 1925 ban on 
using the weapons and to urge adoption of a verifiable ban on 
production as well by the 40nation disarmament conference that 
meets in february in geneva 
two other steps may be taken in paris authorizing the 
secretarygeneral of the united nations to investigate allegations 
of the use of chemical weapons and some form of assistance for 
victims 
nearly all the 159 nations that are members of the united nations 
are sending their foreign ministers or ambassadors to paris you 
can expect an enormous turnout said the us official who is 
involved in preparations for the jan 711 conference 
whatever declaration emerges there is no way to enforce it 
although sanctions may be discussed and the official said there 
is a great allergy particularly in the arab world to pointing 
fingers at their capabilities and their emerging capabilities so 
that becomes a bit sensitive 
assuming the 40 nations in geneva which do not include iraq and 
libya decide to ban the production and possession of chemical 
weapons there still will be an enormous problem 
we recognize that verification is a very complicated problem 
the official said when you are talking about not producing 
chemical agents that raises all kinds of very difficult issues any 
chemical industry which can produce pesticides to kill insects can 
probably produce chemical agents to kill people and thats one of 
the frightening parts of this whole business they are relatively 
simple to construct and to make

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
restructuring drive eventually may enable soviet computer makers to 
satisfy demand but progress will be slow and moscow can be expected 
to keep trying to acquire western technology a us scientific 
advisory panel says 
it said the united states should take a more focused and flexible 
approach to export controls on computers especially since the 
existing curbs on many components and systems have become virtually 
unenforceable 
the panel urged the united states to concentrate instead on 
striving together with its nato allies and japan to control 
leakage to the soviet bloc of militarily valuable supercomputers and 
the most advanced computer manufacturing processes 
the united states cannot afford to be complacent about its 
computer technology strengths or base export control decisions on an 
assumption of an invincible lead said the national research 
council report released thursday 
preparing the 288page study was a 17member committee chaired by 
seymour e goodman professor of management information systems and 
policy at the university of arizona tucson 
the national research council is the principal operating agency 
of the national academies of sciences and engineering 
the report estimated that the soviet union lags about five years 
to 10 years behind the west in many computer technologies 
the lag between east and west is now large enough that the 
acquisitiondiversion of certain western technologies for direct 
production will help the soviets tremendously it said 
referring to gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring drive the 
report said that if perestroika actually fails to bring about 
fundamental changes in the soviet economy collection efforts will 
surely increase 
on the other hand if perestroika succeeds the soviet 
computing industry may finally find itself in a position to fully 
meet demand and the soviet military may find itself getting the 
same kind of support from its own computing industry that it now 
must get by using the western computer industry as a surrogate it 
said 
but the report added that the full effects of perestroika will 
be a long time coming and transformation of the soviet computer 
industry cannot happen overnight in the meantime the acquisition 
of western technology would seem to appear even more attractive to 
the soviet computer industry as it tries to close the gap 
on us export controls policy it noted that as the computer 
market becomes increasingly global us firms face increasing 
foreign competition mostly from firms operating with fewer export 
barriers under the same cocom guidelines 
cocom is the coordinating committee for multilateral export 
controls comprising the united states japan and all nato countries 
except iceland 
tighter us controls may reflect the absence of a fully 
effective multilateral control effort but there is a risk that in 
the computer area the united states may lock the proverbial barn 
door after the horse has escaped the report said 
it concluded that current technological progress will make 
controls harder to enforce and technological and market 
developments combine to make a case for a more focused and flexible 
control process 
increasingly powerful computer hardware and software the study 
said are in effect becoming commodities in world trade 
commodity products are available in high volume and at low 
cost they may be available in multiple and substitutable forms and 
they tend to be small and easy to transport it said these 
attributes make commodities vital to the economic health of the 
computer industry but also effectively uncontrollable 
the report recommended that the united states publish a list of 
computer technologies that are commodities the government then 
should promulgate a policy exempting such commodities from export 
controls at least for trade among cocom nations 
on the other hand it said the state department should work with 
other agencies to focus export control efforts on computer 
technologies of compelling military importance that could enable 
soviet bloc countries to make substantial gains in their technology 
base 
in particular the report cited advanced chip fabrication lines 
supercomputers and other highperformance computing systems 
computeraided design systems and magnetic and magnetooptical 
materials 
the study also said the united states should involve newly 
industrializing countries such as singapore hong kong taiwan and 
south korea into the cocom program

you can call him shree and you can call 
him rajneesh but oregons former selfstyled guru of wealth and 
free love bhagwan shree rajneesh says until further notice that 
you dont need to call him god 
rajneesh announced thursday he has dropped the honorific title of 
bhagwan a hindi word meaning god 
many indians resented rajneesh calling himself bhagwan because 
in hinduism no mortal is equal to god 
i have been calling myself bhagwan just as a challenge to 
this country the 57yearold who once taught philosophy in india 
said in the statement from his new commune in poona western india 
i dont want to be called bhagwan enough is enough the joke 
is over he said 
rajneesh was deported three years ago from the united states 
after he pleaded guilty to immigration fraud and closed his 
64000acre commune of rajneeshpuram in central oregon followers 
had bestowed dozens of rolls royces on their revered guide of 
eastern religion pop psychology and free love 
after roaming in search of a new sanctuary for a claimed 500000 
faithful worldwide he moved his cult to a sixacre commune in 
poona a city of nearly 1 million residents about 80 miles southeast 
of bombay 
but despite thursdays announcement the guru did not entirely 
renounce claims to divinity 
he told 10000 people in poona from today onwards you can 
look at me as gautama the buddha and by accepting gautama the 
buddha as my very soul i go out of the hindu fold completely 
gautama buddha born in india about 500 bc renounced a title 
too born a prince he gave up nobility to launch a new religion

while a nearly allmale club is 
making its annual new years eve trek up 14110foot pikes peak a 
group of women will be making a 1000foot ascent of a nearby 
mountain in jest of the traditional event 
this years climb will mark the 66th annual climb of pikes peak 
by the adaman club which plans to set off fireworks at the summit 
the group adds a climber each year 
adawoman a band founded in 1982 will make an ascent on pyramid 
mountain in ute pass west of colorado springs light sparklers play 
helen reddys song i am woman down champagne and head home for 
the night organizers said 
it will be the seventh climb for the adawoman club which was 
founded almost as a lark by rita randolph and several other woman 
who train on pyramid mountain 
its really beautiful up there and one morning we had run the 
mountain and decided this was the way we should start out the new 
year together she said 
the women also were prodded that year because adaman for the 
first time in its history was inviting a female guest veteran 
climber sue graham 
one of the adaman members said that the reason they hadnt done 
it before was they didnt know any women who could make it said 
randolph well i and another of our members ran the pikes peak 
marathon so i think we can make it 
adaman historian jim bates said graham still the only woman 
invited will make her fourth climb with the club this year 
of course when we started this climb in 1922 you couldnt 
have hired a woman to go with us it wasnt until a few years ago 
that women got so they were into this type of thing he said 
randolph said adawoman may add a man in 50 or 60 years if one is 
found worthy

more americans are once again calling the 
midwest their home but sunbelt states like california and florida 
remain the favored places to settle down government figures show 
the census bureau on thursday released its 1988 population 
estimates showing that the west and parts of the south continued 
strong population growth while smaller growth rates were reflected 
in the northeast 
the midwest appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff in 
population during the early part of the decade 
the total us population stood at 2458 million as of july 1 
the date of the 1988 census statistics reflecting a 3 percent 
increase in population from july 1 1985 
over the threeyear period the biggest growth rate and 
population loss were seen in small population states nevada was up 
128 percent topping the 1 million mark for the first time and the 
energyproducing state of wyoming had a 76 percent decline a loss 
of 39000 people leaving its population at 471000 
the 12 midwestern states where the depressed farm economy 
caused a population downturn between 1981 and 1983 had an overall 
12 percent population increase in the 198588 period the census 
estimates showed 
some midwestern states continued to lose residents but the 
midwest as a region picked up slightly 
losses were estimated in 19851988 for iowa nebraska north 
dakota montana and idaho the census bureau said in a statement 
but added the 1988 data indicate that the declines may be 
slowing and several of these states may have grown in the past 
year 
the largest state california had the greatest increase in 
population 18 million people or 69 percent boosting its total

a provincial court has ordered the television 
series falcon crest off egyptian tv on grounds it undermines public 
morals according to a newspaper report 
falcon crest began appearing several years ago on local 
television and quickly became a favorite among both poor and wealthy 
egyptians despite its depiction of a society generally foreign to 
the mostly conservative egyptians 
television censors for example routinely cut kissing scenes 
from falcon crest that they consider too passionate 
the tv series dallas a predecessor of falcon crest also was 
widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of 
parliament complained it was corrupting the morals of egyptian youth 
the newspaper wafd published by a centrist opposition party of 
the same name said thursday the ruling banning the show was in a 
provincial court in the nile valley town of shibin elkom 
in the case brought by a lawyer identified as mustafa hamed 
khalifa he was quoted as arguing that scenes in falcon crest are 
against morality and the constitution and incite debauchery 
wafd said 
the newspaper said that in finding for the plaintiff chief judge 
radwan mohammed radwan also ordered information minister safwat 
sherif in charge of state television and radio to pay court costs 
a spokesman for sherif said thursday that he knew nothing about 
the case 
the director of egyptian televisions channel 2 which airs the 
series was not available for comment but her secretary wafaa 
hammad said she hadnt heard about the case either 
we will be showing two more episodes next sunday she said

move over ben johnson make way lawrence taylor 
drugs have caught another sports star this one named after a pub 
and owned by the heir to the british throne 
devils elbow a 4yearold gelding tested positive for three 
stimulants after giving prince charles his first winner as a 
racehorse owner in a 1200 steeplechase at worcester 
in announcing the finding this week the jockey club which 
governs horse racing in britain said there were no indications the 
prince had anything to do with the doping and in all likelihood 
would not be punished suspicions were that the drugs were contained 
in contaminated feed 
but trainer nick gaselee faces an 1800 fine and devils elbow 
the namesake of a pub in princeton england that also is owned by 
the prince could be stripped of the victory if further tests showed 
the horse was deliberately doped 
the royal familys longstanding love affair with horses and 
racing was for the first time touched by the spreading stain of 
drugs in sports which have claimed such stars as johnson the 
olympic 100meter runner from canada and taylor the allpro 
linebacker from the new york giants 
i am not aware of any other royal horse being disqualified for 
this sort of reason said michael oswald manager of the royal 
studs the royal familys horsebreeding farm 
prince charles whose career as a steeplechase jockey ended 
several years ago in a series of spills was not commenting on the 
drug findings 
the tabloid daily star quoted an unidentified friend of the 
prince as saying charles was highly embarrassed by the case 
the whole business is most upsetting for him itll take some 
living down the friend was quoted as saying 
most of britains dozen national newspapers played the story on 
the front page thursday with the kind of headlines usually reserved 
for sex scandals and ax murders 
charlies nag fails dope test the daily star said charles 
horse in dope shock said the daily mail the times of london 
using charles formal position in the royal household headlined its 
frontpage story prince of wales first winner fails a dope 
test 
like other sports british horse racing has had trouble recently 
with drugs the jockey club said that of an estimated 6500 samples 
per year 1020 test positive usually for legitimate medication 
administered too close to race day 
two days after devils elbow won the novice stakes at worcester 
dec 5 the jockey club leveled a record 31500 fine against 
trainer david elsworth after one of his horses tested positive for 
steroids 
steroids are musclebuilders and their use got johnson thrown out 
of the olympics in seoul drug use in horse racing in britain where 
no medication is allowed in race entrants more often involves 
painkillers or stimulants such as the caffeine theobromine and 
theophylline found in devils elbow 
gaselee said feed from his barn had been taken away for tests and 
the jockey club confirmed that processed food known as horse 
nuts was undergoing tests which could take up to two weeks 
nevertheless the club said gaselee remained in line for 
punishment 
i make it quite clear that if any substance is found in a 
horse which might have impaired or improved its running the 
trainer will be held responsible lord fairhaven the clubs 
senior steward said 
added david pipe a jockey club spokesman i do not know what 
sort of diet this horse was on but stimulants are not permitted 
on wednesday as the positive test of devils elbow was being 
announced britains big race of the day was the arkle challenge 
trophy at warwick 
the winner a horse named positive

actor martin sheen won a ruling from the 
nevada supreme court overturning a requirement that he post a 5000 
bond aimed at stopping a protest trespass at a nuclear test site 
sheen active in the movement against nuclear testing was forced 
to post the peace bond after saying on national television he 
would hopefully commit civil disobedience at the nevada test 
site 
the supreme court reversing a district judges order said 
thursday that prosecutors had conceded that civil disobedience 
wasnt a crime in nevada 
we conclude that sheens remarks did not indicate an 
intention to commit a criminal offense in this state the court 
added in holding that the peace bond statute doesnt apply in 
such cases 
under nevada law the threat of a criminal act is enough to 
require a peace bond if a violation actually occurs the bond 
could be forfeited and the person could be jailed for up to six 
months

the countrys nuclear power plants reported 
2940 mishaps in 1987 a slight increase from the year before 
according to an antinuclear organization 
a report thursday by public citizens critical mass energy 
project said the accident figure represented incidents reported by 
nuclear plant owners to the nuclear regulatory commission and 
classified by the nrc as potentially significant safety events 
the corresponding figure was 2836 accidents in 1986 when there 
were 99 reactors in operation the number of operating reactors grew 
to 109 in 1987 according to the report 
public citizen a nonprofit research organization and longtime 
critic of nuclear power also said thursday that in 1987 there was a 
record number of more than 104000 incidents in which nuclear 
workers were exposed to measurable doses of radiation 
in addition it said there were at least 430 emergency shutdowns 
last year and at least 492 violations of nuclear plant safety rules 
the report was based on nrc data compiled and analyzed by public 
citizen 
joan claybrook president of public citizen said in releasing 
the report public attention has recently been focused on the poor 
safety conditions at the nations nuclear weapons reactors 
however in 1987 badly managed commercial nuclear plants daily 
threatened the safety of the public particularly the 96 million 
americans who live within 50 miles of a reactor she said 
public citizen criticized the nrc for refusing to release key 
safety data such as singlecomponent failure records and a 
comprehensive listing of all emergency plant shutdowns it contended 
that the commissions public records on safety violations are 
incomplete and contradictory 
robert newlin an nrc spokesman said he could not comment in 
detail on specific allegations without first having a chance to 
examine the public citizen report 
i would say that in general the nrc makes data available to the 
public on all safety issues he said newlin added that based on a 
variety of safety and operational criteria the overall 
performance at nuclear plants we think is improving 
carl goldstein a spokesman for the us council for energy 
awareness a nuclear industry group said in response to the public 
citizen report americas nuclear plants have just ended a 
recordbreaking year producing 20 percent of the nations 
electricity 
the nrc and the institute of nuclear power operations confirm 
that year by year nuclear plants have improved their availability 
and reduced the number of significant events which are an important 
measure of safe operation goldstein said 
here are key findings of the public citizen report 
in 1987 a total of 430 scrams or emergency plant shutdowns 
were reported to the nrc this worked out to an average of 44 
shutdowns per operating reactor 
plants experiencing the largest number of scrams during the year 
were vogtle1 waynesboro ga 27 shutdowns shearon harris1 
newhill nc 21 shutdowns and beaver valley2 shippingport pa 
17 shutdowns 
there were at least 2940 mishaps at us power reactors in 
1987 that was the tally of licensee event reports submitted to 
the nrc by utilities according to nrc guidelines they provide 
descriptions of potentially significant safety events that 
might lead to serious accidents 
reactors with the highest number of mishaps were nine mile 
point2 scriba ny 79 mishaps perry1 north perry ohio 77 
mishaps and vogtle1 75 mishaps 
in 1987 an alltime high of 104458 incidents occurred in which 
workers at nuclear reactors received measurable doses of radiation 
at least 492 violations of safety regulations at us power 
reactors were cited by the nrc in 1987 inasmuch as nrcs data are 
incomplete the actual number is probably significantly higher 
the public citizen report said 
plants at which the highest numbers of violations were reported 
include sequoyah1 and 2 daisy tenn 37 violations browns 
ferry1 2 and 3 decatur ala 35 violations and turkey point3 
and 4 florida city fla 33 violations

its not kennebunkport south its not even 
plains

more than a country store with gas pumps took on the look of a 
presidential retreat when george bush arrived with his fishing 
tackle 
the presidentelect accompanied by a 17vehicle entourage of 
security and press stopped by thursday to fish for bass at ray 
scotts 55acre private lake in pintlalas partly rolling partly 
swampy terrain 15 miles south of montgomery 
i havent seen so much excitement since the milk truck turned 
over a couple of years ago said area resident don williamson 
what camp david and san clemente have been to other presidents 
we hope pintlala will be for the bush administration joked the 
rev gary burton pastor of the pintlala baptist church who 
gathered with a dozen other people to welcome bush 
a few dozen more collected outside scotts guarded gate thursday 
evening when the bush caravan pulled out 
thank you all very much said bush speaking through an 
amplified car speaker happy new year to everybody 
scott a bush political ally and a montgomery native who founded 
the bass anglers sportsman society arranged the afternoon of 
fishing in the former creek indian settlement 
bush caught nine fish by days end the largest weighed three 
pounds and he threw them all back

from scotts home 
the welcoming group with one little girl holding high a sign 
that read good fishing cheered as bush arrived the group then 
went to mosleys service station which serves as a grocery hot dog 
stand and unofficial city hall for pintlala 
at mosleys a few dozen other people had gathered thinking bush 
would pass by the junction of us 31 and federal road which 
amounts to downtown pintlala but the bush motorcade took a 
faster route on interstate 65 turning into the scott farm from 
another local road

with 365 miles of shelves and more than 11 
million different books john zubal thinks his bookstore offers the 
largest collection of titles for sale in the world 
he hopes the guinness book of world records will think so too 
zubal 49 says hes writing the editors of the guinness book 
once he has gathered supporting evidence and theres quite a bit of 
it 
four warehouses packed with books from floor to ceiling house 
zubals volumes arranged alphabetically by categories the complex 
is so large that until recently his 49yearold wife marilyn 
used roller skates to retrieve customer requests 
guinness lists w amp g foyle ltd of london as the bookstore with 
the most shelving at 30 miles while barnes amp noble bookstore in new 
york city is listed as the largest book building with 154250 square 
feet of books said sheelagh thomas a deputy editor for guinness in 
england 
zubal said he has 78000 square feet of books and more titles 
than any other store because he has few duplicate books textbooks 
or remainders such as those sold at barnes amp noble and foyle 
bibliophiles from as far way as japan visit his store regularly 
he said 
but if you want to learn how to ski or groom your pet dont go 
to zubals 
we dont have too many books for the casual reader zubal 
said recently mostly our books are for the scholar and most are 
sold by mail order we are not too concerned with what is being 
published now 
fewer than 2 percent of zubals tomes were published after 1960 
he said 
some of the biggest categories are literary criticism 
anthropology philosophy theology and history zubal estimated he 
has 250 books alone about charles dickens and 1000 on shakespeare 
we do a lot of business in world war ii books said zubal 
we think there are about 6000 books published on world war ii 
and we have 3000 
zubal acquires most of his books from contacts who tell him of 
literary estates or bookstores for sale 
i used to hit the flea market circuit but now i let the younger 
guys do it said the bookseller who travels to europe several 
times a year to buy and sell 
zubal also owns autographed editions by james joyce ernest 
hemingway and flying ace eddie rickenbacker 
while zubal said all his books are for sale there are books i 
mark up to scare off the fainthearted he was not ready to dicker 
over an autographed edition of finnegans wake priced at 3000 
im in no hurry to sell it he said its money in the 
bank 
once zubal submits his claim to guinness ms thomas said he 
will need to submit two forms from witnesses validating his claim 
and a color photograph 
ms thomas said editors would have to determine if his claim to 
have the most individual titles would merit a separate record 
category 
that is always a possibility but we cant make any promises

us industry helped by continued strong 
demand for exports will enjoy a seventh consecutive year of rising 
sales in 1989 with hightechnology businesses leading the gains 
according to government forecasts 
the commerce department on thursday released the 30th edition of 
its us industrial outlook which each year picks the winners and 
losers among american businesses based on detailed analyses of 
market trends in 350 different manufacturing and service industries 
totaling up all the individual forecasts you can see that we 
are looking for another positive year for the economy deputy 
commerce secretary donna tuttle said 
services will continue to be strong and the majority of 
manufacturing industries will continue to grow especially those 
producing capital equipment and exports she said at a news 
conference where she previewed the 566page book 
tuttle said more than 70 percent of us manufacturing industries 
were expected to see higher sales in the new year with the median 
growth rate after adjusting for inflation projected to be 23 
percent 
those projections represented a slight drop from the current 
year reflecting the belief that the nonfarm economy while not in 
danger of a recession will not do quite as well in 1989 tuttle 
said 
among the reports forecasts 
some sectors of manufacturing will be held back by a continuing 
slump in the construction industry which will depress the demand 
for steel and other building materials 
industries providing services instead of goods the fastest 
growing portion of the economy will continue to do well in 1989 
led by firms specializing in computers 
aerospace one of the largest manufacturing industries will 
show modest overall growth as rising demand for civilian aircraft is 
offset by a drop in military orders 
car sales will decline by about 1 percent to 106 million units 
with the share of sales held by manufacturers in canada and the 
united states holding steady at about 72 percent 
the banking industry despite continued problems with 
international debts and stiff competition from nonbanking financial 
companies will show good growth with assets rising by about 7 
percent 
airlines will have another strong year with revenues rising by 
more than 14 percent trucking revenues will rise 7 percent while 
revenues earned by railroads will increase 2 percent 
health and medical services one of the fastest growing service 
industries will show a sharp 107 percent rise in 1989 to an 
estimated 618 billion 
the report said the service category with the biggest projected 
percentage increase will be space commercialization where revenues 
are expected to rise by 50 percent to 27 billion as the commercial 
launch industry in the united states begins its first year of 
operation 
other service standouts will be in the fields of data processing 
computer services and electronic data bases with revenues projected 
to rise by between 13 percent and 20 percent 
in the manufacturing sector the star performer is expected to be 
the metalcutting segment of the machine tool industry with 
shipments projected to rise by 139 percent that reflects the boom 
in capital investment as american industry rushes to expand 
production facilities to meet rising export demands 
the no 2 manufacturing industry will be semiconductors with a 
projected 134 percent rise in shipments followed by a 13 percent 
increase in paper making machinery paper plants are now operating 
at 95 percent of capacity and are trying to expand to meet the high 
level of demand 
many of the manufacturing sectors expected to perform the most 
sluggishly were tied to the construction industry sales of chemical 
preparation were projected to drop by 146 percent the largest 
overall decrease sales of household cooking equipment were forecast 
to decline by 79 percent reflecting an expected decline in 
construction of new homes next year 
demand for steel products are forecast to fall by 69 percent in 
1989 reflecting a drop in demand for steel girders in construction 
the industrial outlook can be purchased for 24 beginning next 
month at the governments 21 regional bookstores

the summers devastating drought caused 
relatively few farmers to renege on contracts for advance sales of 
corn soybeans and wheat the agriculture department says 
the report by the departments economic research service said a 
survey of 325 elevators or warehouses in 13 corn belt and spring 
wheat states showed farmers would default on less than 1 percent of 
their contracts 
only about 1 percent of these elevators expected that losses 
from farmers failing to meet contract commitments would exceed 10 
percent of the elevators net worth the report said 
the report was ordered by congress in this years disaster 
assistance act which provided aid to farmers hit by the drought and 
hot weather during the spring and early summer months 
drought raised commodity prices sharply and left many farmers 
with less grain and soybeans to deliver than they had counted on 
when they entered into forward contracts early in the year 
many would have liked to get out of their contracts if that 
were possible because market prices rose above the contracted 
prices the report said some farmers produced less than they 
had sold forward and faced buying out their contracts at a loss 
if farmers defaulted that would leave elevators or other buyers 
to absorb the losses 
the report was sent to capitol hill but has not been distributed 
generally by usda a copy was made available thursday to the 
associated press 
most of the information was based on a telephone survey of the 
325 elevators in september the report said the survey results also 
were consistent with information obtained in field interviews of 
elevator managers telephone interviews of bankers and brokers and 
from state grain marketing specialists 
severe drought and the associated grain and soybean price 
increases hit farmers who priced forward in two ways the report 
said those who hedged by selling futures were the first to be 
affected to meet margin calls during the period when prices 
increased these farmers had to either tap financial reserves or 
obtain increased credit 
but the study found in a smallscale survey of commodity 
brokers and bankers that farmers and their brokers and bankers 
successfully weathered the sharp commodity price increases and the 
resulting calls for greater margins or deposits that occurred in 
june and july 
for farmers who entered into cash forward contracts the 
financial problem hit when it became necessary to buy back contracts 
in lieu of making delivery the report said 
more than half of the elevators surveyed had forward contracts 
with farmers for corn soybeans or wheat produced in 1988 the 
contracts covered about 15 percent of the corn 22 percent of the 
soybeans and 7 percent of the spring wheat that these elevators 
bought this year 
according to the survey the elevators indicated that more than 
95 percent of their outstanding forward contracts with farmers 
likely would be fulfilled as originally negotiated with between 1 
percent and 2 percent renegotiated and less than 1 percent in 
default the remainder were uncertain 
officials had expected higher rates of default and renogotiation 
but the report said many farmers realized the possible intensity of 
the drought by early june and curtailed normal contracting activity 
as a result farmers incurred fewer contract obligations than 
they might have incurred if the drought had not become apparent 
until later in the season the report said 
weather also was important during that period the report said 
many areas particularly in ohio indiana and parts of illinois 
received rain in late july and early august which improved yield 
prospects in those areas 
in those cases improved yields helped farmers meet contract 
obligations compared with the uncertainties of only a few weeks 
earlier 
the 13 states included an eastern corn belt region of illinois 
indiana kentucky michigan ohio and wisconsin and a western corn 
belt region of iowa minnesota missouri montana nebraska north 
dakota and south dakota

strengthened against earthquakes as quickly as possible or closed 
experts were quoted as saying in an official report 
tass the official soviet news agency said thursday that 
specialists hurried to inspect the plant near yerevan the capital 
of armenia after the earthquake dec 7 that killed thousands of 
people

reinforcement against earthquakes within the shortest possible 
time or it should be closed tass said 
the report follows an announcement by soviet nuclear power 
officials last week that six nuclear power projects were scrapped 
because of earthquake danger or because of tougher standards new 
rules were imposed after the chernobyl nuclear disaster in april 
1986 killed at least 31 people 
speculation abounded after the earthquake earlier this month that 
the plant near yerevan was damaged the facility lies near a 
geological fault 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov told reporters in yerevan on 
dec 12 that the plant would be shut in two years 
but the tass story quoting yevgeny velikhov vice president of 
the soviet academy of sciences mentioned no deadline 
the facility generates more than onethird of the caucasus 
mountain republics electricity

allout effort to bring those responsible for the savage and 
tragic bombing of pan am flight 103 to justice 
what we want to do is find out who did it and bring them to 
justice reagan said in a statement thursday before flying here 
from los angeles to continue a twoweek california vacation 
when they arrived in palm springs the president and nancy reagan 
were greeted by the mayor of palm springs entertainer sonny bono 
and his wife 
the reagans will be guests until monday at the palatial desert 
home of publisher walter annenberg in nearby rancho mirage 
continuing their custom of attending a new years party there 
the reagans then plan to return to los angeles to spend a few 
more days in the bel air residence that will be their home after 
reagans term ends on jan 20 they are scheduled to fly back to 
washington jan 5 for their final two weeks in the white house 
reagans statement at the los angeles airport was his first since 
british authorities announced more than 24 hours earlier that they 
had determined the crash was caused by a bomb the crash killed 259 
people in the air mostly americans and 11 on the ground 
i think you all know that i have been following quite closely 
the details of the pan am 103 tragedy and now that we know 
definitely that it was a bomb were going to make every effort we 
can to find out who is guilty of this savage and tragic thing and 
bring them to justice the president said 
reagan echoing comments made by officials in washington said 
the federal aviation administration is studying and making 
recommendations as to additional things we can do at airports to 
provide security for those who travel 
asked whether he thought the bombing was the work of terrorists 
the president said i cant comment on that it seems to savor of 
that but were going to have to have more details and were doing 
everything we can to find them and working in connection with other 
countries on that 
british investigators announced in london wednesday they have 
conclusive evidence that a bomb not structural failure caused 
the pan american jumbo jet to break up dec 21 over southwestern

christmas trees have reappeared in homes and social 
clubs after a long absence the latest sign of a softening in the 
attitude of the officially atheist government toward the roman 
catholic church 
i considered it a tradition that couldnt be erased said 
enrique lopez oliva who teaches religion at the university of 
havana and also edits a newsletter on church issues 
at a social club a pine tree adorned with christmas lights sits 
a few feet from the statue of one of the martyrs of the cuban 
revolution but the great majority of the christmas trees are found 
in private homes and occupy an outoftheway place invisible to 
passersby 
this pennsylvaniasized nation of 10 million people the least 
religious of any in latin america branded yuletide celebrations as 
a bourgeois prejudice after the 1959 communist takeover lopez 
said 
one reason the government felt the manpower needed for the 
winter sugar harvest should not be diverted by holiday celebrations 
that problem has become less acute with mechanization 
last year several cubans displayed a christmas tree and the old 
tradition picked up considerable momentum this year 
putting up a christmas tree can be a chore since none is sold 
commercially and often they must be dug up from wooded areas no 
small task in a country with few private cars 
in addition ornaments generally are available only if they were 
stashed away and not discarded when the government began 
discouraging christmas observances 
several cubans said christmas always had been considered more of 
an occasion for family gatherings and giftgiving than a religious 
festival 
still even the limited yuletide observation is a far cry from a 
few years ago when the only acknowledgement of the holiday were the 
signs in stores reserved for foreigners december is giftbuying 
month 
this was a subtle attempt by the government to earn dollars by 
getting foreign visitors to buy christmas presents in cuba lopez 
said cuban authorities have become much more accommodating attitude 
toward the church as part of an effort to improve the countrys 
image abroad 
as an example he said the government has allowed 30 new priests 
to immigrate to cuba this year the largest number since the 
revolution 
president fidel castro also said there will be no limit on the 
number of foreign nuns allowed to immigrate in addition there have 
been hints the government is negotiating with pope john paul ii for 
his first visit to the island 
but the more flexible government attitude toward the church has 
not always been met by reciprocal gestures from church leaders 
six weeks ago carlos manuel de cespedes the general vicar of 
the havana diocese expressed concern about the falsity deceit 
apathy and dishonesty that permeate social life in cuba 
there is no disputing however the more relaxed government 
stance toward the church 
in the early 1960s for example the government looked on the 
church as a hotbed of antirevolutionary sentiment and expelled 600 
of cubas 800 priests 
students were taught atheism and only in 1979 was religion made a 
part of the university teachings now lopez said the campaign to 
instill with atheism has diminished there is more flexibility

presidentelect bush back home in washington 
after a hunting and fishing vacation said he was fairly close 
to making his two remaining cabinetlevel appointments and ready to 
focus on his first 100 days in the oval office 
bush ended a fourday vacation thursday with a successful bass 
fishing outing on a private lake in pintlala ala he caught nine 
fish the largest a threepounder 
today bush was having a private meeting with thomas pickering 
the us ambassador to israel who bush has nominated as the new 
ambassador to the united nations bush also planned to meet with 
william webster director of the cia a job bush once held 
bush said he was fairly close to naming his energy secretary 
and his drug czar the only two cabinetlevel posts still vacant in 
his new administration 
according to sources james schlesinger who was energy secretary 
in the carter administration and defense secretary in the nixon and 
ford administrations was among a number of candidates bush was 
considering for the energy post 
on thursday in beeville texas before heading to alabama bush 
told reporters his top priorities were to finish the cabinet 
start fleshing out the secretary and undersecretary levels and 
then start making definitive plans for the first 100 days of his 
new administration which begins after his jan 20 inauguration 
before he left beeville where he hunted quail on a friends 
ranch for three days bush threatened retaliation if possible 
against those who planted a bomb on a pan american jetliner that 
crashed dec 21 in scotland killing all 259 people on board 
bush said he would seek hard and punish firmly decisively 
those who did this if you can ever find them 
but the vice president refused to specify how he would retaliate 
and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be stopped 
completely 
it is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be 
another terrorism act he said though he suggested that improved 
intelligence and cooperation between nations would help 
in alabama bush and his friend ray scott founder of 
bassmasters each caught nine bass in four hours of fishing said 
bush spokesman steve hart 
bush said hart has decided to take another short vacation 
before the inauguration two days fishing in islamorada in the 
florida keys about 75 miles south of miami 
hart who did not have an exact schedule for bush said the 
fishing trip could take place over the martin luther king holiday 
jan 16 
this weekend bush and his wife barbara are going to the 
presidential retreat at camp david md in the cacotin mountains 
leaving on friday and probably returning on monday hart said

the navy denying an accusation by a member of 
a commission that compiled recommendations for military base 
closings said it cooperated with the panels review 
in the recommendations issued thursday the navy lost six 
installations three of which had not yet entered service compared 
with five major bases lost by the air force and the armys 26 bases 
and 52 housing units that would be partially or wholly closed 
thomas eagleton a former democratic senator from missouri who 
joined the 12member commission part way through its sevenmonth 
review said the navy stonewalled and got away with it 
the air force ultimately gave its cooperation the army 
begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation eagleton said in an 
additional view at the close of the 88page final report 
released by the commission on base realignment and closure 
for the navy he said intransigence paid off when the new 
secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of 
trimming the pentagon budget he should most certainly start with 
the navy the navy refused to play this time it should be obliged 
to next time 
navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley rejected eagletons 
criticism 
we feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly 
answered whatever questions the commission had quigley said 
thursday 
eagletons comment may be more a measure of the mood of the three 
services than their willingness to eliminate facilities pentagon 
officials said 
one army officer speaking on condition of anonymity said 
eagletons statement recalled the phrase the dumb the devious and 
the defiant the army being the dumb the air force devious and the 
navy defiant 
navy officers argued that unlike the air force and the army they 
eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the 
1970s those facilities included the quonset point naval air station 
and newport naval base in rhode island the boston naval shipyard 
the glynco naval air station in georgia the brooklyn naval shipyard 
in new york and the hunters point naval shipyard near san francisco 
three of the six navy facilities nominated by the commission for 
elimination were part of the home port program and construction on 
them either had not started or was not complete they included the 
naval station at hunters point the naval station at galveston 
texas and the naval station at lake charles la 
another navy base to be eliminated the puget sound naval station 
in washington state is an administrative center 35 miles by 
automobile from another homeport at everett wash 
the commission recommended moving administrative facilities from 
the brooklyn naval station to nearby staten island where a homeport 
is under construction the sixth navy facility recommended for 
closure is the naval hospital in philadelphia which the commission 
called unsafe and inadequate to support modern health care the 
hospital cannot be modernized 
none of the affected army or air force bases was critical and 
most employees would be transferred those services said 
the army stands to lose the most bases including a major 
training center fort dix nj to be placed inactive status 
affecting 3140 military and 1516 civilian employees 
also picked for closing were fort sheridan in illinois with 
1319 military and 1681 civilian employees and the presidio 
offices would close in san francisco with 2140 military and 3150 
civilian employees 
an army spokesman maj dick bridges said he saw no 
unwarranted closures on the list 
on first look it seems that they have done their homework 
he said sheridan the presidio and dix have appeared on lists 
from time immemorial if we dont need them we should get rid of 
them 
an air force spokesman maj lou figueroa said that service 
fully supports the commission and its charter to bring about more 
efficient use of defense resources 
the air force maintains a military force of 607000 said 
figueroa of those 15743 would be relocated the air force has a 
civilian work force of 264348 of whom 5086 would be affected 
the commission recommended that the air force close five of its 
94 major bases chanute in illinois george mather and norton in 
california and pease in new hampshire most of their functions would 
be taken over by canon air force base in new mexico sheppard afb in 
texas march afb in california and mountain home afb in idaho 
of the air force bases affected only mather has strategic 
bombers and the report said its b52s are programmed to retire 
norton is one of six military airlift command bases chanute is 
largely a training base the f4 tactical fighter wing at george is 
to be retired 
fb111 bombers located at pease are being moved the base is 
considered vulnerable to surprise attack from submarinelaunched 
cruise missiles

a proposal that 34 major us military bases be closed brought 
warnings of economic woe from disheartened local officials and 
merchants but there were sighs of relief around installations 
spared the ax or slated for expansion 
i think it will be devastating 50 percent of our employment 
at least has to do with chanute mayor katy podagrosi said in 
rural rantoul ill home of chanute air force base 
the training center with 2133 military and 1035 civilian jobs 
was one of the military bases recommended for closure in the report 
issued thursday 
but church bells pealed in enid okla when officials learned 
vance air force base was unaffected by the plan and officers 
cheered at myrtle beach air force base when they learned it would 
stay open 
without question we are very pleased enid mayor bruce 
harvey said 
in all the commission on base realignment and closure 
recommended closing 86 facilities including 52 military housing 
units partially closing five others and revising the roles and 
staffing levels at 54 others 
if the plan is carried out the commission estimated the 
government would save 693 million annually and 56 billion over 
the next two decades while 58500 military and civilian employees 
would lose their jobs or be transferred other bases would get 
37850 new jobs or assignments 
san francisco stands to lose the citys third largest employer if 
the presidio army base is closed as recommended the base one of 
the loveliest spots in the city employs about 3000 civilians and 
2700 military 
for 112 years the presidio has been an integral part of san 
francisco it was here before san francisco was a city its been a 
very good neighbor an important part of our economy said 
mayor art agnos 
under the 1972 federal law that established the golden gate 
national recreation area all but 36 of the presidios 1490 acres 
would become part of the popular park which includes coastal land 
both in san francisco and marin county north of the golden gate 
closure would be bad we get a lot of business from the base 
we would really feel it said linda jacobsen manager of a 
travelodge motel only a few yards from the presidios main gate 
nobody likes to see business go down the drain and thats 
whats happening said mike rudolph owner of il forno pizzeria 
across the street from the main gate of fort sheridan in suburban 
chicago 
the base has about 2000 civilian employees and 2000 military 
employees including about 1000 fulltime soldiers who direct 
140000 reservists from seven states 
nobody likes to lose their job said fidel ghini mayor of 
neighboring highwood for the last two decades but look the 
federal government has a job to do its time we put a stop to all 
this waste 
the mood was somber in shops around fort dix nj the commission 
recommended that the armys secondlargest basic training site be 
reduced to semiactive status and that its complement of 8300 
permanent military and civilian jobs be cut by more than 4600 
i am very worried said bill ziotas as he leaned across the 
counter of the palace restaurant which he has owned for 24 years 
id have to close down because 65 percent of my business comes 
from fort dix i hope our politicians will be able to do something 
but what was bad news for some communities was welcome news in 
others that will gain jobs as a result of the closures 
in ingleside texas a naval base being built would receive 
fleets previously assigned to ports in galveston and lake charles 
la which were recommended for abandonment 
im glad to be off the hook said mark crawford mayor of the 
community 20 miles north of corpus christi ingleside will move 
forward in the right direction

politics and sex the mix that has rocked 
greek theater for 2400 years is finding new life in satirical 
shows that mock premier andreas papandreou and his relationship with 
a former flight attendant 
greeks are packing the capitals theaters to laugh at satires of 
the 69yearold socialist premier who is carrying on a public 
relationship with 34yearold dimitra liani while his governing 
panhellenic socialist movement is besieged by financial scandals 
public affairs sexual and political have been favorite topics 
for greek comedians since the playwright aristophanes made the 
combination a smash hit in the 5th century bc 
this year the writers didnt need much imagination 
papandreous heart operation in london last september inspired 
the title of a popular revue postaorta greece written and 
directed by lakis lazopoulos greeces top satirist 
lazopoulos asks innocently at each show if a newcomer to 
athens saw andreas and dimitra walking and holding hands what would 
he think 
that theres a nice girl helping an old man cross the street 
comes the answer 
outside the vembo theater a giant poster of papandreou and ms 
liani embracing advertises little dimitras sweetheart a 
takeoff of a classic greek folklore play the little 
shepherdesss sweetheart 
in the show an athens housewife is asked whether the premiers 
preelection pledges of political and social change have been 
fulfilled 
andreas has made one change ok he changed his american woman 
for a greek she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic 
applause 
three months ago papandreou said he will divorce his 66yearold 
americanborn wife margaret but no proceedings have yet been 
started the blonde ms liani has been divorced twice 
six political revues are playing over the holiday season 
according to boxoffice figures the shows are grossing up to 
37500 a week twice as much as the most successful drama in athens 
the socialists banned censorship when they came to power in 1981 
and the satirists say theyre not afraid of libel prosecution even 
for the bawdiest jokes about papandreou and ms liani 
i feel really free if i couldnt say the things i say i would 
suffocate said lazopoulos 31 who was acquitted in 1987 on 
charges of slandering greeces head of state president christos 
sartzetakis in one show 
greeks have no other way to let steam off if they couldnt 
laugh at their problems they would explode lazopoulos added 
according to critic eleni varopoulou the current shows mix of 
satirical sketches monologues songs and dance is styled after 
french revue and german cabaret 
but the acidity of the satire is what characterizes the greek 
revue she said 
other favorite targets range from family relations to the 
inadequate public varopoulou said the harsh greek satire isnt aimed 
at making people think but at soothing and relieving them so that 
by understanding their problem they exorcise it 
the revues used to be staged like ancient comedy or modern 
musicals with a glamorous chorus line and expensive costumes but 
the trend is toward less glitz and more realism varopoulou said 
lazopoulos says he prefers simple staging but notes the 
aristophanic tradition is still going strong 
i find we have the same attitude against authority as 
aristophanes we can never match his writing but we can try to match 
him in not being afraid to criticize he said

yen in tokyo ending the years final trading day at 12590 yen 
after opening at 12575 yen down 028 yen from thursdays 
closing the dollar inched up but failed to regain its thursday 
level it closed at 12590 yen down 013 yen after ranging between 
12575 and 12600 yen during the day 
dealers attributed the dollars losses in tokyo to its decline on 
overseas markets thursday 
a dealer at a major commercial bank in tokyo described trading as 
very thin ahead of the threeday new years holiday starting 
saturday 
after beginning the year in tokyo on jan 4 at 12045 yen its 
lowest level since modern exchange rates were established in the 
late 1940s the dollar stayed mostly between 120 and 130 yen in the 
first half of the year 
however in the second half it fluctuated between the low120 yen 
and mid130 yen levels after peaking at 13675 yen on sept 2 the 
us currency began declining to a low closing of 12088 yen on nov 
25 since then it has remained generally within the 120126 yen 
range 
currency dealers said more stability is expected in exchange 
rates in 1989 unless presidentelect bush makes drastic changes in 
his economic policy from that of the reagan administration 
but unless the united states succeeds in trimming its twin 
deficits the general tendency will be toward a weaker dollar 
against a stronger yen said a dealer at a us commercial bank in

played a vital role in the countrys defense over the years 
they include

now overlooking the golden gate bridge in san francisco the 
presidio has been a us army base since 1846 the presidio is now 
the headquarters of the 6th us army which controls army

mayor marion barry admitted visiting an 
acquaintance suspected of drug involvement caused some 
embarrassment for the city but said he was innocent of wrongdoing 
and would be extra extra careful to avoid appearances of 
impropriety in his personal life 
the citys us attorney meanwhile said thursday that his 
office had decided to conduct a full investigation of the incident 
in which the mayor visited a former city employee at a washington 
hotel just as police were preparing to attempt an undercover drug 
buy from the man 
the washington post in todays editions quoted an unidentified 
source as saying the fbi may join the federal investigation 
police have turned over to us attorney jay b stephens results 
of an internal probe into why two detectives were stopped from 
attempting a drug buy from former city employee charles lewis after 
barry turned up at lewis hotel room the incidence occurred a week 
ago 
earlier this week federal prosecutors had said only that they 
were reviewing what police investigators had found but on thursday 
stephens said his office is conducting a full investigation of 
this entire matter 
barry through spokesmen has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing 
on thursday he called a news conference to answer questions around 
the controversy and he vigorously denied using or seeing drugs in 
the hotel room 
i believe that one is innocent until proven guilty barry 
said but since last thursday i have been tried convicted 
sentenced and doing time by some members of the media 
barry has acknowledged making several visits to lewis whom he 
described as an acquaintance but denied any involvement with drugs 
asked in a separate interview on wjlatv whether he would submit 
to a drug test barry responded i would do anything necessary to 
get this issue behind us he said he would discuss it with his 
doctor and hell tell me what to do 
asked if that meant he would take the drug test if his doctor 
approved the mayor said he would absolutely 
however barrys spokesman john white said earlier that no 
purpose would be served by such a test since he doesnt do drugs 
the police investigation according to sources was focused on 
whether lewis was involved in any drug activity why the mayor was 
in the hotel and why the police officers did not search lewis 
hotel room until after he had checked out friday morning hotel 
employees police sources said initially had complained that lewis 
had offered drugs in return for sex 
the public needs to know what happened barry said i still 
have demanded and call for a complete investigation and a complete 
disclosure of this report so this city can get on with its 
business 
at the beginning of the news conference barry promised to 
provide details on his relationship with lewis but he revealed only 
that he met lewis when lewis worked for the district government the 
mayor refused to answer reporters questions after finishing his 
remarks 
while city employees applauded barry as he marched from the 
council chambers others were not impressed with the mayors 
comments 
he had an opportunity to talk to the nation and he missed that 
opportunity said city council chairman david clarke there were 
a lot of unanswered questions 
barrys latest controversy refocuses scrutiny on his personal 
life 
barry who is married acknowledged last year he once had a 
personal relationship with a convicted cocaine dealer karen 
johnson however he denied buying cocaine from her or using drugs 
with her and denied reports she had been paid hush money 
johnson had been jailed on contempt charges three years earlier 
after refusing to testify before a grand jury officials say the 
case remains under investigation

dr carl j johnson an early and 
outspoken critic of the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant has died 
of complications from heart surgery he was 59 
johnson died thursday at the lutheran medical center in this 
denver suburb his son frederick said 
johnson was forced to resign as jefferson county health director 
in may 1981 following his publication of studies showing a higher 
incidence of cancer in areas of jefferson and denver counties close 
to the rocky flats plant 16 miles northwest of denver 
johnson sued numerous county officials over the firing he 
received a 150000 settlement in january 1985 
they fired the messenger for the message said john holland 
the attorney who represented johnson in the case they killed off 
the communitys public health director for proving that the 
community had a major illness 
to me carl johnson was truly a great man his death is a 
tragedy in that its too early 
holland said johnson accomplished a great portion of his 
mission which was to revitalize the peoples right to live in a safe 
setting 
johnsons supporters said the government is now starting to 
acknowledge points he had been making for years 
for example the department of energy recently compiled a 
modernization report which calls for improvements to the nations 
nuclear weapons facilities through the year 2010 
according to a summary of the 250 billion energy department 
plan rocky flats recycling buildings would be upgraded between 
1990 and 1997 to continue operating safely as the plant is gradually 
shut down and relocated 
johnson recently had been doing consulting work on the effects of 
nuclear radiation holland said he wrote and published articles 
including a dec 18 column in the new york times headlined rocky 
flats death inc 
if the nation is to be properly protected all studies of 
nuclear contamination and associated health effects should be 
conducted primarily by independent scientists who are insulated from 
cynical retaliation he wrote 
the sims ind native received his medical degree in 1965 from 
ohio state university college of medicine he also held a masters 
degree in public health from the university of california school of 
public health at berkeley 
he became jefferson county health director in 1973 
following his resignation he spent five years as a medical 
officer with the south dakota health department in pierre sd he 
recently returned to denver 
as controversy surrounding rocky flats built over the past four 
months johnson appeared and spoke at almost every public forum 
he also served as a colonel in the medical corps of the us army 
reserve from 1970 until his death 
johnson is survived by his wife kathryn and three sons

prime minister yitzhak shamir wants to launch a 
peace initiative within two months and will seek egypts help in 
finding nonplo palestinian negotiators an aide said today 
also today the mayor of the west bank town of bethlehem said he 
proposed the un security council pass a resolution calling for a 
truce to end the yearlong palestinian uprising 
i spoke about a unsponsored resolution like the one that 
stopped the iraniraq war and on condition that israel releases 
all prisoners jailed on security charges and reopens universities 
mayor elias freij said in an interview 
about 5000 palestinians are in jail including about 1600 held 
without trial under administrative detention five palestinian 
universities and 16 twoyear colleges are closed 
freij made the proposal in a meeting with romanian president 
nicolae ceaucescu two weeks ago freij said he asked that the 
proposal be passed to plo chief yasser arafat he said arafat has 
not yet responded 
freijs statement came as palestinians debated the possibility of 
a conditional truce as a prelude to elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip where 17 million palestinians live under israeli 
military occupation 
the debate is taking place in advance of shamirs expected 
unveiling of a plan for starting arabisraeli peace negotiations 
avi pazner spokesman for shamir said the premier hoped to start 
his peace initiative within two months about the time shamir is 
expected to visit washington for talks with the bush administration 
in an interview pazner said shamir was agreeable to talks being 
launched by the united states and soviet union shamir also 
envisioned a major role for egypt in helping find palestinians 
that would be acceptable to israel which has refused to negotiate 
with the plo 
pazner denied reports that egypt would broker the process or that 
the superpowers would formally guide the negotiations he said 
shamir insisted on direct talks between israel and the arabs 
if the two superpowers call on neighbors to negotiate thats 
all right but the talks would be direct talks pazner said 
the yediot ahronot newspaper reported thursday the israeli plan 
proposes an unofficial understanding that palestinian negotiators be 
chosen or appointed by the plo but not belong to plo institutions or 
have a terrorist past 
officials have declined comment on the report but shamir aide 
yossi ahimeir said choosing palestinians was the internal 
business of the arab side 
we only insist that there should be no plo people or people 
identified with the plo he said 
shimon shamir israels ambassador to egypt was summoned to 
jerusalem and met foreign minister moshe arens today amid reports 
israel was planning to present new proposals to egypt soon 
both shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc and his political 
rival shimon peres of the labor party have hinted that their 
coalition government will propose holding palestinian elections as 
part of a peace package 
as a condition for any such concessions shamir and peres insist 
that palestinians end the violence in the occupied lands since the 
palestinian uprising broke out in december 1987 339 arabs and 14 
israelis have been killed 
in the past clandestine leaders of the uprising and prominent 
palestinians above ground have called for elections but the latest 
underground leaflets and a statement from the plos executive 
committee both opposed the israeli proposals 
saeb erakat a political science professor at an najah university 
in the west bank city of nablus said the election idea was another 
israeli attempt to find an alternative to recognizing the plo 
why stall and lose time and try to escape the realities of 
peacemaking he said i think we should tell israel that instead 
of introducing such ideas you should face the plo 
jack khazmo palestinian publisher of the weekly al bayader al 
siyassi magazine in jerusalem noted that of the palestinian 
officials elected in west bank municipal elections in 1972 and 1976 
israel deposed nine mayors and deported three others 
even if we say yes to the elections who will guarantee that the 
israelis will not interfere in such elections he said 
despite such doubts some palestinians have given conditional 
support to the idea 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily newspaper al fajr in 
jerusalem proposed balloting be held in three stages a referendum 
on the plos declaration of independence municipal elections and 
selection of representatives who could serve as a link to the plo 
these palestinians can serve as a bridge with the plo if they 
are allowed to go back and forth to jordan and carry messages 
he said 
the israeli concept of elections has not been clearly defined 
peres aides have suggested elections would choose a new leadership 
to talk with israel about a settlement but shamir aides suggest 
elections would choose only an administrative council as part of a 
palestinian autonomy scheme 
the liberal daily haaretz newspaper said palestinian willingness 
for a truce had been conveyed to us diplomats by leading figures 
in the occupied territories

here is a condensed transcript of the pentagon 
briefing thursday on recommendations by the defense secretarys 
commission on military base closings participants were deputy 
defense secretary william h taft iv and commission cochairmen 
abraham ribicoff and jack edwards 
ribicoff we believe the results reflect a balanced report to 
eliminate unnecessary installation capacity without restricting the 
flexibility of our national security managers during future 
mobilizations contingencies and changes in the international 
political environment the recommended changes reflect an 
opportunity to improve the nations defense position 
edwards we would like to take this opportunity to thank the 
department and the congress for this opportunity to participate in a 
unique effort which will not only save taxpayers dollars but also 
improve our national defense posture 
during the course of developing our recommendations we used 
improvement in military value of our domestic base structure as the 
preeminent consideration our report presents an opportunity to 
reduce training costs in terms of manpower overhead costs and fuel 
to improve command and control to consolidate training and improve 
economies of scale and to remove unnecessary administrative burdens 
to our defense managers 
add to these improvements an opportunity to eliminate some future 
military construction costs and to save almost 700 million a year 
in base operating costs with a 20year net present value of 56 
billion 
despite these improvements we do not anticipate any substantial 
socioeconomic disruption to the communities that are closely linked 
with bases recommended for closure 
in terms of environmental impact we see little negative impact 
from these recommendations and in many instances improvement for 
the natural surroundings 
ribicoff there are 145 installations affected there are 86 for 
closure five for partial closure 54 bases have been realigned the 
estimation is 693 million saved per year in base operating costs 
and 56 billion to be saved over 20 years on the net present value 
there are about 20 major ones 
edwards i guess generally you would look at the la area fort 
george and the air force base in norton generally you would look 
in illinois at chanute field and fort sheridan generally you would 
probably look at fort devens in massachusetts the washington 
national capital region area which would include meade belvoir and 
holabird you would look at perhaps pease air force base up in new 
hampshire i guess those are the big areas 
ribicoff it goes from page 52 to page 69 in the report and i 
think you will find that to be a very accurate explanation of the 
rationale and what is happening to those bases 
edwards fort dix nj is going into what we call 
semiactive status there will be a group of probably 500 or so 
people there who will maintain it have it available for reserve 
activity have it available for active duty training from time to 
time have it available in the event troops are brought home from 
some part of the world it will be there to support mcguire air 
force base and the naval station at lakehurst 
we broke down all of the military facilities into various 
categories and in our breakdown dix came out at the bottom of the 
list in a category where we had excess capacity basic training 
advanced individual training and these types of things 
we have moved those kinds of activities from dix to various 
facilities in the country some to fort knox some to fort leonard 
wood mo some to fort jackson sc and in the process we moved 
some out of fort bliss in texas so all of it becomes compatible 
what weve tried to do is bring training areas together to the 
extent that we could where we could justify it 
q you mentioned in your opening statement that you didnt expect 
any of these communities to be adversely affected by this i think 
a lot of the communities will find that hard to swallow 
edwards of course they will i said substantial socioeconomic 
impact of course they will have a hard time swallowing it 
there are some areas where the impact is obviously larger than 
others but we have a section in here that deals with ways in 
which communities can help themselves when they feel this kind of 
impact 
the office of economic adjustment in the defense department has a 
great ability to move in and help a community work out its problems 
where possible we have not moved troops across the country but next 
door in the same state or in an adjoining state 
q perhaps you could tell me what sort of thinking went into your 
decision to close the presidio in san francisco 
edwards the presidio sits in the middle of san francisco or 
thereabouts and it cant grow it cant do any more than its 
doing theres no way it can expand its prohibited by laws of 
california and other laws as far as expansion is concerned its in 
a highvalue area and the operations at the presidio can be done by 
and large most anywhere

q to what extent does the property value of these bases that 
youve chosen play a role in your decision and how many total 
jobs are we talking about here being lost 
edwards the first thing we looked at was military value without 
a doubt i mean that was our touchstone and if a base had military 
value then we didnt bother it if the base was lacking in military 
value then it became a candidate to look at 
we obviously did not ignore cost savings we used as our 
guideline a sixyear payback as set out in the charter and so if a 
facility did not meet the sixyear payback then its not in our 
list in some instances we looked at estimates as to what we could 
sell the property for but it was not the cornerstone of our 
activity 
q how about the jobs question 
edwards i dont know whether we actually totaled all that 
youll see a column that talks about personnel out and personnel in 
both military and civilian and i think if youll ust run your 
finger down the column to the area youre looking for youll see 
the impact 
q is this the end of it in your mind or can a year from now a 
similar commission come back and recommend a similar number of 
bases i mean a 56 billion savings over a certain number of years 
is rather insignificant when you consider the total defense budget 
ribicoff we think the basic responsibility should be in the 
hands of the secretary of defense there should be an ongoing study 
to see what changes should be made in the bases weve recommended 
that there should be a highlevel small group of people to go over 
this with the secretary of defense but i would hope that there 
wouldnt always be a commission like ours that would be necessary to 
do the whole job over again 
the training is altogether different with the new technology 
were going to have to acquire larger tracts of land many of the 
present bases are limited because they have been surrounded by large 
urban areas and their effectiveness has been destroyed so i think 
the country is going to have to take a good hard look and the 
defense department as to what future training will have to be for 
future wars and the changes that are going to take place 
q can you tell us what the upfront costs of closing and 
realigning these bases are 
edwards well lets see the najavo army depot in arizona just 
to pull one out of there its going to cost 11 million to make 
that move but it will pay back in annual savings 305 million and 
so its going to take us four years to recover that initial cost of 
the move before we start making annual savings but then they are 
annual savings forever 
q as two former members of congress how do you think the 
reaction on the hill will be to this 
edwards i believe the leadership of the armed services 
committees of both the house and the senate favor this exercise 
taking place theres no question that many congressmen and senators 
are going to be upset when they see this list especially if it 
affects their community 
i would anticipate from my own general conversations from 
the time we were appointed to the present that congress will accept 
it 
q there are some lawmakers especially from california who have 
already argued that the the state has been unfairly hit here 
your reaction to that 
edwards a lot of the activity in southern california that is 
reported in here has to do with norton and george they are both 
encroached by air traffic congestion from the la airport they 
cant train adequately because of that problem they both have major 
problems in attracting hightechnology employees because of the 
activity in that area in the civilian sector and we felt that we 
really just had no alternative but to deal with that 
mather air force base calif they are a good distance away 
from their training area they have to fly over 150 nautical miles 
just to get to the area where they train their particular aircraft 
and pilots we have moved them into mountain home idaho where 
there is an electronic training range right there i like to 
think theres a rationale to what weve done 
ribicoff i think they the air force recognize the great 
changes that have taken place in training with the present type of 
equipment and the present time of aircraft and what has happened in 
the urban areas and they realize that changes have to be made and 
california is the fastest growing state in the union when it 
comes to urban encroachment and the elimination of open spaces that 
air forces need 
q what happens if the list is rejected by congress will 
you gentlemen start over 
edwards we are a oneshot unique kind of an organization when 
we hand this report over we are finished

q congressman les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee suggested that there was a loophole in this 
whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to 
close these bases and by use of that loophole bases could be 
prevented from being closed did you address that question and what 
did you do about it 
edwards there is a problem because the proceeds of the sales of 
these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of 
this law and those proceeds are not going to start coming in on day 
one its going to take a while to come in and so we have 
recommended in this report that congress in fiscal 1990 
appropriate 300 million to put the first money in the fund so we 
can start the process and obviously if congress refuses to 
appropriate enough money to get the process going then its 
going to be very difficult 
q its often said that certain bases have remained open over the 
years for political or pork barrel reasons did you find any 
evidence of that in your study and how far have you gone to 
eliminating it if thats the case 
ribicoff i dont think there was any influence or any attempt to 
protect pork barrel bases i dont think that was taken into account 
at all i dont think anybody on the commission felt any pressure 
we looked at these bases seriously we looked at all the figures we 
spent a lot of time in discussion each and every base was voted on 
unanimously with the action taken 
edwards you should understand first that we simply did not start 
with a list we started with a set of criteria which we applied 
to all 4300 installations in this country and we took those as 
we found them 
q there are four states that are missing west virginia 
mississippi georgia and wisconsin all home states of the chairmen 
of the armed services and appropriations committees were there no 
bases in those states worthy of closing 
edwards thats certainly not by design we did take a little 
something out of fort mcpherson in georgia i recall i dont 
believe we touched wisconsin west virginia im going to bet 
doesnt have a whole lot of military in the first place we had 
to deal with bases where we found them 
q could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes 
that are going to take place at fort devens and some of the other 
bases that are getting increases of people 
ribicoff we found that certain missions were split between a 
number of bases they didnt make any sense when they should have 
been consolidated and put in one base and what we did in many 
instances we just do that and especially when you talk about fort 
devens you will find a shift from one fort to the other one 
base to the other which will make it more effective more 
efficient and be able to do a much better job with their mission 
q i wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the 
value of strategic home porting to see whether dispersion of ships 
offers protection in the nuclear age or whether its really just a 
way of building local political support for various naval tasks 
edwards i dont know anything that was discussed more than 
strategic home porting we concluded that our job was not to 
deal with force structure thats the militarys job our job 
was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it and try 
to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with and 
so we had to live with the fact that theres going to be a 600ship 
navy maybe there never will be but we dont know that 
so we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you 
going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the 
450ship navy and we concluded that we could justify some home 
ports most of them 
q if it were not for political constraints could you actually 
expand your list are there a lot of other bases you consider 
still vulnerable or could be effectively closed 
edwards the biggest constraint is the sixyear payback 
constraint we found a lot of facilities that had 10year paybacks 
12year paybacks even 20year paybacks where we could have made 
some major savings over a longer period of time but we were 
constrained by our charter which had a sixyear payback 
ribicoff once you got over the six years we had to stop i 
think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if 
we werent stuck with that sixyear payback 
q in other words some of these places survived because of 
their inefficiency 
edwards no i think it may cost a lot of money to move one 
facility into another base and have to build allnew construction 
and your payback just simply wont make it

ribicoff it just goes to prove that theres still a lot of work 
to be done and it should be ongoing and i would hope the next 
secretary of defense would take this job very very seriously 
theres money to be saved and with tight budget restraints youre 
going to have to save it wherever you can for basic important 
purposes in the defense establishment 
q some of the bases are under construction such as the naval 
station in galveston texas whats the rationale for closing that 
the state of texas has already spent 8 million building a highway 
to it 
edwards my recollection is that we could save 8 million a year 
forever laughter we concluded that galveston was primarily a 
reserve center in the home port plan that lake charles had only had 
one oiler and one minesweeper and that they could be moved to 
engleside so that we would put together in one place in texas the 
carrier the battleship and the support ships thats the west gulf 
then on the east gulf you would have the 
pascagoulamobilepensacola complex so youd have two complexes on 
the gulf instead of whatever they were 
q some of the bases have been on hit lists things have changed 
over the years the base that led to the obstructing legislation was 
loring air force base in maine what has changed over the years to 
make that coldweather base which was considered obsolete in 1977 
necessary now 
rep edwards i cant give you chapter and verse because it 
didnt come through on our sixyear payback one of the things 
we had to deal with was the fact that a lot of the bases that were 
along the coast such as pease the airplanes that would go in a 
base like that are better centrally located in the united states 
because of the time it takes for the soviets or some enemy to get a 
missile lobbed in and you dont need them right up on the front 
lines anymore 
q did you at all assess the impact on defense contractors that 
support these facilities 
edwards we did not 
ribicoff no 
q i could not find fort monroe va anywhere who saved it 
edwards me laughter i personally went to fort monroe to look 
at it and i saw the moat and the old historic buildings i 
also saw what would amount to around 900 million in cleanup costs 
to get rid of the old shells that had been lobbed over on part of 
that fort for the last 200 years or however long it was i also saw 
the cost of building new facilities to house all of those people 
3000 or 4000 people as i recall and it just didnt even come 
close to our sixyear payback it was more like a 20year payback at 
best and in part because theres no real market value for that 
property it would become perhaps a museum one day i dont 
know any developer in his right mind who would want to go in there 
and buy that property

american scientists today said they will 
join vietnamese archeologists in a remote cave outside hanoi to 
search for remains of the largest known ape a 9foot primate that 
became extinct 200000 years ago 
the excavation planned for jan 428 is being billed as the 
first field research project involving scientists of the two 
countries since the beginning of the war in indochina 
paleoanthropologist russell ciochon said he and three other 
americans would join about 10 vietnamese scientists at the limestone 
cave where remains have been found of the gigantopithecus an 
ape known only from sites in southern china and vietnam 
despite some earlier research by vietnamese east german and 
french scientists very little is known about the giant which is 
related to the orangutan chimpanzee and gorilla 
only jawbones and teeth of the animal have been uncovered but 
ciochon said the team hoped to find more remains in the cave 75 
miles southwest of hanoi which served as a weapons depot and bomb 
shelter during the vietnam war 
one thing we know about it is that it was very big ciochon 
told reporters it was probably a fourfooted vegetarian animal 
weighing about 770 pounds that became extinct 200000 to 300000 
years ago the americans said 
there is speculation early man may have hunted the ape to 
extinction the team hopes to establish relationships between homo 
erectus the direct ancestor of modern humans stone tools used by 
early man and the giant ape since the remains of all three have been 
found in the area of the cave 
ciochon from the university of iowa said the americans were 
bringing in special rock saws and generators for the excavation he 
said these would be turned over to vietnamese counterparts when the 
americans returned home 
two vietnamese scientists are to visit the united states later 
bringing fossils from the excavation site 
the national geographic society which is sending a team to 
vietnam to film a documentary on the excavation is the main backer 
of the expedition 
although the united states and vietnam have no diplomatic 
relations informal exchanges have increased the past two years 
however hanoi permits far more american academics journalists and 
others to visit vietnam than washington does vietnamese to enter the 
united states 
ciochon said members of his team had visited vietnam in 1987 and 
1988 for preliminary surveys 
ciochon said research on the gigantopithecus in china has been 
hampered by site disturbances remains of the ape have been ground 
up to be sold as medicine 
in vietnam he said this practice does not exist and the 
potential of finding substantial fossil remains is considerable 
other american members of the expedition are ms k semendeferi 
of the university of iowa and john olsen and mary kay gilliland 
olsen of the university of arizona the vietnamese scientists come 
from the institute of archaeology in hanoi

reinforcements

the labor department plans hearings early next 
year to discuss lifting a world war iiera regulation that bars 
apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their homes 
the department planned to publish in todays edition of the 
federal register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the 
first formal step for lifting the ban said allan mcmillan a deputy 
assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition 
presidentelect bush urged the action last october after the 
labor department won approval from the white house budget office to 
remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective 
jan 8 
mcmillan said the labor department will hold hearings on the 
proposal in miami on feb 2223 in san antonio texas on march 
23 and in chicago on march 89 
the prohibitions on apparel industry homework were imposed in 
1942 to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other 
lowwage workers lifting them has been the reagan administrations 
top deregulatory proposal in the labor relations area for the past 
several years 
the international ladies garment workers union which represents 
some 170000 workers said last week it will seek a court injunction 
next week to prohibit the further removal of any of the remaining 
bans on homework

racial strife involving african students has 
spread to a second chinese city with africans at a university in 
hangzhou protesting rumors they were carriers of the disease aids 
about 65 africans attending zhejiang agriculture university in 
hangzhou have stayed in their dormitory since monday boycotting 
classes and demanding to leave china a student from cameroon said 
he said university officials have blocked attempts to leave the 
eastern chinese city 
the student speaking on condition of anonymity said university 
officials had implied they were carriers of the fatal disease aids 
they treat us like criminals he said 
further details of the dispute were inpeded by poor telephone 
connections university officials were not available for comment 
hangzhou is about 140 miles southeast of nanking scene of five 
days of antiafrican demonstrations stemming from a christmas eve 
fight between african students and chinese 
chinese officials have isolated about 140 african students and 
other foreign sympathizers in a remote guest house outside the city 
to protect them from chinese demonstrators demanding africans 
responsible for injuring 11 chinese be brought to justice 
the chinese side has refused the africans request to leave 
nanking and only those students who agree to return to their 
schools are being allowed to leave the guest house almost all the 
africans say they fear for their safety and will not return to the 
city 
the xinhua daily nankings leading daily ran a frontpage story 
today for the second straight day expressing understanding for the 
anger of the chinese youth and saying the troublemakers a 
minority of foreign students will be punished 
africans come from developing countries and are struggling 
the article said this is not easy but china will not forgive 
those students who break chinas law 
the story also appealed for calm and quoted professors from 
nanking teachers college as saying we mustnt turn a schools 
problem into a social problem 
yang ruiju president of hehai university said thursday that no 
chinese would be punished for breaking windows and destroying 
property at the african students dormitory during the christmas eve 
brawl 
yang said seven or eight africans were being investigated for 
their involvement in the fight which began when africans refused to 
register the names of their chinese girlfriends they were taking to 
a campus party 
a palestinian student in nanking said today that chinese who 
visited the guest house the previous day had been told seven 
africans the same troublemakers referred to by yang had been 
separated from the other foreign students 
there are an estimated 1500 africans from 40 nations studying at 
chinese universities 
china has long provided scholarships for africans in solidarity 
with developing african states but social tensions which africans 
attribute to ingrained racial prejudices against blacks have 
occasionally flared out into violence between the chinese and 
africans

chicagoborn abe stolar said today his family has 
received permission to emigrate and that he would finally be leaving 
the soviet union for the first time in more than a halfcentury 
theres no feeling yet its just a big mess thinking of all 
the things we have to do stolar said in perfect english in a 
telephone call 
the long struggle came to an end when stolars daughterinlaw 
received word she would be allowed to join the rest of the family in 
emigrating stolar his wife and son received exit visas in 1975 but 
his daughterinlaw was not given a visa so the family decided not 
to leave 
stolars case has been the subject of negotiations between the 
united states and the soviets for years and its resolution was 
another in a series of kremlin moves to improve the countrys human 
rights record 
numerous prominent refuseniks or jews denied permission to 
emigrate have been allowed to leave since mikhail s gorbachev took 
power in march 1985 
stolar a 77yearold jew has not been out of the soviet union 
since his parents ardent american communists brought him here in 
1931 
his parents left the american depression behind to help build the 
new soviet union but in 1937 his father disappeared in one of 
dictator josef stalins bloody purges 
stolar who still holds us citizenship served with the red 
army during world war ii and afterward became an announcer and 
translator for radio moscow 
i have news now an excited stolar said in beginning the 
phone call 
he explained that he was numb after learning his family could 
leave 
they drag it out so long its been 13 years they try to drag 
it out the main thing now is to try to be calm and not to forget 
anything which is hard 
his 29yearold son michael said he was not very excited 
i have no special feelings he said perhaps in some time i 
will feel happy but now perhaps its shock i cant say i am happy 
but i cannot say i am not happy 
the younger stolar said he was probably reserved because he was 
worried about friends who are having trouble emigrating and who are 
not getting the support like his family did from the us government 
michael stolar said his wife julia shurukht had telephoned 
ovir the government agency that handles emigration matters on 
monday and tuesday a deputy chief of the office said she would be 
allowed to join the family in emigrating a postcard confirming the 
verbal notification is expected to arrive next week and then the 
family plans to fly to israel he said 
after getting settled in israel the family plans to make their 
first trip to the united states to visit friends 
the latest in a series of snags that held up ms shurukhts 
emigration was that her mother refused to sign a form saying her 
daughter did not have any financial obligations to her abe stolar 
said the mother apparently has now signed the form

a political analyst says alderman timothy evans 
thirdparty bid for mayor may wind up accomplishing the very things 
he hoped to avoid splitting the black vote and returning a daley 
to city hall 
evans announced thursday that he was withdrawing from februarys 
democratic primary to run in the general election as the candidate 
of the harold washington party which he created and named after 
chicagos first black mayor 
that leaves mayor eugene sawyer evans chief black rival in a 
primary showdown against richard m daley cook county prosecutor 
and son of the late mayor richard j daley who ruled chicago for 
more than two decades 
evans repeatedly said he was not endorsing sawyer in the primary 
but urged supporters to do whatever they can do to defeat daley 
who according to early polls is the frontrunner among announced 
candidates 
evans may ultimately regret both positions said eugene kennedy 
a loyola university professor author of a biography of the elder 
daley and a veteran political observer 
he urged black voters to keep away from sawyer kennedy said 
then he made repeated references to daley as though he were 
somehow evil and that all whites by implication were somehow 
the enemy 
on the one hand he weakens the very cause he purports to 
support a black mayor for chicago on the other hes galvanized 
the white ethnic opposition kennedy said 
evans 45 was washingtons floor leader in the city council and 
has tried since the late mayors death to portray himself as heir to 
washingtons legacy as a reformer 
sawyer 54 was chosen to succeed washington by many of the same 
city council members who were washingtons staunchest opponents he 
and evans have waged a costly struggle for the loyalty of the black 
community 
evans said some believed sawyer should have withdrawn from the 
primary because it is clear from all the available evidence i am 
the choice of an overwhelming majority of our coalition 
but as he has refused to do so i will make that move secure 
in the knowledge that i am at once serving uniting and leading our 
great coalition on a course that will result in a historic 
victory he added 
the daley and sawyer camps expressed little surprise at evans 
move thursday 
mr daley has said all along that whats important are the 
issues crime education and health not whos in or whos out or 
what the numbers are said daley spokeswoman marj halperin 
mayor sawyer did not expect tim evans endorsement in the 
primary and hed have been surprised if there was one said a 
sawyer spokesman who refused to be identified 
the mayor felt all along the important thing was to remove the 
onus from both himself and mr evans of splitting the black vote 
the spokesman said that was everybodys greatest fear and that has 
now been removed

thirtysix students who fled burmas 
military crackdown flew home today and authorities allowed a 
onemonth extension for thousands of others to return from the thai 
border region 
government spokesman kyaw sann told reporters the government had 
extended its deadline from saturday to jan 31 for the students to 
return 
a burmese air force plane brought back the second group of 
students since the government announced all students who fled after 
the sept 18 military coup and had sought haven could return without 
retribution 
a group of 80 students arrived in rangoon on monday from a 
special transition camp in the northern thai city of tak near 
guerrillaheld border areas 
among the second group was aung mo myint 20 his elder brother 
had returned on monday and at that time their father made an 
emotional plea for the return of his other son 
aung mo myint wept when he asked a reporter about his father and 
was told of the plea 
he said he did not accompany his brother earlier because i was 
skeptical about the governments intention i am now convinced that 
it is genuine and we are safe to be back in our country i am sure 
others will also return we heard on the radio about the receptions 
here 
another student hkun thaung myine said he felt sorry for his 
colleagues left behind some of whom he said may have difficulties 
in escaping from the rebels 
thai officials said 19 other students remained in the camp in 
tak including some whose departures were delayed because they were 
waiting for friends and relatives still staying with burmese 
insurgents along the border they estimate 7000 students remain 
along the border 
university students led massive nationwide demonstrations for 
democracy in burma until the new military authorities crushed the 
protests 
many of the students found jungle life too harsh or said the 
guerrillas mistreated them 
the protests prompted the resignation in july of ne win who 
overthrew a civilian government in 1962 and led burmas only 
political party since then in august maung maung became burmas 
first civilian leader in 26 years declared an end to a multiparty 
state and promised elections 
he was overthrown by army gen saw maung a month later saw maung 
also has promised elections but has not issued a date for elections 
the agreement to repatriate the students was reached by saw maung 
and gen chavalit yongchaiyudh the thai army chief who on dec 14 
became the first high foreign official to visit burma since the coup

a college lecturer was cleared of 
charges he made a bomb threat on an american airlines flight after 
an 11yearold boy admitted he wrote the note and left it on the 
aircraft says an apologetic fbi 
charges against peter w canning a lecturer in literature at the 
university of californiaberkeley were dropped thursday after the 
boy told the fbi he wrote the note 
canning 40 found the note on an american airlines jetliner 
tuesday gave it to a flight attendant and was arrested by the fbi 
the fbis top new mexico agent jim nelson said he regrets any 
inconvenience and embarassment suffered by mr canning 
however the investigation fully warranted the arrest of 
canning which occurred after consulting with the us attorneys 
office in albuquerque nelson said 
canning a harvard doctoral candidate could not be reached for 
comment because he was driving home to berkeley when the charges 
were dropped by us magistrate sumner g buell in albuquerque he 
had been released on his own recognizance the previous day 
canning had insisted all along that the note fell into his lap 
from his seat tray while lunch was being served on the flight from 
san francisco to dallas he handed the note to a flight attendant 
who notified the pilot 
the plane was diverted to albuquerque and was searched for about 
four hours with bombsniffing dogs 
the boy came forward with his parents thursday and admitted 
writing the note during a flight to san francisco earlier tuesday 
said fbi spokesman douglas beldon the note was put on the pullout 
tray before it was stowed away he said 
the note said read this there are guns pointed at you if you 
want to live read the letter underneath and do what it says this 
is a bomb scare read this ps if you do what the letter says and 
have everyone else do it you will live ps if you dont you are 
history there are bombs planted all over this airplane and there 
is a gun pointed at your head take your wallet and throw it in the 
aisle now 
at the time of the arrest federal agents said there were 
similarities between cannings handwriting and the note 
agents determined that the boy sat in the seat later occupied by 
canning beldon said he said the us attorneys office in san 
francisco declined to prosecute the boy 
cannings attorney ray twohig had said the arrest resulted from 
fbi confusion im glad theyve cleared up their confusion he 
said thursday 
asked if the crash of a pan am jumbo jet in scotland last week 
might have affected the way this case was handled twohig said 
sure everybody was jumpy 
i just hope that people who read about this and hear about this 
arent discouraged from reporting things twohig said canning has 
said he almost withheld the note

a man who spent 2 million to pressure the 
food industry into making healthier products says hes pleasantly 
surprised by pepperidge farms decision to stop using coconut oil in 
crackers and cookies 
ultimately pepperidge farms will have saved thousands of 
lives phil sokolof said thursday 
coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises cholesterol levels 
people who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of 
clogged arteries that can lead to heart disease 
pepperidge farm announced wednesday that it would stop using 
coconut oil in numerous products including its popular original 
goldfish in response to strong consumer concern 
frankly im surprised because pepperidge farm has a 
multimilliondollar undertaking on their hands to change their 
products said sokolof founder of the nebraskabased national 
heart savers 
pepperidge farm will have to come up with new recipes for more 
than 50 brands of cookies and crackers said sokolof whose group 
has campaigned against products using tropical oils 
we must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of 
performance in the baking process flavor texture mouthfeel and 
shelflife stability richard a shea president of the 
norwalkbased company said in a statement issued wednesday 
coconut and palm oil are popular with food manufacturers because 
they help extend the shelf life of food products sokolof said 
many products advertised as being free of cholesterol contain 
tropical oils that can help cholesterol form after consumption he 
said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat than lard 
sokolof placed advertisments in newspapers in october depicting 
nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods but are 
poisoning americans with saturated fats

communist north korea is producing 
chemical weapons at eight plants and organizing chemical warfare 
units to help maintain superiority over south korean and us 
forces officials said today 
a report by the south korean defense ministry disclosed for the 
first time that north korea was producing chemical weapons 
including poison gas at eight cities including sinhung and sinuju 
chemical weapons would probably be used to knock out south korean 
and us forces as part of lightning attacks if the north invaded 
officials said the united states has 42000 troops based in the 
south under a defense pact 
the report part of an overview on south and north korean 
military forces said the north also has six storage sites for 
chemical weapons and three research and development centers 
storage centers are located near the south korean border for 
possible use in a war the report said chemical weapons factories 
are based in the north of the country with many close to the 
chinese and soviet borders it said 
us military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said they were aware of reports of north koreas chemical warfare 
capability but declined to comment further 
north korea had formed chemical warfare units and attached them 
to infantry regiments officials said the north is expected to 
eventually deploy chemical they said 
the north is also producing sovietdesigned scud and frog 
missiles with ranges of up to 180 miles that could be used to 
deliver chemical warheads officials said 
the officials could not say when chemical weapons might be 
deployed by north korea they noted that the north had been 
developing chemical weapons since the 1960s 
south korean and us forces have antichemical warfare gear 
such as gas masks and chemical warfare suits the two governments 
decline to say if they deploy chemical weapons in south korea 
us forces in south korea reportedly possess battlefield nuclear 
weapons but washington refuses to confirm or deny the reports 
the south korean report noted that seoul is making advances in 
building up its defenses and expects to end the norths military 
superiority by the start of the next century 
but it said that north korea still has a substantial edge in 
troops and weapons and was producing large numbers of tanks 
artillery pieces rockets and other weapons 
north and south korea have been conducting talks aimed at easing 
tensions but the bitter rivals have hundreds of thousands of 
heavilyarmed troops poised along their border 
the two nations were formed after us and soviet forces ended 
the japanese occupation at the end of the second world war in 1945 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 prompting the bloody 
threeyear korean war

reporter bob woodward has revealed that the late 
us supreme court justice potter stewart was the confidential 
source for his bestselling insiders look at the high court the 
brethren 
in an interview published in the february issue of playboy 
magazine the washington post reporter said he was willing to 
identify stewart because the former justice is dead stewart died in 
1985 at age 70 
im revealing his name now for the first time because its 
worth showing that there really are sources people do talk 
woodward said 
its not some reporters imagination or some letter that comes 
in the mail with no address typed on a standard typewriter 
woodward said you have relationships you nurture them and they 
pay off 
woodward said he met stewart at a party in the spring of 1977 
the brethren was published in 1979 
although woodward was willing to identify his main source for 
the brethren which he wrote with reporter scott armstrong he 
told playboy he was not ready to identify deep throat 
deep throat was the key informer woodward and carl bernstein 
used for their pulitzer prizewinning articles uncovering the 1972 
watergate scandal in post and for their subsequent bestselling 
book all the presidents men 
as you know im not going to discuss the identity of deep 
throat or any other of my confidential sources who are still 
alive woodward said 
woodward said stewart turned out to have real intellectual 
disdain for former chief justice warren burger and former attorney 
general john mitchell both appointees of president richard nixon 
woodward said stewarts animosities became clear as he worked on 
the book and were probably the reason stewart allowed him to have a 
behindthescenes look at the high court 
what also came across was stewarts contempt for richard 
nixon woodward said he felt that what had happened with carls 
bernstein and my watergate reporting was very important for the 
country and for journalism and for subduing this rightist movement 
in america tamping it down and saying whoa the guys who had 
proclaimed they were going to fight crime turned out to be the 
criminals

two french girls held hostage in lebanon for 13 
months by a palestinian terrorist group rejoined their father and 
went into seclusion today in france their hometown meanwhile 
prepared a homecoming celebration 
the long journey home took marielaure betille 7 and her sister 
virginie 6 by boat from lebanon to libya where they were turned 
over to french officials and flown to france late thursday 
their hometown of ollioules near toulon set up welcoming 
banners and french flags on its streets today mayor rene arnaud 
said the town would give the girls a belated christmas celebration 
left behind in the hands of abu nidals fatah revolutionary 
council a palestinian guerrilla organization was their mother 
jacqueline valente a baby sister born in captivity and five 
belgians also seized aboard the yacht silco off israels occupied 
gaza strip 
their captors who have been blamed for numerous terrorist 
attacks said the girls freedom was a gift to france from the 
children of the yearlong palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
french newspapers today suggested the release was a propaganda 
ploy by libyan leader col moammar gadhafi to improve his image at a 
time when the us government has raised concerns about an alleged 
chemical weapons plant in libya the palestinian kidnappers are 
backed by libya 
marielaure virginie and their father pascal betille arrived 
in a french government plane at a secluded military base near 
marseille a foreign ministry spokeswoman said they were then taken 
to a hospital for checkups and then to a secret location for sleep 
the girls dressed in dark robes their shoulders draped with 
plaid arab scarves had been reunited with their father hours 
earlier in the libyan capital of tripoli 
betilles lawyer yves massiani said thursday night that the 
children had said nothing of their detention talking only of 
their boat trip 
gadhafi called for the girls release on christmas eve and on 
two occasions they were reported freed and en route home the 
palestinian group has ties to libya 
france welcomes this humanitarian gesture in appropriate 
measure the foreign ministry said it thanks foreign 
authorities who contributed it added without elaboration 
a statement in beirut by fatahrevolutionary council spokesman 
walid khaled said the girls release was a gift to the french 
authorities in the name of the children of palestine the 
children of the revolution of the stones on the occasion of 
christmas and new year 
khaled said saturday the girls would be freed following a call 
from gadhafi in the following days he said they were en route home 
but when there was no sign of the children the initial suspense 
turned to confusion and despair for relatives who spent the 
christmas weekend in beirut seeking the childrens release 
there was no immediate comment from the childrens relatives 
about their arrival 
a later dispatch by the official libyan news agency reported a 
call from gadhafi to liberation movements to free all hostages 
once again i ask the fatahrevolutionary council and the rest 
of the liberation movements in the middle east to respond to my 
appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy 
occasion jana quoted him as saying holy occasion was 
apparently a reference to christmas 
fatahrevolutionary council announced the capture of the hostages 
in a yacht off the gaza strip on nov 8 1987 it accused the 
captives of spying for israel a charge israel and the family has 
denied 
the group has been blamed for dozens of hijackings bombings and 
assassinations since it broke with plo chief yasser arafat in 1976 
ms valente who is separated from the father of marielaure and 
virginie gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a 
recent videotape that she is pregnant again 
the case is considered unrelated to the 15 westerners held 
hostage in lebanon by proiranian factions

when baggage and wreckage from the pan am crash was 
sent to fort halstead for forensic tests some experts said they 
believed even more strongly that a bomb destroyed the plane 
they knew that fort halstead meant the ministry of defenses 
leading bomb experts would be entering the investigation into the 
dec 21 crash of the boeing 747 
their work at the countrys main center for developing explosives 
and armaments proved crucial when it was determined that a bomb 
caused the crash and could help determine the bombers as well 
experts said thursday 
the tests were crucial in clinching the cause ie that it 
was a bomb said a spokesman from the department of transport 
whose air accident investigation branch is heading the crash 
investigation 
working closely with the department of transport mainly civilian 
experts at fort halstead will continue tests on wreckage from the 
plane he said 
fort halstead is the highsecurity headquarters of the royal 
armament research and development establishment the governments 
center for research on defense projects ranging from new weapons to 
bridges and computers 
a ministry of defense spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity refused to comment in detail about the explosives experts 
among the 2500 civilians and 200 military at fort halstead and 
three other sites operated by the establishment 
explosives work centers around fort halstead near sevenoaks in 
kent about 20 miles southeast of london 
its a highsecurity installation which is very expert in 
matters of explosives and armaments research said paul wilkinson 
a professor and terrorism expert at aberdeen university in scotland 
their reputation is extremely high he said in an interview 
adding that fort halstead experts would have worked closely with 
experts in the scottish town of lockerbie which bore the brunt of 
the crash to get a broader picture of the crash 
david learmount air transport editor of the respected aviation 
journal flight international said that when investigators announced 
they were taking a suitcase and pieces of wreckage to fort halstead 
for tests he knew they were looking for symptoms of an 
explosion 
investigators said the tests found residues of explosives in two 
parts of a luggage pallet the metal rack in the baggage hold 
in which luggage is stored but they said they still didnt know 
where the bomb was planted and how it was brought aboard 
ian geldard head of research at the privately funded institute 
for the study of terrorism in london said establishment experts 
would probably next try to find out where the bomb was planted and 
what type of bomb was used as a clue to identifying the bombers 
many terrorist groups have a particular type of favorite 
explosive they use he said

sold gilad said 
ultraorthodox jews object to pictures that show unmarried men 
and women together or women in revealing clothing 
the deputy mayor of bnai brak shmuel weinberg said the 
attempted bombings were the work of disturbed people and were 
not sanctioned by the religious community 
according to our past experience when the police did catch 
somebody they were disturbed people who saw the bombings as some 
kind of a religious commandment he said 
last august five bombs were placed near newsstands in bnei brak 
three of the bombs exploded causing minor damage but no injuries 
and two were dismantled by police 
the ultraorthodox agudat israel party condemned the latest 
bombing attempts saying they violated jewish scriptures 
violence is not the way of the torah the party said in a 
statement we are convinced that it was done by radicals rejected 
by the orthodox public

own life and didnt want me to be burdened by my child ms day

head 
ms day said she began worrying a few hours after finding a note 
that read gramps and dylan have gone byebye together 
he was having dreams you know of he and my son floating off 
into the air and reliving all these things in the hereafter the 
hunting and skiing and fishing trips the 40yearold woman 
recalled 
her father had greeted her with an extra warm hug when she woke 
up tuesday morning and told her that she was a wonderful girl and

she found the note and a few hours later the tenor of its words 
suddenly merged with what her father had been saying in recent 
months and it hit her byebye meant eternity 
she called police indicating a suicide was possible 
at this point the evidence appears consistent with a 
homicidesuicide theory lewis county sheriff bill logan said

scheduled for cataract surgery thursday and he was very very 
disturbed about my childs condition she said 
dylan her only child suffered from a mild form of cerebral 
palsy and was considered developmentally disabled ms day said

the boston museum of fine arts is returning to 
egypt some fragments of nine ancient paintings because curators have 
concluded the art was stolen from a 15th century bc tomb 
the museum bought the paintings from an art dealer in amsterdam 
the netherlands in 1978 for an undisclosed sum and they are not 
considered archaeologically significant museum officials said 
thursday 
the artifacts probably will be returned in the spring after a 
representative of the egyptian antiquities service comes to boston 
to supervise packing and shipping said museum director alan 
shestack 
shestack ordered research into the paintings last year after the 
museums egyptian art department expressed suspicions about the 
legality of their origin 
the museum decided to return the artifacts voluntarily because 
they apparently were stolen smuggled out of egypt and sold into the 
art world museum officials said 
the fragments came from the theban tomb of minnakht an official 
in the period of thutmose iii and date to 14501420 bc said 
timothy kendall the museums acting curator of egyptian and ancient 
near eastern art the tomb is located in the nobles tombs at luxor 
in southern egypt 
thutmose was considered the greatest pharaoh of the 18th dynasty 
known for conquests that extended egypt to the banks of the 
euphrates river and the fourth cataract of the nile river in what is 
now the sudan 
the fragments depict men and women bearing offerings but most of 
the figures are only partly preserved kendall said the largest 
fragment is about 1 foot long and 10 inches high 
the amsterdam dealer who sold the objects to the museum has since 
died shestack said

a plan to close 34 of the nations major 
military facilities won the endorsement of key congressional leaders 
and appears headed for success 
in fact sen sam nunn and rep les aspin chairmen of the senate 
and house armed services committees say they would like to see even 
more obsolete bases closed 
nunn dga and aspin dwis pledged to work hard to ensure 
that the plan is not blocked by lawmakers concerned over jobs lost 
in their districts 
but rep jerry lewis rcalif said 12000 jobs in his district 
would be threatened and urged his colleagues to oppose the base 
closing plan 
if the congress is about caring for human beings as were 
attempting to establish the national defense clearly therell be a 
broader base of support than just those members whose districts are 
affected lewis said on cbs this morning 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has until jan 15 five days 
before he leaves office to approve or reject the entire package of 
recommendations which were presented to the pentagon on thursday by 
the commission on base realignment and closure there appeared 
little doubt that carlucci would back the proposal enthusiastically 
congress then has to buy or reject the whole package and initial 
comments suggested it would accept the commissions proposals 
despite hometown appeals from areas which would lose bases 
in all the panel led by former republican congressman jack 
edwards of alabama and abraham ribicoff a former democratic senator 
from connecticut called for closing 86 facilities including 34 
major installations and 52 military housing units it also proposed 
partially closing five bases and changing the role and manpower 
levels at 54 others 
the cuts would save an estimated 693 million annually and 56 
billion over the next two decades thats a small fraction of the 
total pentagon budget of about 300 billion a year but the closings 
could set a precedent 
i think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the 
new defense secretary said nunn 
if carlucci endorses the package it will go to the white house 
for the presidents signature unless both houses of congress pass 
resolutions specifically rejecting it congress drafted the law 
creating the complex procedure which was designed to reduce 
political pressure to keep the bases open 
carlucci was vacationing over the holidays and had no immediate 
reaction to the recommendations but spokesmen for the army air 
force and navy endorsed them 
an army spokesman maj dick bridges said he saw no 
unwarranted closures on the list of bases if we dont need 
them we should get rid of them 
nunn and aspin said their only objection was that the list was 
too short 
i would have liked to have see more said nunn aspin called 
the list too modest and said it could have been up to about 30 
percent longer neither specified which other bases could have been 
included 
the two states hardest hit by the closures would be california 
and illinois california would lose george mather and norton air 
force bases a future navy base at hunters point in san francisco 
and the presidio headquarters for the 6th army also in san 
francisco illinois would lose chanute air force base and fort 
sheridan an army base 
how can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard 
when we dont even consider a single one of the 1500 overseas us 
military facilities for the same treatment said sen alan dixon 
dill chairman of the armed services subcommittee on readiness 
the overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the 
need is still there echoed sen paul simon another illinois 
democrat 
san francicso mayor art agnos said the commissions 
recommendation to close the presidio would have very grave 
consequences for the city 
rep nancy pelosi a san francisco democrat said closing the 
presidio will have a significant effect on the economy the base 
is the thirdlargest employer in the city and has an annual payroll 
of 600 million she said 
although most objections to the report came from politicians 
representing affected localities there were hints of internal 
wrangling in the pentagon 
one member of the commission said the navy had stonewalled to 
avoid the heavier cuts experienced by the army and air force 
the navy lost six installations three of which had not yet 
entered service compared with five major air bases lost by the air 
force and the armys 26 bases and 52 housing units that would be 
partially or wholly closed 
thomas eagleton a former democratic senator from missouri who 
joined the 12member commission part way through its sevenmonth 
review said the navy stonewalled and got away with it 
the air force ultimately gave its cooperation the army 
begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation eagleton said in an 
additional view at the close of the 88page final report 
for the navy he said intransigence paid off when the new 
secretary of defense looks to further base closings as a means of 
trimming the pentagon budget he should most certainly start with 
the navy the navy refused to play this time it should be obliged 
to next time 
navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley rejected eagletons 
criticism 
we feel we did cooperate with the commission and clearly 
answered whatever questions the commission had said quigley 
navy officers argued that unlike the air force and the army they 
eliminated many facilities employing thousands of people during the 
1970s those facilities included the quonset point naval air station 
and newport naval base in rhode island the boston naval shipyard 
the glynco naval air station in georgia the brooklyn naval shipyard 
in new york and the hunters point naval shipyard near san francisco

flexibility than raw strength 
denver civil service commission records showed 77 percent of the 
female candidates passed the fitness exam between august and 
october compared o 66 percent of the men

against national averages for people of the same age and gender

under the old fitness test women failed an average of 67 percent 
of the time 
in approving the settlement between the city and the 75 female 
recruits in may 1987 us district judge alfred arraj ordered the 
department to revise the test 
the new exam developed by the cooper institute in dallas

gunfire killed two people and wounded 28 
during demonstrations over steep price increases and demands for an 
end to sudans civil war a senior official said today 
demonstrators took to the streets for a fourth consecutive day 
today even though the government canceled the price increases 
because of the protests and a general strike continued to paralyze 
much of the country 
khartoum commissioner fatih abdoun reported the shooting 
incident saying an unidentified gunman caused the casualties 
when he opened fire on protesters near cabinet offices thursday 
abdoun gave no details 
other reports conflicted with his account but did not mention 
casualties 
the action in the streets is taking on a definite 
antigovernment flavor said a western diplomat who closely 
follows sudanese affairs from addis ababa ethiopias capital 
it looks like the government is in serious trouble he told 
the associated press in a telephone interview there is a lot of 
talk about a coup attempt coming out of khartoum there is 
complete political chaos 
a crisis caused by an air traffic controllers strike appeared to 
have ended today an air traffic controller in cairo egypt said 
khartoum international airport closed since wednesday night as part 
of the general strike was reopened around 11 am 
two news dispatches received in cairo on thursday reported 
shooting near the cabinet offices the timing of the reports 
indicated there were two separate shootings neither mentioned 
casualties 
egypts middle east news agency in an early afternoon dispatch 
quoted the official sudan news agency as saying sudanese police 
opened fire on demonstrators when they refused to disperse after 
being told that an emergency cabinet session had rolled back the 
price increases 
reports said demonstrators also were chanting slogans calling for 
government action to implement a tentative peace plan 
in baghdad iraq the official iraqi news agency said in a 
khartoumdatelined report thursday night that shooting occurred 
shortly after dark in the sudanese capital especially near the 
headquarters of the council of ministers 
commissioner abdouns version of the shooting conflicted with the 
sudanese agencys report on the source of gunfire and it was 
impossible to tell whether he and the iraqi news agency referred to 
the same incident 
another version came from the british foreign office in london 
which based its reports on the sudanese ministry of information 
it said one person was reported injured thursday in generally 
peaceful largescale demonstrations in khartoum some at the 
university sudanese police used tear gas and warning shots to 
disperse the protesters it said 
strikes and demonstrations were prompted by a government decree 
on monday increasing sugar prices by 500 percent and cigarettes by 
50 percent and imposing a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities 
prime minister sadek mahdis cabinet met in emergency session 
thursday morning and revoked the price increases 
the cabinet also considered the democratic unionist partys 
withdrawal from the governing coalition wednesday night the 
unionists held the secondlargest number of ministerial and 
parliamentary seats after mahdis umma party 
the party quit the government to protest the price increases and 
mahdis failure to act on a tentative peace accord that a unionist 
leader negotiated last month with rebel leader john garang in addis 
ababa 
mahdi did not submit the accord to the cabinet or the constituent 
assembly sudans parliament for endorsement because he feared that 
would prompt the fundamentalist national islamic front to leave his 
coalition 
the front led by mahdis brotherinlaw attorney general hassan 
turabi opposed the peace accords stipulation that sharia islams 
legal and ethical code be suspended during peace talks and that 
alternatives be considered 
the mainly christian and animist southern rebels demand 
revocation of sharia imposed in 1983 by president gaafar nimeiri 18 
months before he was overthrown in a 1985 military coup

their meetings are going well said another indian official 
both demanded anonymity 
the leaders met following a regular summit session with the 
leaders of bangladesh bhutan the maldives nepal and sri lanka 
the fourth annual summit of the south asian association for 
regional cooperation comes only four weeks after ms bhutto took 
office following pakistans first free election in 11 years the 
summit has kindled hopes of closer ties between india and pakistan 
historically antagonistic nations

leaders gandhi and ms bhutto are to meet again saturday after the 
summit ends 
although ms bhutto did not refer to gandhi in her inaugural 
speech she said last week that continued animosity between india 
and pakistan did not serve the interest of their peoples 
the two countries have fought three wars since they were 
partitioned in 1947 upon the demise of british colonial india 
relations have further been strained by a border dispute over 
kashmir which was split between pakistan and india when the 
subcontinent was divided india claims part of the territory in 
pakistan

others nuclear capabilities and claims that pakistan has supported 
sikh separatists who have killed 2400 people this year in indias 
border state of punjab pakistan has denied the charges

on the prospects of ms bhutto visiting india soon she has said her 
first foreign trips will be to china and saudi arabia she is 
expected to make a pilgrimage to mecca site of islams holiest 
shrine in january but no date has been set for a trip to beijing

on a hillside overlooking islamabad 
police with rifles stood at intervals of 20 feet to 150 feet 
other uniformed and plainclothes guards stood in clusters on rocky 
outcrops and among the trees and thickets 
the security was a reminder of the regions potential for 
violence 
both gandhi and sri lankan president junius r jayewardene have 
escaped unhurt from assassination attempts in their capitals while 
maldivian president maumoon abdul gayoom was the target of an 
unsuccessful coup less than two months ago 
another participant former gen hussain muhammad ershad of 
bangladesh assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982 although a 
yesorno referendum subsequently proclaimed him president the 
other summit participants king birendra of nepal and king jigme 
singhe wangchuk of bhutan rule through hereditary succession 
ms bhuttos avenue to power through popular election followed 
the death of president mohammad zia ulhaq who in 1977 overthrew 
her father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto bhutto was 
subsequently convicted in a murder case and executed zia us

a senior chinese official today marked the 10th 
anniversary of a chinese appeal for peaceful reunification with 
taiwan by renewing chinas proposal for direct talks with taiwans 
nationalist government 
we hold that the communist party and the kumomintang 
nationalists should establish contacts and start negotiations at 
an early date on the basis of equality vice premier wu xueqian 
said we can talk about the reunification of the country or carry 
out consultations on the concrete issues concerning the relations 
between the two sides 
wu was speaking at a forum of 300 senior party and government 
leaders held to commemorate chinas message to taiwan 
compatriots issued on jan 1 1979 
the message called for the peaceful reunification of taiwan with 
the mainland and proposed direct transportation and postal links as 
a first step toward easing tensions between the two nations 
the official xinhua news agency in a report on the forum said 
the 1979 message signified a historic turning point in relations 
between the mainland and taiwan 
china has since then called for direct political and trade 
contacts and has said taiwan can keep its current political and 
economic system if it rejoins the mainland 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan after their defeat to the 
communists in 1949 have rejected all proposals for direct contacts 
with the mainland however in the past year the taiwan government 
has eased travel and trade restrictions with the mainland 
more than 400000 taiwan residents have traveled to the mainland 
in the past year and indirect trade is estimated at 24 billion in 
1988 up from 15 billion in 1987 
such changes are in accordance with peoples wishes and the 
overall tendency of this historic development is therefore 
irreversible wu said 
he also expressed concern about taiwanese advocates of 
independence and those on the island who are in favor of two 
chinas or dual recognition concepts 
reunification is in the interests of both sides he said this 
will not only help the whole country to quickly become prosperous 
but will also help maintain sustained development on the island 
which can then enjoy the prestige of the great motherland

the federal aviation administration in another 
step designed to reduce the chance of air sabotage soon will 
propose a computerized security system to tighten control over 
access to planes the agencys director said today 
faa administrator t allan mcartor said the agency has drafted a 
proposed rule that would require workers to carry a computercoded 
card that would be coded to allow only authorized employees near 
aircraft during maintenance and servicing 
he was not specific as to when the proposal would be released 
in addition mcartor said an faa directive issued thursday 
governing us airline flights from the middle east and eastern 
europe called for very dramatic restrictions on access to 
baggage once it is inspected 
not only the passenger will not have access nobody will 
mcartor said on abctvs good morning america 
the directive issued thursday will require us airlines to look 
inside every checked bag by eye or xray at airports in the middle 
east and western europe passengers should expect longer checkins 
mcartor said 
the steppedup security comes in the wake of the bombing of the 
new yorkbound pan am flight 103 over scotland killing 270 people 
the carriers also will have to make random visual inspections of 
a percentage of hand baggage with the bag being emptied and the 
empty bag xrayed faa administrator allan mcartor told a news 
conference thursday 
mcartor said he was not at liberty to say what percentage of 
hand luggage would be inspected or how it would be selected 
mcartor told reporters the stricter security measures are based 
on the practices of el al the best in the world and far 
exceed existing international standards 
el al the israeli airline has never had a bombing aboard one of 
its aircraft mcartor did not mention some el al practices such as 
the testing of baggage in a decompression chamber and the close 
questioning of passengers about their personal lives 
in 1986 an el al guard questioning a passenger the unsuspecting 
girlfriend of a terrorist found a bomb in hand luggage at londons 
heathrow airport 
mcartor said the new rules would take effect in 48 hours much of 
the new routine already is in place but isnt required to be 
followed all the time he said 
the balance between security precautions and passenger 
processing has been basically upset mcartor said 
asked why similar new measures werent being required in the 
united states he replied the threat appears to be more 
international in scope we are encouraging our carriers to be more 
vigilant domestically 
at the 103 airports affected in the middle east and western 
europe the new precautions may well result in passenger delays 
and inconvenience such as checkin earlier perhaps as much as 
an hour 
presidentelect bush vacationing in texas on thursday 
threatened retaliation against the bombers of the pan am jetliner 
bush said he would seek hard and punish firmly decisively 
those who did this if you can ever find them 
but the vice president refused to discuss specifics of 
retaliation and he said it was unlikely terrorism could ever be 
stopped completely 
it is almost impossible to guarantee there will never be 
another terrorism act he said though he suggested improved 
intelligence and cooperation between nations 
here are the other principal provisions of the new faa 
requirement 
parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be 
xrayed or physically examined 
passengers may not have access to checked baggage and 
additional measures will be required to keep other people from 
unauthorized access mcartor did not say what they would be 
airlines must make a positive match of checked baggage to 
actual passengers keeping unaccompanied bags off the plane if a 
passenger leaves at an intermediate stop said ray salazar director 
of the faas office of civil aviation the passengers baggage would 
have to be taken off in accordance with the already required 
reconciliation at the transfer gate of the passenger and baggage 
manifests 
the faa is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal 
neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known 
explosives even those that are transparent to xrays such as the 
plastic explosives favored by terrorists under the accelerated 
program the first unit will be in operation next summer and the 
last of five perhaps six will be operational by the beginning of 
1990 
mcartor said it had not been decided where to place the thermal 
neutron equipment 
the agencys security inspection staff will be increased by 35 
percent from 550 people to 670 over the next 20 months 
joann sloane an faa spokeswoman said the agency believed 
training of airline security employees was adequate she said the 
agency had no estimate of what its new requirements would cost the 
airlines 
stephen hayes a spokesman for the air transport association an 
organization of the major us air carriers said the airline 
industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives 
however more must be done than simply placing additional 
security requirements on the airlines hayes said the 
government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the 
threat that international terrorism presents 
we believe the faa should assign more of its security personnel 
to europe and the middle east and we believe the faa should impose 
the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the 
united states as it imposes on us airlines he said

history for about five centuries much of the land that is 
modern yugoslavia was under ottoman rule shaken off in 19th century 
uprisings in december 1918 a kingdom of serbs croats and 
slovenes including bosnia hercegovina was formed during world war 
ii the nazi invaders were fought both by royalists and communist 
partisans under tito who then became yugoslavias undisputed 
postwar leader tito broke with soviet dictator josef stalin in 
1948 and yugoslavia became a nonaligned communist country some of 
its present problems are attributed to the system bequeathed by 
tito including annual rotation of key offices and a weak federal 
authority the staterun press and yugoslavs themselves have become 
increasingly outspoken and liberal as the mounting social and 
economic problems have dented the authority of the communist party

premier branko mikulic and his entire 
cabinet quit today in the first resignation by a federal government 
since the communist party took power after world war ii 
mikulic told parliament he stepped down because it refused on 
wednesday to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support 
from the international monetary fund for the debtridden country 
the resignation could signal further liberalization of 
yugoslavias oneparty system as the ethnically divided country 
struggles to solve unprecedented social and economic woes 
mikulic represented a hardline faction within the party and his 
resignation indicated that more reformoriented forces are gaining 
the upper hand in the party leadership 
but the resignations also represent an attempt to shift blame for 
the crisis away from the communist party to the premier and his 
31member cabinet 
parliament and the ninemember federal presidency now will likely 
consult on who will form a new government 
in his speech broadcast live on belgrade television mikulic 
refused to accept blame for the countrys economic problems 
including a 21 billion foreign debt 15 percent unemployment and 
annual inflation of 250 percent 
after the 35minute speech parliament refused to take up an 
option to discuss the resignation in effect accepting it 
mikulic said yugoslavias economic problems were inherited from 
past decades and that it was unrealistic for his government to 
resolve them in only two and half years 
mikulic began a fouryear term after succeeding milka planinc as 
premier in may 1986 it is more honorable for the government to 
resign than to be blamed for all of the countrys ills mikulic 
said 
in recent days leading politicians criticized the governments 
economic policies and staterun dailies had called for mikulics 
immediate replacement 
poisonous arrows are being aimed at the government mikulic 
said 
he said the cabinet decided to resign after parliament on 
wednesday refused to pass a law that would have imposed curbs on 
public spending mikulic said the law was needed to ensure continued 
support from the international monetary fund 
he told parliament on wednesday that agency insisted on austerity 
measures limiting public spending before agreeing in june to grant 
yugoslavia a oneyear standby credit of 416 million about 260 
million of that credit has been used according to official 
estimates 
the loan was crucial to help yugoslavia meet payments on its 
foreign debt and reach separate agreements for loan rescheduling 
with other western banks and governments 
the communist party daily borba on thursday quoted an 
unidentified cabinet minister as saying parliaments refusal to pass 
the law destroys the standby arrangement with the imf 
in a bid to overcome the deteriorating situation parliament 
adopted a new law thursday to stimulate private enterprise 
liberalizing rules for establishing private businesses the law was 
adopted for the first step toward market economy the state news 
agency said 
yugoslavia has had a record number of strikes this year with 
workers protesting low wages and declining living standards 
mikulic survived a potential vote of confidence in may when 
deputies from the liberal northern republic of slovenia and from 
croatia failed to gather support from the other four yugoslav 
republics to vote out the government 
mikulics reputation has been tarnished further by a corruption 
scandal involving hundreds of officials in his native republic of 
bosniahercegovina 
yugoslavia also has been wracked by unrest among its various 
ethnic groups 
mikulic is an economist who served as a presiding member of the 
yugoslav communist party in 1978 and 1979 under the late leader 
josip broz tito 
although he rejected blame for yugoslavias economic problems 
observers said his decision to step down was at least partly 
intended to placate yugoslavias 23 million citizens who are 
increasingly angered by falling living standards 
although mikulic has been accused of incompetence yugoslavias 
complex federal system also has hindered a solution to its economic 
problems 
the need for unanimity by the countrys six constituent republics 
and two autonomous provinces on all federal matters means that key 
decisions are often watered down to ineffective compromises

he said it was in retaliation for the shooting down of an iran 
air airbus by the us navy cruiser vincennes in july the navy said 
the plane was mistaken for an iranian fighter all 290 people aboard 
were killed 
us officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely that 
the group actually was responsible for the pan am bomb 
the group previously claimed responsibility for a july 1987 car 
bombing in london that wounded amir hussein amirparviz the 
chairman of the national movement for iranian resistance and a 
former iranian cabinet minister under shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
who was ousted in the 1979 iranian revolution 
the shah was denied permanent sanctuary in the united states and 
suffering from cancer shuttled with his family from morocco to 
mexico panama and the bahamas before being granted asylum in egypt 
where he died 
the family moved to the united states in 1984 his son reza 
pahlavi whom exiled supporters now call the shah lives at an 
estate in virginia just outside washington with his wife yasmine 
the late shahs wife farah and their other children farahnaz

six current or former police officers were among 18 
people indicted in a towing scam that allegedly bilked at least 600 
people from 1982 to 1987 authorities said 
police sgt william h kelley jr 51 chief of the departments 
auto theft unit was charged with six counts of conspiracy perjury 
and writing a false police report according to indictments returned 
thursday by a suffolk county grand jury 
the suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow 
legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners when they 
came to retrieve them said david rodman a spokesman for district 
attorney newman flanagan 
the grand jury handed up 1500 charges in the indictments which 
capped a twoyear investigation 
police commissioner francis x roache vowed to continue probing 
police corruption 
the public should be outraged that a group of people conspired 
to literally take 600 to 800 cars off the street with no authority 
in total violation of the rules and regulations he said i 
think its time to look at the whole towing industry 
also indicted were three other police officers one metropolitan 
district commission police officer one former police captain two 
employees of the citys abandoned car division two former 
inspectors at the state registry of motor vehicles a special agent 
with the national auto theft bureau and the owners of two city 
garages 
the defendants face charges including larceny concealing stolen 
motor vehicles perjury conspiracy and insurance fraud 
kelley and officer william r cantin 40 who was indicted on 535 
charges have been suspended without pay police spokesman jim 
jordan said 
two other indicted officers peter doherty 47 and john ulrich 
44 were placed on administrative leave pending a departmental 
hearing jordan said 
rodman said one alleged scheme profited from the different 
charges levied on cars towed by police and those towed by the 
registry of motor vehicles which charges more to drivers to 
retrieve cars he said police would tow a car that was parked 
illegally but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been 
towed by the registry and pick up the extra money 
another scheme rodman said would be to tow a legally parked 
car and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to 
collect daily storage charges often up to 600 
the indictment does not say how much money was lost

a selfstyled revolutionary admitted in federal 
court to taking part in bombings and bank robberies as part of a 
campaign to overthrow the government 
carol ann saucier manning 32 admitted thursday to three of the 
charges she faces with four remaining defendants in the us 
district court trial that is scheduled to start jan 9 
i want this over with the evidence that convicted me in 
brooklyn will convict me here manning said at a twohour hearing 
in the boston court i do not want to go through this again i 
want to know whats ahead for me 
manning already serving 15 years in her 1986 new york city 
conviction on bombing charges said she plans to seek her high 
school equivalency diploma and learn a skill in prison she faces 
another 60 years in prison and 60000 in fines on the latest 
charges 
manning pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiring to racketeer 
and seditious conspiracy but was allowed to invoke the alford 
doctrine in which the defendant does not admit guilt but enters the 
plea to take advantage of a pleabargain offer 
assistant us attorney michael loucks fought mannings petition 
saying there was no plea agreement and such a plea was not in the 
public interest since it eliminates a potential avenue for 
discovering nowdecaying and extremely usable dynamite that the 
group is alleged to have used 
he argued that only some of 1166 sticks of dynamite have been 
recovered this would leave about 390 sticks of dynamite and water 
gel explosives and 84 blasting caps at a minimum unaccounted for 
us district judge william g young allowed the change in plea 
after ensuring that manning knew which rights she was forfeiting 
the threecount indictment charged her and the other four 
remaining defendants with engaging in a conspiracy to rob banks and 
bomb military offices defense contractors and other institutions 
from 1976 to 1985 a boston courthouse worker lost a leg and 21 
other people were injured in one 1976 bombing 
all but one of the defendants are serving jail sentences for 
previous convictions on other charges related to the bombings and 
robberies

james schlesinger who has served in the 
cabinet under three presidents is among nearly a dozen people 
rumored to be in contention for the post of energy secretary in the 
bush administration 
schlesinger would fit the presidentelects desire for someone 
with a nuclear background to tackle the departments massive cleanup 
and modernization at its 17 weapons plants in 12 states 
at least 10 other names still were circulating around 
washingtons rumor mills thursday 
schlesingers was a new name as a possible selection and bush 
transition office sources identified him as a top contender two 
other candidates lee m thomas administrator of the environmental 
protection agency and former congressman henson moore of louisiana 
also remained in leading contention 
now a consultant and staff member of the center for strategic and 
international studies schlesinger served as defense secretary under 
president nixon and was dismissed from that job president ford in 
1975 his resignation was one of a handful president carter accepted 
in 1979 after demanding resignations from the entire cabinet and top 
echelons of his administration 
schlesinger who was traveling thursday was let go by ford 
because of budget differences and according to one account because 
he presumed to lecture the president a congressional veteran on 
how to deal with a house committee chairman ford had known for 
decades 
schlesinger had the misfortune to be energy secretary when the 
iranian revolution triggered gasoline lines in much of the united 
states lines many analysts including the current secretary john 
herrington believe were the result of price and allocation controls 
in effect at the time and no longer on the books 
an economist schlesinger has strongly supported nuclear power 
when he was a member of the old atomic energy commission he took 
his family to witness a nuclear weapons test in alaska to show his 
confidence in the safety arrangements 
moore who represented a chemicals and refiningintensive 
district around baton rouge la is a lawyer whose unsuccessful 
campaign for the senate in 1986 was hobbled by the collapse of crude 
oil prices he has campaigned for the secretarys job his selection 
would be taken as a sign of bushs concern for the domestic oil 
industry which lost 150000 jobs in the price collapse 
thomas has no particular nuclear background but got his start at 
epa reviving the nearly abortive superfund toxic waste cleanup 
program in 1983 and presided over a quintupling of the program then 
and as administrator after 1985 
bushs nuclear concern brought two democratic names to the 
surface john deutch undersecretary in schlesingers days at the 
energy department and now provost of massachusetts institute of 
technology and john ahearne former chairman of the nuclear 
regulatory commission and now chairman of herringtons advisory 
committee on nuclear facility safety 
other names mentioned are 
martha hesse deregulationoriented chairman of the federal 
energy regulatory commission and former assistant energy secretary 
for administration 
peter johnson former head of the bonneville power 
administration and the candidate backed by sen james mcclure of 
idaho senior republican on the energy committee 
retiring sen dan evans of washington who has been opposed by 
mcclure 
former gov lamar alexander of tennessee 
air force lt gen james a abrahamson retiring head of the 
pentagons star wars spacedefense program and former head of both

palestinian school students from attending classes 
schools in the west bank were closed by the army feb 3 for 
nearly 10 months authorities gradually reopened the 1194 west bank 
schools in december but made studies conditional on a halt to 
student violence 
army officials say schools often become focal points for violent 
demonstrations in the uprising for that reason four universities 
and 16 junior colleges in the west bank have been shut indefinitely 
palestinians have protested the closure with educators arguing 
that students were losing the discipline for study

a car rental company said today 
it will take a franchise away from a member of a rightwing town 
council that has reinstated hardline segregation laws 
louis de waal executive director of the south africas budget 
rentacar said in a statement that his company would sever its 
ties in february with billy olivier operator of a budget franchise 
in brakpan 
olivier is a member of the farright conservative party which 
won control of councils in brakpan and dozens of other towns in 
municipal elections on oct 26 
the councils in brakpan and boksburg both industrial towns on 
the eastern edge of the greater johannesburg region have reinstated 
whites only status at parks and other public facilities that had 
been opened to all races in recent years 
the actions have been widely condemned not only by 
antiapartheid groups but also by the government however the 
governing national party has given no indication it will repeal the 
separate amenities act which allows racial segregation of local 
facilities 
we do not believe that mr oliviers views and those of his 
conservative party colleagues represent the outlook of the silent 
majority of brakpan voters said de waal 
while the separate amenities legislation that is being enforced 
was put in place by the government it appears these measures were 
dying an evolutionary death until the stance taken by the 
conservative party 
in another development the rev allan hendrickse a politician 
who has irked the government with his defiant tactics says he has 
accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration of presidentelect 
george bush 
hendrickse told the annual congress of his labor party on 
thursday that he would attend the inauguration during a threeweek 
trip to the united states he will miss the opening of south 
africas 1989 parliamentary session on feb 3 
the labor party controls the mixedrace chamber of parliament 
which also has chambers for whites and for asians but excludes the 
black majority 
antiapartheid activists criticized the labor party for deciding 
to join the newly expanded parliament in 1984 but in the past 18 
months hendrickse has taken an increasingly confrontational stance 
toward the government 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
appealed to the eec and the united states today to avoid an allout 
trade war in a dispute over hormonetreated meat 
but the european economic community should not reconsider its 
refusal to accept us meat products containing growth hormones 
genscher said in an interview with westdeutscher rundfunk radio 
he said the ban is not any form of discrimination because the 
same rules apply to all of us and the decision is based on health 
policies 
american officials are threatening to impose 100 million worth 
of trade sanctions on european food products starting sunday because 
of the eecs refusal to accept american meat containing growth 
hormones 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said on tuesday that 
the sanctions which would effectively double the price of european 
food imports would go into effect unless the meat restrictions are 
lifted 
the use of growth hormones on livestock is prohibited in the eec 
although a number of scandals involving illegal hormones have rocked 
the meat industries of west germany and other european nations in 
recent months 
genscher urged that no countermeasures be undertaken by the eec 
if the us sanctions are imposed he said the two sides should try 
to resolve their disagreement through the framework of the 
international general agreement on tariffs and trade known as gatt 
genscher said the eec should try to defuse the dispute in talks 
with the american government at the same time 
european and some american consumer groups say the hormones 
which us producers use to make cattle grow faster are hazardous 
to human health but the us food and drug administration says the 
quantities are miniscule compared with the amounts of the same 
hormones produced by the human body 
the fda approves only three kinds of hormone treatment 
estrogen progesterone and testosterone it banned diethyl 
stilbestrol or des 10 years ago after it was proven to be 
cancercausing 
use of des by european cattle growers led to a scare for italian 
consumers in 1980 when hundreds of children showed signs of early 
sexual development such as breast growth 
residues of des were also discovered in residents of west germany 
and holland prompting a consumer movement that led to europeanwide 
legislation against hormonetreated meat

a plaque marking the apartment house where leonid 
i brezhnev lived for 30 years was gone this morning one day after 
a kremlin directive struck a new blow at the legacy of the disgraced 
soviet leader 
the tass news agency announced thursday that the names of 
brezhnev and a later leader konstantin u chernenko will be 
expunged from every town school and factory christened for them and 
even from their former homes 
the decision was the latest attack on the 18year legacy of 
brezhnev it added chernenko to president mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign to condemn the corruption and stagnation of their rule 
the plaque at 26 kutuzovsky prospekt called brezhnev who lived 
there until his death in 1982 a distinguished figure of the 
communist party the soviet government and the world socialist and 
workers movement 
at the opposite end of the building a tray under a plaque to 
yuri v andropov brezhnevs successor and a mentor to gorbachev 
was full of artificial roses and tulips 
the communist party central committee the presidium of the 
supreme soviet parliament and the council of ministers or cabinet 
decided to drop the names of leonid brezhnev and konstantin 
chernenko from all factories administrative regions institutions 
of learning and organizations named after them tass said 
in addition memorial plaques will be removed from the houses 
where they lived it said the latest decision was in response 
to numerous letters and appeals to central party and state agencies 
and to newspapers 
an announcement read on the evening tv news show vremya said 
brezhnevs name will be removed from a factory and region of the 
ukrainian city of dnepropetrovsk brezhnevs power base and from a 
scholarship at moscow state university 
chernenkos name will be removed from towns in the republic of 
moldavia and in the krasnoyarsk region of siberia and from squares 
and streets in moscow the moldavian capital kishinev and 
krasnoyarsk 
renaming cities neighborhoods streets and factories is one of 
the ways soviet officials have rewritten history in their 71 years 
in power indicating which former officials and ideas are in favor 
many names associated with dictator josef stalin his close 
associates and brezhnev have been removed in recent years a 
movement also has developed recently to restore prerevolutionary 
names to many cities and areas 
in january authorities removed brezhnevs name from a city town 
squares and a moscow neighborhood and blamed the former leader for 
fostering a period of cronyism and complacency the city of brezhnev 
about 500 miles east of moscow was returned to its previous name 
naberezhnye chelny 
the soviet press increasingly has criticized brezhnev who ruled 
from 1964 to 1982 historian roy medvedev said a weakened and senile 
brezhnev ruled for six more years after being revived from a 
clinical death in 1976 
in july the party newspaper pravda said brezhnevs survivors 
would be stripped of unearned privileges and left only with 
retirement benefits they earned with their own labor 
chernenko ruled only for 13 months after andropov and was ill 
most of the time he died in march 1985 making way for gorbachev 
few things were named for chernenko after his death indicating the 
low esteem in which he was held 
in november tass announced that a passenger liner that was to 
have been named for chernenko would be given a different name

an american legion commander allegedly 
signed up 200 phony memberships including a former german soldier 
and several dead people to win a recruiter of the year award a 
newspaper reported 
costa mesa post cmdr robert hanson who was named the state 
legions top recruiter in june may have bought his way to the top 
according to a report detailed in thursdays editions of the orange 
county register 
a threemember legion committee issued its findings in a 13page 
report signed dec 5 by state cmdr andrew j steffanic 
the state american legion awarded hanson its recruiter of the 
year award at its sacramento convention after hanson submitted 801 
new memberships between july 1 1987 and the 1988 convention 
but the investigation found just 18 of the 801 applicants paid 
dues by check while hanson wrote about 25 checks to the costa mesa 
post for 8250 from his own account 
the report concluded the question arises was this an attempt 
to simply buy a large roster of members if so it would constitute 
an ominous attack on the integrity of the american legion itself 
it recommended charging hanson with violating the organizations 
rules by using unorthodox and erroneous recruiting methods 
hanson faces expulsion from the legion steffanic said 
hanson 67 declined to discuss the report 
the investigation began after the legions national headquarters 
received inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the 
american legion magazine 
the report said one of the letters was from a disabled man who 
had never served in the military while another was from a man who 
had been a soldier in the german army during world war ii and was a 
prisoner of war in the united states

the lloyd bermuda sank about 160 miles south of nantucket and 200 
miles east of new jersey when its cargo shifted in weather that was

suffer serious hypothermia

nationalities john w moore of the meyer agencies ltd the ships

people in the water waving flashlights sailor aboard the merchant 
ship eagle pulled two men from the water but the third slipped

pronounced dead apparently of hypothermia a hospital spokeswoman 
said 
the other man identified as dario maciolopez 35 was treated 
for hypothermia spokeswoman marie johnson said 
at first light thursday a navy pilot spotted what appeared to be 
a man waving from a life raft but when rescuers reached the raft 
they found nobody 
three hours later rescuers spotted another man but because of 
choppy seas and floating debris could not get close enough to tell 
if he was alive by the time a rescue helicopter reached him four 
hours later the man was floating face down

federal officials today announced the award of 
a 159 million contract to establish a nationwide data bank to 
store information on doctors and dentists who are either disciplined 
or sued for malpractice 
the idea contained in legislation passed in 1986 is to provide 
a way for hospitals and state medical licensing boards to avoid 
being duped by doctors and dentists who have run into trouble 
elsewhere and try to set up practice in a new state 
each state maintains its own licensing procedures and the 
legislation authorizing the data bank does not attempt to tell 
states who they should or should not license or hospitals who they 
should or should not hire 
information in the data bank will not be available to the general 
public 
the intent is to wave a warning flag at state licensing boards 
and health facility employers so they can check further into a 
doctor or dentists record and then make their own decision on the 
merits of each individual malpractice charge or disciplinary action 
the fiveyear contract was awarded to unisys an information 
systems company with corporate headquarters in blue bell pa 
the data bank is expected to become operational this coming 
summer the contract calls for the project to receive 3 million in 
the current fiscal year which ends next sept 30

an iranian intermediary has approached the 
united states offering to reopen diplomatic talks between the two 
countries but the state department is holding out for a 
substantive upfront proposal a us official said friday 
it must come from someone in a position to make decisions 
said the official in explaining why the department was cool to the 
offer which was channeled through an iranianamerican professor 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
unidentified scholar who teaches at a small college was approached 
by an iranian who has a lowlevel job in the foreign or justice 
ministry in tehran 
the united states and iran have had no diplomatic relations since 
1979 when militants seized and sacked the us embassy taking the 
americans there hostage most were held for 444 days before being 
released 
currently there are nine american hostages in lebanon all held 
by a proiranian group according to the departments 
counterterrorism office 
president reagan in 1985 secretly approved delivery of us and 
israeli weapons to iran in an effort to encourage moderation in the 
tehran government and also to try to facilitate the release of 
captive americans 
the congressional and public uproar that developed when the 
purchases became known in 1986 prompted the state department to 
insist on a public discussion with tehran 
given our past experience in dealing with people who purport to 
represent the iranian government its clear we need to speak to 
someone openly and upfront someone in an authoritative position 
the us official said 
several indirect overtures from iran were received in the past 
and did not produce a substantive diplomatic dialogue between 
washington and tehran however the united states is able to talk 
indirectly to the iranian government through a number of foreign 
countries including algeria japan and west germany

a military tribunal today found the soninlaw of 
former president leonid i brezhnev guilty of taking bribes and 
abusing his office and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp 
yuri churbanov who served as first deputy interior minister 
during brezhnevs years in power systematically took thousands of 
rubles of bribes instead of enforcing soviet laws said the judge 
army maj gen mikhail marov 
the verdict came a day after the kremlin struck a further blow at 
the legacy of brezhnev accused of fostering a period of corruption 
and stagnation by ordering that a memorial plaque be removed from 
his former home and that all factories and schools still named for 
him be renamed 
churbanov originally faced the death penalty in the sensational 
trial that began sept 5 on charges that he had accepted bribes of 
more than 11 million 
but during the trial the court threw out some charges and reduced 
the amount of bribes he was accused of taking to 145000 
prosecutors had recommended a 15year sentence 
the 52yearold churbanov who married brezhnevs daughter galina 
in 1971 stood throughout the entire 3 hour procedure at the soviet 
supreme court staring calmly at the judge and two lay assessors 
he did not react to the announcement of the verdict and sentence 
and declined to talk to reporters afterward 
but his lawyer andrei makarov said the courts decision showed 
that the soviet union is on the way to a society based on law 
you can agree or disagree with the sentence but in substance 
the throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutors 
is indisputable he said 
churbanov was tried along with eight other former government 
officials from the central asian republic of uzbekistan one of the 
eight was aquitted and the case of another former uzbekistan 
interior minister khaibar yakhyayev was turned back to prosecutors 
for further investigation 
tashtimur kakhramanov a former deputy interior minister who was 
acquitted took a seat in the audience after the court pronounced 
him a free man he broke down and cried and nurses clad in white 
came to assist him

mercedesbenz paid a record 202 million fine 
today for failing to meet the governments fuel economy standard for 
its 1986 model luxury automobiles the national highway traffic 
safety administration said 
it was the biggest fine the government had ever collected for 
gasguzzling cars 
agency spokesman tim hurd said the german manufacturers 1986 
models averaged 213 mile per gallon compared with the government 
standard of 260 mpg 
mercedes may be liable for an additional 55 million fine for 
the 1985 model year under a preliminary decision by an 
administrative law judge hurd said the company is allowed to 
appeal that ruling 
in the 1985 model year the requirement was 275 mpg and mercedes 
cars averaged 236 mpg 
federal law requires manufacturers and importers to pay a 5 fine 
for every car sold that falls onetenth of a mile per gallon below 
the governments standard they may earn credits for surpassing the 
standard and apply the excess to model years that violate the rule 
mercedes had no credits for 1986 the 20214700 it paid was 
235 a car for 86020 cars credits reduced the 1985 liability from 
about 18 million hurd said 
telephone calls to the montvale nj office of the companys 
us subsidiary and its washington lawyers went unanswered

a chicago native who came to the soviet union 
almost 60 years ago said friday he and his family had won their 
13year fight to leave ending one of the most mixedup soviet 
emigration cases 
abe stolar his wife gita and son michael have been trying to 
emigrate since 1975 at one point in the battle the family got as 
far as the entrance ramp of their plane when soviet officials 
stopped them claiming mrs stolar had access to state secrets in 
her job as a chemist in a geology institute 
theres no feeling yet its just a big mess thinking of all 
the things we have to do the 77yearold stolar a jew said in 
an interview with the associated press 
they drag it out so long its been 13 years the main thing 
now is to try to be calm and not to forget anything which is hard 
stolar and his family plan to go to israel but he said they did 
not know yet when they will leave after settling in israel he 
said the family will go to the united states to visit friends 
resolution of the case was another in a series of soviet moves 
under mikhail s gorbachev to improve the countrys human rights 
record many jews who were refused permission for years have 
emigrated in the past year and a half 
stolar came to the soviet union as a teenager in 1931 with his 
parents who were russian emigres and ardent communists his father 
died in josef stalins purges stolar was disenchanted with the 
country to which he came to help build the first communist power 
but he was stuck 
stolar was called up to fight in the red army during world war 
ii where a nazi grenade cost him the sight in his left eye he 
later served as a translator and announcer for radio moscow 
stolar holds us citizenship as does his son by virtue of 
stolars birth and residence in the united states 
the family was stripped of its soviet citizenship in 1975 that 
was when they were stopped at the entrance ramp of their plane for 
10 years the soviets refused to let mrs stolar leave their 
belongings have remained in a warehouse in israel ever since 
in the mid1980s the family received final permission to leave 
but stolar had a new problem his sons new wife julia is a soviet 
citizen and her mother refused to sign a financial waiver allowing 
her to go the family refused to leave without julia and mother and 
daughter have not been on speaking terms for many years 
the stolar case has been high on the list of ussoviet human 
rights cases for years officials reported several times that it was 
solved but new problems cropped up 
i have news now an excited stolar said starting his 
telephone conversation 
julia who has a 2yearold daughter and an 8monthold son 
said in an interview that the soviet foreign ministry told us 
embassy officials about five days ago that her mother finally had 
signed a release allowing her to go 
she said she called the soviet visa and registration office 
ovir on friday and that deputy director ilya karakulkov had 
confirmed that officials received the signed waiver she said she 
expects to receive official notification in the next several days 
im sure there was pressure on my mother julia said they 
called her into ovir several times 
she said she did not know why her mother finally signed the 
release and in no circumstances would call her to find out 
she said many jews remain behind in hopeless situations 
because their relatives refuse to sign waivers permitting them to 
emigrate 
michael 29 said he had no special feelings he said he 
worried about friends who want to emigrate but dont have the us 
government on their side like his family did 
sen paul simon dill who met with stolar credited gorbachev 
for the decision to allow stolar to return to the united states 
ive worked on hundreds of soviet emigration cases over the 
years and this has been the toughest and the most frustrating 
simon said from his home in makanda ill 
i dont believe it would have been settled without president 
gorbachevs direct involvement its also a hopeful sign about 
gorbachevs struggle with his own bureaucracy abe stolar loves his 
hometown and were going to give him a grand tour when he comes 
back 
simon said the chicago hilton has agreed to put stolar and his 
family up free of charge when he returns stolar had told simon a 
boyhood dream was to stay a night and live like a king in the 
old steven hotel which is now the hilton 
stolar told simon were trying to make plans we just want to 
find a small quiet town someplace green no hurlyburly i hope i 
can find work

racial conflict between african and chinese 
students was reported in another city friday and more than 60 
africans were sequestered in a dormitory to protest allegations by 
authorities that they have aids 
the incident at the zhejiang agriculture university in hangzhou 
took place against the backdrop of continued antiblack 
demonstrations in nanking where chinese students are demanding that 
african students involved in a christmas eve brawl be punished 
martin ayuk a student from cameroon said the problems in 
hangzhou 143 miles southeast of nanking began dec 23 when a 
university operator started telling all incoming chinese callers to 
the foreign students dormitory that all african students were 
infected with aids 
african students asked the university for an explanation but were 
not satisfied by a meeting with a university official so we began 
our boycott ayuk said in a telephone interview from hangzhou 
on wednesday a school finance officer came to the dormitory and 
students locked him in the office of the gatekeeper ayuk said the 
official escaped through a window at 5 am thursday after nine 
hours in captivity when the african students were asleep he said 
ayuk said he believed the chinese were prejudiced against all 
foreigners but most strongly against africans 
he said the africans had been given a nickname in hangzhou 
aizu bing the chinese words for aids 
a student at the agricultural college from the congo was sent 
home in november after he tested positive for aids but all the 
other african students have tested negative for the disease ayuk 
said 
china which has so far escaped the aids epidemic requires all 
foreigners who live in china to undergo a test for acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
an african student at zhejiang university also in hangzhou said 
police were not allowing other african students to leave the city 
today i wanted to go to shanghai but i wasnt able said 
pierre dujo of cameroon the police are preventing us from buying 
tickets 
another african said he believed the chinese were using the fear 
of aids to restrict contact between africans and chinese 
they cant stop the contact between us and the chinese said 
the student from zhejiang university who spoke on condition of 
anonymity we have many very good deep friendships so what 
theyre doing is using this to scare off the chinese 
ayuk said hot water had been turned off in the dormitory and the 
canteen was closed he said students were cooking in their rooms 
with what little food they had 
there are an estimated 1500 africans from 40 nations studying at 
chinese universities china has long provided scholarships for 
africans in a show of solidarity with developing african states but 
social tensions which africans attribute to ingrained racial 
prejudices against blacks have on occasion erupted into violent 
incidents between the chinese and the africans 
in nanking on friday about 140 african students continued to be 
held at a guest house of a chemical fiber factory outside the city 
city authorities forced the africans to the guest house monday 
night ostensibly to protect them from angry chinese mobs they have 
rejected the students requests to leave nanking 
during demonstrations saturday and sunday thousands of chinese 
threw rocks at african students and destroyed property in their 
dormitory rooms the chinese have demanded the africans be brought 
to justice for allegedly starting a fight on christmas eve at hehai 
university in which 11 chinese were injured 
ye chunsheng vice director of the jiangsu provincial educational 
committee in nanking said friday the incident was under 
investigation and that about seven african students would be 
punished 
he said the africans were not cooperating in the investigation 
theyve locked their doors in the guest house and we cant get in 
to talk with them he said 
yang ruiju president of hehai university said on thursday that 
no chinese would be punished for the clash and subsequent antiblack 
demonstrations 
as of friday evening the streets of nanking were quiet for the 
first time since the initial clash saturday 
on thursday seven africans and one student from bangladesh left 
the nanking polytechnical institute under police escort for the 
train station where they traveled to shanghai said a student from 
the comoro islands he would only identify himself by the name of 
bourhane 
bourhane said the africans from sudan somalia and congo were 
not involved in the incident but felt endangered in nanking and 
wanted either to leave china or study in another city

a judge friday blocked the 
government from proceeding with plans to place 9000 rural blacks 
under the jurisdiction of a tribal homeland against their wishes 
the ruling came hours after president pw botha issued a 
proclamation that the braklaagte community would become part of the 
nominally independent homeland of bophuthatswana on saturday 
pretoria supreme court justice tt spoelstra blocked immediate 
implementation of the proclamation and gave the government until 
march 7 to show why its plan shouldnt be invalidated 
the leader of the braklaagte community chief pupsey sebogodi 
contended in court papers that his people faced hardship and 
discrimination if they were incorporated into bophuthatswana they 
live in a farming area about 100 miles west of pretoria 
the community has voiced opposition in the past to the 
bophuthatswana government and has sought to retain south african 
citizenship because of advantages in seeking employment residents 
feared that if they were incorporated into bophuthatswana they 
would be victimized unless they became citizens of the homeland 
the intended incorporation was part of the governments 
longstanding and controversial policy of locating various black 
ethnic groups in selfgoverning or nominally independent homelands 
to reduce the proportion of blacks to whites in the rest of south 
africa 
this policy suffered major defeats in court twice in 1988 
the countrys highest court the appeal court ruled in april 
that botha acted without authority when he incorporated the 
120000member community of moutse into the adjoining 
semiautonomous homeland of kwandebele northeast of pretoria 
the incorporation provoked widespread violence in moutse where 
most residents do not belong to the ndebele tribe that predominates 
in kwandebele 
in august the orange free state provincial supreme court 
rejected a government plan to place botshabelo a vast black 
shantytown under the jurisdiction of the qwaqwa an impoverished 
homeland 180 miles away 
a threejudge panel said the merger would not promote the 
political development of botshabelos estimated 500000 residents 
zach de beer leader of the antiapartheid progressive federal 
party criticized the attempt to excise braklaagte from south africa 
after the abject failure of the homelands policy during many 
years it is almost incredible that as 1989 opens the government 
should yet again be forcing south africans against their will to 
become inhabitants of one of these places he said 
bophuthatswana is made up of seven separate pieces of territory 
in northcentral south africa it has an estimated 17 million 
residents and covers 18000 square miles 
under apartheid the 26 million blacks in south africa have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

prime minister noboru takeshita appointed his second 
justice minister of the week friday as his scandalbuffeted 
government lurched toward the end of what commentators are calling a 
gloomy year in japanese politics 
takeshita had to reach outside the world of politics to name a 
new justice minister picking masami takatsuji 78 a former supreme 
court justice with experience in drafting legislation as a 
bureaucrat in the 1960s and 1970s 
on tuesday the prime minister appointed takashi hasegawa a 
76yearold member of parliament to the justice portfolio 
but hasegawa lasted only 60 hours said to be a postwar record 
for short cabinet tenure as it became known he had received 
donations for years from recruit co which the justice ministry is 
investigating on suspicion of bribery 
at the root of japans political gloom is the scandal involving 
the recruit conglomerate whose founder sold unlisted shares of a 
subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians their aides and 
business leaders the share prices more than doubled when they were 
publicly listed in 1986 and the holders made fat taxfree profits 
when they sold 
the recruit scandal has been dubbed the top story of the year by 
japanese media rivaled only by the similarly downbeat story of the 
illness of emperor hirohito 87 who has been bedridden with 
intestinal hemorrhaging since sept 19 
the year 1988 was an indescribably gloomy one for japanese 
politics and one that calls for much soulsearching commentator 
minoru tada wrote in fridays japan times he said japans 
leadership is deeply tainted by money power 
an editorial friday in the asahi shimbun another newspaper said 
the justconcluded session of parliament showed japanese politics 
at its ugliest and most corrupt 
as hasegawa gave up the justice portfolio friday some opposition 
leaders and analysts said takeshita should resign his entire 
government and call elections 
takeshita who had appointed hasegawa tuesday along with a new 
cabinet in a drive to restore public confidence in government did 
not immediately comment on the major setback 
instead the outgoing and incoming justice ministers spoke to 
reporters hasegawa apologized and said he hadnt known until 
wednesday that recruit had been giving money to his political 
support organization since 1976 
however as minister in charge of clearing up the recruit 
problem in the takeshita administration which is trying to heighten 
trust in government it is regrettable that i received donations 
from recruit he said 
the scandal now has brought the resignations of 18 public figures 
including two cabinet members since it hit the front pages last 
summer business leaders top bureaucrats and news media executives 
are among the casualties 
after hasegawas donations from recruit became known three other 
members of the cabinet also said the company had donated to them 
making it apparent that takeshita would have to go outside his 
liberal democratic party to find a justice minister untainted by 
recruit money 
takatsuji who served on the supreme court from 1973 to 1980 
said he had no connection at all to the recruit firm 
i dont really have anything to say about recruit takatsuji 
said my attitude toward it is no different from that of the 
people in general 
public approval of takeshitas government has slumped badly since 
he became prime minister in november 1987 a mainichi shimbun 
newspaper poll in december showed his approval had dropped from 30 
percent to 18 percent and a kyodo news service poll showed his 
approval rating down to 359 percent from 548 percent three months 
earlier 
takeshita himself has a recruit link since an aide and a relative 
profited from shares in the recruitcosmos subsidiary but he says 
he was not personally involved 
his popularity also has suffered from the railroading of a 
controversial tax reform through the diet or parliament 
some analysts expect takeshita will face further setbacks if 
there are arrests in the recruit affair and as the opposition uses 
the scandal to try to block passage of the budget in the diet 
since takeshita had advocated the importance of public 
consensus he and his administration should resign as public 
support goes lower said masayuki fukuoka a political science 
professor at komazawa university in tokyo 
despite the polls many analysts think the japanese are inured to 
shady practices under the governing conservatives who have held 
power for all the postwar years except for 10 months in 194748 
the japanese take it for granted said garrett n scalera 
president of the tokyo institute of policy studies i think they 
may be rather blase about this 
the pervasiveness of shady money was shown in a report issued 
friday by the national tax agency which estimated that japanese 
firms had spent 456 million in 1987 on such shady expenses as 
illegal political donations and backdoor rebates to other firms 
the figure was a record up 24 percent from the previous high in 
1984 the agency said

the soviet government will allow lithuanian 
bishop juliajonas steponavicius to resume his official duties after 
nearly 28 years of internal exile vatican radio said friday 
steponavicius appointed by the vatican in 1957 as apostolic 
administrator for the lithuanian republics capital of vilnius was 
exiled to northern lithuania in 1961 for refusing to collaborate 
with soviet authorities 
the bishop has rejected soviet invitations to return to vilnius 
because the offers did not permit him to resume his official duties 
as head of the citys archdiocese according to an official of 
vatican radios lithuanialanguage section 
this latest offer is without restrictions the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity the radio aired a broadcast in 
lithuanian on thursday night about the soviet decision 
the offer to steponavicius comes just two months after the 
soviets decided to return the vilnius cathedral which was converted 
into a state art gallery in 1950 to the roman catholic church 
to celebrate the cathedrals return the first mass at the 
cathedral in 30 years was held for 20000 worshipers in october 
a lithuanian in rome with close contacts in vilnius said the 
permission for steponavicius reflects both the soviet governments 
need for popular support as it pursues its reform policies as well 
as pressure from popular ethnic movements that have been testing 
the kremlins tolerance 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of openness has allowed 
lithuanians and their baltic neighbors to air their frustrations 
about limits on religious practices under soviet rule 
about 3 million of the 4 million roman catholics in soviet union 
live in lithuania which has a population of 35 million

a sophisticated device with two separate detonating 
systems is believed to have triggered the bomb that brought down pan 
am flight 103 killing 270 people the times of london reported 
today 
the newspaper said crash investigators believe the first trigger 
was a barometric device set off by altitude this activated the 
second trigger an electronic timer to make the bomb explode an 
hour later it said 
terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some 
airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers that would 
detonate pressureactivated bombs before they got on the plane the 
times said 
the frankfurt airport where the pan am flight originated aboard 
a different plane uses the pressure chambers the times said 
on wednesday the times was the first to report that 
investigators concluded a bomb was responsible for the crash the 
formal announcement was made hours later 
the boeing 747 crashed dec 21 in lockerbie scotland en route 
from london to new york all 259 people on board were killed and 11 
people on the ground were missing and presumed dead so far 241 
bodies have been recovered 
an anonymous male caller claiming to represent the guardians of 
the islamic revolution which last week said it blew up the plane 
telephoned american news agencies in london today and threatened 
more action 
he repeated the claim of responsibility and told the associated 
press that unless the united states deports reza pahlavi son of the 
late shah of iran there will be another present in the new year 
for america 
last weeks caller said the group attacked the plane in 
retaliation for the shooting down of an iran air airbus over the 
persian gulf by the us navy cruiser vincennes in july us 
officials and terrorism experts said it was unlikely the group was 
responsible for the pan am explosion 
as a worldwide hunt began for the terrorists who planted the 
bomb passengers using american airlines at four british airports 
underwent questioning thursday and had their baggage xrayed in 
accordance with department of transport orders 
british police today started security checks of the frankfurt 
airport but a spokesman for the west german interior ministry 
michaelandreas butz said there were no indications of security 
lapses that could have allowed the bomb to be smuggled aboard at the 
airport 
the fbi scottish police the british antiterrorism squad and 
west german police also are investigating 
frankfurts airport security chief horst hanstein said today 
that luggage handlers and other ground personnel were being checked 
he did not elaborate 
in washington the federal aviation administration ordered visual 
or xray inspection of all checked bags on us airlines at 103 
airports in the middle east and western europe 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the change far exceeds 
international standards and is based on practices of the israeli 
airline el al which has never had a bombing 
officials said the faa is rushing delivery of devices that are 
capable of detecting all known explosives including plastic 
explosives 
checkins proceeded smoothly at londons heathrow airport but 
passengers were quizzed about who packed their bags when they were 
packed whether the bags had been out of their sight and whether 
strangers had given them parcels to carry 
their checkedin baggage was fed through xray machines and then 
bound with a tough plastic strip to prevent them from being opened 
en route to the planes some luggage was also handsearched 
sam fleischacker of philadelphia who was catching a twa flight 
to new york said he flew to britain the day after the pan am jet 
crashed 
what worries me a lot is the fact that they didnt have all 
this then he said gesturing to the xray machine 
the security directive was issued hours after wednesdays 
disclosure that a bomb brought down the jumbo jet the security 
directive took effect at heathrow and gatwick airports near london 
manchester in northern england and prestwick in scotland 
the airplanes nose cone which had lain in a field outside a 
church near lockerbie was moved today to the royal aerospace 
establishment at farnborough southwest of london 
investigators from the department of transports air accidents 
investigation branch will examine it there for clues about the bomb 
brian jenkins a us terrorism consultant said investigators 
must check the background of each flight 103 passenger and look for 
false identities discover whether any had connections that could 
make them witting or unwitting confederates and trace cargo 
items to their origins 
the historical record suggests that in fact we probably will 
eventually be able to identify a perpetrator he told the british 
broadcasting corp 
suspicion fell on palestinian and iranian extremists and british 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe appealed to middle eastern 
governments to cooperate 
presidentelect george bush vacationing in texas on thursday 
threatened retaliation saying he would punish firmly decisively 
those who did this if you can ever find them 
washington has offered a 500000 reward for information leading 
to the prosecution of those responsible for the crash

the new government grappling with its first 
crisis has begun work on an economic program aimed at restoring 
public confidence in the shekel and ending a speculative run on the 
dollar 
finance minister shimon peres was expected to ask the cabinet on 
sunday to approve the outlines of an economic recovery plan that 
will be the most comprehensive since the emergency antiinflation 
program of 1985 analysts said 
israel radio reported friday that peres was considering a 600 
million cut in government spending an increase in fees for 
government services a reduction in subsidies for food and other 
necessities and an end to automatic costofliving salary increases 
for workers 
the cabinet also was expected to approve a further devaluation of 
the shekel perhaps as much as 10 percent the radio said 
the new government a coalition of the rightwing likud bloc and 
the leftist labor party that is similar to the previous government 
was installed dec 22 peres leader of the labor party is the 
former foreign minister 
the government has spent the past week trying to stem a massive 
buying binge of foreign currencies by the public and large financial 
institutions 
the bank of israel the nations central bank on tuesday 
devalued the shekel 5 percent by adjusting the exchange rate to 
1680 shekels to the dollar from 1599 shekels 
on friday the central bank halted all foreign currency trading 
to stop further speculative buying the markets are expected to 
reopen tuesday after the new years holiday 
michael bruno the banks governor predicted on israel radio 
that once the new economic program is adopted the public will 
calm down and the markets will stabilize 
in the three days before trading was stopped israelis responded 
to rumors of an impending devaluation by purchasing 285 million 
worth of foreign currencies mostly dollars they apparently hope to 
sell at a profit after the shekel is devalued 
the israeli economy faces other major problems including an 
industrial slump rising budget deficits and inflation approaching 
20 percent a year 
efran kleiman chairman of the economics department at hebrew 
university in jerusalem noted that when the government introduced 
its last emergency program in july 1985 prices were rising at an 
annual rate of 440 percent or more 
we dont have hyperinflation anymore he said but the 
governments idea now is the same not to do things unilaterally 
but to get some kind of agreement a social contract 
this will require support from histadrut the nations massive 
labor federation which represents about 80 percent of israels 
workforce 
but histadrut generalsecretary yisrael kessar said friday that 
workers cant be expected to relinquish their costofliving 
guarantee unless they are assured of other compensation union 
workers now get automatic pay increases equal to about 70 percent of 
the inflation rate 
but he added this doesnt mean we dont want to be partners in 
a comprehensive plan

air terrorism has spawned a grisly arms race 
between the security establishment and the everincreasing 
sophistication of the terrorist arsenal 
as bombdetection machinery has grown more refined explosives 
have become easier to conceal as one security gap closes 
terrorists find another 
because of lack of personnel and the expense of operating xray 
equipment we are always at least two steps behind the 
terrorists brian orrell of the british flight engineers union 
said friday eight days after a bomb blew up pan am flight 103 over 
scotland killing all 259 people aboard and leaving 11 on the ground 
missing and presumed dead 
but other experts say the quest for terroristproof air travel 
has reached an outer limit beyond which it will become prohibitively 
expensive or make flying unbearably uncomfortable 
when air terrorism became a problem in the late 1960s 
authorities responded by transforming airports into fortresses 
it now is routine for all passengers to go through metal 
detectors while their hand luggage is xrayed airlines especially 
at risk such as israels el al search all luggage by hand at 
belfast airports the irish terrorist threat makes it necessary to 
frisk not just the passengers but everyone else coming into the 
terminal 
airlines insist that each piece of luggage match its passenger 
assuming that no bomber would travel aboard the targeted plane so 
terrorists have resorted to duping unwitting passengers into 
carrying explosives onto planes passengers are regularly warned to 
accept no baggage they havent packed themselves 
the search for suspicious objects has become much harder with the 
advent of plastic explosives that give off virtually no detectable 
odor they are malleable enough to be shaped into a souvenir or 
rolled waferthin to fit inside a suitcase lining detonators now 
are small enough to fit into a suitcase lock 
moreover the age of the metalfree handgun is looming according 
to david kyd spokesman for the international air transport 
association in geneva such a gun has been developed in austria and 
will be extremely hard to detect on xray screens 
the sophistication and miniaturization of explosives has become 
quite worrisome kyd said in an interview 
according to david learmount of the respected journal flight 
international its an arms race 
bombs can be connected to barometric detonators that respond to 
altitude changes airports have hit back by putting baggage through 
simulated pressure to set off such bombs in safety 
the terrorists in turn have come up with a doubledevice the 
pressure detonator goes off safely but it activates a second timer 
that will detonate the bomb in the air 
the times of london said friday that this method was believed to 
have been used on flight 103 
kyd is optimistic that within two years a highly advanced 
explosives detector will become operational 
now being tested in us laboratories the machine bombards 
objects with thermoneutron rays that detect telltale nitrogen 
vapors but to cover the vast amount of baggage moving through large 
airports it will have to be small mobile and able to distinguish 
explosives vapors from those given off by aviation fuel said kyd 
he said the biggest security hole now lies not in the terminals 
where passengers arrive to catch flights but on the tarmac where the 
planes are parked 
security he said is difficult to impose on the hundreds of 
airport workers swarming about the tarmac many of the menial jobs 
are held by lowpaid immigrants who are vulnerable to bribery and 
whose background is unverifiable in a security screening 
we can put all the screens in place to check passengers and 
luggage but theres still the problem of direct access to aircraft 
by people who are there to clean planes fuel them and put food 
aboard he said 
the weapons used in the hijacking of a kuwaiti airliner by 
iranian extremists this year were probably smuggled aboard in 
catering trolleys in bangkok kyd said 
a huge amount can still be done for security but the fact that 
its possible doesnt mean its feasible learmount said in an 
interview 
el al is unique he said because israel as a nation operates 
in some respects under siege under military conditions and all its 
citizens accept that so its airline has to act in many respects 
like a military operation 
el al passengers have to check in three hours before takeoff 
their baggage is handsearched and the slightest irregularity in a 
travel document can mean a polite but lengthy interrogation about 
the passengers origins work family friends and purpose of travel 
if another airline used such tactics on passengers learmount 
said i suspect they wouldnt keep on flying with you for very 
long 
el al has never had an aircraft bombed but an el al boeing 707 
was hijacked over italian airspace by three armed members of the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine on july 23 1968 all 
passengers and crew were freed over several days after the plane 
landed in algeria

two french girls held hostage for 13 months 
celebrated a belated christmas on friday with a party thrown by 
their home town 
but public rejoicing was tempered with suggestions that libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi used the children to boost his image 
this is the end of a nightmare pascal betille father of 
7yearold marielaure and 6yearold virginie told hundreds of 
people gathered in the public square of ollioules in southern 
france this is happiness 
the girls held by an extremist palestinian group were handed 
over to french officials thursday in the libyan capital of tripoli 
six days after gadhafi called for their release 
the childrens mother jacqueline valente five belgians and a 
baby sister born in captivity remained in the hands of abu nidals 
fatahrevolutionary council backed by libya the group suspected 
in numerous cases of terrorism accused them of spying for israel 
doctors at a marseille hospital said friday the girls were in 
good physical and psychological health 
the children and their father attended the town party in 
ollioules near the mediterranean port of toulon before leaving for 
a vacation at an undisclosed location 
the french press welcomed the return of marielaure and virginie 
but it gave equal space to what the conservative daily le figaro 
called nausea at the motive for the release 
at the close of this ignoble drama there remains an 
aftertaste of bitterness le figaro wrote gadhafi today wants 
to play the role of father christmas 
the girls freedom is widely viewed here as gadhafis effort to 
boost his image at a time when the united states alleging libya has 
a chemical weapons plant issued threats of a military strike 
this gesture by the colonel is not gratuitous when once again 
the object of american threats he urgently needs to finetune his 
image as a reasonable man of state commented the daily le 
monde 
the press also noted a renewed effort by libya to improve 
relations with the european economic community which reduced 
diplomatic activity with libya following the us raid on tripoli in 
april 1986 
french officials said no conditions were made for the the release 
of the girls 
the only exchange le monde quoted officials as saying was 
allowing gadhafi to make a nice gesture 
gadhafi called for the girls release on christmas eve once 
freed fatahrevolutionary council in a statement issued in beirut 
lebanon said the girls were a gift to france from the children 
of the yearold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories 
they were taken captive nov 8 1987 when the silco a sardine 
trawler turned yacht was seized off the gaza strip according to 
the captors announcement 
there have been reports the boat was actually seized off the 
coast of libya highlighting the mystery that has surrounded the 
hostages from the start 
le monde quotes french intelligence sources as suggesting the 
belgian hostages may never have left libya and that the girls may 
have arrived there long before the official announcement thursday 
the hostages who have received little public attention over the 
past year have been referred to in the french press as the 
forgotten hostages 
the case is considered unrelated to the 15 westerners held 
hostage in lebanon by proiranian factions they include nine 
americans the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985

mercedesbenz has paid a record 202 million 
fine because its 1986 cars guzzled too much gasoline the national 
highway traffic safety administration said friday 
the luxury german automaker was fined because the 86020 cars it 
sold in the united states in the 1986 model year fell 47 miles per 
gallon short of meeting that years required fleet average minimum 
mileage 260 mpg said tim hurd spokesman for the agency 
the law requires a fine of 5 for every tenth of a mile per 
gallon that the standard is missed 235 a car in this case times 
the number of cars sold 
manufacturers may apply credits earned by doing better than the 
minimum in other years but mercedes exhausted all its credits in 
the 1985 model year 
an administrative law judge has proposed to fine the company 
about 55 million for 1985 when the companys us fleet averaged 
236 mpg and the requirement was 275 mpg without credits the 1985 
fine would be nearly 18 million hurd said 
the largest previous fine was 88 million paid by jaguar in 1987 
for shortfalls in 1985 jaguar also paid about 6 million in 1986

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india the offspring of leaders who 
helped feed the bitter feud between their nations were getting 
along famously on friday sources said 
ms bhutto who took office four weeks ago met gandhi for the 
first time thursday when he arrived in islamabad for a sevennation 
south asian summit that has been overshadowed by meetings between 
the leaders of the regions two mightiest powers 
the two held a second private meeting friday and indian sources 
said the talks were friendly and productive 
their talks have been very warm very cordial an indian 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity he said there was 
hope for a new face on the relationship between the two countries 
one of warmth trust and confidence 
another indian source said theyre getting along famously 
pakistani officials declined comment on the talks 
before gandhi returns to new delhi on saturday india and 
pakistan are expected to sign three agreements including one in 
which the countries agree not to attack each others nuclear 
installations indian sources said 
the others provide for cultural exchanges and an end to double 
taxation in trade and commerce 
the signings appear to be largely symbolic and designed to 
emphasize hopes that new leadership in pakistan will lead to better 
relations with india 
the cultural and taxation agreements were initialed about a year 
ago by both countries 
a verbal agreement on the nuclear nonattack pact was reached 
three years ago during a visit to new delhi by president mohammed 
zia ulhaq the army general who overthrew ms bhuttos father 
prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in 1977 bhutto was subsequently 
executed after being convicted of what he said was a trumpedup 
charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent 
zia was among those killed aug 17 in an explosion that destroyed 
an aircraft over pakistan 
ms bhutto and gandhis first private meeting began at 9 pm 
thursday and lasted until 130 am indian sources say the only 
other people present were ms bhuttos husband businessman asif 
zardari and gandhis wife sonia 
on friday the indian and pakistani prime ministers attended an 
allday session with the leaders of sri lanka bangladesh nepal 
bhutan and the maldives as part of the fourth annual summit of the

ministers narasimha rao of india and yaqub khan of pakistan

worst violence more than 2400 people were killed in the border 
state this year by sikh separatists india claims pakistan aids the 
extremists pakistan denies this 
gandhis mother and immediate predecessor prime minister indira 
gandhi was killed by two of her sikh bodyguards in october 1984 
four months after she ordered an army raid on the golden temple in 
amritsar where sikh militants were holed up more than 2000 
people mostly sikhs were killed 
the kashmir border dispute dates back to 1947 when moslem 
pakistan and predominantly hindu india were partitioned along 
religious lines india claims a portion of the region lying in 
pakistan 
the indian official declined to give any details of ms bhutto 
and gandhis discussions but said the leaders did more than outline 
problems but discussed what we will be able to do about them 
gandhi is to meet again with ms bhutto on saturday 
other participants in the summit are president hussain muhammad 
ershad of bangladesh president junius r jayewardene of sri lanka

the farmers home administration said friday it 
will begin next week a 200 million loan guarantee program for rural 
businesses that suffered from the 1988 drought and other weather 
disasters 
acting fmha administrator la verne ausman said the program was 
authorized by congress in the 1988 disaster assistance act new 
regulations carrying out the program will be put into effect on jan 
3 although they will have a 60day period for public comment 
ausman said the agency can make any changes that may be 
necessary after the 60day comment period is over meanwhile he 
said many rural businesses are in need of assistance the maximum 
loan amount is 500000 
under the program fmha can guarantee up to 90 percent of a loan 
to help alleviate financial distress caused directly or 
indirectly by drought hail excessive moisture or related 
conditions that occurred in 1988 he said 
the program will be similar in most respects to the existing fmha 
business and industrial or bampi guaranteed loans the loans will be 
made by regular commercial lenders at negotiated interest rates 
with fmha guarantees providing protection against loss should the 
loans fail 
ausman said the main difference is that the drought and disaster 
program will guarantee only the principal while the bampi program 
guarantees both principal and interest

hundreds of people are seeking their 
fortune in the managua city dump scrambling through tons of garbage 
in search of a lost lottery ticket worth 1300 
a restaurant employee mistakenly threw away the ticket on monday 
the day before the drawing that made it worth 6 million cordobas or 
nearly 750 times the daily minimum wage 
the owner of the restaurant andres pastora asked the national 
lottery to pay him anyway but the head of the lottery luis guzman 
said the prize will go to whoever presents the ticket 
pastora has offered a 100 reward a sum several treasure hunters 
scorned as a miserable tip according to the daily el nuevo 
diario 
sandinista tv and el nuevo diario showed pictures hundreds of 
people picking through the municipal garbage thursday and friday for 
the ticket 
dump employees said they burn trash every day and that it would 
be a miracle if anyone found it but the treasure hunters seemed 
undeterred 
it is worth making the effort said juan jose alvarado who 
is unemployed 
the minimum wage in nicaragua is 8000 cordobas a day or about 
170 a movie ticket or a pound of beef costs nearly half a days 
wage and a pair of imported jeans costs 90000 cordobas

some may call it a publicity gimmick but 
bob neel believes that revelers find his annual offer to pay funeral 
costs for anyone killed in a drunken driving accident on new years 
eve a sobering thought 
for the past 10 years neels funeral home and cemetery has 
offered a free casket funeral service and burial to anyone killed 
in a drunkendriving accident during the endofyear celebrations 
so far no one has collected and neel thinks his offer has made 
a difference 
i cant prove it with statistics of course but i get so many 
calls and letters you wouldnt believe neel said friday they 
tell me its made them more aware of drinking i know it has me and 
my friends the publicity im sure has done some good 
neel chairman of woodlawn memorial park amp funeral home started 
the practice in 1979 and he believes he was the first to do so 
ive been challenged on that by other funeral directors he 
said but i know of no one who offers all of the services that we 
do the family would not have to spend one cent 
neel said the casket grave funeral service minister 
embalming flowers and incidentals would cost about 3500 
originally woodlawn required that those who planned to drink and 
drive over the holiday had to sign up to take advantage of the 
offer later neel dropped that stipulation and just had people call 
in beforehand 
but for the past two years all that a relative or friend of the 
deceased had to do was come in after the accident and request the 
funeral 
the victim does not have to be the person driving he or she can 
be a passenger or an innocent bystander killed in a smashup caused 
by a drunken driver 
to dramatize the project this year woodlawn dug a fresh grave 
friday morning provided a vault and chapel tent and had a minister 
on hand for television cameras and reporters 
we pray that it wont be used said neel its an unusual 
thing to do and publicize but if we save even one life its worth 
it

the government resigned friday in 
reaction to mounting criticism of its handling of an economic 
crisis the first to do so since the communists took power after 
world war ii 
the move a sign of the liberalization creeping into yugoslavias 
oneparty system represented a further break with the legacy of 
president josip broz tito founder of communist yugoslavia and its 
undisputed leader until his death in 1980 
premier branko mikulic told parliament he and the entire 
31member cabinet stepped down because legislators refused wednesday 
to pass an economic law needed to ensure continued support from the 
international monetary fund 
mikulic a 60yearold economist and tito ally who took office in 
may 1986 was seen as a hardliner in the ruling communist party his 
resignation indicated that reformoriented forces eager to adopt 
westernstyle changes are gaining the upper hand in a protracted 
political struggle 
few yugoslavs however expected mikulics resignation to bring 
any immediate solutions to an economic crisis that has reduced 
living standards by 50 percent since 1980 
foreign debt stands at 21 billion unemployment at 15 percent 
and inflation at around 250 percent three times what it was when 
mikulic took office 
in a speech to parliament broadcast on live national television 
mikulic firmly rejected responsibility for the countrys economic 
and social woes effectively blaming the system bequeathed by tito 
he said difficulties created in past decades could not be solved in 
the 2 years he has spent in office 
mikulic will stay in office as a caretaker premier until the 
nineman federal presidency names a new government in january 
the complex federal system bequeathed by tito stipulates that all 
federal decisions must be unanimously agreed on by yugoslavias six 
constituent republics and two autonomous provinces 
in practice this has meant that federal decisions are watered 
down to ineffectual compromises that each region interprets as it 
wants 
referring to yugoslavias maze of federal republican and local 
bureaucracies and laws mikulic told parliament that decisions about 
the economy are made in 7000 to 8000 different places suggesting 
it was unfair to blame the government 
falling living standards have provoked more than 1000 strikes 
this year in a country once hailed as a workermanaged state 
discontent also has eaten at the prestige of the communist party 
whose membership has fallen steadily 
two belgrade residents who asked not to be named said they 
expected little to change after the first fall of a communist 
government in yugoslavia 
did they fall indeed a travel agent asked upon being told 
the news so who is going to congratulate us for the new year 
she quipped 
a housewife shopping before the threeday new year holiday 
lamented the difficulty of making ends meet each month 
so what do you expect will happen now she said they are 
all of a kind they cannot do anything or do not want to except 
build seaside villas at the expense of the workers 
she was referring to a scandal in mikulics native republic of 
bosniahercegovina where hundreds of party officials have been 
accused of securing illegal loans to build themselves homes in the 
adriatic resort of neum 
mikulic survived an attempted vote of confidence in may when 
parliamentary deputies from the liberal northern republic of 
slovenia and from croatia failed to gain support from four other 
republics for mikulics ouster 
but criticism had mounted in recent weeks government minister 
oskar kovac who oversaw yugoslavias negotiations with its debtors 
resigned dec 5 citing unidentified pressures that hindered 
marketoriented reform 
ironically parliament on thursday passed a package of economic 
reform laws that should allow mixed ownership and greater foreign 
investment measures economists have long prescribed for 
yugoslavias economic ills 
increasing poverty has exacerbated traditional ethnic conflicts 
among the more than 30 ethnic groups who make up yugoslavias 23 
million citizens 
but parliament on wednesday defied mikulics warnings about the 
need to live up to its obligations to the international monetary 
fund refusing to pass a law curbing public spending 
such austerity measures are a condition of imf aid to 
inflationridden countries such as yugoslavia mikulic said the imf 
had demanded the law as a condition for granting the belgrade 
government a oneyear 416 million standby credit in june 
some 260 million of that credit has been used to date according 
to official estimates the loan also encouraged western creditors to 
reschedule payments on yugoslavias mounting foreign debt

soldiers of the prosoviet afghan 
government will cease firing on usbacked moslem guerrillas next 
week and will refrain from attacks as long as the insurgents do 
afghan president najib said friday 
but a guerrilla spokesman in islamabad said the insurgents would 
keep fighting in the 10year war rendering the truce meaningless 
all sections and divisions of the republics military forces 
have been given an order to observe a ceasefire from jan 1 in 
conditions in which the opposite side will refrain from direct 
attack the official soviet news agency tass quoted najib as 
saying on afghan television 
afghan government radio said moslem insurgents will be given four 
days to accept the truce if they refuse government troops will 
start shooting again said radio kabul monitored in islamabad 
the truce was dismissed by masood khalili a spokesman for the 
jamiateislami guerrilla group its leader burhanuddin rabbani 
met with soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov in saudi 
arabia last month 
we did not start our fight because he asked us to and we wont 
stop because he asked us to khalili said he wont have any 
ceasefire because mujahedeen holy warriors wont stop fighting 
soviet troops marched into afghanistan in december 1979 to help 
the communist government fight the guerrillas 
in april moscow signed a unbrokered accord providing for the 
withdrawal of more than 100000 red army soldiers by feb 15 1989 
half had left by aug 15 
soviet officials say the withdrawal was halted because of 
continuing us and pakistani aid to the guerrillas 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a speech to the united 
nations on dec 7 proposed that a ceasefire begin in afghanistan 
on jan 1 and that all military supplies be cut off 
the sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance headquartered in 
pakistan rejected the ceasefire 
najib also declared a ceasefire that began jan 15 1988 but 
the insurgents ignored it and the fighting continued 
khalili said the fighting wont stop until najib and his ruling 
marxist peoples democratic party of afghanistan leave kabul 
vorontsov also has met former afghan king zaher shah in italy to 
discuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians or 
prominent public figures to create a new government 
khalili said moscow has escalated the fighting inside afghanistan 
within the past two weeks he said the panjshir valley commander 
ahmad shah masoud reported civilian casualties were heavy after 
bombing raids in the northern takhar provincial capital of taloqan 
there also were indications the guerrillas planned to step up 
their offensive 
leaders of the pakistanbased afghan guerrilla alliance left 
tehran on friday after apparently working out a joint strategy with 
iranianbacked rivals aimed at toppling the kabul regime and 
installing an islamic government irans official islamic republic 
news agency said 
irna monitored in cyprus said the pakistanbased guerrillas 
led by rabbani were seen off at tehrans mehrabad airport by 
mohammad karim khalili a leader of the iranbased coalition 
the two guerrilla groups declared tuesday the ninth anniversary 
of the soviet invasion of afghanistan that they will not accept any 
ceasefire until all the soviets have left and najibs government 
has been toppled 
the eightparty iranbased group is shiite moslem like most 
iranians and the pakistanbased alliance is sunni moslem shiites 
make up about 20 percent of afghanistans 13 million people 
in the past the radical shiite factions have largely operated 
separately from the pakistanbased groups and taken a more extremist 
islamic position about the role of religion in any future afghan 
government 
the iranians who are improving relations with the soviets after 
years of strain have been trying to reconcile the two guerrilla 
coalitions in the hope of producing an afghan government dominated 
by the moslem insurgents 
the soviet withdrawal has been hampered by unremitting attacks by 
the estimated 200000 mujahedeen 
the 5000060000 soviet troops still in afghanistan are believed 
to be concentrated in two evacuation corridors in the east and west 
while the guerrillas battle against the increasingly demoralized 
afghan army in worsening winter conditions

policies are being bogged down by a communist party dictatorship 
of mediocrity that ought to resign

gorbachev said elections for a new government structure a congress 
of peoples deputies will determine real power in the soviet union 
they pledged allout support for gorbachev 
but they said that a campaign begun after the june party 
conference in moscow to review nearly 20 million party members with 
a view toward their support for gorbachevs reforms had been 
hampered by too many directives 
they said that experience made them doubt whether the elections 
would firmly implant reformers throughout the soviet system 
can it be said that we are entering the new year and moving 
toward elections with full confidence in the irreversibility of the 
democratic renewal of society they asked one would very much 
like to answer that question positively but a feeling of sensible 
realistic responsibility holds us back from such an evaluation 
the writers said a dictatorship of mediocrity was rampant 
not only among individual conservatives who remain in the party 
apparatus but throughout the entire communist party headquarters 
the letter was published in the jan 1 edition of the weekly 
moscow news which was released friday it was signed by grigory 
baklanov editor of the monthly literary journal znamya playwright 
alexander gelman author danil granin film producer elem klimov 
actor mikhail ulyanov and space scientist roald sagdeyev 
speeches by baklanov and ulyanov both caused sharp disputes with 
conservatives at the june party conference 
gorbachev has sought to get the party out of daytoday 
management leaving that to local economic and government officials 
but the party retains final authority and has shown no sign of 
tolerating any opposition 
the writers said that there undoubtedly must be opponents of 
gorbachevs reforms in soviet society and that they must be able to 
state their ideas but it said party members who oppose gorbachevs 
reforms must be judged severely 
those who do not agree with the new course must retire they 
said 
the six also appealed for more tolerance of informal political 
and social organizations that have sprung up in the freer atmosphere 
fostered by gorbachevs reforms 
if we dont find the path toward cooperation with dissidents a 
temptation to rush to repressive measures probably will arise and 
already has arisen with all the antidemocratic consequences that 
flow from this they said 
cooperation with dissidents not only doesnt weaken but on the 
contrary strengthens the authority of restructuring they said

sales of new homes hurt by a big slump in 
activity in the northeast declined by 8 percent in november the 
largest setback in 18 months the government reported friday 
the commerce department said that new singlefamily homes were 
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671000 units last 
month down from a revised october sales rate of 729000 units 
the november decline was the second in the past three months and 
the sharpest since an 116 percent decrease in may 1987 sales had 
risen 44 percent in october 
while three of the four regions of the country showed sales 
declines from october to november the biggest by far was a 273 
percent plunge in sales in the northeast 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said the latest decline reflected a further cooling 
off of the northeast market which had been the hottest sales area 
for the past several years 
an awful lot of weakness has developed in the northeast market 
while the west has been surging seiders said for the first 11 
months of the year we have seen about a 15 percent decline in the 
northeast compared to the same period a year ago while sales in 
the west are up by about 10 percent 
the regional crosscurrents have resulted in total sales 
nationally holding essentialy unchanged from the 1987 level of 
671000 new homes sold 
however seiders predicted that new home sales would drop by 
about 6 percent in 1989 reflecting slower economic growth and 
higher mortgage rates 
he predicted that mortgage rates could rise as high as 12 percent 
by midyear 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported friday that rates 
rose to 1077 percent in the week just ending up from 1068 percent 
a week ago and the highest level since early november 1987 
richard peach senior economist of the mortgage bankers 
association also predicted mortgage rates would continue rising 
but he said the fact that existing home sales showed an increase in 
november should be viewed as a good sign that the bottom is not 
falling out of the housing market 
the numbers this month suggest that some buyers are switching 
from new homes to existing homes particularly in the northeast 
because they believe they represent a better value peach said 
the decline in sales was accompanied by a drop in prices the 
median price of a new home fell 42 percent to 110200 in november 
the average price was down as well declining by 08 percent to 
138900 
in addition to the northeast sales were off 75 percent in the 
south to a rate of 245000 units and down 68 percent in the west to 
a rate of 233000 units 
the midwest was the only region of the country to enjoy a rise in 
sales in november a 52 percent increase to an annual rate of 
121000 units this region is currently benefiting from a rebounding 
economy as the areas manufacturing industries enjoy rising demand 
from a boom in us exports

a kremlin commission overseeing earthquake relief 
efforts sharply criticized food suppliers in armenia saying their 
lack of vigilance has led to rumors of unfair food distribution 
tass reported friday 
in another report tass said defense minister dmitri t yazov 
called for an improved civil defense system to react to disasters 
like the dec 7 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people 
the official news agency in a report from the armenian capital 
of yerevan said the politburo commission led by yuri balatin warned 
that officials responsible for poorly organized food supplies to 
devastated northern armenia would be held personally responsibile 
the work style of a number of officials is limited to commands 
they do not actually have the situation in hand and do not make spot 
checks to exercise control at local level tass said 
lack of control has led to contradictory and unfounded rumors 
about an allegedly unfair distribution of relief aid it said it 
did not elaborate 
tass also said 34 food stores reopened in the city of leninakan 
armenias secondlargest with a population of 280000 before the 
earthquake ten fruit and vegetable stores and nine department 
stores also reopened it said 
on thursday armenian officials said the number of bodies 
recovered was fewer than 25000 and that only about 100 remained to 
be found they blamed the initial death toll estimate of 55000 on 
information based on the amount of physical destruction and the 
disruption of communications and transportation 
many armenians are still homeless and ailing and foreign 
volunteers will be needed there for up to two years west germanys 
red cross president said 
there is tremendous fear even now about the possibility of 
aftershocks so even the little housing that is habitable in the 
worsthit areas is being avoided botho wittgenstein said in 
cologne after returning from armenia 
other red cross officials said the housing problem is worsening 
because temperatures are falling and there is not enough tent space 
tass said the politburo commission adopted a plan for improving 
armenias railroads to ensure that aid gets to the stricken area 
without dramatic improvements in the rail lines that were torn up 
by the quake it said aid wont reach affected areas fast enough 
road air and rail bottlenecks have slowed movement of relief 
supplies to the area in the foothills of the caucasus mountains in 
the soviet south officials from premier nikolai i ryzhkov down 
have criticized the organization of the early relief work 
tass reported that yazov has called for upgrading civil defense 
services in the soviet union incorporating welltrained military 
and civilian experts 
specialized foreign rescue teams using trained dogs and 
sophisticated equipment pulled scores of people from the rubble in 
the ruined cities the soviet union did not have any comparable 
teams 
more than 23000 soldiers were sent to the area to restore 
communications and utilities preserve order and provide medical 
care and food

a foreign ministry statement categorically denied that 
czechoslovakia ever provided explosives to terrorists 
british authorities said wednesday that the residue of explosives 
recovered from the debris of the boeing 747 that crashed in 
lockerbie scotland on dec 21 was consistent with the use of a 
highperformance plastic explosive 
that led to speculation the bomb may have been made of semtex an 
orangecolored plastic explosive manufactured in czechoslovakia 
terrorism experts and us state department officials have said 
that syria and libya obtained semtex from czechoslovakia and passed 
it on to surrogate terrorist groups 
so far no group or individual has been identified as a prime 
suspect in the bombing 
czechoslovakia again emphasizes that it condemns categorically 
all acts forms and methods of terrorism and that it complies 
consistently with the appropriate international commitments said 
the foreign ministry statement carried by the state news agency ctk 
it has never supplied and does not supply explosions to 
terrorist organizations the statement said 
ctk said the ministry issued the statement in response to reports 
semtex may have been used in the pan am disaster 
we are prepared should this help the identification of the 
explosive used to send any time czechoslovak experts for the

federal police said friday they are 
close to solving the slaying of an ecologist who angered ranchers by 
fighting to protect the vast amazon jungle 
the murder is still not solved but the investigation is 
heading in the right direction and is close to the end said 
police spokesman paulo marra in brasilia 
francisco mendes 44 was shot to death dec 22 outside his home 
in the jungle town of xapuri 2660 miles northwest of rio near the 
bolivian border 
marra said the body was to be exhumed so there will be no 
doubts when we reach our conclusions 
mendes honored by the united nations for his defense of the 
environment and his belief that the amazon jungle could be developed 
without being destroyed had said before his death that big 
landowners had made threats against his life 
federal agents sent to faroff acre state to work on the mendes 
case detained five ranchers thursday for questioning but did not 
formally arrest them marra said 
remaining in custody in acre were darcy pereira da silva 21 
oloci alves da silva 22 and aleci alves da silva 23 all sons of 
ranch owner darly alves da silva 
mendes told a rio newspaper dec 9 that darly da silva was one of 
those who most wanted him killed because of his efforts as an 
ecologist and as head of the local rubber tree tappers union 
darcy da silva said on tuesday he had killed mendes but police 
said the confession could have been a smokescreen to protect others 
the deputy justice minister luis fernando eichenberg told the 
privately owned rio station radio jornal do brasil on friday if 
darcy wasnt the author of the crime and it seems he wasnt 
there is some indication he was at the scene 
the issue of how to develop the amazon jungle an expanse of rain 
forest about twothirds the size of the continental united states 
has often erupted in violent conflicts between landowners landless 
peasants politicians clergymen and ecologists

meat imports are not expected to rise enough in 
1989 to trigger mandatory quotas on shipments from foreign 
suppliers agriculture secretary richard e lyng said friday 
the annual estimate is required by law and is subject to revision 
every three months during the calendar year it was the first 
estimate for 1989 
lyng said a formula in the law calls for maximum imports of 
slightly less than 1438 billion pounds in 1989 down 877 million 
pounds from the 1988 trigger level 
but lyng said total 1989 imports are not expected to exceed 1425 
billion pounds or about 13 million pounds below the quota trigger 
the law covers imports of fresh chilled or frozen meat of 
cattle sheep except lambs and goats and certain prepared and 
preserved beef and veal products 
most is lowgrade beef used to make hamburger and other processed 
meat items australia and new zealand are the principal suppliers 
although about a dozen countries are eligible to ship quotatype 
meat into the us market

it has been 11 years since craig air force 
base furled its flag in the nations last round of militarybase 
closings a blow the mayor says hurt selma more than the tumultuous 
civil rights era 
in just one day oct 1 1977 the city and surrounding dallas 
county lost 2500 military and civilian jobs a 40 million payroll 
and untold millions in economic spinoffs the kind of fiscal future 
other communities may face under the list of 34 recommended base 
closings released thursday by a government panel 
joe smitherman mayor of selma then and now said friday that 
gains have been made in converting the former flighttraining base 
to private use but the mostly black rural area still has not 
recovered he said 
we havent got it developed like we hoped it would be its 
mostly turned into a housing project smitherman said 
while the nation remembers selma for civil rights benchmarks like 
the bloody sunday clash on the edmund pettus bridge and the rev 
martin luther king jrs subsequent voting rights march to 
montgomery in 1965 smitherman said the loss of craig was the 
biggest single impact weve had on the area 
people do adjust to civil rights changes but its hard to 
adjust to an economic loss like the base he said 
hugh allen head of the authority that oversees what used to be 
the base said dallas countys unemployment rate temporarily doubled 
to about 20 percent when craig shut down 
but it was a lot more than that there was the real estate and 
people who were used to having a lot of military business lost it 
said allen 
state statistics showed dallas countys unemployment rate at 86 
percent in 1976 the last full year of recordkeeping before the 
closing the rate rose to 93 percent in 1979 but that number 
reflects only the number of residents seeking employment rather 
than try to find work in the county allen estimates that 3000 to 
3700 people out of a town of 27000 simply left 
in the decade since craigs closure local authorities have 
fought toothandnail over the field smitherman said 
we got word one time that federal officials were considering 
putting cuban prisoners out here we stopped that the state prison 
people were going to put a minimumsecurity prison out here and we 
stopped that he said 
what does exist at craig is a municipal airport a training 
school for state police officers and prison guards several 
companies warehouses and housing while as many as 700 people 
worked at craig two years ago allen said the recent closing of a 
beechcraft aircraft plant reduced that number to 275 to 300 
of the 500 military housing units on the property the federal 
government controls 50 the craig field airport and industrial 
authority sold about 50 about 330 are rented and 70 remain vacant 
allen said 
allen had some advice for communities that stand to lose military 
facilities under the panels recommendations 
they need to go after that property i think you need to plan 
your work and then work your plan

hungarys presidential council friday 
revised the criminal record of 120 people convicted after the 1956 
antisoviet uprising the state news agency mti reported 
they were among 174 people who were excluded from a broad amnesty 
in september for those imprisoned for participating in the revolt 
the people who were not covered by the amnesty had been told at 
that time to sumbit a proposal to the presidential council on 
granting individual pardons until nov 30 1988 
katalin gaspar head of the justice ministrys amnesty 
department said friday that those not granted clemency involved 
cases when manslaughter was committed amid inhuman 
circumstances in a dastardly manner like the killing of wounded 
persons mti reported 
clemency was also not granted to those convicted of robbery 
shopbreaking or when vengeance motivated the actual or attempted 
killing of persons because of their political persuasion or office 
held mti quoted gaspar as saying 
he said those not included in the present clemency act can 
petition the justice ministry again next year 
according to the amnesty ruling those convicted for their role 
in the 1956 revolt had their criminal record erased a criminal 
record is one reason for denying the issuance of a passport in 
hungary meaning those granted clemency would likely be permitted to 
travel under hungarys liberalized travel laws 
the september amnesty covered those sentenced to imprisonment for 
crimes against the state counterrevolutionary activities or 
persons whose death penalty was commuted to imprisonment 
the amnesty did not extend however to those convicted of high 
treason or espionage or those who in cumulation of offenses 
committed homicide robbery and caused public danger 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with mass demonstrations for a 
new government amd demands that soviet troops leave hungary on 
nov4 200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks struck at budapest to 
quell the uprising

as many as 20 infants died after drinking 
powdered milk in rural veracruz state in the last two weeks 
prompting authorities to seize boxes of the milk and test water 
supplies mexico city newspapers said friday 
el nacional the government newspaper said red cross and federal 
officials began investigating this week after a local newspaper said 
20 children had died at a clinic in perote 
perote is 20 miles west of the state capital of xalapa where the 
first report about the deaths was published in the daily grafico de 
xalapa it said the children ranged in age from 18 months to 3 
months 
they died after suffering fever sharp stomach pains diarrhea 
vomiting and convulsions the mexico city daily el universal said 
it said health authorities seized boxes of powdered milk from 
local stores and took water samples to check for contamination 
el universal said parents were alarmed by the reports despite 
denials by local officials 
pedro coronel perez the state health and welfare secretary 
toured the villages of el conejo frijol colorado los pescadores 
el limon totalco and escobillo to check the reports 
coronel perez said at least nine infants in the area had died 
from intestinal troubles in the past two months but he said 
officials had not determined if their deaths were linked to 
contaminated powdered milk 
he said the infants were from poor rural families and could have 
died from a variety of intestinal illnesses 
they lived in extreme poverty without proper food and care 
he said 
el nacional quoted perote mayor jaime roldan roa as saying that 
if there had been contaminated powdered milk in the area thousands 
of children would have died 
many people in mexico drink powdered milk because it is cheaper 
and more easily obtained than fresh milk

nearly half of more than 200 people studied 
failed to keep their new years resolutions for a month and less 
than one in five followed their pledges for two years a researcher 
said 
sticking to your resolution takes more than willpower it takes 
careful planning both before and after the new year said john c 
norcross head of the university of scrantons psychology department 
norcross headed a research team that showed only 55 percent of 
213 people kept their new years resolution for a month only 19 
percent kept their pledge for two years he said this week the 
study ran from jan 1 1986 through jan 1 1988 
people who make new years resolutions need to take them 
seriously and follow a systematic strategy for keeping them or not 
make them at all said norcross who is also a clinical psychologist 
more than half a million american adults routinely make new 
years resolutions and year after year they fail he said not 
because they lack desire rather they are poorly prepared to change 
and are undereducated in the complex process of selfchange 
norcross suggested several steps before the new year to improve 
chances of a resolution succeeding including 
define an attainable goal 
solicit the cooperation of family and friends 
have a substitute for the behavior to be changed 
a social worker in owensboro ky doesnt recommend resolutions 
at all 
youre really setting yourself up for a fall with these 
things said tom mudd a social worker at green river 
comprehensive care center 
thats because we usually set things up that are way beyond our 
reach i just dont believe in making them at all 
the key to keep from giving up and saving yourself from the guilt 
that usually accompanies failure mudd said is setting your sights 
on one or two small specific goals and then working on them as soon 
as possible 
norcross said environmental control selfreward and willpower 
were the keys to selfchange 
for example smokers who want to kick the habit could remove 
ashtrays from their home and avoid situations that would tempt them 
to smoke he said they also could devise selfrewards such as 
complimenting themselves or treating themselves to a night out for 
staying off cigarettes 
norcross said people also should be persistent even if they slip 
along the way his research showed successful resolvers slipped an 
average of 14 times during the two years of the study 
meaningful behavior change is a lifelong pursuit it takes the 
average smoker five to seven tries to quit for good he said

a senior un official has accused 
turkish police of routinely torturing detainees despite government 
efforts to polish up turkeys human rights image a dutch newspaper 
reported friday 
the rotterdam newspaper nrc handelsblad said pieter kooimans un 
special rapporteur on human rights also charged turkey with 
frequently denying suspects legal assistance and keeping them in 
total isolation after their arrest 
turkey which has signed several un and european conventions 
banning the use of torture is eager to improve its human rights 
reputation after filing an application to join the european economic 
community 
the newspaper quoted kooimans as saying in an interview however 
that in my experience torture is still being used on a large 
scale especially at police stations throughout the eastern 
mediterranean nation

police facilities he said he will discuss his findings in detail in 
his annual report to the united nations human rights commission 
scheduled for publication in early 1989 the paper said

early 1980s when turkey was ruled by a military junta under gen 
kenan evren premier turgut ozal became head of a civilian 
government in 1983 evren is still president 
under turkeys legal practice pretrial detention without the 
possibility of legal assistance and with the detainees being kept in

the commerce department reported friday that 
its chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 02 percent in 
november continuing a sawtooth pattern that analysts said portends 
a slowdown but no recession in 1989 
the sluggishness in the departments index of leading economic 
indicators was actually viewed as good news by some experts who 
said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace 
threatening new inflation 
the 02 percent november decline was the fourth drop in the past 
seven months since may the index has alternated between gains and 
declines showing very little forward momentum 
the index has risen by just 16 percent over the past 12 months 
less than half of the 41 percent increase of the previous 12month 
period suggesting that overall economic growth will slow 
significantly in 1989 
in another signal of slower growth the government reported 
friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in november the 
biggest decline in 18 months analysts blamed the setback which put 
sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 671000 units on 
rising mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989 
the last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence 
over the financial markets which closed out the final trading day 
of the year with mixed results in light trading 
bond prices rose slightly the dollar weakened marginally against 
key currencies and the dow jones industrial average fell 1411 
points to close at 216857 though advancing issues slightly 
outnumbered declines on the new york stock exchange 
the reagan administration said the setback in the leading index 
was nothing to become alarmed over showing only that the economy 
was slowing a bit the traditional signal for a recession in the 
past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the 
index 
the data continue to suggest a trend towards slower but 
continued economic growth and moderate inflation in the months 
ahead white house spokesman roman popadiuk told reporters in palm 
springs calif where president reagan is vacationing 
private analysts agreed forecasting that overall economic 
growth as measured by the gross national product will probably dip 
to around 25 percent in 1989 that would be down from an expected 
growth rate of 39 percent in 1988 the economys best performance 
in four years 
we turned in a real strong 1988 despite the drought but it is 
virtually certain that we will see slower growth in 1989 said 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of home 
builders 
economists said that with many factories producing at near peak 
capacity and the unemployment rate near a 14year low a slowdown is 
needed to dampen inflationary pressures most said they saw little 
danger that the slowdown would threaten a recession next year 
because we are still growing at a fairly rapid clip we can 
slow quite a bit before there is a danger of a recession said 
richard peach senior economist at the mortgage bankers association 
this slowing will be very good news for the economy because it 
will remove inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve has been nudging interest rates up since last 
march and analysts said they expected further credit tightening 
moves in the early part of 1989 until the central bank becomes 
convinced that inflationary forces are under control 
in november four of the available nine indicators contributed to 
the decline in the leading index which fell to 1932 percent of its 
1967 base of 100 
the biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery times on 
business orders this is viewed negatively for the future because it 
indicates declining demand for products 
the other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in 
stock prices an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a 
decline in raw materials prices also viewed as a negative because 
it signals falling demand 
three indicators made positive contributions led by an increase 
in growth in the money supply other positive forces were a rise in 
manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders 
for new plants and equipment 
two indicators building permits and the length of the average 
workweek were unchanged in november

the reagan administration did not adequately 
study the protections needed for migratory wildlife before adopting 
a plan last year for offshore oil and gas leasing through 1992 a 
federal appeals court ruled friday 
the us circuit court of appeals said the interior department 
failed to perform an adequate analysis of the cumulative impacts 
of the program on migratory species it ordered the department to 
try again though the ruling does not immediately impede the leasing 
program 
the wildlife at issue include the gray whale and salmon that 
migrate in the north pacific between california and alaska and 
various migratory birds 
the appeals courts unsigned 64page opinion rejected all other 
aspects of a challenge against the fiveyear plan adopted by 
interior secretary donald p hodel in july 1987 
the previous fiveyear plan survived all court challenges 
the latest plan was challenged by the national resources defense 
council other environmental groups and the states of california 
massachusetts oregon and washington 
leasing activities have not been held in abeyance pending the 
legal fight however and are not immediately affected by fridays 
ruling the appeals court ordered the interior department to comply 
with federal environmental law by providing the required 
environmental impact statements on migratory species 
this is a significant victory for the environment said james 
thornton of the national resources defense council in san francisco 
it allows the new secretary of interior and presidentelect bush 
to look at the entire leasing program and decide whether there 
should be a kinder gentler fiveyear plan 
he said the ruling would carry a profound impact for federal 
waters off northern california oregon and washington where as yet 
no oil and gas leasing has occurred 
the american petroleum institute the largest trade group said 
it was pleased with the decision it reaffirms what we have long 
been saying that the fiveyear offshore leasing program does 
address adequately and fairly the concerns of state and local 
interests 
william bettenberg associate director of the departments 
minerals management service said he was pleased and not very 
surprised that the department had been largely upheld 
it will be very easy to meet the courts requirement in about 
two months he said since the analysis already has been done for 
the various leasing areas individually and what has to be done is 
show the impact if any across all areas 
based on all the research done previously im confident well 
find no substantial impact on migrations bettenberg said 
the first possible lease offering that could be affected is 
scheduled in alaska for december 1989

a federal contract that gave prisoners 
processing mortgage applications access to credit card and bank 
account numbers has been canceled 
i cant run the risk its just too high a risk warden 
patrick kane of the federal correctional institution in lexington 
said thursday no one in their right mind is going to allow this 
stuff in an institution 
the us secret service is investigating whether any inmates 
might have misused the information 
the contract between the federal department of housing and urban 
development and the prison called for inmates to type information 
from completed mortgage applications into computers since the work 
began as a pilot project in july more than 60000 applications have 
been sent to the prison 
about 600 of the applications contained either credit card or 
bank account numbers 
the decision to discontinue the contract between hud and the 
prison was made during a meeting of hud and bureau of prisons 
officials in washington according to kane 
an inmate at the institution beverly hirsch first sounded the 
alarm about the credit card numbers the lexington heraldleader 
reported friday kane said ms hirsch serving a 40year sentence 
for bank and credit card fraud told him that some inmates had 
copied the credit card numbers and that some of the information had 
been passed out of the institution 
secret service agent bill cravens of lexington who is heading 
the investigation said friday there was no evidence the information 
was being used illegally 
so far as we know now none of the card numbers have been 
compromised he said 
a spokesman for the bureau of prisons said the hud mortgage 
applications did not ask applicants for their credit card or bank 
account numbers 
some overzealous lending officers added the information to the 
application in an effort to overdocument the applications said 
john pendleton a bureau of prisons spokesman

israel on friday denounced as repugnant 
libel an editorial in an egyptian government newspaper saying the 
israeli secret service may have been responsible for last weeks 
bombing of pan am flight 103 
also friday egyptian president hosni mubarak was quoted by a 
west german magazine as saying an antiplo group that may be 
working with certain israeli circles planned a largescale attack 
to discredit the palestinians 
mubarak did not identify the group and did not draw any links 
between the planned attack and the dec 21 bombing of the pan am jet 
over scotland 
in an unsigned editorial friday the egyptian newspaper al akhbar 
said it was possible israels mossad intelligence service carried 
out the pan am bombing that killed 270 people 
the editorial claimed israel had a past record in masterminding 
such sort of crimes which aim at casting suspicion on palestinian or 
arab elements it did not elaborate 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said his government 
is amazed by the fact that an official egyptian newspaper has 
published an injurious article of this kind 
israel rejects the repugnant libel attributing to israel a 
victim of plo aviation terrorism the same terrorist methods used 
against her during the last 25 years liel said in a statement 
mubarak was asked in an interview by the magazine der spiegel 
what would happen if arabs opposed to peace in the middle east 
activated terrorists such as abu nidals group 
by allah one must reckon with this certain groups have surely 
hammered out such plans the news weekly quoted mubarak as saying 
i dont want to name any names but there is one group that 
wanted to let arafat speak before the un general assembly and 
then start a largescale terrorist action in order to turn public 
opinion against the palestinians spiegel quoted mubarak as saying 
these criminal elements that are trying to prevent peace may be 
working with certain israeli circles i dont know he was quoted 
as saying 
the spiegel article did not say when and where mubarak was 
interviewed 
the reports come at a time when israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is seeking mubaraks help in launching a new middle east 
peace initiative 
egypt which signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 is the 
only arab nation to maintain diplomatic ties with the jewish state 
but relations have often been strained 
arafat renounced terrorism at a news conference after a speech to 
the un general assembly in middecember in geneva the session was 
moved to geneva after the us state department refused to issue 
arafat a visa to speak at un headquarters in new york 
arafats statement led to the united states opening a dialogue 
with the palestine liberation organization

better said mrs bogoraz i saw him the day before yesterday 
but i cant say how he looked 
she said he had died at his apartment in moscow 
daniels most famous work this is moscow calling 
satirically called for a public murder day in which soviets 
over the age of 16 would be allowed to kill someone as long as it 
was not a policeman or a public transport worker 
under soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness some of daniels works written in 
prison camp were published in moscow in july as he lay in a hospital 
daniel and sinyavsky conscious of the ostracism of nobel 
prizewinning author boris pasternak for publishing his novel 
doctor zhivago abroad used the pseudonyms nikolai arzhak and 
abram terts respectively to publish their works abroad 
despite persecution of writers such as pasternak premier nikita

soviet union by foreign radio stations 
the kremlin followed their trial with a long and determined 
crackdown on dissidents and unofficial publications but during the 
late 1960s unofficial publications and the number of dissidents 
nevertheless grew 
the trial brought mrs bogoraz to prominence she and others were 
arrested in 1968 for a red square protest against the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
daniel lived and worked in kaluga and moscow after he finished 
his term but did not take part in any further dissident activities

friday president augusto pinochet announced a 10 percent increase 
in the minimum legal salary of 57 a month earned by nearly one 
third of chiles 4 million workers 
the 73yearold president and army commander said in a speech 
over national radio and tv that a 10 percent wage increase also will 
be granted to chiles 500000 government workers with both 
increases effective feb 1

equilibrium and the firm economic growth achieved by his 
15yearold military government 
pinochet asked chileans to unite to face the important 
challenges that we will meet in the new year 
he said national unity is his governments main goal 
lets set aside those things that separate us pinochet said

the justice department said friday that closing the 
miami news could trigger an antitrust suit if investigators 
determine that its owner did not make a serious effort to sell the 
newspaper 
the 92yearold news is due to close saturday if a buyer is not 
found 
meanwhile a federal judge on friday dismissed efforts by local 
groups trying to force the news to stay open saying the government 
could not compel a newspaper to publish 
the news is owned by cox enterprises inc and since 1966 has been 
published under a joint operating agreement between cox and 
knightridder inc which owns the rival miami herald 
cox had been conducting sale negotiations with a chicago 
consultant representing a group of investors but david easterly 
who heads atlantabased coxs newspaper division said friday no 
deal was made 
its over easterly said 
in the newsroom news staffers were cleaning out desks while 
keeping ears open for the latest efforts to halt the closing 
its been real stressful said bonnie anderson a former 
nbctv foreign correspondent who became a news columnist 15 months 
ago this is a very dignified 92yearold woman and she deserves 
to die with some honor not to keep her on lifesupport systems 
many staffers planned to gather in the early morning hours 
saturday for the final press run 
in washington the justice department found that an amendment to 
the joint operating agreement allowing cox to share herald profits 
even if the news is shut down means the deal would likely lose its 
antitrust immunity said charles f rule head of the antitrust 
division 
that amendment would make it financially beneficial to both 
parties if the news goes out of business rule wrote therefore 
the investigation deals not only with how vigorous a search was made 
for potential buyers by cox but how seriously negotiations were 
conducted once a potential buyer was found 
a conclusion that serious efforts by cox would have resulted in 
the sale of the miami news could provide the basis for an antitrust 
suit his memo said 
knightridder officials said they were studying rules memo 
we and our lawyers are reviewing it and we have no comment at 
the moment said james k batten president and chief executive 
officer of knightridder 
easterly refused to comment on rules statement saying only 
press releases are not law 
easterly was attending a hearing in miami on the federal suit 
filed by officials from a dozen community newspapers who claim 
closing the news will result in a monopoly for the herald the 
plaintiffs included readers and distributors of the news 
after the twohour hearing us district judge stanley marcus 
rejected their arguments 
the question is whether the government has the power to compel 
a newspaper to publish if it wishes to be silent marcus said 
ruling that he had no such right he also questioned whether the 
plaintiffs could show they stood to lose because of the sale 
negotiations for the papers sale snagged earlier in the week 
when easterly rejected the investors proposal that cox support the 
papers losses for six weeks while the potential buyers obtained a 
loan

a pentagon review of 17 accidental deaths in 
navy training over the past two years said the service was trying to 
improve its safety record but a wisconsin congressman called the 
report an insult and accused the navy of stonewalling 
if this wasnt so serious it would be a joke said rep toby 
roth rwis roth took interest in the issue after the death of a 
constituent airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis 
a navy swimming instructor at the training base in pensacola 
fla was convicted of negligent homicide last september in the 
mirecki case and sentenced to 90 days in jail 
in wisconsin if you hit a parked car you get more of a penalty 
than that roth said in a telephone interview friday this death 
could have been prevented it was negiligence things got out of 
hand 
the paragraph dealing with mirecki in the 10page pentagon report 
said the only action taken had been review of training courses to 
ensure maximum safety of students while retaining required realism 
the court record showed mirecki had been dunked repeatedly while 
other recruits were forced to stand with their hands against the 
wall singing the national anthem 
in a letter attached to the report assistant secretary of 
defense grant s green said the personnel casualties we have 
suffered in training are few when compared to the number of students 
undergoing training 
that is not to diminish the personal tragedy which is 
represented by each training fatality said green chief of 
personnel for the pentagon 
beyond the personal loss accidents pose the greatest peacetime 
threat to our warfighting assets i assure you that we will continue 
to pursue vigorously methods to reduce accident losses to our 
personnel and equipment in our training activities greens letter 
said 
the pentagon spending bill for the current fiscal year called on 
the navy to report on the training deaths to congress by dec 31 
we had been going around and around with the navy and never got 
answers roth said i thought there had been some stonewalling 
the congressman said that after he met with green on friday 
morning and complained about the report green said we will 
consider this an interim report and we will try to comply with a 
more complete version later 
green could not be reached at his office friday afternoon 
a pentagon spokesman navy cmdr mel sundin said he was not 
familiar with the report but read a statement a letter 
forwarding an interim report on the causes and circumstances of all 
deaths of navy personnel during navy training since jan 1 1986 
and on actions taken was sent today to the speaker of the house the 
hon james c wright dtexas and the president pro tempore of 
the senate sen john c stennis dmiss 
lt cmdr cw baumann a navy spokesman said he had not seen 
the report and could not comment 
spokesmen for wright and stennis said the report had not yet 
reached their offices 
roth said he would raise his complaints shortly after the 100th 
congress convenes next tuesday the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress is due to report on the issue by feb 
15 roth said 
the navy report listed the deceased trainees and the dates and

antigovernment protesters took to the 
streets of khartoum and other cities in sudan for a fourth day 
friday despite government concessions on food price increases at 
least two people were reported killed 
a western diplomat reported rumors of an imminent coup attempt in 
sudan and said the east african country remained paralyzed by a 
general strike communications were still disrupted 
khartoum commissioner fatih abdoun the capitals head of 
government told associated press reporter mohamed osman that an 
unidentified gunman opened fire on demonstrators outside cabinet 
offices on thursday killing two and wounding 28 
osman speaking by radio from khartoum also reported one dead 
and 21 injured including some victims from outside khartoum in 
eastern sudan it was not known whether the victims were included in 
the previous report 
dispatches received in cairo from the egyptian and iraqi news 
agencies on thursday reported what appeared to be two separate 
shooting incidents including one after dark with intensive 
shooting near government headquarters 
there were no reports of new violence friday but a western 
diplomat in the ethiopian capital addis ababa reported complete 
political chaos in sudan 
the diplomat who watches sudanese affairs and said he was in 
contact with khartoum said the disturbances do not seem to have 
subsided despite the fact that the price increases which originally 
sparked the trouble have been rolled back 
the action in the streets is taking on a definite 
antigovernment flavor he said it looks like the government is 
in serious trouble theres a lot of talk about a coup attempt 
coming out of khartoum 
thousands of sudanese began demonstrations and strikes tuesday a 
day after the government increased prices of prime commodities by up 
to 600 percent and imposed a 15 percent sales tax on all goods 
on thursday in response to a call by the 2millionmember sudan 
workers trade union federation a general strike closed most 
businesses and shut down communications and transportation 
facilities 
the government rescinded the price increases on thursday but it 
was not known whether the tax also was eliminated 
officials in cairo reported the first apparent loosening of the 
general strikes grip on the country khartoum international airport 
sent a notice to area airports that it was back in business for the 
first time since late wednesday 
but the national airline sudan airways scheduled service to 
khartoum from cairo was canceled friday night because airline 
employees remained on strike 
the diplomat in addis ababa said sudan still suffers from a 
complete paralyzation of transport communications and everyday 
life the railway is down inter and innercity buses have 
stopped rolling shops are closed 
it appeared that since the government backed down on the price 
increases anger has turned to prime minister sadek mahdis refusal 
to submit to the government and parliament a tentative agreement to 
end the countrys 5yearold civil war 
the head of the democratic unionist party junior partner in the 
governing coalition negotiated the pact with john garang a 
renegade army colonel who heads the rebels in southern sudan 
the agreement called for a ceasefire and suspension of islamic 
law in sudan until the matter can be discussed in a constitutional 
conference a major concession for garang he had vowed that his 
mainly christian and animist forces would continue to fight until 
the islambased legal code was abrogated 
mahdi reportedly was concerned that endorsing the islamic law 
clause would prompt the fundamentalist national islamic front to 
leave the government removing a buffer that the prime minister has 
used in disputes with the democratic unionists 
since the street protests began the democratic unionists who 
dominate the trade union federation have quit the government in 
sympathy 
reports on friday said mahdi has accepted the six unionist 
ministers resignations and will name hassan turabi his 
brotherinlaw and attorneygeneral to the key unionistheld post 
of foreign minister 
that would make turabi the governments peace negotiator with 
garang as attorneygeneral turabi drafted the islamic legal code 
and as head of the islamic front he has spearheaded opposition to 
the unionistnegotiated agreement so prospects for successfully 
concluded talks would be virtually nil

two opposition activists on friday hung a 
protest banner reading free the politicals from a balcony at the 
headquarters of the community partys central committee in the 
capital 
the banner was signed with the initials of the banned polish 
socialist party and the warsaw regional council of the solidarity 
trade union movement 
the protest was connected with a weeklong hunger protest taking 
place in warsaw through sunday to draw attention to the detention of 
antimilitary activists in poland and czechoslovakia 
brief displays of opposition banners from public buildings are 
fairly common in poland however this appeared to be the first time 
activists managed to place one on the guarded headquarters of the 
communist party 
security workers seized the 15footlong banner after about five 
minutes the activists piotr ikonowicz and edward mizikowski were 
led away into the building and detained according to jozef pinior 
a socialist party spokesman 
authorities meanwhile freed a secret policeman friday who was 
sentenced to prison for helping underground members of solidarity 
prison officials and opposition sources said 
adam hodysz 48 was arrested in 1984 and initially charged with 
cooperating with solidaritys underground authorities later 
sentenced him to six years in prison on a more serious charge of 
corruption alleging he had taken money to pass police secrets to 
solidarity 
solidarity activists have denied any financial motive for 
hodyszs cooperation they say he was motivated by sympathy for the 
union movement which authorities crushed in late 1981 and banned in 
1982 
hodysz a former captain in the state security service in gdansk 
was released from a prison in koszalin in northwestern poland 
according to a duty officer at the regional board of penitentiaries 
the official refused to give his name 
the former policeman was eligible for the parole subject to good 
behavior because he had served twothirds of his prison sentence 
after his release hodysz went to st brygidas church in gdansk 
a northern port to meet with solidarity leader lech walesa and the 
rev henryk jankowski according to a jankowski aide jankowski is a 
walesa adviser 
at the time of hodyszs arrest authorities were trying to stamp 
out any vestige of solidarity the first independent labor movement 
in the east bloc however they have increasingly tolerated the 
movement in recent years and even allowed walesa to speak in an 
uncensored television debate in november

roman catholic leaders announced the 
selection of conservative georg eder as salzburgs new archbishop 
friday but complained of bias in the vaticans list of candidates 
for the post 
in an official statement carried by the catholic news agency 
kathpress the 12member salzburg cathedral chapter said eder 
accepted the bodys appointment thursday it must now be formally 
made by pope john paul ii 
the announcement comes at a time when the catholic church in 
austria is suffering from widening divisions over the appointment of 
conservative bishops and with contentious issues including the 
popes stand on birth control and womens role in the church 
eder is known as a conservative priest who says mass in latin 
with his back to the congregation the second vatican council in the 
1960s called for use of a new mass in the vernacular with the priest 
facing the faithful 
the salzburg chapter said it broke the traditional secrecy 
surrounding such appointments because of advance media criticism of 
the choice of yet another conservative for a top church post eder 
was considered by commentators as the least conservative of three 
candidates put forward for selection by local church leaders 
an estimated 260000 believers have left the church in the past 
eight years according to a critical catholic journal 30917 left 
the church in 1987 alone 
the local church leaders also criticized the vaticans three

a federal judge refused friday to block police from 
arresting homeless people in preorange bowl weekend roundups 
denying an injunction sought by the american civil liberties union 
the aclu accused miami police of harassing the homeless in 
advance of the orange bowl parade on saturday in an effort to make 
the city look clean for tourists and national television audiences 
when someone is sleeping on a piece of cardboard they can be 
arrested for littering said aclu attorney valerie jonas seeking 
a ban on enforcing misdemeanor laws she said were used selectively 
to round up the poor and homeless 
us district judge c clyde atkins ruled on technical grounds 
said assistant city attorney leon firtel who added the decision 
probably did not allow time for an appeal before the weekend 
the police are not restrained from enforcing the law which is 
all that the city asked said firtel who argued against the aclu 
in court the police are going to do their duty and follow the 
law if they have probable cause to arrest someone they will go 
ahead and do that 
brother paul johnson director of the private camillus house 
homeless shelter says at any given time there are 10000 homeless 
people in miami the city offers no public shelters 
were going to have observers out in the streets tonight to 
make sure nothing happens and if these sweeps continue were going 
to observe them said ben waxman another aclu attorney 
waxman said the aclu lost the fight for a preliminary injunction 
but he will continue to press the underlying classaction lawsuit on 
behalf of the homeless 
were still convinced that the misconduct occurred and the 
homeless are being discriminated against he said

israels members of parliament suffer from 
headaches you dont get from guerrilla infiltrators hostile arab 
neighbors or even a palestinian uprising 
no they have some real headaches the kind that make your 
temples throb turn your brain to porridge and transform a 
political speech into medieval torture 
lawmakers blame the endemic headaches on their 22yearold 
parliament building whose poor ventilation and air conditioning 
have earned it the nickname the submarine doctors in turn 
dubbed the lawmakers physical complaints the submarine syndrome 
parliament speaker dov shilansky said friday the problem has a 
great influence on legislators ability to function 
this is not a joke it is a serious problem i know a lot of 
legislators who suffer from headaches and dizziness shilansky 
said on israel army radio 
asked if this was why many of the 120 legislators often look 
sleepy shilansky said its really hard to sit here for the whole 
day if you spend a whole day here you leave with a headache 
the fivestory parliament building on a hilltop in central 
jerusalem was inaugurated in 1966 the two lower floors including 
parts of the main auditorium are partly underground 
the submarine syndrome can do more than give you a pounding 
headache said shilansky a member of the likud bloc 
when i was a new knesset parliament member i met a man who 
told me that he was a knesset worker had a good job and was happy 
with it but he resigned because of poor ventilation he said a 
doctor told him you have a choice between shortening your life or 
resigning he said 
raanan cohen a freshman legislator from the labor party said he 
has begun to suffer frequent headaches since the 12th knesset opened 
nov 21 
normally i dont have headaches and i think theres some 
problem with the building cohen said 
throughout the building its either too hot or too cold said 
maintenance manager shmaryahu eckhaus 
if we heat the first floor where people complain of cold the 
heat spreads to the second and third floors and people there 
feel suffocated by the heat if we turn down the heat people on the 
first floor complain of cold he said 
experts say the solution is to break down the airconditioning 
system into smaller systems with individual controls in different 
parts of the building but army radio said that answer is too 
expensive 
parliament doctors advise legislators to walk outside from time 
to time for a breath of fresh air the radio said 
but legislators cannot always heed that advice during long 
debates that often deteriorate into shouting matches especially 
unbearable to people suffering from headaches

a military court on friday ordered the 
arrest of 20 members of a militarypolice task force implicated in 
the massacre of 14 venezuelan fishermen in october 
there was no armed confrontation but the loss of 14 innocent 
lives said gen angel zambrano who overruled a lower military 
court decision in november that the task force acted in legitimate 
selfdefense 
zambrano presided over a war council the highest regional 
military court in san cristobal about 400 miles southwest of 
caracas 
he ordered the arrest of the 20 venezuelans 16 members of 
special police forces and four members of the armed forces and a 
colombian man believed to be an informant for the brigade 
military spokesmen originally said the 14 men killed were 
colombian guerrillas shot in an oct 29 firefight with government 
forces out to prevent them from blowing up oil installations along 
the colombianvenezuelan border 
but two survivors who jumped into a river and swam for their 
lives denied those shot were guerrillas and said they were all 
fishermen out on a picnic 
a major factor in the militarys reversal was evidence released 
publicly although never made official that an exhumation of the 14 
bodies showed most of the men were shot either in the back or in the 
head at close range 
the case attracted international attention government officials 
received letters from human rights and church groups around the 
world demanding justice 
townspeople of el amparo near the site of the massacre backed 
up the two survivors claims in interviews with journalists 
the two survivors wolmer pinilla and jose arias later sought 
asylum in mexico rather than face the military court for trial on 
charges of military rebellion based on the official version of 
events

opened talks with the plo 
in the haaretz interview shamir reiterated his opposition to an 
international peace conference under un auspices as demanded by 
the plo and most arab nations

the united states and the soviet union but said they should be 
restricted to a ceremonial role to give international legitimacy 
to direct talks

him to an international conference with plo participation shamir 
said i would notify him that i could not come 
lebanons acting prime minister meanwhile instructed his

an influential west german admiral 
wrote in a magazine article that west germany should stop acting as 
washingtons model boy support abolishment of shortrange 
nuclear arms and seek peace with moscow 
in an article written for this weeks edition of stern weekly 
magazine adm elmar schmaeling promoted policies he said would lead 
to withdrawal of foreign troops from west germany and other european 
countries 
about 400000 foreign troops including 250000 from the united 
states are stationed on west german territory a spate of crashes 
of nato warplanes this year has heightened public controversy over 
the troops 
schmaeling serves as chief of the west german armed forces 
office for studies and exercises a think tank 
he has made comments in the past similar to those in the stern 
article 
he wrote in stern that it was time to reexamine the 
foundations of our postwar policies because of changes in the 
soviet bloc 
he argued that the united states believes eventual conflict with 
the soviet union is inevitable in contrast he wrote west germans 
want to overcome confrontation with the warsaw pact 
the goal is an international system of common security in 
europe he wrote 
schmaeling said that for too long we have been playing the role 
of model boy to appear reliable friendly and grateful friends 
of the united states 
the united states owns the shortrange or tactical nuclear 
weapons stationed in west germany the soviet union keeps such 
weapons in east germany and czechoslovakia 
nuclear weapons should be allowed to be stationed only on the 
territory of the country that also has them at their disposal 
schmaeling wrote 
he called for pursuit of disarmament policies that would lead to 
ending the unnatural situation of foreign troops on ones own 
territory 
a speededup process of mutual disarmament and the dismantling 
also of conventional invasion weapons must lead to military 
structures that are purely defensive in all countries 
when this is mutually done military alliances with 
integrated forces can be dissolved he wrote 
defense minister rupert scholz and other west german officials 
say foreign troops and shortrange nuclear weapons are needed here 
to offset what they view as a soviet threat

canadas senate on friday approved a sweeping 
agreement that virtually erases trade barriers between canada and 
the united states the free trade agreement goes into effect on new 
years day 
furious debate over the pact forced prime minister brian mulroney 
to call new elections on nov 21 but the contest gave mulroneys 
progressive conservative party its second straight majority 
government and a clear mandate to push for passage of the 
legislation 
the senate vote in ottawa was by voice and not tabulated 
senators from the opposition liberal party which fought the 
agreement fiercely during the fall campaign but promised to let it 
pass if mulroney won abstained 
later friday supreme court justice antonio lamer acting for 
governor general jeanne sauve gave the bill its final approval 
such approval by britains representative in canada is a vestige of 
colonial times 
mulroney issued a new years statement friday celebrating 
canadians historic opportunity to affirm their confidence in our 
countrys future 
he used similar language in his pitch for the freetrade 
agreement in the campaign for november elections 
the pact was approved by the house of commons during a volatile 
session on dec 24 the conservatives used their majority to muscle 
the bill through 141111 while irate opposition lawmakers sang the 
national anthem in protest 
the liberals control the nonelected senate and had tied up the 
legislation there last fall forcing mulroney to call the election 
they promised however not to repeat their action if he won a 
majority government 
even so they pledged to monitor the trade agreement closely as 
its effects begin to be felt in coming years 
even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become 
law our concerns have not disappeared allan maceachen the 
liberals leader in the senate said during the debate the 
government has chosen the hard discipline of the market we will 
have to monitor whether the market does its job 
the liberals hold 59 of the 98 senate seats allowing them to set 
up a monitoring committee as trade negotiations under the agreement 
with the united states get under way 
the pact was signed jan 2 1988 by president reagan and 
mulroney sparking a year of soulsearching by canadians 
many believed the trade pact represented a final subjugation of 
the canadian identity by its rich southern neighbor but supporters 
especially big business heralded the agreement as a potential 
economic boon that would open up us markets and eliminate 2 
billion annually in us tariffs 
the two nations with 150 billion in annual trade already form 
the worlds biggest twonation trading partnership but the trade 
agreement now phases out all remaining tariffs quotas and duties 
between them 
it also dismantles many investment barriers frees up trade in 
energy and services and creates uscanadian panels to settle 
disputes 
the actual start of the agreement will be low key with an 
exchange of diplomatic notes 
special interests on both sides of the border mainly union and 
farm groups criicized various elements of the legislation because 
it would eliminate protectionist rules for specific industries 
ontario grape growers for example were upset because the pact 
would eliminate an automatic 65 percent markup on usmade wine

the pilgrim nuclear reactor began 
lowpower testing friday after receiving final federal clearance 
nearly three years after being shut down and labeled one of the 
countrys worstrun power plants 
boston edison co the owner said the restart began about 6 pm 
with the withdrawal of control rods in the reactor 
opposition to pilgrims restart has been intense with state 
officials pledging to do everything they can to keep the plant from 
operating and protesters planning to demonstrate at the plant gates 
saturday 
the nuclear regulatory commission cleared the way friday for 
lowpower testing of the 670megawatt reactor for up to 5 percent of 
its capacity 
the restart began a test program intended to take the plant 
gradually to full power in about four months said ralph bird 
boston edison senior vice president for nuclear power 
bird said the utility would continue to work with state and local 
officials to complete and improve an emergency evacuation plan for 
towns around the plant state officials have called the plan 
inadequate despite revisions and they also say the plant should not 
reopen until a study of leukemia rates in the population surrounding 
the plant is complete 
we will do whatever we possibly can legally through the 
attorney general to ensure that the plant doesnt operate said 
martie barnes a spokeswoman for gov michael s dukakis we still 
believe the plant is not ready for restart 
at the time pilgrim was shut in april 1986 the nrc called the 
plant one of the worstrun nuclear plants in the country 
boston edison has spent about 200 million since the shutdown to 
replace nearly all of the plants top management work on mechanical 
problems and fight skepticism by the nrc and a growing antinuclear 
movement among nearby residents 
if the plants restart schedule is followed consumers can 
receive power from pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating 
capacity sometime next month 
by the end of january the plant should be at about 25 percent of 
power producing 100 megawatts daily or enough electricity to power 
160000 homes boston edison spokeswoman elaine robinson said 
massachusetts citizens for safe energy an antinuclear group 
friday called the reopening a slap in the face to local and state 
government officials and a direct threat to thousands of people 
living near the pilgrim nuclear plant 
there are increasing signs that pilgrim has caused leukemia in 
nearby residents the group said in a statement 
boston edison officials said there is no evidence that radiation 
from the plant has caused any cancer deaths 
citizens for safe energy also said the plant should not be 
brought to full power because pilgrims history of management and 
safety failures has continued despite nrc and edison claims to the 
contrary 
said robinson were confident that were proceeding in a very 
safe and responsible manner and we wouldnt procede if we didnt 
think it was safe its important to realize how many of us live 
right here with our families 
in october 1987 dukakis and attorney general james shannon 
citing evacuation and safety concerns asked the nrc to revoke 
pilgrims operating license 
that request was formally denied thursday in a letter from thomas 
e murley director of the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation 
in a letter dated friday nrc regional administrator william t 
russell gave permission for the plant to operate saying the 
technical issues raised in the shutdown had been resolved 
the pilgrim plant must undergo another review by the nrc before 
it is granted permission to operate at full power a process that 
could take months

a fiery chainreaction crash that 
killed four people and injured 10 others took place at the same 
intersection where two fatal accidents occurred five years ago 
a truck driven by richard hall 37 of warrenville sc plowed 
into a line of cars thursday night at a stoplight at the 
intersection of the edens expressway also called us 41 and 
clavey road about 25 miles north of chicago causing the crash and 
a series of explosions authorities said 
apparently the truck driver had been driving too many 
hours and fell asleep said master sgt jerry bresnahan of the 
illinois state police i guess when youre on an interstate like 
that you dont expect to come to a stoplight 
just after the light turned green halls truck smashed into a 
car killing the two men and two women inside bresnahan said the 
car hit by the truck then smashed into others a chain reaction that 
involved seven cars in two lanes he said 
the identities of the four dead were not released friday 
afternoon hall was in good condition at highland park hospital 
suffering from abdominal pain said hospital spokesman charles block 
block said another crash victim marvin whittaker 44 of zion 
ill was in fair condition with a rib fracture eight other people 
were treated at the hospital and released block said 
no charges had been filed in the case bresnahan said 
state department of transportation figures show that at least 509 
accidents have occurred at the intersection since 1976 in 1983 two 
fatal accidents that left four people dead spurred lawmakers to 
press for the construction of an overpass 
i think it can be characterized as the most dangerous 
intersection in illinois said daniel pierce mayor of this 
suburban town 
the mayor added i dont know how many deaths we have to have 
there before the state thinks its a dangerous intersection 
charles mclean an operations engineer for the state 
transportation department said the 45 accidents at the intersection 
in 1987 ranked it sixth in lake county and 25th in the chicago 
metropolitan area 
in terms of the number of accidents the intersection doesnt 
rank high its just the type of accident he said 
he said the department had been planning the 85 million 
overpass since 1983 and that construction should begin next fall 
and be completed in late 1990 
but the lengthy process was costly pierce said 
finally its going through but not in time to save the lives 
of those people he said

presidentelect bush departed friday for a long 
holiday weekend at camp david md after receiving a court subpoena 
that could force him to disclose information on the irancontra 
affair that he previously has refused to divulge 
bush was subpoenaed along with president reagan as a defense 
witness in the upcoming irancontra conspiracy trial of former white 
house aide oliver north 
the trial is to begin jan 31 which is 11 days after bush 
becomes president 
he has repeatedly refused to say what he discussed with reagan 
regarding matters involved in the irancontra affair other than 
that he had reservations about us sales of arms to iran 
bushs legal counsel boyden gray informed the presidentelect 
friday morning that the subpoena would be forthcoming said press 
secretary sheila tate she added it was not unanticipated 
she had no reaction from bush but said he planned no meetings on 
the subject while on a threeday vacation at the presidential 
retreat in the maryland countryside with his wife barbara 
as bush left washington he also left unfilled the two 
cabinetlevel posts he has not yet named energy secretary and drug 
czar 
tate declined to indicate directly whether bush would fight the 
subpoena but noted constitutional and legal questions were being 
examined by white house and justice department lawyers along with 
gray 
what theyre saying is that its unprecedented to do that 
she said in reference to potential bush testimony 
north is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired 
air force maj gen richard secord to illegally divert more than 12 
million in usiran armssales profits to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
the bushes planned to relax in seclusion until late monday and 
were expecting to be joined by no friends or aides said spokeswoman 
kristin taylor 
no announcements were expected before tuesday on bushs choices 
for energy secretary and the new cabinetrank post of drug czar 
said david prosperi spokesman for the bush transition team 
while speculation continued to swirl around former energy 
secretary james r schlesinger as a potential pick for that post 
the presidentelect spent friday meeting with his designee for 
united nations ambassador thomas pickering and with cia director 
william webster 
pickering currently the ambassador to israel briefed bush on 
usisraeli relations and they discussed the current middle east 
peace process said taylor 
substance of his private meeting and luncheon with webster was 
not disclosed 
while several names have been mentioned as possible choices for 
energy secretary those of schlesinger and former rep henson moore 
rla were said by transition sources to be the leading contenders 
at weeks end 
air force lt gen james abrahamson head of the pentagons 
strategic defense initiative program who had been mentioned earlier 
as a contender for the energy job has told friends he would not be 
selected 
for the cabinetlevel post of drug czar created last year by 
congressional legislation the name of customs commissioner william 
von raab has been mentioned in several reports however von raabs 
aide steve dougherty said friday that the commissioner has 
received no query from nor had any official contact with the bush 
transition team 
meanwhile the bush transition office is expected to announce a 
flurry of white house staff positions including bush campaign 
operative jim wray as political director 
many names have surfaced as candidates for energy secretary and 
sources said the decision is being held up in part by strong 
lobbying within the transition office for one or another candidate 
bush has said he wants someone with capabilities to deal with the 
pressing problem of nuclear waste disposal and other nuclear safety 
questions 
transition sources said schlesinger who served as the first 
energy secretary when president jimmy carter appointed him and 
earlier as secretary of defense under presidents ford and nixon was 
getting serious attention 
schlesingers washington office said friday he would have no 
comment on the matter 
moores office also refused comment but a source in the office 
of one of his key boosters sen alan simpson rwyo said moore 
has remained one of the top two contenders for he post 
the independentminded schlesinger would be a controversial 
choice given opposition to him by industry leaders and his 
affiliation with the troubleplagued energy policies of the carter 
presidency 
he was energy secretary when gasoline lines reappeared in the 
summer of 1979 and resigned thereafter 
he helped shape policy against which ronald reagan and bush 
campaigned in 1980 and large parts of which they dismantled a 
massive government effort to develop unconventional sources of 
energy a socalled windfall profits tax on crude oil help for the 
poor faced with higher fuel bills and continued price controls on 
natural gas bush in his campaign urged complete decontrol of 
natural gas 
moore who represented a chemicals and refiningintensive 
district around baton rouge is a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for 
the senate in 1986 he is backed my many in the oil industry which 
lost 150000 jobs in the price collapse of recent years 
also frequently mentioned for the energy post is environmental 
protection agency administrator lee thomas who revived the nearly 
abortive superfund toxic waste cleanup program in 1983 and 
presided over a quintupling of the program 
meanwhile transition officials have told dennis r patrick 
chairman of the federal communications commission that bush is 
fully satisfied with his performance and has no intention of 
replacing him fcc spokesman john kamp said friday 
many had expected bush to replace patrick at the helm of the fcc 
in order to improve relations with congress patricks deregulatory 
approach to the telecommunications and broadcasting industries has 
made few friends among democrats on capitol hill

a gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty 
salon and released all but one during a 24hour siege was shot and 
killed by a police sniper friday after threatening to detonate a 
bomb in a suitcase 
michael fane 21 of iowa city iowa was shot by a swat team 
sniper about 245 pm friday at the beauty salon and all of the 
hostages were safe police chief robert wadman said 
a bomb squad was called in to deal with the suitcase 
it did not explode when they attempted to detonate capt 
michael london said all indications that they had at the time was 
that it had the makings of a bomb i cant tell you whether there 
was an explosive device in there or not 
police said they had believed fane had a 9mm pistol but found he 
had a 9mm lookalike pellet gun police said fane probably could not 
have killed anyone with it 
we believe mr fane was suffering from severe mental problems 
and was under psychiatric care wadman said 
early in the standoff police said the hostagetaking occurred as 
the result of a botched holdup but later said they didnt know why 
the camouflagejacketed fane entered the possibilities salon about 3 
pm thursday 
police sealed off the neighborhood and the gunman released four 
people including a young boy police said after negotiating 
through the night he freed three women friday his final hostage a 
woman was freed apparently unharmed after he was shot 
police would not release the names of the hostages but relatives 
and friends said three of the final four were debbie mcqueen 28 
and shop employees darla lordemann and sharon kuhlmann 18 
london said fane was shot while trying to pick up a package he 
had demanded from police that was placed by the door 
at a news conference london said police decided to shoot fane if 
it became possible because they believed he had a suitcase bomb with 
a pressure point that would detonate if he touched it 
about 6 this morning negotiations deteriorated seriously 
because they found out at that time there was a great likeliehood 
there was a bomb or the makings of a bomb or a bomb apparatus in a 
suitcase london said 
police evacuated bystanders west of the former bank building and 
moved reporters and photographers a distance away because of fears 
they could be hurt if a bomb was detonated 
fane a 1985 graduate of mason city iowa high school attended 
the university of iowa in iowa city for two years his father dr 
larry fane of el compo texas told the mason city iowa 
globegazette that his son recently received psychiatric treatment 
dean chandler fanes grandfather said of fane hes always 
been very passive and mild around us this is the biggest surprise 
of my life and thats all im going to say 
the gunman negotiated undisclosed demands with police capt 
william crawford said during a friday news conference he would not 
say what the demands were but he did say the gunman had not asked 
for money 
sgt william muldoon said police knew quite a bit about the 
gunman but would not elaborate he had said the man had remained 
calm during negotiations 
he is talking so thats always a good sign muldoon said 
hes not doing anything directly at this time to harm the people 
if he starts harming people we will have to reevaluate the 
situation 
a minister and family members of the hostages were assisting 
police in negotiations more than 40 family members gathered at a 
nearby house thursday night and were taken to a salvation army 
center to meet with police chaplains and other clergy

investigators have told scottish police that the 
bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 was put aboard in frankfurt 
west germany the times of london reported saturday 
the report said investigators are certain that luggage loaded on 
flight 103 in frankfurt and flown to londons heathrow airport was 
transferred on arrival at heathrow to the forward cargo hold of the 
doomed boeing 747 
it said scientists have established that the bomb exploded in 
that hold causing the jumbo jet to disintegrate 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt changed planes at heathrow 
and continued to new york 
the jet crashed in the scottish village of lockerbie on dec 21 
less than an hour after taking off from heathrow killing all 259 
people aboard and 11 on the ground 
the account said the hunt for those responsible is now centered 
in frankfurt where a palestinian terrorist cell is known to have 
been operating for more than 18 months 
it said the cell is known to be part of ahmed jibrils hardline 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command and to 
have carried out two bombing attacks on us military trains that 
serve frankfurt 
the paper did not identify by name the source of its information 
it said scottish police officers who flew to frankfurt on friday 
would be shown evidence of the terrorist units existence and are 
expected to be given access to a palestinian man arrested by west 
german security forces two months ago 
it did not identify the man but said he is suspected of being a 
senior figure in jibrils organization 
the paper noted that the jibril group in a statement in damascus 
friday denied any connection with the crash but it said the denial 
was regarded skeptically by terrorism experts who believed the 
group was trying to avoid possible us military retaliation 
an anonymous male caller claiming to represent a group called the 
guardians of the islamic revolution telephoned american news 
agencies in london friday to repeat a claim of responsibility and 
threaten further attacks 
the blueandwhite nose cone of flight 103 was removed from the 
scottish countryside friday so investigators can examine the 
symbol of this disaster for clues to the bomb 
the search for wreckage expanded from lockerbie and surrounding 
countryside into the waters of the solway firth said deputy chief 
constable paul newell of the regional police force 
he said the coast guard was acting on an eyewitness report that 
something fell into the inlet about 20 miles from lockerbie 
the airplanes nose cone and cockpit with its name clipper 
maid of the seas still visible had lain in a field beside a 
church for eight days a silent reminder of the tragedy 
the picture of this nose cone has been seen throughout the 
world said police chief superintendent angus kennedy it has 
become a symbol of this disaster 
on friday helicopters and trucks hauled the cutup wreckage to 
the royal aerospace establishment 300 miles south at farnborough 
southwest of london 
investigators from the department of transports air accidents 
investigation branch will examine it for clues about the bomb 
police roped off an area near the wreckage where relatives of 
crash victims can place flowers 
the times reported friday that investigators believe the bombs 
first trigger was a barometric device set to go off under a change 
of altitude this would activate the second trigger an electronic 
timer to make the bomb explode at a later time it said 
terrorists developed the double detonator technique after some 
airports started putting cargo through pressure chambers which can 
detonate pressureactivated bombs the times said 
the investigators have yet to establish whether a suitcase 
containing the bomb passed through frankfurts pressure chamber 
setting off the timing device or whether the timer was activated in 
flight the newspaper said 
the caller claiming to speak for the guardians of the islamic 
revolution said friday that unless the united states deports reza 
pahlavi son of the late shah of iran there will be another 
present in the new year for america 
the day after the crash an anonymous caller claimed it was 
retaliation by the guardians of the islamic revolution for downing 
of an iran air airliner by the us navy cruiser vincennes in the 
persian gulf in july 
the group previously claimed responsibility for a july 1987 
bombing in london that wounded amir hussein amirparviz chairman of 
the national movement for iranian resistance and a cabinet minister 
under the shah 
presidentelect george bush vowed to seek hard and punish 
firmly decisively those who did this if you can ever find them 
police chief superintendent john orr who is leading the 
investigation in conjunction with scotland yards antiterrorist 
squad and the fbi said that besides the officers sent to frankfurt 
others may be sent to other parts of the world 
american airlines using four british airports were implementing 
tighter security procedures on orders from the british government 
including tougher baggage inspections

part of an artillery shell containing 
conventional explosives and depleted uranium was accidentally 
shipped to the sandia national laboratories a newspaper reported 
friday 
the test shell sat at the lab for four days in august 1987 before 
it was discovered said the san jose mercury news 
depleted uranium is incapable of causing a nuclear explosion and 
only slightly radioactive but it is poisonous when inhaled 
officials at sandias main facility in albuquerque nm said 
the risk of a conventional explosion was very low 
it didnt pose any danger said nigel hey a sandia spokesman 
in albuquerque on friday the thing is we just didnt follow the 
rules 
the shell was shipped to the lab as unclassified freight from the 
tonopah test range in nevada where a clerk mixed it up with another 
shipment the shell was to have remained there for a future 
shipment where it would have been properly labeled 
the wooden crate carrying the device should have been marked as 
classified package containing explosive and radioactive material 
hey said it was supposed to be shipped to a secret weapons testing 
site at the lawrence livermore national laboratory 
instead it was flown to the alameda naval air station by a 
government contractor and carried to the sandia lab by a department 
of energy truck as a routine delivery the shell was placed under 
armed guard after its discovery 
it caused a lot of concern and it was taken as an example of 
how things can go wrong hey said test range officials have since 
revised shipping rules

the contra rebels on friday proposed a new round of 
peace talks with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government to be 
held in washington under the auspices of the organization of 
american states 
we believe that this could break the impasse contra director 
roberto ferrey said at the contra headquarters in miami we are 
accepting one of their proposals 
talks between the usbacked rebels have been stalled since june 
when negotiations broke up in managua and the contras refused to 
return to the country saying they were being harassed 
since then both sides have accused each other of violating the 
shaky truce and a cutoff of us military aid has sent many contra 
troops across the border into refugee camps in honduras 
the sandinistas have expressed willingness to meet in washington 
or managua on previous occasions said ferrey he said the oas would 
be a natural forum for the peace talks 
the nicaraguan resistance as the contras are formally known 
sent a telecopy of their proposal to the sandinista foreign ministry 
in managua early friday ferrey said but have not yet received a 
response 
the resistance proposes that the point of departure of this 
round be the same proposals presented in june ferrey said the 
democratization of nicaragua followed by troops surrendering of 
arms 
but he said the contras were flexible and would be willing to 
change that agenda

colombia for the first time friday 
suspended payment on its 165billion foreign debt for three 
months when the government is to obtain a new loan to meet the 
payments 
treasury minister luis fernando alarcon who announced the 
decision said the countrys creditors agreed to the suspension 
colombia was the only latin american country up to now that had 
not restructured its debt or suspended its payments 
the minister said colombia will receive in april an international 
loan of 17 billion that will ensure it will have the funds needed 
to pay interest and principal on the foreign debt until 1990 
the 90day moratorium means colombia will not pay 300 million 
which can be used for economic development programs he told a news 
conference 
the 300 million will be paid after colombia receives the 
additional loan he said 
colombia had asked for a 185 billion loan in negotiations with 
international bankers to pay its foreign debt 
political leaders and economic analysts had recommended that 
president virgilio barcos government renegotiate the foreign debt 
under more favorable terms in recent years 40 percent of 
colombias income from exports has been spent to service the debt 
congress last week approved a law making it easier for the 
government to renegotiate the debt with its creditors saying it was 
impossible to continue paying the debt under the current schedule

astronauts he had just been commissioned to do a major park for the 
city of sapporo japan 
noguchi lived in new york but spent much time in japan including 
his formative years and he employed numerous artisans at a large 
workshop in takamatsu on the japanese island of shikoku 
the son of a japanese poet and an american writer he was born in 
los angeles on nov 17 1904 but two years later his family took 
him to tokyo he returned alone to the united states in 1918 and 
went to school in indiana 
noguchi entered columbia university as a premedical student in 
1922 but dropped out in favor of sculpture studies at the leonardo 
da vinci art school now defunct 
he moved to paris in 1928 and became a studio assistant for 
constantin brancusi for six months during that time his earliest 
works were made noguchi returned to new york in 1929 and had his 
first oneman show at the eugene schoen gallery 
he survived on the sales of a few bronze head portraits and on 
grants including a guggenheim fellowship in 1927 which enabled him 
to travel to japan and china where he studied drawing inkbrush 
painting and pottery 
one of his first competitive successes was a 1938 commission for 
the 10ton stainlesssteel relief above the entrance to the 
associated press building at rockefeller center the piece one of 
his few representational pieces depicts five journalists at work 
his sculptures were often smoothsurfaced vaguely biological 
forms that remind some scholars of the surrealistic paintings of 
joan miro and of primitive japanese haniwa figures in later 
years his work became more geometric while retaining organic 
imagery 
the naturalistic style was once described in the new york times 
as a restrained vocabulary of organic forms ranging from playful 
biomorphs and abstract figures to subtle mounds polished rings and 
massive boulders 
he said he was fascinated by abandoned stones that allow me 
to enter into their lifes purpose 
his works are found outside the united states at tokyos museum

apartment he was married briefly to the japanese actress yoshiko 
yamaguchi but they were separated by immigration difficulties and 
later divorced they had no children he is survived by a sister 
ailes spinden of santa fe nm 
there will be a memorial service at the noguchi garden museum

president reagan and presidentelect bush were 
subpoenaed friday as defense witnesses in the trial of retired 
marine lt col oliver north in the irancontra affair 
we did receive it justice department spokesman loye miller 
said theres one for the president and one for the vice 
president we received it at midafternoon the subpoenas were 
received by robert ross the executive assistant to attorney general 
dick thornburgh miller said 
a statement released by the white house press office in palm 
springs calif where reagan is on vacation said the justice 
department has received a subpoena seeking the presidents testimony 
at the criminal trial of oliver north the subpoena also seeks the 
discovery of certain personal records of the president the subpoena 
was not an unanticipated development 
it raises significant legal and constitutional questions which 
are currently being reviewed by the department of justice and 
counsel to the president the statement said it would be 
unprecedented for a president to appear as a witness at a criminal 
trial and its premature to speculate on the final decision that 
will ultimately be taken but historical precedent suggests any 
relevant information could be provided through written questions and 
answers 
the washington post reported in saturday editions that 
unidentified white house and justice department officials said they 
will fight the subpoenas 
the newspaper also cited an unidentified white house official as 
saying reagan viewed the subpoena effort as an attempt to pressure 
him into granting a pardon to north before he leaves office the 
official said reagan had not changed his view that the legal process 
should run its course 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman said reagan had known 
since wednesday that it was likely he would be subpoenaed white 
house chief of staff kenneth duberstein told reagan on friday 
morning that the subpoena would be delivered during the afternoon 
popadiuk said 
bush aides confirmed that the presidentelect had received a 
subpoena friday 
bush press secretary sheila tate said bush legal counsel boyden 
gray informed the vice president friday morning that the subpoena 
would be delivered that afternoon and she did not know bushs 
reaction 
she said he was going ahead with his weekend of relaxation at 
camp david md and planned no meetings to discuss the trial 
matter gray she said did have conferences on the matter friday 
but she said she could give no further details 
the receipt of this is not an unanticipated development but it 
is unprecedented said bush press aide kristin taylor 
bush will take office jan 20 and thus will be president when the 
north trial begins jan 31 
north a former white house aide is facing conspiracy and theft 
charges in the irancontra affair 
he is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired 
air force maj gen richard secord to illegally divert more than 12 
million in usiran armssales profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
national security concerns have placed in jeopardy norths trial 
on the major conspiracy and theft charges which involve extensive 
use of classified material 
norths attorney brendan sullivan appearing on abc news did 
not go into any detail on why reagan and bush were subpoenaed 
what i do say is this as you know a defense lawyer has an 
obligation to issue a subpoena for every person who has relevant 
information about a matter in court sullivan said the 
president himself has indicated he has relevant information 
attorneys for the vice president the white house and the justice 
department were looking into the constitutional legal issues 
raised by the subpoenas taylor said 
in 1973 president nixon received a subpoena to turn over white 
house tape recordings of conversations with top aides in connection 
with the watergate scandal although nixon was not required to 
testify the supreme court ruled that nixon had to release the tapes 
tate said she could not say whether bushs attorneys would fight 
the subpoena 
what theyre saying is that its unprecedented to do that 
she said in reference to potential bush testimony 
the issue of how much he knew about norths activities with the 
contras and the diversion of funds from iran was the subject of 
contradictory testimony during congressional hearings into the 
irancontra matter 
the subpoena could force bush to disclose information that he 
previously has refused to divulge 
bush repeatedly has refused to say what he discussed with reagan 
regarding matters involved in the irancontra affair other than 
that he had reservations about us sales of arms to iran 
the congressional irancontra investigating committees concluded 
last year that there was no evidence bush knew of the diversion plan 
bush also said he did not know of norths secret operation to 
supply the contras during the congressional ban on aid although his 
national security adviser donald gregg was well informed on the 
matter and bush met three times with felix rodriguez one of the 
key figures helping north in the operation 
questions also were raised about bushs statement that he did not 
know of the armsforhostages nature of the dealings with iran until 
late 1986 when his chief of staff indicated that israeli operative 
amiram nir briefed bush on this aspect in may of 1986 
bush has said he was told about the israeli side of the 
operation not the american activity in the same vein

hedrick smiths the power game comes to life 
beginning tonight in a fourpart series that is a kind of video 
cliff notes for the 725page bestseller about the machinations of 
official washington 
pegged to run just before the inauguration of george bush the 
pbs series is also something of a scorecard for interested viewers 
who want to keep track of the players as the new game begins 
produced by philip burton with david saltman and pam hogan the 
series of onehour programs is fastpaced and entertaining it 
boasts interviews with an impressive array of current and former 
officials including presidentelect bush but avoids too many 
talkinghead interviews by blending in news footage and flashy 
graphics 
smith a pulitzer prizewining print reporter and author the 
russians is a pleasant host and experienced interviewer 
the series hones the book down into four topics the 
congress the pentagon the unelected and the 
presidency the installments run in that order monday through 
thursday 
with bush coming in the final two segments the unelected 
about the power of staff and the news media and the presidency 
are especially interesting 
in the presidency smith outlines the three things he says a 
successful president must immediately do 
set a simple agenda jimmy carter he says cluttered his 
agenda confusing his wouldbe supporters on capitol hill 
form coalitions carter and john f kennedy were good 
imagemakers who had problems working with congress smith says 
carter had the added problem of a postwatergate and postvietnam 
congress filled with mavericks unbeholden to the leadership 
create an image reagans team masterfully managed the media 
smith got a late interview with bush for inclusion in the the 
presidency a transcript was provided to television critics if 
bush has read smiths book he doesnt seem to buy its theories 
it seems to me listening to you i hear a few echoes of jimmy 
carter says smith that may sound strange to you i dont mean 
in terms 
bush interrupts that sounds very strange 
smith continues what i mean is that when jimmy carter came in 
he wanted to do something about the environment he wanted to do 
something about education he wanted to do something about the 
deficit and on and on and one of the problems he had was focusing 
the congress he confused the congress and he confused the country 
please dont suggest to me that if i dont say that if i 
throw in the question of trying to do something better on fighting 
narcotics that that means im not interested in the deficit the one 
major you know economic problem facing us bush argued but i 
think to be so unipurpose that you say youre gonna do nothing else 
until the deficit is solved is myopic 
the main theme in the four programs is the phenomenon of 
floating power from the presidency to congress the news media 
and staff members from congress to its staff on capitol hill from 
the news media back to the president 
smith shows how reagans own national security council staff 
pursued the strategic defense initiative or socalled star 
wars without informing highlevel advisers some of whom talk of 
learning about the proposed massive shift in defense policy only 
days or hours before reagan announced it to the nation in a 1983 
speech 
a powerful media set the agendas for watergate and later the iran 
hostage crisis 
but reagan advance man william henkel describes an amazing feat 
of media management when he describes scheduling reagans stopoff in 
brussels to brief nato on his summit meeting with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev just so reagans helicopter would arrive on 
capitol hill later that night at the top of the evening newscasts 
smith told a news conference at pbs that he was delighted by the 
documentary experience and hopes to get the money to produce an 
examination of the first 100 days of the bush administration to 
take the power game analysis forward and apply it to this new 
administration 
even though you get a good audience with 100000 copies of the 
hardback and several hundred thousand with the paperback to be able 
to reach several million people at once with a concentrated dose in 
terms of this kind of material im just enough of an idealist and 
fresh enough to the game to want to throw a lot more into it 
smith said

two riveting mysteries unfold in thursday 
nights cbs movie the man in the brown suit 
who killed the sultry chanteuse and how many more ensembles can 
stephanie zimbalist produce from her tiny carryon bag 
advertised as an intriguing mysterydrama the movie is 
intriguing in only one regard can dramatic improbability really go 
any further 
why zimbalist playing a flaky tourist stuck in egypt wants to 
stalk a murderer is never explained how a car moving at about 8 mph 
can kill somebody is equally perplexing 
the only thing that makes perfect sense is why edward woodward 
rue mcclanahan ken howard tony randall and zimbalist all agreed to 
star in this clunker a neat chance to visit spain for free 
based more or less on a 1924 agatha christie novel the man 
in the brown suit focuses on a couple of murders or maybe one 
was an accident some missing diamonds a handsome stranger in a 
brown suit several suspects a kidnapping an ezescape jail cell 
a halfdozen lurkingintheshadows bad guys and a whole bunch of 
romantic european film locations 
zimbalist stars as anne beddingfeld a cameratoting traveler 
lost in the cairo airport with hardly any luggage and nothing much 
to do except whimper before you can say plot device a man at 
the airport who smells like musk no kidding is hit by that 
deadly slowmoving car and were on our merry way 
on the dead mans body is a piece of paper that surprise 
might be a clue after the handsome stranger the one in the brown 
suit drops the note he has stolen from the corpse beddingfeld 
scoops it up i dont want to leave now she says the 
adventure hasnt started yet 
using sleuthing skills that would make nancy drew relax in her 
retirement beddingfeld books a cabin on a small cruise ship and 
sets to work on board lucky for her are all of the key players in 
the unsolved chanteuse murder and a related diamond theft below 
decks somewhere must also be a bloomingdales as beddingfeld never 
seems to run out of fresh outfits 
suspects include the man in the brown suit simon dutton 
dashing english businessman sir eustace pedler woodward his 
assistant underhill nickolas grace oftmarried socialite suzy 
blair mcclanahan and a creepy priest randall 
special acting points should be given to randall and woodward for 
working up new dialects especially for this project randall sounds 
like quasimodo on a caffeine overdose and woodward manages a 
brilliant john cleese impersonation ken howard takes the smarter 
route spending most of the movie hiding behind dark sunglasses if 
he could have seen the finished movie he probably would have worn a 
hat and fake moustache too 
the creaky script by carla jean wagner runs low on action and 
overflows with talk when beddingfeld jots down a list of suspects 
she has to announce each persons motive the films director alan 
grint couldnt impart such basic information with his camera 
beddingfeld and blair eventually join forces oh lord says 
blair this is so exciting i feel just like one of charlies 
angels 
the closer beddingfeld moves to solving the mystery such as it 
is the more endangered her life becomes after beddingfeld is 
almost pushed overboard into the sea she survives a plunge into a 
waterfall 
tough private detective that she is the watery neardeaths only 
strengthen her determination 
does she solve the crime does anybody care 
the rewards of the man in the brown suit do not rest with the 
delivery of justice instead the fascination is found in the 
preposterous depths to which this story slinks allstar camp after 
all is allstar camp

economists will tell you they make their 
prognostications on the basis of the data not gut feelings 
about the economy 
but some attending last weeks conference here of the american 
economic association were bold enough to venture guesses on the fate 
of the economy without their usual battery of numbers at hand 
yes there were scores of seminars during the conference on such 
esoteric topics as empirical analysis of price determinants and 
we wonder why johnny cant understand simple rules of economics 
but there was also a fair amount of cocktail and luncheon chatter 
about what economists might call exogenous or outside 
factors affecting the ebb and flow of the economy principal among 
them politics george bushs politics to be more precise 
theories about how the presidentelect will manage the economy 
span the usual spectrum as you might expect yet a predominantly 
hopeful theory is emerging in some quarters based on bushs 
transition performance 
while some pundits have criticized his recently announced cabinet 
selections as bland others are impressed by the mix of key 
holdovers from the reagan administration and new choices aimed at 
mending fences with old opponents 
so far these optimists say bush has done several things right 
when the markets reacted negatively in the days following his 
election he moved swiftly to name his economic team long 
before settling on advisers for defense and other areas 
among his earliest choices was nicholas brady to remain as 
treasury secretary a pick that was applauded by those who admired 
bradys work as head of the reagan committee investigating the 
october 1987 stock market crash having james a baker iii a former 
treasury secretary and an architect of past accords to stabilize the 
dollar in world markets as secretary of state also was seen as a 
plus by some economic experts 
later additions that have drawn praise are michael boskin of 
stanford university to chief economic adviser clayton yeutter to 
agriculture secretary robert mosbacher to commerce secretary and 
elizabeth dole to head the labor department 
the dole move was viewed as especially significant since it not 
only installed an experienced hand at the wheel of labor but also 
helped smooth the ruffled feathers of the secretarydesignates 
husband senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
other rough spots in the road that bush quickly patched were in 
massachusetts he initiated a meeting with his defeated challenger 
michael dukakis and also offered to make exhouse speaker tip 
oneill of massachusetts the next ambassador to ireland neither of 
the highprofile democrats will end up serving the new 
administration but bushs thoughtful gestures werent lost on the 
loyal opposition 
the optimists say bushs style may help him make strides on 
capitol hill where democratic cooperation will be crucial to 
keeping his pledge of no new taxes 
one economist at last weeks conference james smith of the 
university of north carolina said he predicts a great rose garden 
compromise along about april that will put a twoyear federal 
budget in place restrain the deficit and maybe even avoid new taxes 
that certainly would provide the socalled soft landing the 
economy needs to avert recession in 1989 
nonbelievers would say such finetuning went out a long time 
ago about the time paul volcker used skyhigh interest rates to 
squelch inflation still the prospect of striking a delicate 
balance in economic policy between bust and boom is intriguing 
particularly now a few weeks before the inauguration when hope 
springs eternal

where most people list their job 
experiences operation rescue founder randall terrys resume brags 
arrested 26 times in seven cities 
terry complains its outofdate 
it might be closer to 30 right now the 29yearold activist 
said during an interview at the unmarked storefront office in 
upstate new york where the latest protests against abortion are 
being planned 
since its national debut at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta last summer operation rescue has made abortion a 
highprofile issue again 
terry and his followers have blocked women from entering abortion 
clinics throughout the country lying in front of doors until police 
carry or drag them away under the watchful eye of television cameras 
terry says he is trying to produce the social tension 
necessary to change abortion laws by using the nonviolent 1960s 
civil rights protest as a model 
hes the martin luther king of a movement said dominick 
brignola an albany lawyer and footsoldier in the antiabortion 
drive 
terrys critics claim operation rescue so named because 
followers try to rescue the unborn is an assault on womens 
rights 
the civil rights movement was trying to gain rights for people 
theyre trying to take away the rights of living breathing human 
beings said molly yard president of the national organization 
for women 
more than 450 antiabortion demonstrators clogged atlanta jails 
during the fiveday democratic convention since then 
demonstrations have spread to new york city indianapolis 
milwaukee detroit philadelphia and boston and still more cities 
the activists want the supreme court to overturn roe vs wade 
its 1973 decision that allows women to have abortions an estimated 
16 million women have abortions each year in the united states 
standing at the forefront of operation rescue is a used car 
salesman who once wanted to be a rock star 
terry and his wife cindy began their crusade in 1984 by 
standing in front of abortion clinics trying to talk women out of 
entering friends soon joined them and the couple opened an office 
that offered women free pregnancy tests and handmedown baby 
clothes 
god clicked a light on in my head and said it wasnt enough to 
just be against childkilling that i had to do something about 
it said terry whos selling his auto dealership because he is 
too busy with operation rescue 
critics concede terry has a mesmerizing personality he even 
tries to convert relatives at family reunions said dawn marvin of 
rochester his aunt 
terry was reared in a lowkey protestant environment but quit 
high school at 17 dreaming of a career in music said marvin who 
is communications director for the rochester chapter of planned 
parenthood a medical service that antiabortion pickets frequently 
target she stressed that she does not speak for the organization 
about her nephew 
he went away and he flipped out she said about terrys 
transformation into a bornagain christian he came back a totally 
changed personality it was more like a cult reaction than a 
spiritual quest 
marriage and his highly public role as operation rescue spokesman 
have calmed him somewhat she said the terrys have one child and 
three foster children 
terry dismisses his aunts comments including her assessment 
that hes an egomaniac lapping up news media attention 
to margaret johnston administrator at southern tier womens 
services in binghamton operation rescue is nothing new she said 
antiabortion activists have spread nails in the parking lot and 
glued the clinics door shut four or five times 
terrys first arrest came in january 1986 when he chained himself 
to a sink at the clinic which performs abortions he was jailed for 
22 days for refusing to pay a 60 fine 
it doesnt matter what you say to him there is no reason 
involved johnston said he doesnt care about women i think he 
really hates women 
iron pipes now prevent cars from blocking the entrance to the 
binghamton clinic a court order keeps the nearly everpresent 
demonstrators at shouting distance 
they really want to make it personal johnston said 
even when she has run into him on a saturday in the post office 
johnston said terry has shouted at her how many babies did you 
murder today 
terry criticizes the antiabortion movement as being too nice 
during the 1980s pacified by the presence of an ideological friend 
like president reagan into not working hard for its goal 
we cry that abortion is murder its childkilling and yet we 
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters he 
said thats not an adequate response to murder a logical 
response to murder is physical intervention on behalf of the 
victim 
the lean bushyhaired terry expects and even hopes his 
demonstrators will be arrested he claims operation rescue is 
responsible for 11000 arrests this year and predicts 500000 will 
be arrested in the next year 
there are no situations he said when abortions are justified 
in most areas of life its ok for people to follow their own 
beliefs but not when it comes to having innocent children 
murdered he said 
thats like saying why cant a white man follow his own 
conscience concerning owning a black slave why cant a german 
follow his own conscience if he decides he wants to shoot jews 
terry has attracted some prominent supporters including former 
presidential candidate pat robertson who said he backs any means 
short of violence to stop abortion 
if antiabortion demonstrators set their minds to it terry said 
they could change abortion laws in six months because the political 
system is not built to deal with mass protests 
yard dismisses terry as a puppet groomed for the role of 
point man in the latest antiabortion offensive 
women are really outraged by the whole thing she said the 
reason they have been passive seemingly in the light of bombings of 
abortion clinics and operation rescue is that people dont believe 
roe vs wade can be overturned im not so sanguine all i know 
is we have to make the biggest outcry we possibly can 
at operation rescues office a competing outcry is being plotted 
pinned to the wall is a large map of the united states with 
abortion mills dotted in red terry distractedly complains to a 
staff member about a plane flight later that afternoon that will 
take him to a television appearance 
as a photographer snaps pictures he removes his foot from his 
desk saying thats too casual for someone trying to change world 
history 
he adds chuckling its comical really i think god has a 
sense of humor dont you think its rather funny that a former used 
car salesman is heading such a movement

in a continent where newspapers are not 
generally known for their crusading zeal a zimbabwean editor has 
become a national hero and his tabloid a sellout for exposing 
highlevel corruption 
the price for geoff nyarotas principles has been high 
a cabinet minister threatened him with detention two of his 
staff were allegedly assaulted by a senior politician and president 
robert mugabe branded two of his reporters enemies of the country 
but nyarota editor of the chronicle in zimbabwes second largest 
city bulawayo remains unbowed 
where corruption exists at whatever level and we find out 
well expose it said the 37yearold editor a former 
schoolteacher who broke into journalism with a muckraking weekly 
newspaper in the l970s 
the chronicles exposes are small change in africa where 
widespread graft infects most levels of society but the stories are 
avidly read by zimbabweans who have long suspected some of their 
leaders of dipping into the national till 
in december the chronicle published the names of several cabinet 
members security chiefs and ranking bureaucrats who obtained cars 
and trucks directly from the staterun willowvale assembly plant 
then evidently resold them at a huge profit 
the chronicles frontpage report was headlined willowgate 
scandal 
private buyers who order cars must wait years for them and the 
demand has created a flourishing black market in which vehicles 
fetch as much as five times their book value 
defense minister enos nkala was one of those questioned by the 
chronicles assistant editor davison maruziva on the whereabouts 
of a car he bought 
nkala demanded to know how the paper knew he had the vehicle and 
he threatened to send soldiers to detain maruziva and his boss 
where did you get that information the minister reportedly 
asked 
that information is supposed to be with the police and the 
president i want that information here in my office if you do

for students working in a miniature factory at 
the university of missourirolla the future of american business is 
now 
when our students go into industry they will have 
stateoftheart knowledge that will affect decisions about 
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the 
workplace said sema alptekin designer of the futuristic business 
laboratory 
ms alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs 
the universitys computerintegrated manufacturing and packaging 
laboratory 
the lab established two years ago at a cost of 120000 is the 
only project of its kind in the state and one of the more advanced 
such programs in the country 
tom akas of the society of manufacturing engineers said ms 
alptekin has created a model for similar laboratories students 
can see how the factory of the future operates 
the society of manufacturing engineers has recognized ms 
alptekin as an outstanding young manufacturing engineer 
in her lab a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from 
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent 
4foot metal sentry the robot is a vshaped jointed arm on a 
pivoting base the arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp lift and 
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks the 
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe 
or milling machine 
the entire factory would fit inside a basketball halfcourt the 
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting 
shops ms alptekin said 
students learn to program a computer and automated machines 
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation retrieving raw 
materials from the storage shelf unit which can be programmed to 
supply appropriate parts from its inventory lifting and placing the 
parts in position with the robots arm and shaping parts into 
finished products at the lathe 
students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key 
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass 
but the product is less important than the process ms alptekin 
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation 
and financial consulting 
in the factory of the future according to the universitys 
model human chatter will be replaced by the clickclack of machines 
ours is quite unique its totally integrated ms alptekin 
said referring to programming that allows components such as the 
automated storage system to talk to the computer that controls 
the manufacturing process informing it about the availability of 
parts 
ms alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even 
from industries where robots and automated machines have become 
almost commonplace there she said robots perform specific tasks 
in islands of automation but human workers remain responsible 
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the 
production line 
ms alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile 
industry but she would like to see it expanded 
it should be used in any industry she said its difficult 
to justify economically but if quality is the concern then it can 
be easily justified 
at least our students will be aware of the enhancements and 
developments in this area and when they make decisions as engineers 
and managers they will take this into consideration she said 
a masters candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to 
altering it to create a new product ms alptekin said the student 
identified what new production components were necessary and 
determined how they could be integrated into the system 
a doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will 
allow the system to diagnose itself the system could be programmed 
to recognize when a component is not working and then decide to 
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled 
component much as human managers would react 
graduate student bob borchelt said the equipment he is using is 
on the cutting edge of manufacturing 
truthfully i cant say that i was expecting this level of 
expertise he said i know that our lab is one of the best of 
its kind in an educational institution 
the lab like the entire engineering management program calls on 
computing mechanical electrical and chemical skills and teamwork 
for us for managers the entire system is important ms 
alptekin said 
ms alptekin said she is continually finetuning the lab this 
past year the original robot was replaced with one able to perform 
more tasks she now is considering purchasing a robot with vision 
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector 
the university spent 30000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987 an 
estimated 60000 to 70000 was earmarked in 1988 
international business machines corp recently pledged 12 
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part 
of an ibm program to aid 48 collegebased robotics labs across the 
country 
studies show that theres a severe national shortage of 
instructional materials in this growing and critical area said 
andy russell a spokesman for ibm ibm will benefit because we 
will be helping to train the computerintegrated manufacturing 
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow

chiles oncepowerful communist party 
finds itself increasingly deserted by the left and sharply repressed 
by the right while it pursues revolutionary tactics long abandoned 
by other opposition forces 
parties once closely aligned with the communists including 
important sectors of the socialist party are taking pains to 
distance themselves from the promoscow group while the country 
prepares for an end to 15 years of rightwing military rule 
many socialists spent more than a decade in exile in western 
europe after the 1973 military coup that brought augusto pinochet to 
power their political views were moderated by reforms in that 
region where socialist groups shed their leninist tendencies 
but most chilean communists sought refuge in the soviet union or 
east germany upon their return they have employed a revolutionary 
rhetoric that many excomrades find antiquated and offensive 
while communism is changing around the world the chilean party 
goes back to 1917 and declares itself probolshevik socialist 
exsenator erich schnake told the associated press that leaves 
them entrapped in a politicalmilitary apparatus 
schnake was referring to a recent communist party document 
presented at its first national congress in 19 years in it the 
party declared our policy of open rebellion remains in effect 
it was a reiteration of a party policy statement in 1983 that 
formally proclaimed a strategy of popular rebellion and the 
use of legitimate violence and all forms of struggle against 
pinochet 
schnake participated in a coalition of socialists communists and 
other leftist groups led by salvador allende who was elected 
president in 1970 and ousted by pinochet 
he now calls the communists one of the most difficult things to 
explain in chilean politics today 
jose sanfuentes a communist party spokesman objected to 
criticism of the communists militant stance but admits the strategy 
had created some problems with the rest of the opposition 
but we do not feel isolated he insisted we are an 
important element in the fight to restore democracy 
the countrys nonmarxist opposition led a peaceful cmpaign for 
pinochets defeat in an oct 5 referendum which asked voters 
whether the 73yearold army commanders rule should be extended 
until 1997 
the communist party characterized the vote as a farce and 
insisted only mass struggle would topple the government only after 
it appeared evident pinochet would lose a few weeks before the 
election did the party come out in favor of a no vote 
the communists were not invited to join thea broadbased 
opposition coalition that led the campaign and they remain 
ostracized while the coalition prepares for open elections 
socialist ricardo lagos a leader of the coalition characterized 
the communists position as contradictory 
they need to clearly define themselves to the whole country 
he said the country cant understand a party that says it wants 
to become legal and thinks thats compatible with a bunch of kids 
attacking a police station 
he referred to a recent attack on a rural police outpost in which 
one officer was killed a guerrilla band that claimed responsibility 
is widely believed to be related to the communist party 
the government calls the group the armed hand of the communist 
party 
sanfuentes denied his party encourages terrorism and claimed 
recent terrorist actions were the work of government security 
services to put the blame on the communists 
we do not want to exclude anybody lagos said the 
communists want to participate very well then let them to adhere 
to our strategies 
the communist party is officially outlawed and has suffered 
fierce repression by the military since the coup party spokesmen 
say 17 members of its central committee and dozens of other party 
militants have been killed during military rule 
some political analysts contend the repression has contributed to 
the partys resistance to reform by forcing it to function 
clandestinely 
the party convention expected to last several months began in 
december but was being held secretly for fear of government 
sanctions spokesmen said 
some party public spokesmen such as sanfuentes have 
operated more or less openly however appearing at public events 
and meeting with the news media 
popular mobilization is still essential to put an end to the 
dictatorship sanfuentes said the expression popular 
mobilization is used by communists to describe labor strikes and 
street demonstrations 
sanfuentes said his party is not immune to changes in communism 
around the world but he claimed that those changes including 
perestroika in the soviet union have been misunderstood by 
nonadherents 
they try to show perestroika as a reverse for the russian 
revolution he said thats not so its exactly the other way 
around the idea is to rescue the best part of the revolution to 
make more democracy and more socialism 
in that sense our party is going through a process of renewal 
which is deeply revolutionary sanfuentes added and that 
process has not been prompted by events in other parts of the world 
or in other parties but by the reality in our own country

the inventors of the unbundled stock unit are 
confident they can tie up enough loose ends for stillunconvinced 
investors to make februarys planned offering of the new security a 
success 
but the developers who initially pitched the securities as a way 
to unlock hidden values in a company by breaking a share of its 
stock into three tradable components are now emphasizing the value 
of the three pieces as a package 
ron gallatin the shearson lehman hutton inc executive who 
oversaw the development of the unbundled stock unit insists the new 
marketing approach simply reflects an effort to point out what may 
have been an underappreciated reason for making the switch from 
common stock to unbundled stock unit 
there seems to be no question that long before the important 
date there will be more than enough people comfortable with it to 
proceed with the offerings he said 
the important date may be in early february after the securities 
and exchange commission completes its review of the proposal and the 
offerings begin 
shearson and four clients american express co pfizer inc 
dow chemical co and sara lee corp said dec 5 that they planned 
to offer shareholders a chance to exchange about 56 billion in 
common stock for unbundled stock units the precise exchange ratio 
has not been announced and some investors are pushing to get one 
unbundled unit for slightly less than a share of common 
the unbundled stock unit consists of a 30year bond paying 
interest equal to the companys current dividend a preferred stock 
that will reflect any increase in the dividend and an equity 
appreciation certificate that will reflect stock price appreciation 
in excess of the bonds stated value 
it is expected that each of the units will trade separately on 
the new york stock exchange along with the companys common stock 
and a unit that will combine the preferred stock and equity 
appreciation certificate 
the stock exchange recently made a proposal to the sec that would 
allow the issuance of unbundled stock units with certain 
restrictions 
the restrictions include limiting the total outstanding stock 
that can be converted into unbundled units to no more than 25 
percent in addition the voting rights of the remaining 
stockholders should not be adversely affected by an exchange of 
stock for unbundled units and individual shareholders should be 
allowed to swap their shares without a shareholder vote 
gallatin said his firm has no objection to the exchanges 
recommendations and noted that each of the four offerings proposed 
to date are in compliance 
shearson has been briefing institutional investors who are being 
counted on to be major participants in the market for unbundled 
stock units 
among the reservations that some investors have expressed are 
that the exchange will be taxable and that unbundled units carry no 
voting rights some have also questioned how liquid the market for 
the new securities will be and have found it difficult to place a 
value on the preferred and equity appreciation components of the 
unbundled unit 
gallatin said the taxability issue should not pose a problem for 
taxexempt investors such as pension funds and may be an incentive 
for investors who may have a capital loss rather than a gain voting 
rights would be restored in the event of a takeover 
in addition gallatin said those trying to place a value on the 
various pieces of the unbundled stock unit should consider the 
extras in the package as a whole 
while companies can cut dividends they are less likely to skip 
an interest payment and that is what the dividend becomes after the 
share of stock is traded for the unbundled stock unit the bond has 
a face value after 30 years of about 25 times the current stock 
price with the potential for even more with the equity appreciation 
certificate 
in an analysis of the pfizer offering the investment firm 
goldman sachs amp co said its experts have guardedly assigned a 
value of about 510 percent of the price of the common to these new 
guarantees which might be realized if one were to hold the pieces 
for 30 years 
but they added that if investors do not consider the value of 
these provisions attractive enough to offset the lack of common 
voting rights and the potential liquidity problem the offering may 
be untenable 
some investors want to wait until the new securities are in the 
market 
in a recent report for the investment firm oppenheimer amp co 
inc analysts norman weinger and michael metz said the jury is 
still out on the probable success of the new securities and 
described initial reaction as mixed 
but they added were the reaction of market participants to 
remain favorable the incentive would be strong for other companies 
to adopt the proposal

in the abc movie the ryan white story 
look for a scene in a hospital in which the young aids victim talks 
to a friend named chad 
chad is played by ryan white the indiana youngster who took on 
fear ignorance and the establishment in his determination to go to 
school despite being diagnosed as having the deadly acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome chad is a friend who died of aids 
lukas haas witness plays ryan producer linda otto said it 
was director john herzfelds idea to have ryan play chad 
ryan was a natural she said he just understands he has a 
sixth sense i loved being around him hes enriched my life 
hes just turned 17 he drives a car no one quite understands 
why hes fine but he is ryan has determined to do well and have a 
good life the lesson of the movie is overcoming adversity its not 
about aids although thats what he has 
i didnt want to make a movie about a boy dying of aids i 
wanted to make a movie about a kid living with aids every movie you 
see about aids the person dies even if ryan had died i wouldnt 
have him die in the movie but i knew he wouldnt die i knew hed 
hang in there 
at the end of the movie which abc broadcasts monday there is 
another look at ryan plus his mother jeanne and his sister 
andrea 
judith light plays ryans mother nikki cox his sister george c 
scott plays his attorney george dzundza and sarah jessica parker 
his doctor and nurse mitchell ryan and grace zabriskie his 
grandparents and peter scolari an attorney representing the school 
people wanted to be in this movie because it was about ryan and 
about aids said otto we were able to get music from john 
cougar mellencamp michael jackson and elton john because they all 
knew about ryan 
the ryan white story is a feelgood movie 
ryan is a hemophiliac who learned in 1984 that he had contracted 
aids through a blood transfusion his school in kokomo ind barred 
him many parents wrongly believed that their children could get the 
disease through casual contact with ryan 
a lot of people were terrified said otto thats why this 
picture is important you cant get aids by casual contact the fact 
that it polarized an entire town is a microcosm of america kokomo 
is as apple pie as you can get there were no good people or bad 
people people wanted to protect their children 
ryan was bound and determined to go to school they were bound 
and determined to keep him out it could happen in any community 
what made this a special case is that ryan went public with it i 
cant go to school watch me 
ryan won a precedentsetting court decision and now attends 
school at his new home in cicero ind 
otto said it took nearly three years to get the movie made after 
the project was dropped by nbc then picked up by abc 
thats a long time to care about a movie she said but 
more important i was concerned about ryan his health went up and 
down i wanted to get it done so he could be a part of it 
many people called about the rights to ryans story but nobody 
went to kokomo and said i want to make this movie except me 
they didnt say yes right away i sent them tapes of adam and 
bill two other reallife movies she has produced 
ryans story was filmed in north carolina the third movie ottos 
landsburg co has made there the others were a stoning in fulham 
county for nbc and quiet victory the charlie wedemeyer story 
for cbs otto is now awaiting word from abc on another picture to be 
filmed there unspeakable acts about a child abuse case in 
florida 
ottos movie adam was about the murderkidnaping of adam 
walsh which caused his father to crusade for a law setting up a 
national clearinghouse for missing children and bill was about 
a mentally retarded man played by mickey rooney who was able to 
make it on his own

government bureaucrats think they had good reason 
to pop champagne corks early for their success at peddling some of 
the sickest insolvent savings and loan institutions before the new 
year holiday 
but congressional critics think the last laugh may belong to the 
slick financiers who bought them risking little of their own money 
gaining huge tax benefits and controlling a vast new source of 
assets 
once criticized for moving too sluggishly to solve the nations 
thrift crisis federal regulators intensified efforts this past week 
to sell at least 200 insolvent sampls by the end of the year 
on wednesday and thursday alone the federal home loan bank 
board which regulates the nations 3100 savings institutions sold 
22 of the insolvent thrifts it has been forced to take over because 
of mismanagement and bad loans 
they included the first sale of a us thrift to foreign 
investors pacific usa holdings corp the texas unit of a taiwanese 
concern is acquiring eight institutions with assets worth 850 
million 
the bank boards biggest single sale was the american savings amp 
loan association of stockton calif with more than 30 billion in 
assets to a group controlled by the texas takeover strategist 
robert m bass who will only have to put up 500 million in return 
for 17 billion of government aid 
but the costliest to the government was the sale of five 
insolvent texas sampls to an investment group headed by new york 
takeover strategist ronald perelman chairman of revlon inc 
for a 315 million investment of its own and 51 billion of 
federal aid perelmans group will obtain control of savings units 
with assets of 122 billion 
part of the lastminute rush to sell sick thrifts was due to tax 
law changes that expire sunday halving the potential benefits to 
buyers 
but the selling spree has raised new questions about whether the 
government is relinquishing too much in its effort to unload the 
problem concern also has intensified over many of the buyers 
professional financiers who arent necessarily interested in running 
these thrifts but consider them undervalued 
the haste with which you are proceeding may prove to be 
shortsighted irresponsible and ultimately unfair to us 
taxpayers sen howard metzenbaum dohio said in a letter to the 
bank board 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas new chairman of the house 
banking committee said he intends to hold hearings in january to 
scrutinize these deals especially the two largest bailouts 
bank board officials who toasted the biggest deals with 
champagne defended the massive infusion of money to salvage the 
bankrupt sampls saying it would cost taxpayers much more if they were 
closed which would require the government to pay off the depositors 
they also rejected the other alternative continuing to run 
bankrupt institutions that are losing more money every day 
some thrift industry analysts said the situation reflects the 
extremely weak bargaining position held by the bank board which 
doesnt have enough money to shut down failed sampls and doesnt want 
to keep them in the end the government may have to settle for 
whoever is willing to buy 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
the governments economic statistics suggested a mixed picture 
going into 1989 the commerce department said us industries will 
expand for the seventh straight year strengthened by demand for 
exports and services but its chief economic forecasting gauge 
turned down slightly and home sales hit an 18month low in november

new york city barred the firm from participating in its next bond 
sale 
american telephone amp telegraph co agreed to buy paradyne corp 
for 250 million a move that reflected the telecommunications 
giants new willingness to acquire other companies rather than 
develop new technology on its own elsewhere in the takeover 
business sunshine mining co said it would buy rexene corp for 
8652 million pennwalt corp rejected a 698 million offer from

avery inc says it is discussing the possible 
sale of its uniroyal chemical co subsidiary to a managementled 
investor group for as much as 810 million 
avery bought uniroyal chemical for more than 700 million from 
uniroyal inc in 1986 in hopes of creating a large multinational 
chemical company jerry hostetter an avery spokesman said thursday 
however avery abandoned the idea early this year after it found 
that the plan was too expensive to carry out he said 
avery said in a statement late thursday that the investor group 
which also includes drexel burnham lambert inc would pay 240 
million to 250 million in cash for uniroyal chemical as well as the 
assumption of the divisions 560 million in debt 
avery said that if it reached agreement with the group the deal 
would require the approval of its board shareholders and 
bondholders and would also require financing commitments drexel 
would arrange for the financing avery said 
avery also announced plans earlier this year to dispose of its 
coal subsidiary without the chemical and coal divisions in 
essence it would only be an investment company hostetter said 
he said avery with 45 million to 55 million in cash would 
consider other acquisitions or the possible liquidation of the firm 
averys stock closed at 318 in overthecounter trading 
thursday up 6 cents from wednesday 
uniroyal inc sold off the chemical division along with its other 
assets after the company at one point one of the worlds leading 
rubber producers went private in a leveraged buyout 
uniroyal chemical had 1988 sales of 7342 million up from 
5905 million last year avery said

adolph coors co has learned what happens when you 
change the label of the flagship beer but dont change the 
ingredients some beer drinkers are convinced it just doesnt taste 
the same 
last summer coors put a new original draft label on its 
flagship beer to attract younger drinkers and compete with miller 
brewing cos successful draft beer advertising campaign 
but some beer drinkers in el paso texas and southern california 
two coors loyalist strongholds thought the retirement of the old 
banquet beer label meant the beer had changed although it 
hadnt 
sales fell in some liquor stores and taverns as cans and bottles 
bearing the old banquet beer label gave way to original 
draft 
we thought the change would help us but it kind of 
backfired mark martinez of the coors distributing co in el paso 
said thursday we were talking to the brewery to try to tell them 
how much it was hurting us 
coors battling for a bigger share of the beer market paid 
attention 
next week coors will begin selling the beer under the old 
banquet beer label again in el paso and southern california 
alongside its original draft label 
the coors experience in some ways recalls cocacola cos 
experiment in april 1985 when it replaced its original cola flavor 
with a new formulation the ensuing consumer protest forced 
cocacola to bring back the old flavor three months later renaming 
it cocacola classic 
we were faced with a choice argue with the customers and say 
it is the same beer or give them what they wanted coors 
spokesman doyle albee said from company headquarters in golden a 
denver suburb 
coors introduced the original draft label because miller 
brewing co was having success with an advertising campaign that 
emphasized its draft beer albee said he said coors wanted 
consumers to know coors has been putting draft beer in bottles since 
1959 
we also found that new graphics could attract perhaps a younger 
drinker in the 21 to 25 age group he said 
the brewery began bottling the beer under the new label last 
july this fall coors officials were surprised to learn they had 
some disgruntled customers 
we found there was confusion about whether it was a different 
beer said albee we never in our advertising campaign said this 
is the same beer in a new package perhaps that added to the 
confusion 
albee said coors asked the companys 600 beer distributors 
whether they wanted the old label back the only response was in 
southern california and el paso about 20 said they would take 
banquet 
coors has a loyal following in those areas said albee who 
thinks the label change was more readily accepted in areas where 
coors has not been available so long the beer has been sold in 
southern california since 1937 and in southwest texas since 1948 
martinez said that in el paso the label change was especially 
unpopular with hispanics over 40 who form the core of el paso coors 
drinkers 
albee said it will not cost the brewery extra to put two kinds of 
labels on its bottles and cans after running out a few thousand 
cases you break about even he said 
he thinks that while coors lost some business with the label 
change in a few locations the original draft label already is 
building a following that could increase sales 
and coors does not plan to change its advertising campaign 
because of diehard banquet beer label fans 
ninetysomeodd percent of our business is original draft 
labels and will continue to be said albee

in a major blow to prime minister noboru takeshita 
the man appointed to investigate a widening scandal resigned today 
after saying he had accepted political donations from the company at 
the center of the controversy 
takeshita today named a political outsider former supreme court 
judge masami takatsuji 78 to replace justice minister takashi 
hasegawa 
hasegawa announced he was stepping down just three days after 
takeshita appointed him to a new cabinet supposedly untainted by a 
stockdealing scandal that had already forced the resignation of 17 
politicians and business leaders 
opposition parties and analysts say takeshita should follow the 
lead of those leaders and resign 
hasegawas resignation which occurred the day after takeshita 
publicly reaffirmed his support for him was the second cabinet 
casualty finance minister kiichi miyazawa stepped down on dec 9 
takeshita made no comment on the resignation of hasegawa 76 
takatsuji a constitutional expert and former bureaucrat served 
as a supreme court justice from 1973 to 1980 he is an unusual 
choice as a cabinet member because he is not a career politician 
the background of nearly all cabinet ministers 
takeshita apparently decided it was necessary to go outside 
politics to find someone without links to the recruit co the 
information conglomerate at the heart of the scandal over charges it 
sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary to scores of politicians and 
business leaders at bargain prices 
asked at a news conference today if he had any connection to the 
recruit affair the new justice minister said none at all 
i dont really have anything to say about recruit takatsuji 
said my attitude toward it is no different from that of the 
people in general 
his predecessor had been given a mandate to reform political 
ethics and head the legal probe of the recruit scandal but one day 
after hasegawas appointment it was disclosed that recruit had 
given money for 12 years to a group that financed his campaign and 
political activities 
there is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations 
made from the good will of their supporters hasegawa told 
reporters earlier today 
however as minister in charge of clearing up the recruit 
problem in the takeshita administration which is trying to heighten 
trust in government it is regrettable that i received donations 
from recruit he said 
i apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice 
minister 
the scandal has engulfed the liberal democrats as several senior 
party lawmakers or their aides purchased shares in the subsidiary 
before the shares were offered publicly and later sold them at large 
taxfree profits 
the transactions were legal but have generated a storm of 
controversy over business and political ethics prosecutors also are 
invesigating possible bribery 
leaders of the opposition clean government party and the 
democratic socialist party said hasegawas resignation was only 
natural while the communist party called for the entire cabinet to 
resign and new parliamentary elections 
takeshita should step down because he is connected to the 
recruit affair himself and as long as he is appointing cabinet 
ministers government wont be clean said masayuki fukuoka a 
professor of political science at komazawa university in tokyo 
there is no way for the takeshita administration to regain its 
public support as more people will probably be arrested as the 
recruit investigation advances next year he said 
it is widely perceived that the premier should consider resigning 
when public support dips below 20 percent fukuoka said 
a newspaper poll this month found takeshitas public support was 
18 percent down from 30 percent when he took office 13 months ago 
an aide to takeshita and one of his relatives also profited in 
the stock transactions but the prime minister has denied any 
personal involvement 
takeshita cannot escape the responsibility of political reform 
that he has pledged and he should resign said jiro kamijima 
professor of government at tokyos rissho university 
the entire parliament has been hijacked by recruit 
hasegawa confirmed thursday that his political support 
organization received 46000 from recruit over the last 12 years 
but hasegawa said he had no knowledge of the donations 
other new cabinet members have received donations from recruit 
including the agriculture and economic planning agency chiefs and 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi who has acknowledged his 
political support group received monthly donations of 160 from 
recruit

the governments chief gauge of future economic 
activity edged down 02 percent in november after having risen in 
the previous month the commerce department said today 
the performance by the departments index of leading economic 
indicators continued a sawtooth pattern which analysts said was 
signaling that economic growth will slow in the new year but the 
country should not topple into a recession 
the index had risen 04 percent in october after having suffered 
a 03 percent decline in september since may the index has 
exhibited an alternating pattern of increases and declines in each 
month 
over the past 12 months the index has risen 16 percent less 
than half the 41 percent increase of the previous 12month period 
to many analysts this suggests that economic growth will be 
slower in 1989 but there should be no recession the traditional 
signal of an economic downturn is three consecutive months of 
declines in the leading index 
while the overall economy as measured by the gross national 
product is expected to climb by 39 percent this year the best 
performance in four years many analysts are predicting growth in 
the new year will slow to around 25 percent 
such a slowdown would have the beneficial effect of easing 
inflationary fears analysts said with many industries already 
operating at close to peak capacity and with unemployment near 
14year lows economists believe that slower growth is needed to 
keep the economy from overheating 
we think a little slowdown is useful right now said david 
wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
the economy has been growing too fast and needs to slow to a more 
sustainable pace 
in november four of the available nine indicators contributed to 
the decline the biggest negative factor was a speedup in delivery 
times on business orders this is viewed negatively for the future 
because it indicates declining demand for products 
the other negative factors dragging the index down were a fall in 
stock prices an increase in weekly unemployment claims and a 
decline in raw materials prices also viewed as a negative because 
it signals falling demand 
three indicators made positive contributions led by an increase 
in growth in the money supply other positive forces were a rise in 
manufacturing orders for consumer goods and an increase in orders 
for new plants and equipment 
two indicators building permits and the length of the average 
workweek were unchanged in november 
the various changes left the index at 1932 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
the federal reserve has been tightening up on credit for much of 
this year in a move to dampen demand and keep inflation from 
accelerating 
even without the credit tightening by the federal reserve many 
analysts said a slowdown would have occurred anyway because they 
expect that business investment and export sales the two sources of 
strength in 1988 cannot continue growing at the same rates in 1989 
those two sectors of the economy were responsible for half of all 
growth in 1988 
the commerce department on thursday said it was projecting a 
somewhat slower demand for us manufactured goods in its annual 
us industrial outlook based on the expectation that us exports 
and capital spending will not rise at the same breakneck pace in the 
new year 
the outlook forecast that 70 percent of all manufacturing 
companies would enjoy rising sales in the new year down from a 
decadehigh level of 82 percent in 1988

the government has decided to proceed with a 2 
billion capital injection for renault the stateowned automaker 
the industry ministry announced friday 
the widely expected announcement was the latest development in a 
dispute between france and the european economic community over 
frances plans to make renault solvent by easing its debt burden 
the eecs executive commission wants renault operated as a normal 
company rather than a government authority the french agree but 
want to make sure they can continue to finance the company 
in an apparent effort to placate the commission the industry 
ministry published a decree friday saying renault would be run in 
accordance with article 241 of frances 1966 corporate legal code 
the decree gives government decisions the same status as a vote 
by a general shareholders meeting since the state is the groups 
only shareholder this in turn means that a capital boost approved 
by the state has the same legal status as one approved by 
shareholders of a privatesector company 
renault lost 5 billion between 1981 and 1986 and by the end of 
1987 its liabilities amounted to 77 billion almost 2 billion 
more than its assets

a federal judges decision stalling a 970 million 
takeover effort is based on concerns about the deals huge debt 
financing and criminal sanctions hanging over its investment banker 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
the order by us district judge david mazzone late thursday came 
hours before mai basic four incs 20ashare bid for prime 
computer inc was due to expire mai basic extended the bid until 
jan 11 
mazzones ruling appeared to be the first time that concern over 
drexels record settlement of securities fraud charges announced 
last week had affected litigation in a hostile takeover fight 
mazzone said he wanted more information from tustin califbased 
mai basic which is about one fourth the size of prime involving 
the ambitious fragile and possibly illegal financial requirements 
through which it and other investors propose to acquire prime 
the judge said mai basic controlled by new york financier 
bennett s lebow and its investment banker drexel are proposing a 
deal that will cost a total of 15 billion with virtually all of 
this financing taking the form of debt 
of the 15 billion 875 million would be in the form of junk 
bond financing from drexel which mazzone noted has acknowledged 
its guilt to six felony counts related to its involvement in 
similarly heavily leveraged transactions 
suggestions that drexels guilty plea improves its financial 
stability while not necessarily disingenuous are not helpful 
mazzone said 
prime stock closed at 1775 up 375 cents in composite new 
york stock exchange trading thursday 
matthew eluck an attorney for mai basic said he was optimistic 
mai basic would address some of mazzones concerns about financial 
disclosures and that mai basic would be able to satisfy his latest 
concerns 
the judge also said mai basics offer requires the delaware 
courts to strike down primes poison pill antitakeover plan or 
for primes board to rescind it which is unlikely prime is 
headquartered in massachusetts but incorporated in delaware 
the bidders acknowledge that the poison pill makes prime 
prohibitively expensive mazzone said yet despite a delaware 
court decision refusing to enjoin the plan the bidders continue to 
assert with confidence that they can consummate the deal 
eluck said mai basic intended to pursue efforts in the delaware 
courts aimed at overturning primes poison pill under the plan if 
a party acquires more than 20 percent of prime current shareholders 
are entitled to buy shares at half price 
meanwhile eluck said mai basic would respond promptly to 
mazzones latest queries for further details of the financing 
we think we will be able to provide them and comply with the 
judges directions for further disclosures by the end of next 
week he said 
prime said in a statement we are gratified by the district 
courts order and its recognition of the serious economic and legal 
questions raised by mais efforts to acquire prime

the japanese but were projecting by 93 or 94 well have parity 
in product quality at least in consumer perceptions power 
founder of jd power amp associates told auto dealers at the 
indianapolis auto show 
power predicted slightly slowing car sales over the next two 
years followed by a brisk recovery 
were projecting an average of 103 million passenger cars 
and 49 million trucks will be sold in each of the next two years 
he said thursday we see sales climbing back by 93 to about 11 
million passenger cars and 48 million lightduty trucks 
he said he does not expect continuing growth in demand for 
lightduty trucks which have given domestic manufacturers a big 
lift in recent years 
one thing that concerns me about the truck business is the rosy 
projections everyone is giving to it power said i would 
caution the industry to be looking at a realistic level of 
sales we cannot sustain a 5 million lightduty truck market

soybean futures prices surged mightily friday in 
an abbreviated session on the chicago board of trade amid forecasts 
for drier weather in south america and more soybean meal purchases 
by the soviet union 
grain futures also advanced 
some meteorologists said a highpressure ridge was forming over 
the south american soybean belt which could mean a return to the 
unusually warm dry conditions that marked the recent planting 
period in brazil and argentina 
additional buying was prompted by rumors that the soviet union 
planned to buy more us soybean meal said dale gustafson an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
the soviets are on a very aggressive import program for both 
grain and protein in an attempt to improve food supply and 
availabilities he said

federal regulators announced the closings of 
two more insolvent savings and loan associations today pushing the 
total for the year to 199 with officials predicting that figure 
would climb to a postdepression record well above 200 before the 
yearend rush to complete deals is over 
the latest sales involving insolvent sampls in montana and 
oklahoma were announced at midday as the threemember federal home 
loan bank board continued to meet behind closed doors reviewing 
applications to take over failed institutions 
bank board chairman m danny wall scheduled a late afternoon 
press conference to announce further agreements and to answer 
charges raised by critics that many of the multimilliondollar 
bailouts represented bad deals for the government 
critics have complained that in its rush to complete sales before 
midnight saturday when tax breaks for buyers will be cut in half 
the bank board failed to drive the best bargains possible 
the latest acquisitions involved the sale of the insolvent 
community federal savings and loan association of tulsa okla to 
the local federal savings and loan association of oklahoma city the 
agreement was te first acquisition under the bank boards oklahoma 
plan providing for accelerated review of cases in that state the 
government pledged assistance of 89 million and local federal 
agreed to invest 16 million in cash 
in the other deal the insolvent great falls federal savings and 
loan association of great falls mont was taken over by western 
savings and loan association of missoula mont the agreement in 
which the government pledged 114 million in assistance resolved 
the final insolvent sampl in montana 
the 199 insolvent sampls which have been closed compared to 48 
closed in 1987 and would be the highest figure since 277 sampls failed 
in 1938 during the depression 
the bank board for the first time has drawn foreign investors 
into its effort to bail out sick sampls in the southwest it announced 
a subsidiary of a taiwanese company had agreed to buy eight 
insolvent texas savings institutions 
bank board chairman m danny wall defended the sale of the texas 
thrifts to taiwanese investors saying we welcome our first 
nonus owned investor their interest in investing in the 
future of texas is a further indication of the attractiveness of the 
states thrift industry as well as its business climate 
working against a midnight saturday deadline the bank board 
announced the sale of 13 more insolvent sampls in texas and illinois 
late thursday 
all of the institutions will be open for business as usual today 
sporting new names and with their depositors funds fully protected 
even with the yearend rush of closings there are still more 
than 400 insolvent sampls operating and estimates of cleaning up the 
total mess range as high as 112 billion 
the amount of money needed presents an immediate problem for the 
incoming bush administration 
presidentelect bush is faced with the task of coming up with a 
solution to the sampl crisis that will not make it impossible for him 
to meet his campaign pledge of narrowing the federal budget deficit 
without resorting to higher taxes 
many congressional critics believe that the bank boards efforts 
are going in the wrong direction and will worsen not narrow the 
ultimate cost to the government 
wall has insisted that the cost of simply closing the 
institutions and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales 
which are being arranged through the use of tax breaks and direct 
federal assistance as a lure to buyers 
the tax benefits to sampl buyers will be effectively cut in half 
after midnight saturday the provisions that will expire allow firms 
purchasing failed sampls to deduct the previous losses of those 
associations from profits the firms earned on other operations 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas the new chairman of the house 
banking committee said he plans to hold a series of hearings 
starting in january on the deals looking specifically at the two 
largest bailouts announced this week 
those complex transactions will cost the government 68 billion 
in assistance to the purchasers of american savings of stockton 
calif by texas billionaire robert bass and the acquisition of five 
deeply troubled texas sampls by revlon cosmetics chairman ronald 
perelman 
the sampls which were closed on thursday included one institution 
in springfield ill and 12 insolvent sampls in texas which were 
purchased by two separate groups of investors including the first 
sale of texas institutions to foreigners 
the details of the transactions were 
eight insolvent texas sampls were sold to pacific usa holdings 
corp a texas subsidiary of pacific electric wire and cable co of 
taiwan which agreed to invest 375 million the branches will be 
operated under the name pacific southwest savings bank fsb 
headquartered in corpus christi the bank board agreed to provide 
5662 million in government assistance to the purchasers 
the sampls being taken over were charter savings and loan of corpus 
christi keystone savings and loan of lampasas bayview federal 
savings association of corpus christi first federal savings and 
loan of luling independence savings and loan of gonzales yoakum 
federal savings and loan of yoakum union savings association of san 
antonio and sequin savings association of sequin

provide 429 million in government assistance and centex will invest

the interest rate forecast for 1988 turned out to 
be a bit like a longrange weather report with few experts 
accurately predicting what was in store for the borrowing public 
everyone was thrown for a loop said jay goldinger a 
principal of the hollywood calif investment banking firm capital 
insight inc it was a year that frustrated many 
consumers and businesses generally saw shortterm interest rates 
soar while longerterm rates were little changed from the previous 
year a mixed blessing for both groups 
as a result the socalled yield curve which illustrates the 
difference between short and long rates in the bond market took an 
unusual turn in 1988 first it flattened from the normal upward 
slope then started to invert for the first time in about six years 
i think if you were to try to isolate one key factor of the 
1988 fixedincome environment it was the pronounced flattening of 
the yield curve said william v sullivan director of 
moneymarket research for dean witter reynolds inc 
on the last day of trading in 1988 for instance the yield on 
the oneyear treasury bill was slightly higher than that of the 
bellwether 30year bond 900 percent vs 898 percent the 
3monthbill yield was still 064 percentage points lower than the 
long bond although normally the gap is around 2 percentage points 
longterm rates usually are significantly higher to compensate 
investors for their increased risk for instance its more likely 
that someone will renege on a 30year debt than on one lasting three 
months 
the last time the yield curve inverted the stock market took a 
tumble and the nation headed into a recession 
few economists though are predicting a similar scenario for 
1989 in fact it was fears of the opposite occurring that pushed 
shortterm rates as high as they are now 
the shortend rise in rates came from the fed tightening 
said sullivan 
at the start of 1988 the federal reserve eased its credit 
policies by keeping interest rates down out of nearuniversal 
concern the country was close to a recession from the previous 
octobers stock market crash 
but the economy showed surprising resilience the fed then 
started to worry about rising inflation along with an unstable 
dollar in foreign exchange and switched gears by tightening credit 
inflation actually remained in check throughout the year which 
is partly why longterm interest rates and prices remained fairly 
stable economists said 
the central bank took its biggest inflationfighting stand in 
august when it raised the discount rate the interest charged on 
loans to member banks a half percentage point to 65 percent other 
indirect movements have been made known since 
commercial lending rates followed suit major banks lowered their 
prime lending rates used to set rates on most corporate and 
consumer loans a quarter of a percentage point to 85 percent on 
feb 2 then raised them a half percentage point four times to 105 
percent by years end 
there was a similar pattern for mortgage rates for a 
conventional 30year fixedrate mortgage rates ranged from a low of 
984 percent in midfebruary to a high of 1077 percent at years 
end according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the interest rate climate didnt have too much effect on the 
volume of municipal and corporate issues 
for the year the volume of municipal issues totaled around 112 
billion compared with 1015 billion in 1987 the volume of 
corporate issues rose to around 275 billion from 27219 billion 
many economists predict that rates will continue to rise during 
the first half of 1989 with the 30year treasury bond yielding as 
much as 95 percent it was as low as 829 percent in february and 
as high as 945 in august 
during the second half interest rates should decline as the 
economy starts to cool down economists predict 
we expect fed policy next year to be driven primarily by 
inflation and inflation expectations said elliott platt an 
economist with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette corp

gold bullion was bid at 41000 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est up 
160 from late thursday when it lost 510 an ounce 
foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollars weaker tone 
friday largely to comments made by bundesbank vice president helmut 
schlesinger in an interview with west german newspaper die welt 
schlesinger said a further increase in us interest rates could 
cause the dollar to rise making it more difficult for the united 
states to reduce its high trade deficit 
one dealer said the comments had an impact on the market because 
they were intperpreted as a call by schlesinger for a lower dollar 
and a firmer mark 
however others said that since trading was thin on the last 
business day of 1988 some transactions had an exaggerated effect on 
rates trading also ended a few hours earlier than usual

performance in the final session of 1988 
its the end of the year and the last opportunity to sell

index of leading indicators fell 02 percent in november 
but the government also revised upward its estimate of the 
october gain in the leading indicators to a 04 percent rise rather

close at 216857 
that left the markets bestknown barometer with a decline of 
036 for the week but with a gain of 22974 points or 1185 
percent for the year

ground than many people would have expected at the time of the

poultry giant tyson foods inc won an 
important round friday in its fight to acquire rival holly farms 
corp for 11 billion when a judge blocked the target company from 
merging with conagra corp 
the ruling by a vice chancellor maurice hartnett of the chancery 
court in delaware where holly is incorporated evidently means 
tyson can proceed with its unsolicited 54ashare cash tender offer 
for the company 
its a major victory said james b blair counsel for tyson 
we are pleased and gratified with the courts decision 
tyson is the nations biggest poultry producer conagra is no 2 
and holly is no 5 together they control about 30 percent of the 
readytocook poultry market in the united states 
holly based in memphis tenn has been resisting tysons 
overtures and sought a merger with omahabased conagra to thwart an 
unfriendly takeover under that deal arranged in november conagra 
would acquire tyson in a stock swap valued by securities analysts at 
about 995 million 
hartnett had been asked by tyson to set aside holly deal with 
conagra tyson contended the target companys directors had not 
considered getting the best price for their stockholders 
tyson also contended that the hollys board was influenced by 
managers who are unfriendly to tysons industry analysts have said 
a tyson takeover of holly would likely lead to management changes at 
holly while a merger with conagra probably would not cause such 
turnover 
apparently we won the case blair said from tyson 
headquarters in springdale we are now going to actively pursue 
the acquisition it means the playing field has been made into an 
even ground 
officials for holly and conagra were in meetings and werent 
immediately available for comment 
earlier friday tyson extended its tender offer until jan 6 
nearly 3 million of hollys approximately 20 million shares 
outstanding had been tendered tyson said 
tyson produces more than 2 billion pounds of poultry a year 
conagra turns out about 15 billion pounds and holly farms 
processes about 12 billion pounds 
the court announcement came after the conclusion of nationwide 
stock trading holly stock closed friday at 5562 per share up 
37 cents tyson closed at 1725 up 37 cents conagra closed down 
12 cents at 29

zenith electronics corp asked the 
government friday to invoke a neverused law to monitor imports of 
televisions made by companies suspected of dumping in the united 
states sets they assembled outside their home countries 
zenith the only remaining usowned tv maker said monitoring 
by the commerce department would discourage foreign tv makers from 
evading penalties imposed for selling their products in the united 
states at unfairly low prices 
the request stems from a provision in the 1984 trade law that 
permits the commerce department to develop a 12month monitoring 
program in certain cases 
were simply asking the government to enforce the laws on the 
books zenith chairman jerry k pearlman said in a statement 
commerce department spokeswoman claire buchan said in a telephone 
interview that before going ahead with a monitoring program the 
agency would have to find an extraordinary pattern of persistent 
injurious dumping that was causing a serious problem for the 
domestic industry 
she said the department also would have to decide how to monitor 
imports a procedure presumably less complex than a fullscale 
dumping investigation 
because its a statute thats never been applied its 
something well have to look at to determine what is the best way 
ms buchan said 
dumping refers to the sale of products in foreign markets at 
unfairly low prices to get rid of excess production or to force 
competitors out of business 
zenith based in the chicago suburb of glenview has not had an 
annual profit since 1984 largely because of fierce competition from 
cheap imports 
zeniths 378page request asks the government to monitor imports 
of color tvs picture tubes and parts from mexico malaysia 
singapore hong kong china thailand and the philippines those 
countries have assembly plants established by television 
manufacturers based in japan south korea and taiwan 
zenith claims that by assembling television sets in other 
countries for export to the united states the large asian 
television makers are evading antidumping duties imposed by the 
commerce department that raise the prices of japanese south korean 
and taiwanesemade sets at their borders 
even though a television produced at a singapore plant may have 
a japanese picture tube and japanese chassis and essentially is a 
japanese tv set its imported into the united states without any 
antidumping duties assessed said zenith spokesman john taylor 
antidumping provisions for picture tubes also are in place 
against japan south korea and taiwan 
ordinarily a dumping investigation is initiated when a company 
or industry petitions the commerce department a cumbersome and 
costly process 
but the 1974 trade law also contains a provision for the commerce 
department to initiate its own investigation if it determines 
through monitoring that dumping is taking place 
taylor said zenith hopes the commerce department will 
selfinitiate an investigation in the latest case

a state appeals court upheld a jury verdict 
awarding an investor group 20 percent of the stock of the computer 
franchise giant computerland corp in a case that started with a 
250000 loan 
the ruling by the 1st district court of appeal issued late 
thursday included harsh words for the management as well as the 
legal arguments of computerland founder william millard who has 
been driven from control of the oaklandbased company 
millard was continuously engaged in a kind of shell game with 
his corporations whereby one would be informally merged with 
another justice robert merrill said in the 30 decision 
merrill also said millard kept chaotic and frequently 
nonexistent corporate records and offered speciously 
legalistic arguments in the appeal that contradicted his claims at 
trial 
the court upheld a jurys findings that the terms of a 250000 
loan to millard more than 12 years ago in the early stages of his 
venture included the right to exchange the note for 20 percent of 
the stock in millards computer business 
the note was later bought by a group of investors called 
microvest corp which sued computerland after millard refused to 
transfer the stock in 1981 
in addition to the stock an alameda county superior court jury 
awarded microvest 141 million mostly in punitive damages the 
damages were dropped in december 1985 in a partial settlement which 
included millards resignation from the board of directors 
microvest lawyer herbert hafif on friday confirmed reports that 
the settlement gave the investment group an additional 85 percent 
of computerland stock bringing the total to 285 percent he said 
he expects the company to make a public stock offering this spring 
and estimated the total value of computerland at 500 million 
the ruling is the longoverdue culmination of an unnecessary 
legal battle hafif said he said computerland is now prospering 
after some tough times with new management and continued 
operation of a chain of 500 computer stores 
millards lawyer shirley hufstedler declined comment on the 
ruling saying she had not seen it 
in appealing the jury verdict millard argued that the 
stockconversion feature of the original 250000 loan applied only 
to his original computer company called ims which allegedly went 
out of existence after a merger 
he also said he had agreed orally with one of the original 
lenders that the note and stock option would not be transferred to 
anyone without millards consent 
the appeals court said millard did not make those arguments 
during the trial and also said the evidence was to the contrary 
not only did ims evidently remain in existence merrill said but 
the loan applied to any of millards computer businesses including 
the laterformed computerland he also said the written loan 
agreement presumably the best evidence of the parties intentions 
made no reference to any restrictions on transfers and indicated 
the loan could be assigned 
the court also rejected millards argument that microvest should 
be denied any reward because it was allegedly a sham corporation 
formed for the purposes of prosecuting a lawsuit 
the individuals who paid to be a part of microvest were 
investing in the anticipated ownership of the various corporations 
in which they believed the conversion option gave microvest a 20 
percent ownership interest merrill said this is not the same 
thing as selling shares in litigation

the governments chief economic forecasting gauge edged down 02 
percent in november continuing a seesaw pattern that analysts said 
portends a slowdown but no recession in 1989 
the commerce departments report friday on its index of leading 
economic indicators was viewed as good news by some experts who 
said it should ease fears that the economy was growing at a pace 
that threatened new inflation 
the 02 percent november decline was the fourth drop in the past 
seven months since may the index has alternated between gains and 
declines showing very little forward momentum and suggesting 
overall economic growth will slow significantly in 1989 
in another signal of slower growth the government reported 
friday that sales of new homes fell by 8 percent in november the 
biggest decline in 18 months analysts blamed the setback on rising 
mortgage rates likely to further dampen sales in 1989 
the last government numbers of 1988 had little or no influence 
over the financial markets which closed out the final trading day 
of the year with mixed results in light trading 
bond prices rose slightly the dollar weakened marginally against 
key currencies and the dow jones industrial average fell 1411 
points to close at 216857 though advancing issues slightly 
outnumbered declines on the new york stock exchange 
the reagan administration said the setback in the leading index 
was nothing to become alarmed over showing only that the economy 
was slowing a bit the traditional signal for a recession in the 
past has been at least three consecutive monthly declines in the 
index 
private analysts agreed forecasting that overall economic 
growth as measured by the gross national product will probably dip 
to around 25 percent in 1989 that would be down from an expected 
growth rate of 39 percent in 1988 the economys best performance 
in four years
