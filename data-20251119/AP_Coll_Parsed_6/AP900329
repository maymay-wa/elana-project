colorados governor on thursday urged the energy 
department not to reopen rocky flats until it has solved a safety 
problem that left the nuclear weapons plants air ducts clogged 
with 62 pounds of plutonium 
the amount of lost plutonium a deadly carcinogenic poison 
stunned environmentalists monitoring the plant northeast of denver 
rocky flats was shut down by the department of energy late last 
year because of safety and management problems 
i have some comfort that the plant now is shut down gov 
roy romer said thursday and it should not be restarted unless 
they cure this problem the buildup of plutonium in ductwork has 
been known since last summer and the state of colorado has been 
urging doe to take strong action to correct the problem 
doe spokesman pat etchart said late thursday that the department 
will address romers concerns were going to continue to 
evaluate this data 
he said it did not appear the issue would affect the plants 
plutonium processing operations scheduled to resume in june but 
that would be decided as part of the continuing evaluation 
a doe official said wednesday that crews might not finish 
cleaning up the plutoniumclogged air ducts before opening 
i dont know if all the activity will be completed prior to 
restart but if there are any safety questions the energy 
secretary wont order restart catherine kaliniak a department 
of energy spokeswoman said wednesday 
but an environmentalist who has been monitoring the situation 
for the governor says news of the amount of plutonium contamination 
illustrates the need for a review of safeguards against an 
explosion at the plant 
if enough plutonium gathers in one spot it can reach 
criticality the point a nuclear chain reaction could take place 
plant officials have said the amount in the ducts does not threaten 
an accidental chain reaction 
melinda kassen an attorney for the boulderbased environmental 
defense fund had raised questions as a member of gov roy romers 
rocky flats monitoring council about the amount of plutonium in the 
air ducts 
operations should not be restarted until they can make sure 
theyre not going to have those releases in the future ms 
kassen said 
egampg inc the wellesley massbased contractor that operates 
the plant for the federal government gave her the figure of 28 
kilograms or 62 pounds on wednesday that amount is enough to 
build six to seven nuclear bombs but officials said it did not 
pose a threat to workers or residents 
we think the figure of 28 kilograms is pretty solid said 
bill heimbach an egampg spokesman we have a lot more measurements 
to do before we can restart 
egampg had been studying the matter since federal inspectors 
estimated in october that up to 15 kilograms or 33 pounds may be 
in the 4000 feet of glovebox exhaust ducts at the nations only 
plant for making plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
technicians handle the deadly radioactive material with gloves 
attached to arm coverings in sealed gloveboxes 
last fall federal inspectors said employees did not maintain 
air filters in the gloveboxes that could have allowed plutonium 
dust to escape into the air ducts the inspectors theorized 
rocky flats the only plant that makes plutonium triggers is 
the target of a criminal probe into allegations of illegal 
hazardous waste handling a federal grand jury has been convened to 
consider evidence gathered in a raid at the plant last june 7 but 
no charges have been handed up 
federal investigators have found a variety of safety and 
management problems at the 16 major facilities in 12 states 
involved in making nuclear weapons and some have led to production 
shutdowns and interruptions 
the problems include a lawsuit by ohio residents who say they 
were harmed by radioactive spills from the fernald plant near 
cincinnati poor training of safety inspectors at the hanford 
nuclear reservation near richland wash and the savannah river 
site near aiken sc and inadequate fire protection at savannah 
river

a sort of purplishpink mauve officials hope 
will soothe tempers and blunt aggression has been painted on the 
walls of the polk county jails new booking area 
if it reduces aggression fine said sheriff lawrence w 
crow jr if it has an opposite effect then we would consider 
changing but we feel like it will work well 
crow said tuesday the length of time the color affects inmates 
waiting to be booked may not be long some studies suggest only 
about 30 minutes he said 
several jails have tried this in their bookin area crow 
said i have read about it in publications and it seemed to be 
working well where they have tried it 
psychologist dr joyce brothers however is doubtful the color 
will produce the desired effect 
most people are so emotional when they are booked in whether 
they are guilty or innocent i dont think the background color 
could make that much of a difference she said in a telephone

a lithuanianborn tavern owner is so 
upset about his compatriots quest for freedom that he changed the 
name of his popular downtown haunt from russian lady to lithuanian 
lady 
it may not affect much but whatever i can do is important 
said john rimscha who came to the united states in 1955 
rimscha on tuesday had the name painted over the bars facade 
and ordered his staff to pour the bars russian vodka down the 
drain he did the same thing in 1983 when a soviet fighter shot 
down korean air lines flight 007 then he changed the bars name 
to american lady to protest the incident 
rimscha 46 said the taverns new name will stay at least until 
lithuanians obtain their independence an event hes sure will 
occur 
how could they possibly not succeed he said they are 
such determined people theyve been fighting for the last 50 years 
for their freedom 
he said when that happens hell consider returing his bar to 
its original name but its more than likely that ill stay with 
the lithuanian lady since im of lithuanian descent

nasa technicians have removed the 
last experiment from a scientific satellite that was rescued in 
january after nearly six years in space and survived far better 
than expected 
it really looks like brand new said william kinard chief 
scientist for the long duration exposure facility or ldef 
the surprising thing to us is although there was a lot of 
weathering apparent on the outside most of that weathering was 
really only skindeep he said wednesday a day after the last 
experiment tray was removed 
the satellites condition is so good in fact it demonstrates 
longlasting space facilities such as the freedom manned space 
station are feasible kinard said 
the proposed space station has come under attack in recent weeks 
because of a johnson space center study that concludes an unusually 
high number of astronaut spacewalks would be needed for 
maintenance by the time its completed and manned in 1999 the 
space station is expected to cost more than 30 billion 
it ldef certainly gives you a great deal of confidence in 
the ability to build things like space station and any spacecraft 
that has to function for a long period of time kinard said 
with reasonable care theres no reason why you cant get 
extremely long lifetimes 
the laboratory was placed in orbit in april 1984 for an expected 
10 months because of delays however the satellite was not 
retrieved until january when astronauts aboard the shuttle 
columbia snared it 200 miles out in space 
it is the longest time a spacecraft has been in space before 
being retrieved for study 
barring a rescue the 15 million to 18 million laboratory 
would have come crashing down through the atmosphere right about 
now and all 57 scientific experiments attached to its exterior 
would have been lost if not for gravity the structure could have 
lasted many more years in space although some of the experiments 
may have decayed kinard said 
none of the experiments were lost as a result of the satellites 
unexpectedly long stay in space some even were enhanced because of 
the additional exposure kinard said 
most of the experimental trays have been returned to their 
principal investigators for further analysis including one 
involving 125 million tomato seeds the seeds were sent into space 
for eventual planting by school students 
those seeds currently are being distributed to schools around 
the country so students can monitor the growth process and report 
the findings to nasa 
now that ldef is empty technicians plan to spend the next few 
weeks inspecting the 8000pound aluminum shell then pack it for 
storage at kennedy space center the laboratory was designed to be 
reusable and could venture into space again kinard said 
it is worth keeping he said

a mysterious skin disorder that has 
children in two states scratching the skin off their arms has 
prompted school closings and protests from frustrated parents 
officials said 
the rash which varies from a minor skin irritation to inflamed 
bumps has appeared on the necks arms and backs of students in 
jackson and doddridge counties in west virginia and in mcdowell 
ky officials said wednesday 
were looking for a pattern and we cant establish one said 
loretta haddy an epidemiologist with the west virginia department 
of health unless it really starts getting out of control were 
just assuming its a viral rash 
teacher brenda hamilton of mcdowell where dozens of students 
suffered rashes said the childrens skin looked like theyd been 
scalded with water 
children were literally scratching the skin off their arms 
said james bennett school superintendent in doddridge county in 
northcentral west virginia 
at gilmore elementary school in sandyville in westcentral west 
virginia 50 students reported suffering from the rash according 
to schools superintendent cl staats 
jackson county health department and private doctors who 
examined the children gave different diagnoses staats said 
some said the rash was fifth disease a minor childhood skin 
disorder others classified it as contact dermatitis 
the centers for disease control in atlanta tested blood samples 
taken from the kentucky youths and ruled out fifth disease the 
health officials said last week 
jackson and doddridge counties are not adjacent to each other 
neither is adjacent to mcdowell in eastern kentucky near the west 
virginia border 
parents kept more than 450 elementary and high school students 
home on tuesday in mcdowell and about 40 people held a protest 
over officials inability to identify the rash which first 
appeared in the small town march 12 
protest leader brenda cook 34 said parents were afraid because 
no one knew anything about the rash or its longterm effect she 
said they wanted the school closed until the problem has been 
identified 
its something in the air or inside that school cook said 
jane bond a health adviser for the floyd county health 
department said its upsetting the parents but we really dont 
have any answers for them yet 
examinations in west virginia showed no pattern and gave no 
indication the school environment was causing the rash said herb 
loy director of immunization for the west virginia department of 
health 
gilmore elementary school was closed friday so that biological 
and environmental testing could be done to see if the school was 
causing the problem staats said 
it is expected to remain closed for at least two weeks pending 
the release of the test results he said 
in doddridge county officials said 20 fourthgraders at big 
isaac elementary school broke out in rashes in january and february 
most of the children are back to normal but have been moved to 
the school gymnasium to isolate them from others bennett said

hundreds of chanting aids activists besieged 
the state capitol on wednesday wrapping parts of the historic 
building in red tape and chanting slogans police arrested 80 
people 
the demonstrators blocked entrances to the capitol and marched 
through the hallways to preselected areas where they fell to the 
floor or otherwise disrupted government operations 
police dragged dozens of demonstrators away to waiting paddy 
wagons some had handcuffed themselves together and police used 
boltcutters to separate them 
by the time police escorted the last demonstrator into a waiting 
bus wednesday evening there were 80 arrests most were charged 
with disorderly conduct said said thomas tubbs spokesman for the 
state office of general services 
one man was charged with harrassment for pushing a police 
officer and a woman was charged with criminal mischief for 
spraypainting slogans on the capitol steps tubbs said 
no police were injured one arrested demonstrator was treated at 
a hospital for a head injury and released tubbs said 
earlier members of the new york citybased aids coalition to 
unleash power or act up picketed the executive mansion they 
shouted down gov mario cuomo when he tried to speak to them 
were closing down this capitol walter kawandler of new 
york city said as he and about two dozen others sprawled on the 
floor outside the state senate chamber and wrapped themselves in 
more red tape 
the aids activists are seeking among other things more state 
money for aids treatment and prevention programs they used yards 
and yards of the red tape to protest what they said was a 
slowmoving government bureaucracy in the face of aids deaths said 
act ups leslie feinberg 
outside the capitol demonstrators banged drums loudly and 
splattered red paint on marble steps they taunted police 
chanting the whole world is watching as protesters were 
carried away several state troopers wore rubber gloves 
some state officials tried to carry on a normal day amid the 
chaos the assembly and senate met behind heavily guarded doors 
tour guides led groups of schoolchildren through the hallways 
the demonstration began shortly before noon outside cuomos 
stateowned mansion several blocks from the capitol there were 
about 700 people involved said albany police chief john dale 
at one point democrat cuomo stepped outside to speak with the 
protesters saying they should ask republican legislators to help 
raise taxes to pay for new aids programs 
i asked you to prod the whole system said cuomo im not 
the only one in the system to be objective you have to prod the 
whole system 
cuomos comments were soon drowned out by activists chanting 
programs not promises and shame shame shame 
the governor eventually left 
the state has budgeted 200 million for aids programs as part of 
the current state budget cuomo has proposed raising that to 266 
million for the fiscal year that begins sunday

dar robinson was one of the greatest stunt 
men of all time actor danny glover told a jury in a lawsuit 
stemming from robinsons death when a stunt went wrong in the 
arizona desert 
glover who saw robinson work his stunt magic in the film 
lethal weapon was called as a witness wednesday by attorney 
jerry kroll who represents robinsons family in a 
multimilliondollar suit against dino de laurentis entertainment 
group and productions ltd 
kroll maintains that robinson died because an ambulance was 
unavailable at the remote desert location where he had a motorcycle 
accident while filming million dollar mystery in 1986 
deg and productions ltd maintain there was no ambulance on the 
set because robinson felt it was bad luck and an insult to his 
stunt abilities to have one around 
but glover who referred to robinson as one of the greatest 
stunt men ever testified that an ambulance and fire engines were 
present when robinson executed a dangerous stunt on the set of 
lethal weapon earlier in 1986

congress favors limiting production of the b2 
bomber says a senator who predicts that recent estimates of 155 
billion to buy and operate the stealth aircraft will cause 
sticker stupefaction 
i think the consensus for capping production is there this 
year whether its there to terminate the program is too early to 
say sen william cohen rmaine said wednesday of the 
radarevading plane 
cohen spoke at a news conference where the union of concerned 
scientists released a report that questioned the mission of the 
stealth bomber and air force estimates on its cost 
the service has said its planned fleet of 132 bombers will cost 
slightly more than 70 billion but the science group which is 
frequently critical of pentagon programs said the price of the 
plane more than doubles if operation and maintenance costs are 
included 
the b2 force would probably cost in the neighborhood of 155 
billion or more to acquire operate and support for 25 years 
said the groups report 
cohen said figures reported by the union of concerned scientists 
will not simply be sticker shock but perhaps even sticker 
stupefaction 
michael brower author of the report said the expense of fuel 
spares personnel tanker aircraft and other items significantly 
increases the cost of the radarevading plane 
we do not see a compelling need for the b2 bomber brower 
said its major missions that have been announced are either not 
credible or they can be handled more cheaply by other types of 
weapons such as airlaunched cruise missiles 
air force secretary donald rice said recently that the purchase 
cost of the b2 bomber probably will be closer to 75 billion when 
inflation is included in addition the service has said it will 
need more than 1 billion for special climatecontrol hangars for 
the planes 
cohen a member of the senate armed services committee who last 
year voted to terminate the b2 program said support among his 
colleagues for the batwinged plane is decreasing 
im not sure the votes are there to terminate the program but 
i think there is an emerging concern that has been expressed to me 
by other members of the armed services committee about the cost and 
indeed the mission cohen said 
in the house rep john kasich rohio said this week he has 
obtained at least 130 cosponsors for an amendment that would 
terminate the b2 program 
priced at more than 530 million a copy the bomber is 
considered the most expensive plane in history members of congress 
expressed shock over the cost last year and withheld funds for one 
less plane than the pentagon sought in the current defense budget 
in the 307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 president 
bush has proposed spending 55 billion for five b2 bombers

blackened prewar factory buildings where outdated trabant cars are 
built and says it can only get better 
i may well wind up unemployed for a time but thats not the 
end of the world says the 47yearold forklift driver one of 
11500 workers at the plant ill just have to look around we 
wont starve 
optimism prevails at the sachsenring plant even though many of 
its workers are likely to lose their jobs they are looking forward 
to the promise of westernstyle prosperity once germany is united 
in a freemarket economy 
volkswagen west germanys largest car maker has signed a 
nearly 3 billion deal to build models for the western market at 
the plant which dates back to 1904 and uses virtually no 
automation 
modernization will mean layoffs in a workforce accustomed to 
making the trabant a plasticbody compact of 1957 vintage with a 
sputtering twocylinder engine 
at the same time chassis welding foreman dieter blank says 
approaching capitalism has already raised morale and removed some 
notorious aspects of the stateplanned economy 
we had considerable problems with discipline in the past but 
theyve drastically gone down says blank 39 
right now all of us are fighting for our jobs the workers 
know that vw will only pick the best 
trabants became a symbol of freedom last summer when east 
germans drove them through hungary to the west in an exodus that 
helped trigger last falls democratic changes now the trabi 
seems more like an inescapable reminder of the past 
blank says the mood is hopeful after the conservative victory in 
east germanys free elections march 18 
the winning threeparty alliance heavily backed by the 
conservative bonn government has promised quick union with rich 
west germany 
the conservatives did especially well in east germanys southern 
industrial areas of thuringia and saxony where zwickau is located 
west german flags waving from the windows of the citys aging 
apartment buildings show which way the wind is blowing 
but as west german companies rush to get a foothold in the 
eastern market trabant workers realize their economys immediate 
future is uncertain 
my friends and i expect a dry spell of 23 years says 
engineer dieter hildesheim 35 then things will look up again 
sales of the little car are plummeting because east germans are 
waiting for economic union with west germany planned by this 
summer so they can buy a car of their choice 
volkswagen production is expected to reach full steam only in 
1994 so sachsenring hopes its revamped trabant with a vw engine 
will sell in eastern europe and canada in the meantime 
its a far cry from east germanys closed market last year 
which buyers faced waits of 15 years or more for a trabi and the 
plant advertised 700 openings 
trabis now are available for immediate delivery the giant job 
notice board at a plant entrance is conspicuously empty 
dieter voigt chief of the state vehicle building conglomerate 
ifa has said up to 70 percent of the workers in the automotive and 
supply industries about 100000 people could lose their jobs in 
the switch to a freemarket economy 
guenter noetzold an economist at leipzig university predicts 2 
million east germans a quarter of the labor force will be jobless 
for a limited period 
but blank who has a wife and two children is convinced east 
germans will find enough work in rebuilding their land after 
decades of neglect 
because of the mess for example in road and housing 
construction there will be jobs he says 
however some zwickau residents do not hide their bitterness and 
sense of helplessness 
henry hofmann a lifetime employee knows hell be among 5000 
sachsenring employees volkswagen is expected to dump 
the 33yearold engineer is in charge of making the trabants 
hard plastic body panels well all have to search for new 
jobs he says of his shop 
but he adds im not looking yet what would be secure now 
state planners decided on plastic for the trabants body because 
it was cheaper than metal and postwar projects like housing and 
social programs had priority 
until the end east berlin refused to invest in overhauling the 
trabi leaving it just another doomed relic when change swept 
eastern europe 
we were told no funds available hofmann says

another new nixon emerges from richard nixons 
new book at 77 a man at peace with himself who says that despite 
the ordeals and crises i can look back and say that the day has 
indeed been splendid 
nixon still has the media to kick around too often they 
shoot first and literally ask questions later he says adding 
that watergate has elevated peeping tom journalism and character 
assassination to a new level of respectability 
still instead of an enemies list nixon prints a list of his 
friends among journalists and says i could not possibly have 
gone as far as i did in the political arena without having the 
benefit of some balanced as well as negative coverage 
in the arena his seventh book since leaving the presidency 
is his most personal 
in the end what matters is that you have always lived life to 
the hilt he writes i have won some great victories and 
suffered some devastating defeats but win or lose i feel 
fortunate to have come to that time in life when i can finally 
enjoy what my quaker grandmother would have called peace at the 
center 
the book sums up a lifetime of victories defeats and comebacks 
almost dropped as the republican vice presidential candidate in 
1952 because of questions about a slush fund he saved himself 
with an emotional television address in 1960 he was defeated for 
the presidency by john kennedy in an election that he says his 
wife pat still thinks was stolen from him 
two years later he ran for governor of california against pats 
advice she was right nixon says and bitterly announced his 
retirement from politics only to bounce back in 1968 to finally 
win the presidency 
but his second term was spoiled by scandal midway he resigned 
a tape recording showed that he had tried to cover up white house 
involvement in the watergate breakin at democratic headquarters 
and impeachment appeared certain 
nixon offers his standard defense on watergate that he was 
held to a higher standard than others 
all administrations have sought to protect themselves from the 
political fallout of scandals he writes the breakin at 
democratic headquarters and the coverup were illegal but not 
unusual in political campaigns 
other presidents he adds taped private conversations and 
suffered no rebuke for it 
and most people and other presidents used foul language he 
says but since neither i nor most other presidents had ever used 
profanity in public people were shocked when he released the 
white house tape transcripts and all its notations of expletive 
deleted especially when the expletives were subsequently 
published 
nixon says that despite his spats with the press you wont 
have nixon to kick around any more he told reporters after the 
gubernatorial defeat in 1962 he has had good relations with many 
journalists 
he lists 73 of them by name but leaves some others out since 
being considered fair on nixon by nixon would almost certainly put 
them in dutch with their colleagues 
to make his case that he was judged by a higher standard than 
other presidents nixon writes that some of my critics said he 
should have paid to take his dog on air force one flights to 
vacations in florida and california 
he recalls incidents involving dogs owned by franklin d 
roosevelt and lyndon d johnson 
when roosevelts dog fala supposedly rode on a destroyer it 
was a good laugh he writes when johnsons dog rode on a 
plane it was what everyone the dog included expected when 
nixons dog rode on a plane it was a crime for not reporting the 
air fare as income even though the animal did not take up a seat

the nation should put more money into research 
on aging so americans can enjoy a healthy senior boom when the 
baby boom generation gets older an advocacy group said today 
serious gaps in research are placing the successful aging and 
independence of older americans at risk the alliance for aging 
research reported 
the alliance which is supported by businesses and foundations 
said the nation is pouring increasing amounts of money into sick 
care for older americans while it fails to adequately finance 
research to help the elderly stay healthy 
compared to the health care costs attributed to older 
americans there is a wide and growing gap in our commitment to 
find cures and preventions the group said in a report 
it said that as the baby boom generation turns into the senior 
boom in the next century older americans will account for 
onehalf of a health care bill approaching 2 trillion a year 
the alliance called for spending 1 billion a year on research 
to help prevent postpone or cure chronic conditions that affect 
older americans this would require a 600 millionayear increase 
in research on aging and would bring research funding on aging up 
to par with that for other major health concerns such as cancer 
aids and heart research it said 
the successes in health and medicine in the 20th century have 
primarily saved lives in youth and middle age the report said 
advances affecting the cure and prevention of chronic illnesses 
in late life have been few 
americans age 65 and older represent more than 12 percent of the 
population and the oldestold those 85 and older represent the 
fastestgrowing segment of the population by the year 2020 the 
over65 population is expected to more than double to more than 65 
million the report said

cancer cells have been killed in the 
test tube by sabotaging their genetic machinery an early step in 
what could someday become a new form of therapy a researcher says 
scientists used a molecule that latched onto a key substance in 
cancer cells preventing a crucial gene from relaying its orders to 
the cells 
the research is among early work in the socalled antisense 
strategy that seeks to block the effect of particular genes in 
cancer cells 
the new results were described wednesday at an american cancer 
society science writers seminar by dr john reed of the university 
of pennsylvania in philadelphia 
his work was in lymphomas cancers of the bodys lymph tissues 
that strike more than 40000 americans a year lymph tissues play 
an important role in fighting infections 
reed focused on a gene called bcl2 it is activated for limited 
periods in some normal cells when the bodys diseasefighting 
immune system gears up 
but at some point very early in the transformation of a normal 
cell to a lymphoma the bcl2 gene tends to become overactive reed 
said 
that occurs in about half of lymphomas as well as maybe 5 
percent to 10 percent of leukemias reed said it results from a 
breaking and defective rejoining of chromosomes the threadlike 
structures that carry genes he said 
the normal function of the bcl2 gene is not known reed said 
like other genes bcl2 relays its orders to the cell by sending a 
sort of morse code message in chemical messengers called 
ribonucleic acids 
reeds experiment involved invading lymphoma cells with a 
substance that seeks out and binds this messenger stopping its 
function 
that killed lymphoma cells in the test tube showing that the 
bcl2 gene plays a key role in lymphoma cell survival reed said 
he cautioned that any therapeutic use is many years away and 
must overcome some significant hurdles one is that a single dose 
of the messengerbinding substance would now cost about 100000 
he said 
future developments might produce a binding substance that 
clings to abnormal genetic material associated with an overactive 
bcl2 rather than the messenger he said 
that could keep therapy from harming normal cells in which bcl2 
happened to be switched on he said 
another step toward that goal would be developing binding 
substances that seek out an abnormal form of the bcl2 messenger 
that frequently appears in lymphoma cells he said 
dr john laszlo the cancer societys senior vice president for 
research called the work fascinating reeds early successes are 
very exciting he said

a new study concludes that airline 
deregulation has brought higher fares more danger and less 
service and recommends a federal commission to regulate all modes 
of transportation 
the report published wednesday by the liberal economic policy 
institute called for price setting within a range that would 
prevent airlines from overcharging in thin markets or undercharging 
to drive out competitors on heavily traveled routes 
the study called for airlines to be limited to one hub operation 
to avoid a system that its author paul stephen dempsey said has 
destroyed the inherent advantages of the air transport system 
dempsey said it is cheaper to take a taxi from kansas city to 
st louis than to fly at full fare and that many flights take much 
longer than they did several years ago because so many pass through 
hub airports 
the time has come to reconsider the experiment of airline 
deregulation said dempsey a university of denver professor who 
supported deregulation in the late 1970s when he was a lawyer for 
the nowdefunct civil aeronautics board 
dempseys study challenged reports by the transportation 
department and the airline industry that hail deregulation as a 
boon to travelers 
the phenomenon of jet lag has been replaced by the phenomenon 
of hub lag said dempsey he referred to the formation of hub 
airports where a single airline dominates flights decreasing 
competition and increasing fares on some routes 
the report said deregulation has increased airlines fares for 
the average traveler by 26 cents per mile over prices they likely 
would be paying without it the cost per trip may be as much as 33 
percent higher and is likely to take longer dempsey said at a news 
conference releasing the study flying blind the failure of 
airline deregulation 
the crux of the reports economic conclusion is that airline 
ticket prices had been declining for several years before 
deregulation but the decline slowed after the government stopped 
regulating fares 
federal aviation administrator james b busey responding to a 
question about dempseys report at a separate news conference 
wednesday said deregulation has provided increased access to the 
air traffic system for millions of americans 
he said the us system is the safest in the world 
if people are upset about the rates theyre paying then 
demand is going to control that busey said encouraging 
competition in a deregulated market is the best way to lower 
rates 
the institute study says that of the 514 nonhub communities 
with air service before deregulation 312 have suffered declines in 
flight frequency while 143 lost all service 
the institute study says complaints filed against us airlines 
skyrocketed from 7326 in 1983 to 40985 in 1987 and cited a poll 
of pilots that said 97 percent believe deregulation has made flying 
more dangerous 
it also said the number of nearcollisions soared from 311 in 
1982 to 1058 in 1987 that the average age of pilots has decreased 
while the age of planes has gone up and that spending for 
maintenance has declined 
dempsey acknowledged that fatalities and accidents have 
declined but he credited that to safety improvements by 
manufacturers rather than airlines which he said are treating 
their aircraft worse not better

us officials are facing resistance to 
placement of sophisticated bombdetection devices in foreign and 
american airports and the head of the federal aviation 
administration says hes frustrated by the delays 
agreement to install one of the 1 million thermo neutron 
analysis or tna devices at londons gatwick airport will be 
announced soon faa administrator james b busey said wednesday 
but he said negotiations have been delayed by sovereignty and 
other issues at frankfurt west germany and by insurance questions 
at washington dulles international airport 
im very frustrated that we have not been able to get the 
original six machines in place busey told reporters we are 
experiencing more difficulties than anticipated 
only new yorks kennedy international airport and miami 
international airport have the machines under a program stepped up 
after the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people 
in west germany negotiators are going through a long 
structured process that will include a trip by german authorities 
to the united states next month to test their own explosives on tna 
devices at us airports busey said 
an installation in the philippines is tied up in diplomatic 
negotiations he said 
the dulles talks are in their final stages busey said adding 
that he wants to put the equipment in a public area where it can be 
seen the bulky machines generally are expected to be in luggage 
areas out of public view 
earlier plans to place two of the first six devices at the san 
francisco and detroit airports were scrapped because the faa the 
airports and the airlines failed to agree on an arrangement said 
faa spokesman fred farrar 
the tna devices emit a neutron cloud over checked bags that 
interact with the contents and allow the machine to analyze 
characteristic gamma rays emitted by various explosives including 
plastic that cannot be detected by the xray machines now common in 
airports 
the government had set the goal of installing 40 of the machines 
at highrisk airports around the world by the end of the year us 
airlines are to pay the cost of all but the first six which are 
being purchased by the faa 
farrar said three of the units have been built one is near 
completion and the other two are on order from science applications 
international corp of san diego 
hundreds more tna or comparable units would be installed in a 
second phase with the largest airports having 20 or more machines 
to handle all baggage 
airlines have objected to government directives that force them 
to pay for and install the detectors before the technology has been 
adequately tested in airport operations they say the devices are 
needed primarily because of the terrorist threat against the us 
government not against individual carriers 
busey said he intends to keep the pressure on airports and 
airlines to place the expensive machines and is not yet prepared to 
cut back on the timetable for installation but will if necessary 
he said that as more tna devices are put into use they should 
become more efficient and less expensive

cutting taxes on capital gains eventually 
would produce an economic boost equal to all current federal 
spending for education job training and social services the bush 
administration is telling congress 
over the next five years the presidents proposal would 
raise gross national product by roughly 60 billion over the next 
10 years by roughly 280 billion michael j boskin chairman of 
the council of economic advisers said wednesday 
increases in gnp represents new jobs better opportunities and 
better standards of living for americans the presidential 
adviser told the senate finance committee by the year 2000 he 
said the economic growth would be equal to all current private 
spending for basic research 
boskin and treasury department officials told the committee that 
reducing capital gains taxes would generate more revenue than it 
would lose analysts for the joint committee on taxation and the 
library of congress disputed that point 
a cut in the tax on capital gains the profit on the sale of 
investments is at the top of president bushs legislative agenda 
he contends that taxing capital gains at lower rates than apply to 
wages would boost investment and allow us companies to be more 
competitive with foreigners 
democratic leaders in congress oppose a cut on grounds it would 
worsen the budget deficit and produce a huge tax cut for 
highincome americans with no assurance the economy would benefit 
at all 
the senate committee failed to get a consensus from 
nongovernment witnesses wednesday for example 
tax lawyers n jerold cohen of atlanta and david g glickman of 
dallas said a lower rate for capital gains violates all goals of 
sound tax policy it is difficult to convince the wage earner 
who has income of 50000 that he should be taxed at a much higher 
rate than the trader who earns 50000 speculating in the market 
mark bloomfield president of american council for capital 
formation the business organization leading the fight for a 
capital gains reduction called the cut essential to a high 
sustained rate of investment that investment he said is the 
only way our highwage economy can restore the productivity growth 
that allows us to compete with lowwage industrial nations around 
the world 
alan j auerbach chairman of the economics department at the 
university of pennsylvania disputed the argument that a capital 
gains cut would so spur the economy that it would generate more 
money that it would cost and nobody would lose in reality 
however there would be losers the taxpayers who would have to 
supply the lost revenue he said 
the capitalgains exclusion is about the most regressive tax 
proposal advanced with a straight face in my memory said 
economist henry j aaron of the brookings institution 
opposing capital gains on the grounds that the wealthy stand 
to benefit fails to answer the question of whether lower taxes 
is good public policy in revitalizing our economy said 
mitchell kertzman chairman of the american electronics association 
a preferential tax rate long enjoyed by capital gains was 
repealed in 1986 in a general overhaul of the tax law it was one 
of several special benefits eliminated in order to allow a sharp 
reduction in individual and corporate tax rates 
president bush contends it was a mistake to eliminate the 
capital gains preference the house approved a lower rate for 
capital gains last year over objections of democratic leaders but 
it was blocked in the senate 
bush wants to tax only 70 percent of gains from the sale of 
assets owned for more than three years with smaller incentives for 
property held for a shorter period

bean sprouts and other specialty crops are 
puny compared with the major commercial vegetables such as tomatoes 
and sweet corn but consumers are still adding exotic names to 
grocery shopping lists 
the agriculture department says about 125 million hundredweight 
of specialty vegetables reached us consumers in 1989 a 13 
percent increase from 1988 fresh herbs also have caught shoppers 
fancy 
supplies from domestically grown crops rose 10 percent to 93 
million hundredweight while imports increased 24 percent to 32 
million hundredweight according to a report by the departments 
economic research service 
imported specialties are often vegetables that are common in 
foreign countries such as jicama which is a widely eaten root 
crop in mexico the report said imports also include crops 
that a relatively uncommon but which are receiving new promotional 
efforts 
fancy lettuces make up most of the specialty category and those 
supplies generally increased last year for example domestic 
romaine lettuce increased 16 percent while imported shipments were 
up 76 percent however escarole and endive mostly from florida 
were down 
domestic shipments of various oriental vegetables including 
daikon and bean sprouts increased 23 percent in 1989 while 
imports soared 333 percent the report said 
even with the sharp percentage increases the total for specialty 
vegetables 125 million hundredweight was relatively small 
compared with the 1989 output of fresh market vegetables those 
were estimated at 255 million hundredweight up 2 percent not 
counting potatoes 
another consumer surge has occurred with fresh herbs used by 
home cooks and the food service industry 
the 1987 census of agriculture shows dramatic increases in 
us herb production the report said production includes older 
standby such as garlic parsley watercress dill oil ginger root 
and mint oil 
also the 1987 figures included production of an aggregate 
category for miscellaneous fresh herbs such as basil cilantro 
and rosemary those increased to 98 million pounds from 21 
million pounds reported in 1978 
the harvested acreage of garlic which is concentrated in 
california declined slightly in 1987 from earlier census 
tabulations made in 1978 and 1982 however the number of farms 
producing garlic increased to 448 from those earlier years 
the increase in farms but not acreage may reflect a surge in 
the number of small farmers producing garlic for farmers markets 
country fairs and other directmarketing outlets the report said 
farms producing parsley have increased steadily since 1978 and 
are located mostly in california florida and new jersey

washington ap an agriculture department report says fish 
farming aquaculture is young but growing rapidly into a major 
provider of food for an expanding world population 
the 1990s should be an important decade for growth the 
report said wednesday world population grains and limits on wild 
catch from the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture 
products 
aquaculture refers to commercial production of a wide variety of 
fish shellfish and seafood products it includes baitfish 
hatchery operations and the stocking of fish farms 
if us seafood consumption continues to grow the rise in 
demand will likely be met through increased imports and higher 
domestic aquacultural production the report said 
fish farmers and other aquacultural producers have an 
advantage over capture fisheries in that production can rise 
without endangering future supplies 
catfish are the leading species grown commercially in the united 
states production in 1989 rose 16 percent in volume to 342 million 
pounds delivered by farmers the report said 
overall including the wild catch catfish ranked fourth in 1988 
behind pollock salmon and cod and may have moved into third place 
ahead of cod in 1989 the report said 
prices paid to catfish farmers last year averaged 72 cents a 
pound down 6 percent from 1988 because of the larger supply and 
lower prices paid by processors for large fish 
but catfish prices have risen since october and by february had 
reached 75 cents a pound the report said also growers have 
formed a bargaining association that has negotiated prices with 
many processors for the first half of 1990 
the most recent survey of trout growers showed a decrease in the 
number of producers to 478 in 1989 from 518 in 1988 however sales 
of trout and trout eggs rose to 726 million from 664 million in 
1988 
domestically grown farm salmon output was estimated at nine 
million to 10 million pounds in 1989 a sharp increase from six 
million pounds in 1988 the gain was attributed to larger output on 
both the east and west coasts 
oyster production has increased in the northwest while disease 
problems reduced oyster harvesting in the chesapeake bay formerly 
the largest producing area the report said 
pacific coast oyster production grew from 67 million pounds of 
meat with a value of 56 million in 1980 to eight million pounds 
valued at 145 million in 1988 the most recent figures available

the defense kept former national security 
adviser john m poindexter off the witness stand at his irancontra 
trial to keep him from putting the noose around his own neck 
one legal observer says 
having poindexter testify would have risked destroying any 
doubts about the prosecutors case planted by defense attorney 
richard beckler said georgetown university law professor paul 
rothstein 
prosecutor dan webb would have asked did reagan ever 
authorize you to lie to congress poindexter would probably have 
to say no rothstein said 
he would hit every one of those points where a seed of doubt 
has been laid and the last thing the jury would hear is poindexter 
putting the noose around his own neck rothstein said 
the general rule among whitecollar criminal defense lawyers is 
to put the defendant on the witness stand experts say 
acquittals are very rare when a defendant does not take the 
stand said rothstein who has attended poindexters irancontra 
coverup trial 
the defense rested its case on tuesday and final arguments are 
scheduled for friday in us district court 
beckler asked tuesday why he did not call poindexter to the 
stand said because i dont believe the government proved its 
case 
rothstein said when a defendant does not take the stand the 
jury supposes you are covering up something even though the 
judge instructs ther panel not to hold the accuseds silence 
against him 
poindexter avoided what observers agree would have been 
withering crossexamination by webb who hammered away at former 
white house aide oliver l north for 3 days 
the decision probably focused on the question of were there 
any facts he could clarify or bring to the table that werent 
already there said e lawrence barcella a prominent defense 
lawyer in washington or were you just going to give a very good 
lawyer an opportunity to crossexamine him 
generally the accused would be expected to testify if youve 
got a case where the only person who can explain things is the 
defendant barcella said but here you have all kinds of people 
who were explaining the events 
poindexter is accused of conspiring to obstruct congressional 
inquiries into the irancontra affair by lying and destroying 
documents he also is accused of making false statements in 
meetings with lawmakers and in a letter to congress denying that 
north was secretly helping the nicaraguan contra rebels 
another danger poindexter avoids is the possibility of a perjury 
charge if he contradicted sworn testimony he gave congressional 
hearings about the irancontra affair in 1987 rothstein said 
poindexter told lawmakers he didnt tell president reagan about 
the diversion of usiran arms sale profits to the rebels 
poindexter testified then that he kept reagan in the dark to 
give the president credible deniability if the covert contra aid 
operation were exposed 
but rothstein said that version of events doesnt support 
poindexters contention that he had no motive to lie to congress 
because he acted with reagans authority and he would be courting 
a perjury charge if he provided a different explanation to the 
jury rothstein said 
the defense tried to show that a 1986 meeting with lawmakers at 
which poindexter is accused of lying was really a formal 
congressional proceeding to which the former national security 
adviser made false statements about the irancontra affair 
it raised the possibility that the document north said he saw 
poindexter tear up was not a politically embarrassing document 
signed by reagan that authorized us involvement in a 1985 
shipment of israeli hawk missiles to iran 
the defense also tried to suggest the document was superseded by 
two other documents reagan signed in 1986 to authorize usiran 
arms sales 
the defense had a lot of alternative explanations that raised 
doubts rothstein said 
all of these can coexist as long as poindexter doesnt take 
the stand he said but if poindexter took the stand he would 
have to commit himself to one of them

president bush takes about four times longer 
than john kennedy to fill his administrations top jobs but much 
of the delay is because of ethics laws snooping reporters and 
yes politics a presidential scholar says 
we find ourselves with a presidential appointment process 
that greatly complicates and elongates the change in policy 
directions that democratic elections are designed to permit g 
calvin mackenzie wrote in the april issue of government executive 
magazine 
procedural changes new legislation escalating media scrutiny 
and more complex politics have all slowed the appointment 
process said mackenzie a professor of government at colby 
college in waterville maine 
the bush administration has survived this process because it 
took over a friendly government and brought no great agenda for 
change said the author but the consequences of this new 
complexity would not have been viewed with such equanimity if a 
democrat had won in 1988 nor will they be so viewed in future 
transitions where the government changes hands from one party to 
another 
the time it takes to fill a position by presidential appointment 
and senate confirmation has lengthened steadily since the 
administration of president kennedy wrote mackenzie director of 
the presidential appointee project of the national academy of 
public administration 
after kennedys election in 1960 it took 238 months for the 
average appointee to a highranking job to be confirmed by the 
senate mackenzie wrote in bushs case it will be more than eight 
months 
figures for other presidents who entered the white house by 
election during the period were 339 months for nixon 455 months 
for carter and 530 months for reagan 
the figures were based on a study of 964 nominees during the 
five administrations covering more than half of the appointments 
to positions at the assistant secretary or deputy director level or 
above in departments and major agencies 
mackenzie said that the white house does not deserve all the 
blame it has received for the slowdown 
both the reagan and bush transitions have been slowed by the 
impact of the ethics in government act of 1978 and subsequent 
efforts to tighten even further the regulations of the actions and 
personal finances of executive branch officials he wrote 
the article said an increasing amount of time is taken up 
explaining the rules to potential appointees completing and 
reviewing financial disclosure forms and altering investment 
portfolios to avoid conflicts of interest 
chase untermeyer director of presidential personnel at the 
white house was described as believing that the attention to 
ethics was a principal cause of delay in making appointments 
early in 1989 
the article said staffing of the bush administration also took 
off much more slowly than reagans efforts in 1981 because bush 
chose not to have extensive personnel recruiting processes 
developed months in advance of his election as reagan and carter 
did

the thinner the better 
thats the conclusion of a study released today on us women 
and their risk of heart attack 
average weight is overweight when it comes to heart attack 
risk and being even mildly to moderately overweight substantially 
increases the risk in women said dr joann e manson who 
directed the study at bostons brigham and womens hospital 
in fact the study blames 40 percent of all heart disease among 
women on the consequences of being too heavy carrying just a 
little extra weight or even being average size makes people more 
vulnerable to heart trouble 
mansons findings were part of the nurses health study an 
eightyear review of 115886 healthy us women aged 30 to 55 the 
researchers divided the women into five weight categories and 
counted the number who had heart attacks or developed chest pain 
the results were published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
the leanest onefifth of the women in the study weighed in at 5 
percent or more below the 1983 metropolitan life insurance co 
tables of desirable weights a 5foot4 woman in this category 
weighed less than 125 pounds these slim women suffered the fewest 
heart attacks 
those considered in the tables to be average weight about 130 
pounds for a 5foot4 woman had 30 percent more heart disease 
than did the thinnest women 
mildly obese women fared substantially worse those who were 15 
percent to 29 percent above their desirable weights had 80 percent 
more heart disease and the heaviest women those 30 percent or 
more over their ideal weights had more than three times the lean 
womens risk 
putting on weight during middle age appears to be especially 
risky the study found that women who gained more than 20 pounds 
since age 18 doubled their risk of heart attacks 
although the report is not the first to suggest that being 
chubby is bad for the heart it suggests that the hazard may be 
greater than previously thought especially for women 
obesity is a major cause of heart attacks in us women 
said manson the risks of obesity have been underestimated and 
underappreciated 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal dr theodore b 
vanitallie of st lukesroosevelt hospital center in new york 
agreed that doctors have failed to take obesity seriously enough 
but because of the latest study he said any remaining 
confidence that some degree of obesity in women is safe is likely 
to be replaced by deep concern 
the study concludes that obesity is harmful to women largely 
because it increases blood pressure raises cholesterol levels and 
contributes to diabetes 
about 34 million us adults are considered to be obese because 
their weight is 20 percent or more above their desirable level 
whether fat is bad for mens hearts too is unclear because 
studies have produced conflicting results 
heart attacks are the leading killer in the united states about 
987000 men and 513000 women suffer heart attacks annually 
gaining weight is a common condition of aging only about 
onefifth of young women are considered to be overweight but this 
increases to onethird by middle age 
the researchers said that because weight is so hard to take off 
and keep off women should be encouraged to keep from adding extra 
pounds as they grow older 
no one should minimize the difficulty of avoiding the weight 
gain that comes with middle age manson said but with a good 
deal of effort this is potentially preventable

if your mother wears army boots theyre not 
getting any cheaper peace dividend or not 
last years outbreak of democracy in eastern europe coupled 
with hopes for wrapping up assorted minor wars around the globe 
could still produce big savings from the pentagon budget someday 
and third world generals may be able to strike great deals for 
the secondhand tanks and latemodel fighters about to be made 
unwelcome in europe if conventional arms talks stay on track 
but when sunnys surplus in georgetown trumpets world peace 
means bigger savings for you in its posters and television ads 
it turns out theyre making a little joke sorry prices are not 
tumbling on army boots or canteen belts thrown aside by unemployed 
cold war soldiers 
store manager mike carpenter patiently explaining the humor in 
an interview at his twofloor emporium of tents trenchcoats and 
camouflage hats said he hadnt really noticed any price drops 
since the berlin walls demise 
for that matter most of the stores merchandise such as 
sweatshirts and socks is surplus or seconds from some civilian 
manufacturer not anybodys army or navy 
gamely carpenter suggested that prices for armysurplus type 
goods are not as high as they would be if say vietnam or world 
war iii were in progress right this minute 
it makes the prices a lot lower you can buy a decent 
entrenching tool for 499 on up he said grabbing a folding 
shovel originally made for the dutch army 
then he looked around at other piles of clothing and gear and 
asked what are they going to use this stuff for 
the stores advertising campaign shows a smiling soldier in 
helmet pack and army boots collecting gear on a deserted 
battlefield presumably to be sold at bargain prices back in 
washington 
too bad it hasnt worked out but sunnys is still probably the 
only boutique in swank georgetown where you can buy west german 
wool pants for just 1499 us navy sailor middies for as little 
as 299 or a heavy army raincoat for under 20 
that could be enough to get by until the peace dividend check 
comes in the mail

the race to cram more technology and power into 
japanese television sets and computers sometimes has left quality 
inspectors behind leading to smoking appliances and an 
embarrassing wave of recalls 
the recalls following a series late last year involving some 
new model japanese cars with faulty parts have revived 
recollections of a time when made in japan was a label of 
derision in the united states 
since january four japanese electronics giants sony corp 
matsushita electric industrial co pioneer electronics corp and 
toshiba corp have issued nationwide public notices recalling 
hundreds of thousands of color tv sets that suddenly smoked or 
caused minor fires seiko epson corp recalled laptop computers 
that smoked 
none of the recalls affected products exported to the united 
states most were made for the domestic market and some were 
shipped to taiwan 
safety for consumers has been ignored while companies 
concentrate on technology and sales to survive in the competitive 
market said michiko aoyama a director at the governmentbacked 
japan consumer information center 
im afraid the quality of japanese products is declining due 
to imperfect quality control that cannot catch up with the speed of 
technological advance she said 
toshiba spokesman yuji wakayama said we have tried so hard to 
add as many features as possible while reducing the cost as low as 
possible the accidents mean production under such conditions has 
reached the limit 
with the increasing popularity of home videos electronics 
companies have been making larger screen televisions that require 
higher voltage the recent smoking cases were traced to defects in 
highvoltage circuits 
late last year toyota recalled thousands of its luxury lexus 
cars in the united states after defects were found in the 
cruisecontrol mechanism and a brake light nissan earlier recalled 
nearly 38000 cars in japan 
the most recent recalls brought a warning from the ministry of 
international trade and industry it told the electronic industries 
association of japan which groups 600 manufacturers to 
investigate thoroughly tighten safety and quality control and 
adopt regular procedures for recalls 
on wednesday a special committee of the association announced a 
draft for tighter safety standards in tv sets highvoltage 
circuits to be adopted voluntarily by 11 japanese manufacturers 
and standardized procedures to handle defects 
the changes could be reflected in new products within one year 
said ryuji iwasaki the associations vice president 
generally speaking our new voluntary safety standards require 
a substantial change in designs and production said hiroshi 
wada sharp corps director of product planning 
this probably would result in a 2 percent price increase he 
added 
except for motor vehicles japan has no law or government 
guidelines on recalls or reporting of defects in products giving 
companies a great deal of leeway in responding to problems 
we think it is our mission to repair defects to ease our 
conscience toshibas wakayama said 
he added however that while the problem televisions smoked or 
burned the tables on which they sat they did not kill and hurt 
people or burn down houses 
industry and trade ministry official takashi yonehara said 
the recent tv accidents resulted mainly from complex designs and 
lack of quality controls 
in the ministrys last annual inspection more than 30 percent 
of manufacturers were found to have violated government safety 
standards in products and miti will start announcing the names of 
violators he added 
a government report in february criticized companies for not 
promptly giving public notice and reporting defects to industry and 
trade officials 
pioneer quietly began repairs for 9135 defective tv sets last 
spring and already had fixed some 8000 before issuing a public 
recall notice nine months later company officials acknowledged 
sonys public recall notices for six color tv models came almost 
four months after the first report last october of a sony set 
starting to smolder in a home in western japan 
sony said it took time to trace the problem to a highvoltage 
component that had a tendency to overheat after long use 
we admit our reaction was not quick enough i guess we 
could have done better said koichi izukura a sony spokesman 
naokazu takeuchi spokesman for the japan consumer union one of 
the largest japanese consumer groups argues that notification of 
possible dangers should come before anything else 
he also says the government should help process consumer claims 
to speed remedies and spread information more widely 
atsushi nakamura a spokesman for the japan bar association 
said consumers should be protected by a product liability law as 
in the united states so that victims of product defects do not 
have to settle for small compensation from manufacturers 
industry and trade official tomosaburo yano said the ministry 
has urged electronics and auto makers unofficially to make safety a 
top priority when considering whether to recall their products 
companies that dont work hard to improve their products will 
become losers in the market yano said

installation and other us defense nuclear facilities this week as 
part of a factfinding mission designed to exchange information on 
ways of handling and disposing of radioactive wastes 
for most of its nearly four decades of operation the savannah 
river plant has been one of the most secretive sites in the nation 
it contains three reactors that produce tritium a gas needed in 
the production of nuclear warheads the reactors have been shut 
down for two years for safety reasons but are being repaired 
also on the site are a weapons laboratory a navy nuclear fuel 
processing plant facilities for disassembling retired nuclear 
warheads and related operations

stripped of their citizenship only at their own request

communistled prague spring reforms and installed a hardline 
government according to the new law those people may regain their 
citizenship by the end of 1993

the bush administration should seek an 
international court ruling that the soviet union would have to 
observe on the status of lithuania sen daniel patrick moynihan 
says 
i do ask why no one in the administration seems the least 
interested in pursuing a legal approach to a settlement of the 
lithuanian issue the new york democrat said wednesday in a 
speech at the national press club 
moynihan is among the growing number of lawmakers of both 
parties who are concerned that president bush isnt doing enough 
for lithuania a baltic state that has declared its independence 
from the soviet union soviet troops have been dispatched to the 
rebel republic 
bush met wednesday with republican lawmakers and then had a 
separate session with four house members who work with the informal 
baltic freedom caucus 
rep newt gingrich of georgia assistant house republican 
leader said gop members had a very spirited exchange over 
lithuania 
gingrich said he was persuaded after the bush meeting that any 
overt us action such as formal recognition of lithuania would 
trigger the immediate use of force against lithuania by the soviet 
army 
rep dick durbin dill a lithuanianamerican who wants the 
united states to grant immediate recognition to lithuania said his 
meeting with bush was frank and candid 
he said bush didnt seem willing to recognize lithuania as an 
independent state but indicated a willingness to take an interim 
step such as meeting with a lithuanian diplomat a symbolic 
gesture is important durbin said 
moynihan promoted his novel approach 
history has shown that the soviet union paid 75 million in 
gold dollars to germany for lithuania in 1939 an illegal act 
moynihan said 
the administration cannot seem to grasp that at its core this 
is an issue which involves violations of law he said he 
suggested asking the un general assembly to request an opinion 
from the international court of justice on the issue 
only by holding soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to his own 
professions about international law can we provide him with a way 
out of the situation he finds himself in moynihan said 
the point is to do something now 
some members of congress were reluctant to criticize bush 
i dont criticize the president at this moment in recognizing 
that circumstances are very delicate very serious and i think he 
bush could be given the benefit of the doubt as he deals with 
this said house speaker thomas foley dwash 
the president is correct not to be rattled by daytoday 
events in the soviet union said sen richard lugar rind 
but durbin said he sensed that congress is becoming increasingly 
agitated over lithuania particularly since gorbachevs decision to 
expel foreigners from the republic 
the bottom line is that we ought to be standing by the 
lithuanian people said sen connie mack rfla 
last week the senate passed a nonbinding resolution that 
called on bush to consider the call of the elected lithuanian 
government for recognition first however senators rejected a 
tougher measure seeking to pressure the president into giving 
lithuania immediate diplomatic recognition 
the house is preparing to debate later this week a companion 
resolution that asks bush to plan for normalizing diplomatic 
relations with lithuania and to take steps in that direction 
lithuania maintains a twomember diplomatic office in washington 
in an explanation of the status of the lithuanian legation 
issued wednesday night the state department underscored the united 
states longstanding refusal to recognize the soviet takeover of 
lithuania it described stasys lozoraitis the head of the 
legation as the fully accredited representative of the last free 
government of lithuania and as head of the lithuanian diplomatic 
service 
he enjoys the confidence of the president of the lithuanian 
supreme council vytautas landsbergis the brief statement said

the doctor of a man revived by 
tranquilizers after eight years in a vegatativelike state cautioned 
against raised hopes the treatment would help other braindamaged 
people 
it makes me nervous that people are going to see this as a 
possibility for treating such patients dr andres kanner a 
university of wisconsin neurologist said wednesday i think we 
are getting excited prematurely 
every patient is different why this happened with this 
patient we dont know 
after the case was reported tuesday the university received 
inquiries from around the world said hospital spokeswoman 
priscilla arsove 
kanner said the 45yearold man was awakened temporarily after 
being injected with valium during a routine dental procedure march 
12 
the patient a former airline pilot who is married with 
children had suffered injuries in a car wreck 10 years ago he was 
in a coma for about three months after the accident then improved 
but lapsed into a vegetativelike state about eight years ago the 
doctor said 
the patient whose identity was being withheld at his familys 
request was being cared for in a nursing home when the drug was 
administered the doctor said 
kanner said the patient is being observed at university hospital 
and clinics in madison and doctors are experimenting to find the 
right dose of tranquilizers that would allow him to return home 
when medicated the man has remained fully conscious for up to 
12 hours at a time kanner said during the initial discovery he 
was able to walk with assistance talk and perform complicated math 
calculations 
when not treated with the medication he returns to the 
vegetativelike state kanner said 
the patient remained in that state wednesday while doctors 
experimented with oral administration of the drugs kanner said 
but that procedure so far has not had the same effect as when the 
drugs were introduced intravenously 
the doctors will experiment with dosage levels for a few weeks 
but continuous injections of the tranquilizing drugs has its 
risks including depression of the respiratory system or heart 
kanner said 
a vegetative state is different from a coma because vegetative 
patients have sleeping and waking patterns often open their eyes 
and sometimes utter words experts said 
kanner said wednesday the man was in a vegetativelike state 
rather than a true vegetative state 
the man had some reactions that would not be characteristic of 
someone in a permanent vegetative state kanner said for example 
he would sometimes pull his arm away when someone tried to give him 
an injection 
experts said the mans reaction should stimulate more research 
and cause doctors to reexamine some of their patients but it 
probably wouldnt have a significant immediate effect on medical 
practices 
it must cause caregivers to be more cautious said dr 
richard foa of washington a member of the american academy of 
neurologys ethics and humanity subcommittee but an anecdote 
like this wouldnt alter my practice 
foa said the vegetative state and more particularly the 
persistent vegetative state has been studied as specialists try 
to narrow the definition of the condition 
usually a persistent vegetative state patient is given that 
prognosis after six months to a year it is a condition that many 
doctors believe justifies the removal of life support systems foa 
said 
kanner said one theory is that benzodiazepines such as valium 
and barbituates inhibit certain nervous system functions and may 
have blocked the effects of the vegetativelike state on the patient 
but dr nathan zasler of the medical college of virginia said 
drugs such as valium typically would have a worsening effect on 
vegetative state patients 
the american academy of neurology in minneapolis said there were 
about 10000 persistent vegetative state patients in the united 
states in 1988 
dr catherine bontke of the institute for rehabilitation and 
research in houston who is currently caring for four vegetative 
patients said she feared the freakish report would give 
families of vegetative state patients false hope and as a 
doctor that is so painful for me to watch

americans deserve better government protection 
from contamination by chemicals used in lawn care and sold to 
foreign countries as agricultural pesticides witnesses told two 
senate committees 
the environmental protection agency needs to step up its 
regulation of lawn care chemicals the general accounting office 
said in a report to a senate committee on wednesday 
another senate panel was told the united states should ban the 
export of agricultural pesticides that are not permitted for use in 
this country 
the import of produce sprayed with these chemicals is a circle 
of poison said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
the gao report released by the senate environment and public 
works committee followed a 1986 study that found the epa had made 
little progress assessing the health risks of lawn care pesticides 
the gao is the investigative arm of congress 
the earlier report said the epa had taken little enforcement 
action against advertising claims made by the pesticide industry 
peter guerrero the gaos associate director for environmental 
protection issues said the new report shows the epa still has more 
to do 
we also found that prohibited pesticide claims that epa 
classifies as false and misleading are still being made by the lawn 
care pesticides industry he said yet epa has taken even 
fewer formal enforcement actions in recent years than it did during 
the 1984 and 1985 period we reviewed for our earlier report 
one of the most popular chemicals diazinon was disallowed for 
use on golf courses and sod farms because it killed waterfowl and 
other birds 
after several people were poisoned by diazinon the epa required 
special warnings on its label and said only certified applicators 
could use it commercially 
but guerrero said the restriction does not apply to commercial 
lawn care companies and homeowners 
a spokesman for the epa said migratory birds that fed on golf 
courses were dying but the agency doesnt have similar evidence 
against diazinon for birds that light in peoples yards 
the law says you have to prove a substance has reasonable 
adverse effects before you can take it off the market said al 
heier the spokesman for epa 
in the senate agriculture committee witnesses testified on a 
bill that would stop us companies from exporting agricultural 
chemicals that are banned in the united states 
one fourth of the produce we eat is imported said leahy 
thats 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man woman 
and child 
an agriculture official from ecuador supported the bill saying 
her country like many developing countries is not in the 
condition to guarantee that highly toxic pesticides will be used in 
even a relatively safe manner 
mercedes bolanos de moreno chief of ecuadors plant protection 
program said her country has no national pesticide policy the 
united states buys large amounts of bananas coffee cocoa and 
sugar from ecuador 
in the last two years federal inspectors have found usbanned 
pesticides in beef from honduras pineapples from the philippines 
and beans and carrots from latin america 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association defended the industry in testimony at both hearings 
some pesticides produced in the united states and sold 
overseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlled 
is not a us problem or crops concerned are generally not grown 
in america like coffee rubber cocoa bananas tea vroom said 
he said attempts to control how other countries use agricultural 
chemicals would amount to us imperialism 
he told reids committee lawn insecticides greatly contribute 
to the protection of human health by warding off potentially 
harmful bugs such as ticks mosquitos fleas ants and roaches

two years after he was impeached and removed from 
office former gov evan mecham and his rightwing populist agenda 
still dominate arizonas political landscape 
few believe he could win back the governors office but mecham 
is running hard for the gop nomination 
meanwhile the state bureaucracy ruled by three wildly 
different governors in the last four years is virtually paralyzed 
as it awaits yet another master after novembers election 
and the legislature is wrestling with two mecham legacies a 
250 million deficit and a battle over a holiday honoring martin 
luther king jr 
mecham campaigning as an outsider battling the power 
brokers of state politics has staked his career on opposition to 
taxes and government meddling 
he won the governorship on his fifth try in a threeway race in 
1986 but soon got into trouble by rescinding the states king 
holiday and by making remarks that offended blacks asians 
hispanics women and homosexuals 
thirteen months after he took office the state senate convicted 
him on impeachment charges of misusing 80000 and trying to thwart 
an investigation of an alleged death threat he was removed on 
april 4 1988 
the senate however declined to pass a dracula clause that 
would have barred him from running again and he has risen from his 
political coffin 
when the public decides weve had enough even communist 
dictators are overthrown mecham said last week during an 
interview between campaign stops the mecham militia is stronger 
than ever 
political analysts say mecham could win the sept 11 primary 
given the crowded field no polls have been taken in more than a 
month but in any case some say polls have been ineffective in 
showing mechams level of support 
evan mecham has a hard core of supporters that is unidentified 
in most polls says rick degraw a democratic strategist evan 
mechams voters are not average everyone that hates anyone feels 
comfortable with evan mecham it doesnt matter if they hate trees 
or old people or lawyers theyll feel comfortable 
mecham has his own woes the federal government is trying to 
foreclose on his office building and a state judge assessed him 
more than 35000 in penalties and fees over the allegedly misused 
funds 
but mecham said of his problems we have it all in hand he 
added that he has already collected more than 100000 in campaign 
funds 
the others in the fiveway gop field are millionaire developer 
fife symington former congressman and mecham aide sam steiger 
former maricopa county supervisor fred koory and former mecham aide 
bob barnes a parttime teacher 
symington was the early gop frontrunner but some say steigers 
recent entry into the gop race will take more votes from symington 
and koory than from mecham 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard is the democratic 
frontrunner with businessman david moss and attorney ray brown 
considered longshots gov rose mofford the former secretary of 
state who replaced mecham declined to run for election 
the shift of governors from liberal bruce babbitt in 1986 to 
rightwing mecham in 1987 to the moderate mofford in 1988 has 
left state agencies adrift said lobbyist bill jamieson who was 
babbitts chief of cabinet 
when that happens the bureaucrats tend to dig in and erect 
barricades said jamieson nobody wants to do anything that the 
next governor may dislike 
after a long battle over a proposed king holiday opponents of 
the holiday gathered enough signatures to put the issue on the 
november ballot

jesse jackson who has ruled out running for 
mayor of the nations capital may try to become its delegate to 
congress instead top aides to the civil rights leader say 
although jackson issued a denial sources said wednesday that he 
is considering running for the nonvoting house seat this fall to 
boost his presidential prospects and help the district of 
columbias drive for statehood 
it gives him a base to operate from without eliminating any of 
his other options including the possibility of another national 
campaign said one jackson associate who like others spoke on 
condition of anonymity hes seriously considering it 
jacksons political plans have been the subject of great 
speculation since he moved to washington from chicago last summer 
in february the twotime democratic presidential candidate 
announced he would not run for mayor and stressed his desire to 
serve as a national leader 
he said wednesday he not considering the delegate post 
however advisers said jacksons national rainbow coalition is 
trying to dismantle a city law that would keep him from running for 
delegate the law requires that congressional candidates live in 
the city for three years before seeking the office 
one effort is aimed at persuading members of congress to amend 
the law and another option under consideration is challenging the 
law in court advisers said 
so far people on the hill have been generally receptive 
one aide said it is a noncontroversial law and changing it 
should not be difficult 
the rainbow coalition also has asked a law firm to study whether 
the threeyear residency requirement can be challenged on grounds 
it is stricter than those throughout the rest of the country aides 
said 
officials at the law firm did not return calls seeking comment 
one jackson adviser predicted jackson would make a decision on a 
congressional run within the next six weeks 
sources said jackson believes the delegates job would give him 
a better opportunity to lobby capitol hill for statehood but that 
he is unsure whether it would leave him enough time to push voter 
registration drives or run for president in 1992 
bert lance former president carters budget director who was an 
adviser to jacksons 1988 campaign said jacksons presidential 
chances would be enhanced by first serving in congress 
it makes him a peer immediately with all the other 
officeholders who are likely to run for president lance said 
lance said he had not talked to jackson about his political 
plans recently but that jackson considered the delegates job an 
option at the time he decided not to run for mayor 
the incumbent delegate democrat walter fauntroy announced 
earlier this month he will run for mayor

john e list thought he was ensuring 
salvation for his wife and children by killing them 18 years ago 
according to a confession letter released by prosecutors 
at least im certain that all have gone to heaven now list 
wrote in a 1971 letter to his lutheran pastor if things had gone 
on who knows if that would be the case 
the fivepage letter was released wednesday after superior court 
judge william le wertheimer allowed it as evidence in lists 
murder trial 
i know that many will only look at the additional years that 
they could have lived but if finally they were no longer christians 
what would be gained list wrote the rev eugene a rehwinkel 
also im sure many will say how could anyone do such a 
horrible thing my only answer is it isnt easy and was only 
done after much thought 
police found the bulletridden bodies of lists wife helen 45 
and children patricia 16 john jr 15 and frederick 13 lined 
up on the floor of the ballroom in their 18room westfield mansion 
when they entered the house dec 7 1971 they also found the body 
of lists 84yearold mother alma upstairs 
of course mother got involved because doing what i did to my 
family would have been a tremendous shock to her at this age 
therefore knowing that she is also a christian i felt it best that 
she be relieved of the troubles of this world that would have hit 
her list wrote 
afterward list said he prayed for the family that was the 
least i could do he wrote 
the judge released the letter after denying a defense motion 
that the document was protected by the priestpenitent privilege 
opening statements are set for monday 
list arrested in richmond va in june argues that he is 
innocent because of his mental state at the time the slayings 
occurred 
handwritten in script on yellowlined paper the letter was 
dated nov 9 1971 it had been the subject of intense interest 
since police found it dec 7 1971 in a filing cabinet in lists 
mansion police read the letter and called rehwinkel to the house 
where they let him read it 
list began by apologizing to rehwinkel for this additional 
burden to your work he said his actions went against all he had 
been taught and that his account will not make it right 
he then enumerated his reasons 
list then a 46yearold accountant who was selling insurance 
said he wasnt earning enough to support the family and was near 
bankruptcy 
he also worried about what patricias aspirations as an actress 
might do to her continuing to be a christian and he was upset 
that his wife said she wanted to remove her name from the church 
rolls 
he gives detailed instructions for funeral arrangements but 
returns to religious themes 
god could have helped but apparently he saw fit not to answer 
my prayers he wrote this makes me think that perhaps it was 
for the best as far as the childrens souls are concerned 
list said in his letter that he shot his family members from 
behind because he didnt want any of them to know even at the 
last second that i had to do this to them 
none suffered but john jr got hurt more because he seemed to 
struggle longer list said police said he was shot 10 times 
list said he had planned to kill them on all saints day nov 
1 an appropriate day for them to get to heaven but the day 
passed he said because his travel plans were delayed 
he signed it john and added a postscript 
ps mother is in the hallway in the attic3rd floor she was

in 1987 harriet smith was the victim of a 
truck accident that left her partially paralyzed with broken bones 
and double vision 
now a budgetcutting measure that put a moratorium on civil 
jury trials is adding insult to her injuries by frustrating her 
pursuit of muchneeded cash from the driver whose truck hit her 
without that money the wheelchairbound mother of two 
teenagers cannot receive the extensive physical and other therapy 
she needs said her attorney mary kirkpatrick 
smiths lawsuit against the driver and the college he worked for 
was headed for jury selection on jan 22 when the vermont supreme 
court imposed a fivemonth ban on civil jury trials at the 
legislatures behest 
the moratorium should save about 75000 said lee suskin 
director of trial court administration 
but the vermont trial lawyers association has filed a 
classaction lawsuit to overturn it on behalf of 18 vermont 
residents saying the ban violates the constitutional right to 
speedy trial 
it has a disruptive effect on people every day said jerome 
oneill the lawyers association president theyre out there 
suffering individually and they certainly continue to 
requests for civil jury trials are pending from more than 3000 
vermonters he said 
similar bans were overturned by the north dakota supreme court 
in january and by the us supreme court several years ago he 
said the associations challenge has been filed in the vermont 
supreme court the court that made the cut 
during a typical sixmonth period vermont juries decide about 
50 civil trials which usually involve divorces property disputes 
personal injury claims malpractice suits and breaches of contract 
suskin said hundreds of other cases are settled before they go to 
trial 
oneill said the people hurt most by the ban are in cases 
involving medical expenses and other debts 
the ban allows litigants to request an exemption for special 
cases administrative judge stephen b martin has granted one 
exemption and is considering smiths case 
since no trials are being held lawyers have largely abandoned 
their civil cases meaning few outofcourt settlements martin 
said 
the importance of setting jury cases and jury hearings is to 
get the parties to come to terms and finally resolve the case 
martin said thats where the loss is 
the bans impact will be felt long after it is lifted on july 1 
he said 
the attorneys that have jury cases are not giving attention to 
these files martin said its an area of business that the 
attorneys are not addressing because theres no push from the 
courts to do so 
oneill said the blame for the moratorium lies not with the 
supreme court but with the legislature 
they did an acrosstheboard cut and the judiciary didnt have 
the fat oneill said theyve had to cut heavily into the 
meat 
the legislature is considering a budget adjustment that would 
give the judiciary an extra 25000 suskin said that money would 
pay for civil jury trials in may and june 
vermont with much of new england is suffering an economic 
crunch as part of gov madeleine kunins belttightening plan 
state departments were ordered to cut spending 25 percent

disease emotional distress and poor sleep 
habits are the cause of sleeplessness among the elderly not just 
age alone according to a new study by a national institutes of 
health panel of experts 
the common belief that you dont need as much sleep as you 
age is not true said dr robert j joynt vice president of 
health affairs at the university of rochester and chairman of the 
nih panel that studied sleep problems among the elderly 
in healthy older people without an accompanying medical 
disease there are very few complaints of sleep disorders joynt 
said wednesday at a news conference sleep problems are not 
because of the aging process alone but because of other diseases 
attempts to treat troubled sleep among the elderly often lead to 
an overuse of drugs or overthecounter medications that are 
ineffective or even make the condition worse the report by the 
14member panel said 
more than half of those over 65 who live at home complain of 
sleep problems the report said and in longterm care facilities 
such as rest homes about twothirds of the patients say they have 
sleep disorders 
and yet joynt said many in medical science know little about 
normal sleep or how to treat sleep problems 
knowledge about sleep and its disorders is lacking and 
education is needed at all levels including by physicians he 
said 
in desperate attempts to treat themselves the panel said 
elderly patients often resort to the habitual use of 
overthecounter sleep medication 
they overthecounter drugs are used to deal with the 
symptoms of sleeplessness said israel hanin a loyola university 
professor and the pharmacology expert on the panel these drugs 
may help to make the patient sleepy but they have side effects and 
dont treat the basic cause of sleeplessness 
hanin said overthecounter sleeping pills can cause problems 
with vision and urination along with a dry mouth and some heart 
conditions and he said the pills become ineffective after long 
use 
powerful prescription sleeping pills are even more dangerous 
because they can lead to more serious health problems and 
addiction the panel said 
our report is quite clear in condemnation in the use of 
sedatives for sleep disorders said dr morton c creditor of the 
university of kansas medical center in kansas city a major 
problem we have to deal with is overmedication among the elderly 
joynt said that people tend with age to develop a different 
sleep pattern but will generally sleep just as much as the young 
for the elderly sleep at night may be fragmented and not as 
deep joynt said but the elderly often sleep some during the 
day so that their sleep is about equal to that of younger people 
studies he said show that many who complain that they cant 
sleep at night are actually sleeping more than they believed 
sleep problems often are caused by poor sleep habits such as 
drinking caffeine at night or drinking fluids that cause people to 
awaken at night to go to the bathroom joynt said 
the report said exercise going to bed the same time each night 
and the use of the bedroom primarily for sleeping and sexual 
activity may help 
emotional and social developments may also disrupt sleep events 
such as retirement depression or changes in natural sleeprest 
cycles can lead to sleep disorders 
many sleep problems the panel said are caused by medical 
conditions that must be treated before the sleeplessness will go 
away some of the common physical problems that can interrupt 
slumber include obesity alcoholism breathing difficulty 
arthritis and cardiovascular disease 
the report called for more research on normal sleep patterns of 
the elderly it also said that sleep disorders should be treated by 
specialists using advanced diagnostic tools and that there should 
be controlled clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for 
sleeplessness

minorities say theyve gotten a small toehold 
in broadcasting thanks to 18yearold rules that give them 
preference in seeking radio and television station licenses 
once representing just 1 percent of the nations station owners 
minorities now comprise about 3 percent of the people who control 
what americans see and hear on the airwaves 
the federal communications commissions minority and female 
preference rules have allowed missing voices to be heard 
backers of the rules told the supreme court on wednesday 
opponents however said the rules discriminate against white 
males they contended the rules should be dropped and the 
marketplace should determine the bidding 
the two cases involve challenges to broadcast minority 
preferences in florida and connecticut 
its clear that the court is very troubled by what the fcc is 
doing andrew schwartzman of the media access project a 
supporter of the rules said following wednesdays oral arguments 
its always dangerous to guess what the court will decide but 
im not too optimistic 
the supreme court upheld a federal public works setaside 
program in 1980 saying congress had special authority under the 
constitution to enact such programs 
but a newly conservative majority court last year struck down a 
similar setaside program for minority contractors run by the city 
of richmond va 
one of the courts new conservative justices antonin scalia 
took a leading role wednesday in questioning whether the fccs 
policy promotes diverse viewpoints 
it has to do with nothing but blood scalia said not 
background and environment he suggested that a black from a 
predominantly white community of scarsdale ny could receive 
preferential treatment under the fcc rules 
but margaret polivy a lawyer for a hispanicowned company in 
the florida case said whether you were born in scarsdale or 
harlem contributes to what you believe 
she said congress regards women and racial minorities as 
missing voices who should be given special consideration in 
awarding broadcast station licenses 
ms polivy represents rainbow broadcasting co which was 
awarded a tv license in orlando fla a rival metro broadcasting 
inc argued unsuccessfully before a federal appeals court that it 
was denied the license unfairly 
gregory guillot metros lawyer said the fccs affirmative 
action program is a complete total failure he said the policy 
has increased minority ownership of television and radio stations 
by only 1 percent in 18 years 
the connecticut case is a test of the socalled distress sale 
provisions of the fcc rules which allow a broadcaster faced with 
the loss of its license to sell to a minorityowned business at 75 
percent of market value 
alan shurberg who is white appealed the award of a hartford tv 
station to hispanicled astroline communications co 
the federal communications commission adopted the rules in 1972 
and strengthened them in 1978 the fcc under reaganera chairman 
mark s fowler tried to rewrite the rules but congress said no in 
1987 
the distress sale provisions were struck down in march 1989 on 
constitutional grounds by a threejudge panel of the us court of 
appeals in washington but less than a month later another 
threejudge panel of the same court upheld the minority and female 
preference provisions 
the fcc now is defending the rules it had tried to scrap 
the commission maintains that by regulating the ownership of 
broadcast outlets the government will have an indirect impact on 
program diversity and thereby serve the public interest 
daniel m armstrong fcc associate general counsel told the 
court the fcc doesnt exactly know how minority ownership 
translates into more diverse views but the agency believes it does 
in subtle ways such as through news and public affairs programs

state over a tough antiabortion law but mcdonalds corp said its 
french fries will be cut from idaho potatoes no matter what 
gov cecil andrus said he will act by saturday on the nations 
most restrictive state abortion law passed last week by the 
legislature and that the boycott by abortion rights supporters 
will not be the deciding factor in his decision 
some 1000 abortion rights advocates and 600 antiabortion 
activists held separate capitol rallies wednesday to sway the 
governor 
andrus has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape 
incest and to save the life of the woman

ethical political or religious issues and would not take a stand 
on the idaho abortion issue 
our customers represent all points of view and we serve all 
of them she said mcdonalds is a big buyer of idaho potatoes 
but officials from the states food processing printing travel 
and resort industries have already lost orders andrus said 
commerce director james hawkins said antiabortion forces have 
promised to buy more idaho products but those offers wont make up 
for the boycott threat 
andrus declined to identify the companies affected so far or to 
give dollar figures for losses 
nationally syndicated radio talkshow host rush limbaugh a 
conservative called on his listeners to send a wrapped idaho 
potato to molly yard president of the national organization for 
women who has called for a boycott if the bill is passed 
in west virginia antiabortion activists are adding bags of 
idaho potatoes to their grocery lists 
were issuing a challenge to the godfearing people of west 
virginia said avis hill spokesman for the 200member west 
virginia parents for life were saying to them if they choose 
not to buy idaho potatoes well buy an extra bag and give it to a 
food pantry 
the bill would ban 90 percent of the more than 1500 abortions 
performed in the state each year abortion would be banned except 
in cases of nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if 
the victim is under 18 severe fetal deformity and a threat to the 
life or physical health of the woman it would take effect july 1 
abortion rights activists promise to challenge the law in what 
could provide the us supreme court the context it needs to 
overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion

a conference on womens health issues was 
canceled out of concern that antiabortion picketing would 
embarrass one of the sponsoring organizations a participant in the

organizers assumed that grand canyon university which has 
baptist affiliation would want to call off the twoday conference 
that was scheduled to begin today when they heard about the 
pickets said bill byron a spokesman for good samaritan regional 
medical center 
but it turned out university officials were not opposed to the 
conference proceeding byron said the medical center was another 
sponsor of the conference 
the fourth annual conference on woman and her family was to have 
dealt with issues such as infertility prenatal care and access to 
care by the poor 
although the conference did not concern the issue of abortion 
it appears that the opponents of abortion rights have decided to 
shut down all discussion on the legal issues surrounding fetuses 
even those dealing with carrying a fetus to term and how to combat 
infant mortality the arizona branch of the american civil

hoping to defuse weeks of tension with 
moscow lithuanias president has told citizens of the baltic 
republic not to resist if soviet troops tried to confiscate their 
weapons 
a deadline set by the kremlin passed wednesday without incident 
in the republic which has been at odds with moscow since it 
independence march 11 
both sides showed restraint wednesday with lithuania also 
shelving plans for border guards and the soviet army refraining 
from seizing more lithuanian buildings or rounding up more military 
deserters in the republic 
at present establishing border points would be stepping up 
confrontation lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis told a 
news conference in the capital of vilnius 
landsbergis said he advised lithuanians not to resist if soviet 
authorities came to seize their hunting guns at the same time he 
said citizens should treat the officials as uninvited guests 
this is in keeping with the lithuanian strategy of refusing to 
obey foreign soviet law while avoiding violent conflicts 
the developments came a day after the first violent 
confrontations in the standoff with the republic with soviet 
troops raiding two hospitals and rounding up at least 23 deserters 
in moscow the soviet military stepped up a war of words against 
lithuania complaining of increased attacks on soldiers and 
accusing it of a campaign to discredit the soviet army 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who has promised not to 
use force to keep lithuania from breaking away ordered the signup 
for the border guard halted as soon as it began 
in the same decree last week he ordered lithuanians to turn in 
their weapons and said those not surrendered by wednesday would be 
confiscated 
only about 1000 of the 30000 guns registered in lithuanian 
have been turned in to local police said a lithuanian interior 
ministry official yaroslav prokopovich he said local police were 
refusing to hand them over to the soviet army as gorbachev ordered 
in moscow the commander of soviet paratroopers alleged there 
had been an increase in attacks on soldiers since the independence 
declaration 
the soviet news agency tass said col gen vladislav achalov 
reported a noticeable increase in incidents of provocation 
against soldiers and armed attacks by groups of young hooligans 
against both individual soldiers and military sites 
he listed three recent attacks in kaunas lithuanias 
secondbiggest city two of the cases involved hooligans 
throwing stones at military guards he said 
the ukrainian republics popular movement rukh threw its support 
behind lithuanias new government and urged rallies to support its 
independence but tass said the ukrainian government asked local 
authorities to ban the rallies 
independence movements in several of the soviet unions 15 
republics including lithuanias baltic neighbors estonia and 
latvia are posing a stiff challenge to gorbachev ironically 
gorbachevs political reform since he came to power in 1985 had in 
part paved the way for such dissent 
in washington the state department on wednesday night 
underscored the united states longstanding refusal to recognize 
the soviet takeover of lithuania in 1940 the soviets crushed the

mikhail gorbachev isnt the only 
superpower leader with secession troubles vermont has voted 
999598 to quit the united states 
people gathered wednesday night at the statehouse to hear the 
last of seven statewide debates on whether they should work from 
within to reinvigorate us politics or opt out 
will vermont become another lithuania state rep bill mares 
asked as he introduced the principal debaters 
the answer is no 
the debates have been a warmup to next marchs 200th anniversary 
of vermont statehood and the vote to secede simply was a fun 
exercise in civics 
frank bryan a university of vermont political science 
professor argued for secession the political culture is moribund 
he said and congress is brain dead 
the united states needs a sharp slap in the face bryan 
said a century hence america will say of us thanks vermont 
we needed that 
justice john dooley of the vermont supreme court argued for 
staying in vermont farmers need the national market he said and 
its elderly need social security 
at the close of each debate the audience has been asked to vote 
on the question each time secession has won the vote total was 
the sum of all seven ballots 
a key question when considering secession would be can we get 
away with it bryan said vermonters are very very practical 
people we know theres no sense trying something unless you can 
get away with it 
on that point dooley quoted a letter from a man in georgia 
you may have heard of an organization called the confederate 
states of america the letter said as for secession forget 
about it we tried it and it didnt work out too well

chinas chief justice today condemned western 
countries for their vicious slanders against his countrys 
legal system and said last years prodemocracy demonstrators 
received fair trials 
the hegemonists accused us of conducting secret 
interrogations handing out secret verdicts refusing to conduct 
fair open trials and extensively trampling on human rights ren 
jianxin president of the supreme peoples court said in his 
annual report on crime 
the human rights group amnesty international in a report 
released last month said tens of thousands have been arrested 
since troops shot their way into beijing in june to put down the 
massive prodemocracy movement killing hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people 
the report said authorities conducted arbitrary arrests 
detained prisoners without charge or trial and imprisoned or 
executed others after unfair trials 
another group asia watch said thousands are languishing in 
cramped cells and being tortured by prison guards 
these accusations are deliberate fabrications and absolutely 
groundless these are vicious slanders on chinas judicial organs 
and judicial system ren told the national peoples congress 
chinas legislature which is holding its annual twoweek session 
in beijing 
he said all the proceedings were handled according to criminal 
procedural law and all cases that were supposed to be tried openly 
were public thus ensuring fair judgments on them 
however reporters requests to attend such trials have been 
repeatedly rejected 
liu fuzhi head of the supreme peoples procuratorate or 
prosecutors office said demonstrators who made radical 
statements but did not violate the criminal law were not brought 
to trial 
liu said parts of china saw dramatic increases in crime 
including murder robbery rape and gang activity but he did not 
provide details or numbers ren said juvenile delinquency is on the 
rise but also did not give statistics 
last year chinese courts handled 29 million cases a 27 
percent increase over the previous year 
of those 1815300 were civil cases also a 27 percent increase 
over 1988 and 694900 were economic cases up 35 percent from the 
previous year eighty percent of civil and economic cases were 
settled through mediation ren said 
the economic cases that were settled involved a total of 46 
billion a staggering 84 percent increase over 1988 more than 
105000 people were sentenced in those cases 31 to death for 
embezzling large amounts of public funds or taking bribes 
prodemocracy demonstrators last year had called for a fight 
against corruption

a scientific satellite that spent 
nearly six years in orbit suffered mostly surface damage 
demonstrating the feasibility of a manned space station a nasa 
scientist says 
on tuesday technicians from the national aeronautics and space 
administation removed the last of 57 science and techonology 
experiments from the space lab known as the long duration exposure 
facility 
the surprising thing to us is although there was a lot of 
weathering apparent on the outside most of that weathering was 
really only skindeep william kinard chief scientist for the 
ldef said on wednesday 
a nasa study concluded recently that the proposed space station 
freedom would begin falling apart before completion and would need 
extensive maintenance in space but kinard said the space lab had 
fared well in space boding well for freedom 
all of our systems have survived better i think than predicted 
so you might expect the same thing from the space station he 
said the survivability of materials and systems in space is 
pretty good 
kinard said concern about freedom is healthy but problems of 
duration in space can be resolved the space station is expected to 
cost 30 billion by the time its completed and manned in 1999 
weve built a lot of spacecraft that have performed for long 
periods of time in space he said the data should give one 
confidence that you can design spacecraft and have them work 
the ldef satellite was placed in orbit in april 1984 for an 
expected 10 months because of delays however it was not 
retrieved until jan 12 when astronauts snared it 200 miles out in 
space 
the six years were the longest time a spacecraft had been in 
space before being retrieved for study none of the experiments 
were lost during the long stay 
barring a rescue the laboratory would have come crashing down 
through the atmosphere in midmarch and all the experiments 
attached to its exterior would have been lost if not for gravity 
the structure could have lasted many more years in space although 
some of the experiments might have decayed kinard said

about 62 pounds of deadly radioactive plutonium 
escaped into nearly a mile of air ducts during the 38 years the 
federal government has operated the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant officials said 
that much plutonium could make six bombs and would be worth 
billions of dollars if sold on the black market said melinda 
kassen an attorney for the environmental defense fund and member 
of a rocky flats monitoring committee 
we feel the 28kilogram figure is fairly solid jim breen a 
spokesman for plant operator egampg inc said wednesday but we 
still have more measurements to make 
twentyeight kilograms is equal to about 62 pounds 
the energy department confirmed in october that there had been 
at least one accumulation of plutonium that had a serious 
potential for causing a criticality accident under certain 
conditions 
if enough plutonium gathers in one spot potentially a nuclear 
chain reaction and explosion could take place 
even if the plutonium poses no risk of criticality the point 
at which a nuclear chain reaction become selfsustaining it still 
is dangerous to hundreds of thousands of people in the denver area 
kassen said 
plutonium is so toxic it is usually expressed in quantities of 
grams a thousandth of a kilogram 
the energy department estimated last year there were 12 
kilograms of plutonium in the 4000 feet of exhaust ductworks for 
the hundreds of gloveboxes that workers use to handle and process 
the plutonium at rocky flats 
plutonium operations at rocky flats were closed down last fall 
for routine maintenance and plutonium inventory and have remained 
closed pending resolution of safety and health problems at the 
plant officials said 
breen said wellesley massbased egampg which operates the rocky 
flats plant under contract to the energy department was working on 
recovering the plutonium he wouldnt elaborate further 
we will clean out the pipes before we restart said 
catherine kaliniak of the energy department i dont know if all 
the activity will be completed prior to restart but if there is 
any safety questions the energy secretary wont order restart 
egampg last year replaced rockwell international corp as the 
plants operator 
kassen as a member of gov roy romers rocky flats monitoring 
council was the first one to find out about the situation and 
alerted others she said she attended a meeting tuesday night about 
the proposed restart of plutonium operations at the plant 
i asked some questions about what they were going to do before 
restart she said but officials were vague 
so she asked specifically about the criticality report of last 
year which began the assessment of missing plutonium 
egampg officials called back wednesday morning with the figure of 
28 kilograms she said

a federal judge ruled the citys method of 
electing council members illegal and ordered new elections as soon 
as possible to offer better representation to blacks and hispanics 
us district judge jerry buchmeyers ruling wednesday gives the 
nations eighthbiggest city 30 days to submit a plan for the 
special interim election the judge did not set an election date 
buchmeyer said he wanted an election plan with 11 to 15 
singlemember districts and a mayor elected at large 
eight council members are currently elected in singlemember 
districts while three including the mayor are elected atlarge 
although 51 percent of the citys more than 1 million residents 
are black or hispanic only two council members are black there 
are no hispanic council members 
the 83 system for electing members of the city council 
violates the voting rights act because it dilutes the votes of 
politically cohesive blacks and hispanics in dallas buchmeyer 
ruled 
under the 83 system africanamericans and hispanics are 
denied access to the three atlarge seats because they cannot raise 
from their own communities the enormous amount of money that is 
required for an effective atlarge city campaign in dallas 
buchmeyer said an interim election would end once and for all 
the atlarge election of all city council members 
only the mayor would be elected at large buchmeyer said 
if the city fails to develop an interim election plan within 30 
days buchmeyer would devise a courtordered one said betsy 
julian executive director of the legal services of north texas 
mayor annette strauss refused to comment on the ruling until she 
had studied it 
the plaintiffs including two former unsuccessful black council 
candidates claimed the only way to achieve racial equality in the 
elections was to have all members of the council elected in single 
districts 
the city had countered with a 1041 plan which it scheduled to 
go into effect in 1991 under which voters would elect 10 council 
members from individual districts four from regional quadrants and 
the mayor at large 
the judge suggests that the 1041 system has the same problem 
as the 83 system said the plaintiffs lawyer mike daniel 
the suit was filed by the two candidates roy williams and 
marvin crenshaw in may 1988 they later were joined by the 
ledbetter neighborhood association a hispanic group

scores of people were trampled today as thousands 
of illegal immigrants from neighboring china stormed the gates of a 
race track in hopes of receiving residency rights in this 
portuguese territory 
police fired shots into the air and arrested more than 1000 
people to bring the situation under control at the track where 
about 40000 people gathered for the registration program 
about 70 people were taken to two hospitals where they were 
treated and discharged said nuno roque chief of staff for macaos 
security force 
several pregnant women suffered miscarriages and at least two 
men suffered broken bones in the rush said dr leong chifai 
director of kiang wu hospital 
the incident occurred one day after the government began an 
amnesty program for illegal immigrants whose children earlier 
received permission to live in macao 
crowds of other illegal immigrants also demanded they be covered 
by the amnesty and early today police told them to head to an 
athletic field near the chinese border to be registered 
as the crowd there grew police decided to move the operation to 
the nearby dog racing track frantic illegal immigrants afraid they 
would miss the registration stormed the gates pushing and shoving 
as police helplessly looked on 
police closed the track gates and warned the crowd outside that 
people without identification cards would be arrested three hours 
later police reported more than 1000 had been detained 
several factories restaurants and shops were closed or only 
partially operating today because employees were trying to register 
thousands of chinese have illegally crossed macaos porous 
border to work in this territory which enjoys a much higher 
standard of living 
it was unclear whether illegal immigrants who register with 
police at the track will be granted permission to live in this tiny 
enclave of about 500000 people at the mouth of the pearl river in 
southern china 
even if the amnesty applies the illegal immigrants would not be 
allowed to reside in portugal under that countrys nationality law 
the portuguese have agreed to hand over macao to communist china 
in 1999 two years after the nearby british colony of hong kong 
reverts to chinese rule beijing has promised both territories can 
maintain their capitalist systems for at least 50 years

sobs and cries from hundreds of mourners rang 
out at a roman catholic church as the caskets of 17 victims from 
the happy land social club fire were arrayed in the form of a large 
crucifix 
one pink coffin for a female victim and 16 blue coffins for 
males were carried wednesday from the rivera funeral home in the 
bronx across the street from st josephs church 
the dead were among 87 people most of them honduran immigrants 
who perished sunday in the illegal social club that was allegedly 
set afire by a spurned lover it was the citys worst fire in 79 
years 
god never never abandons us sudden death is also sudden 
mercy the rev henry hill told more than 1000 mourners packed 
inside the church 
my heart goes out to each and every family said hill a 
honduran native the church understands your loss and extends its 
sympathies and love 
another 1000 people unable to fit in the church huddled outside 
on the street about 10 blocks from the scene of the fire 
the honduran government declared three days of national mourning 
wednesday and said 78 victims had been identified as honduran most 
of the bodies will be buried in honduras 
but relatives who are illegally in the united states may not be 
able to return if they travel to honduras to attend burial services 
before the mass hundreds of mourners prayed in the funeral home 
and then stood in the street at least three women fainted and more 
than 15 required medical attention 
jose alvarez who came for the wake of his brother denny 22 
left the funeral home sobbing and clinging to a cousin and friend 
across the street on the church steps dennys father pedro 
railed against the man charged with setting the blaze 36yearold 
cuban emigrant julio gonzalez 
they ought to take him and give him a public hanging people 
like that dont deserve to live alvarez said 
roses and daffodils in vases and coffee cans were placed in 
front of the the smokeblackened red brick social club burned 
coats some still on hangers lay piled against the building a 
paper sign on a tree listed the victims names and ages 
nearby family members went to a school to collect their 
relatives personal effects 
carlos pena clutched a manila envelope which held a watch keys 
and some cash his brother eli 26 had when he died at the club 
the watch arrived with eli from honduras and carlos said the 
timepiece would now be his it means a lot a reminder he said 
the wake at the funeral home began three hours after a bronx 
civil court refused to let the landlord of the social club reclaim 
the establishment until it decides whether the late tenants widow 
should replace her husband in an eviction suit 
the hearing scheduled before the blaze sunday whose victims 
included club proprietor elias colon did not delve into 
responsibility for the tragedy it only dealt with the demand of 
the buildings landlord one peach associates for colons eviction 
for failing to pay rent

a pizza shop owner who shot a man hed just seen 
kill a woman in a shopping mall said he wouldnt do it again 
although a grand jury decided against indicting him for murder 
i was acting on my reaction to what had happened and i wanted 
to stop the man from fleeing the scene todd broom said 
wednesday but if the same thing happened in the parking lot when 
i left here id probably think a lot more 
broom who could have faced a murder charge fired two shots at 
eddie edwards car on march 12 after watching edwards shoot 
demetria yvonne taylor in the irving mall parking lot 
one of the shots hit edwards who lost control of the car 
crashed and died at a hospital a short time later 
im glad this is behind me and i can go forward now said 
broom 25 
prosecutor norm kinne said the grand jurys decision reflects 
the way the average citizen feels about the case whether its 
based on the law or not 
but he added i fail to see that mr brooms actions were in 
any way justified under the law 
im not thinking of myself as a hero and i dont know what a 
hero is supposed to be said broom a copier repairman and 
coowner of a pizza parlor 
kinne said the grand jurys action wont encourage others to 
emulate broom 
i dont anticipate any of our lawabiding citizens are going 
to take this as a sign to pick up their guns and go to the shopping 
mall and try to deal out justice he said 
broom saw edwards 41 shoot ms taylor 28 in the head and 
fired his 44caliber magnum twice at edwards car when the man 
drove away 
after the shooting broom fled and did not turn himself in until 
two days later he said at the time he was afraid he would be 
treated as a criminal 
broom said that if any money is left over from his legal fund 
he will make a donation to the fund set up for ms taylors 
5yearold daughter tiffany

pizza is great in 30 minutes but better late 
than never says a highway patrolman who has been lecturing 
delivery drivers on how to arrive with pizza and driver in one 
piece 
managers of the 35 dominos stores in the pittsburgh area 
suspended their delivery service for four hours tuesday night so 
drivers could listen to mississippi state trooper lt pete collins 
i dont know a thing in the world about selling pizzas but i 
do know one subject better than anyone in this room collins 
said thats dying 
critics say the ann arbor michbased companys guaranteed 
halfhour delivery has caused accidents by encouraging employees to 
drive recklessly company officials admit haste has contributed to 
some fatal accidents 
attorney kenneth r behrend who is representing a couple 
injured when a dominos car collided with their car said the 
company should drop its guarantee 
it was a great public relations gimmick it got them their 
market share said behrend president of the american trial 
lawyers association but it is causing more problems to the 
american public than are needed 
behrend said he knows of 140 accidents where victims or their 
survivors have filed suit are preparing to file suit or are trying 
to negotiate a settlement 
we probably have a perception problem said dominos 
spokesman ron hingst 
most people dont know that you can have a pizza out and fully 
cooked in 8 to 12 minutes and that leaves time for driving if 
theres a way we can save 10 seconds in the production of the 
pizza well do it he said 
hingst said in 1988 half of the 20 accident deaths involving 
company drivers had nothing to do with dominos guarantee 
dominos defends the guarantee which helped spur its explosive 
growth in the 1980s the policy established in 1973 says if a 
pizza is delivered late dominos will refund a minimum of 3 
the company bills itself as the worlds largest pizza delivery 
company it sold 250 million pizzas in 1989 posting 25 billion 
in sales hingst said

in a move that may ease weeks of tension between 
lithuania and moscow the defense ministry announced it would offer 
amnesty to lithuanian soldiers who deserted the army if they turn 
themselves in tass reported today 
the announcement came a day after lithuanias government made 
two conciliatory moves toward moscow it suspended plans for 
setting up its own border guard and told citizens not to resist if 
officials came to their homes to confiscate their firearms in 
accordance with a soviet decree 
hundreds of lithuanian soldiers have deserted in recent weeks 
some complaining of harassment and others refusing to serve in a 
foreign army after their republic declared independence march 
11

legal liability for the social club fire that 
left 87 dead depends on the answers to three questions according 
to some of the citys top lawyers 
did the owner and landlord know about the unsafe and illegal 
condition of the happy land social club what could they have done 
about it and what did they try to do about it 
the lawyers say those questions deal primarily with matters of 
fact not law and resist immediate answers 
everyones jumping into the pot and pointing the blame even 
though we dont know what happened and wont know for sure until 
the pretrial stage of any litigation said bernard rifkin 
chairman of the real property committee of the state bar 
association 
it all depends on the facts agreed karl holtzschue 
rifkins counterpart at the city bar association if they the 
building owner and the landlord knew there was something wrong and 
didnt do something they might have some liability but this is an 
area of law thats very factspecific 
three people held varying degrees of control over the building 
in which the club was located 
the club operator elias colon died in the fire jay weiss and 
morris jaffe whose company one peach associates held a 30year 
lease for the property subleased it to colon alexander dilorenzo 
iii who owned the building leased it to one peach 
lawyers agreed that the chance of criminal charges was slim 
because the fire was apparently the result of arson but when such 
a tragedy occurs victims families search for the deepest pockets 
to sue in this case holtzschue noted the operator paid for 
what he did with his life you cant get any more out of his hide 
that leaves the owner and one peach as well as those who will 
probably call the defense legal shots in any lawsuit their 
insurance companies 
but what dilorenzo weiss and jaffe knew what they did and what 
they could have done remains unclear 
the unlicensed club colon operated had been the scene of arrests 
for the illegal sale of alcohol it had been cited for serious 
building and safety code violations and had been ordered to close 
in late 1988 
colons lease from weiss specified that the building was not to 
allow any person under the age of 21 years to enter 
if any governmental authority complained about the club the 
lease gave the landlord the right to evict the club unless it 
quickly corrected the problem 
the city of course did complain and minors were served but 
did the owner or landlord know the city says it sent copies of 
vacate orders out but it appears only dilorenzo received one 
weisss attorneys said they never were formally notified of the 
violations but declined to say if they knew about them anyway 
one of weisss attorneys said his client was not closely 
involved with the property alan vogeler told the new york times 
that weiss husband of actress kathleen turner had never been 
inside the social club and had not visited the property since april 
1989 jaffes role remains unclear 
weiss and jaffe however were trying to evict colon that 
usually would be a legal mark in their favor but they apparently 
were doing so only because that colon had not paid his rent 
rifkin questioned how much weiss and jaffe could have done to 
get rid of colon or correct the buildings problems because of 
city laws and court policies that protect tenants he said 
anytime you try to evict anyone youve got a nightmare

vietnams communist party has purged a 
member of the ruling politburo who advocated more democratic 
reform and party leaders affirmed a commitment to socialism 
despite its crisis abroad 
the official vietnam news agency said tran xuan bach the no 9 
man on the 13member politburo was removed for his grave 
violations on the partys organizational and disciplinary 
principles which had caused many bad consequences 
the agency was paraphrasing a communique issued at the central 
committees eighth general meeting a twoweek gathering that ended 
tuesday in the capital hanoi the report dated wednesday was 
seen in bangkok today 
the communique did not specify bachs alleged mistakes but it 
was clear they involved disagreeing with the partys attempt to 
avoid substantial political liberalization while easing controls on 
the society and economy 
the plenum noted that many socialist countries were being 
enmeshed in a comprehensive and most critical crisis ever seen 
before the report said in paraphrasing the communique referring 
to recent reform in other communist countries 
however the plenum was confident that socialism would 
certainly surmount difficulties and continue to march 
forward the report said 
it said the plenum concluded that initial successes showed the 
partys reforms were correct although the country had not yet 
gone out of the economic and social crisis 
the 1986 party congress endorsed mainly economic changes 
including limited private enterprise decreased state management 
and material incentives for farmers 
the seventh congress will be held the second quarter of 1991 
the plenum communique said 
in an article by indochina correspondent murray heibert the far 
eastern economic review said in its feb 1 edition that bach has 
been one of the partys leading ideological thinkers in recent 
years and frequently had been touted as a possible successor to 
party chief nguyen van linh 
in a speech broadcast by the official radio in january bach 
65 said the economy had improved but social unrest remained with 
people demanding more democracy and social justice 
countries that have liberalized the economy but not the 
political system are facing a very tense situation he said 
but bach did not call for a multiparty system in vietnam only 
for more democratic reforms and greater diversity of political 
ideas the far eastern economic review article said

leaders of the two parties that dominated 
east germanys first free elections began crucial talks today that 
could have a major impact on the pace of unification with west 
germany 
the talks came hours before the groups that toppled the old 
communist order were to rally throughout the country protesting 
the new leaderships alleged ties to the secret police of the 
ousted communist regime 
lothar de maiziere leader of the christian democratled 
coalition that finished first in the balloting said he was 
optimistic that a government could be formed with the rival social 
democrats 
during a visit in the west german city of stuttgart on 
wednesday de maiziere said that a new governing coalition could be 
formed within the next two weeks 
however the social democrats who finished a distant second in 
the march 18 balloting have expressed concern about whether they 
will be able to work with some of the more conservative elements of 
de maizieres alliance 
the social democrats also favor a more gradual process for 
unification than the christian democrats 
we expect to learn where the conversations will lead markus 
meckel a social democrat leader told reporters before talks began 
today in east berlin 
new forum which led the revolt last fall that brought down the 
government of communist leader erich honecker called for the 
demonstrations to force an immediate investigation of new 
parliament members 
in bonn members of west german chancellor helmut kohls junior 
coalition partners the free democrats joined with the opposition 
social democrats in rejecting a kohl government proposal to grant 
amnesty to former members of the east german secret police 
wrongs cannot be allowed to be swept under the table 
gerhard baum deputy chairman of the free democrats said wednesday 
voting in their first free elections march 18 east germans 
overwhelmingly elected a threeparty coalition that favors quick 
unification with west germany and a capitalist economy 
de maiziere who heads the winning coalition and ibrahim 
boehme head of the social democrats both were accused after the 
elections of having ties to the former secret police 
both men denied the accusations similar charges have been 
raised against other members of the newly elected 400member 
parliament 
the 85000member secret police known as the stasi and its 
109000 informers were used by east germanys hardline stalinist 
government for decades to control the countrys citizens the unit 
was disbanded after honecker was overthrown 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said tuesday 
that a generous amnesty for the stasi may be needed to quell 
further instability in east germany 
not everyone who was forced to report to the stasi was a 
criminal schaeuble said kohl later told reporters he agreed 
in principle with the proposal 
in the east german elections kohl backed the coalition led by 
de maiziere 
baum said former stasi members should be allowed to begin new 
careers but it is out of the question to allow them to hold 
important political posts 
boehme temporarily stepped down from his party post until his 
name was cleared of any stasi links lawmaker horst ehmke a leader 
of west germanys social democratic party on wednesday called on 
de maiziere to also resign 
in the meantime a reformoriented communist government that 
replaced the ousted honecker government continues to handle daily 
operations of the country the retooled communist party was soundly 
defeated in the elections 
on wednesday an east german prosecutor said that doctors will 
decide if honecker is physically and mentally able to face charges 
of corruption and abuse of power 
lothar reuter east germanys deputy chief prosecutor told the 
official news agency adn that medical specialists also will examine 
other aging officials accused of misusing their power during the 
honecker regime 
the comments further increase the likelihood that the ailing 
honecker who ruled east germany with the help of the secret police 
for 17 years may avoid criminal trial 
authorities already have decided this week not to charge 
honecker 77 and in poor health with conspiracy and high treason

special kgb guards who protect president mikhail 
s gorbachev and other leaders have stopped wouldbe assassins who 
tried to enter government buildings with sawedoff shotguns and 
knives a news report said today 
every month our men in the kremlin on red square and other 
places expose and detain about a dozen people with criminal 
intentions a kgb general yuri s plekhanov told the communist 
party daily pravda 
even in the period of gorbachevs policy of greater openness 
officials previously have not discussed planned attacks on top 
leaders 
several weeks ago a popular tv show referred to an effort to 
assassinate president leonid i brezhnev in 1969 the effort had 
previously only been rumored to have occurred 
security for gorbachev compared to that for leaders of other 
major countries is erratic 
when the soviet leader traveled to washington in 1987 to meet 
president reagan us security officers said gorbachevs security 
operated in nearly an identical way 
but gorbachevs security details have appeared ragged on other 
foreign trips and at times in moscow security for gorbachev and 
his wife raisa appears to be lax 
gorbachev who enjoys stepping into crowds to chat with people 
in the soviet union and abroad presents a tougher security problem 
than previous soviet leaders whose public appearances had little 
spontaneity 
plekhanov said that kgb security guards for the soviet 
leadership have not had to use their weapons since world war ii 
the kgb general said that recently a man waiting in the 
reception room of the communist party central committee pulled out 
a sawedoff shotgun but he was disarmed by kgb maj v frolov 
gorbachev is said to do most of his daytoday work in the 
central committee headquarters although a person visiting the 
reception area would be unlikely to get anywhere close to the 
soviet leader 
others with bombs knives and guns have been arrested on red 
square and in the kremlin he said 
last year security guards found a knife on a person among the 
crowd entering the kremlin for new years festivities 
a person was arrested with a bomb on may 1 the may day holiday 
in red square where the entire soviet leadership gathers atop 
lenins mausoleum to review a workers parade 
the next day security agents on red square arrested a man with 
a gun that accidentally went off when he was being detained 
plekhanov said 
besides gorbachev the guard unit protects other soviet leaders 
provides security for parliamentary sessions in the kremlin and 
cooperates with the secret services of other countries during the 
visits of foreign dignitaries 
the kgb guards have good contacts with scotland yard the us 
secret service finnish west germany and other security police he 
said 
without going into specifics plekhanov said the kgb guard is 
relatively small and cooperates with other branches of the soviet 
security police during important political events or if it catches 
wind of a plot

a tv documentary identified four people it said 
were responsible for ira bombings that killed 21 people and a 
british lawmaker said new evidence should lead to the release of 
the six people who were convicted 
the home office responsible for law enforcement said in a 
statement today that all four people identified on the television 
program had been investigated by police and that the program does 
not put forward new evidence 
chris mullin a member of the opposition labor party said 
wednesday that those convicted known as the birmingham six were 
innocent of the 1974 bombings of two pubs he said an irish 
republican army informer identified one of the bombers but that 
police failed to follow up the lead 
the lie cannot be sustained much longer mullin told a news 
conference to publicize the third edition of his book on the case 
error of judgment 
the bombings in the northern city of birmingham which also left 
162 injured were the deadliest ever by the ira in its campaign to 
end british rule in northern ireland 
mullin based his charge on a police document a summary of an 
interview with an ira informer and said it ought to bring the 
end of this scandal 
mullin also claims to have interviewed four men who carried out 
the bombings he spoke hours before four alleged bombers were also 
identified in granada televisions dramatized documentary who 
bombed birmingham 
mullin declined to comment on the identifications made in the 
broadcast but said i advise you to take very seriously the 
granada broadcast 
none of those identified on the program is among the six 
convicted of bombing two pubs in birmingham on nov 21 1974 
the program identified the suspects as a man who served 12 years 
for other offenses a man serving a life sentence in ireland for 
murder and two men now living in ireland one of those two men the 
program alleged was involved in other ira attacks including the 
murder of 11 people in london in 1982 and the bombing in brighton 
in 1984 that nearly killed prime minister margaret thatcher 
granada said a fifth suspect could not be named for security 
reasons 
the home office however said the people named in that report 
were included in the police investigations into the birmingham pub 
bombings and general terrorist activities in the west midlands at 
the time 
one was not charged and no evidence had been found to link two 
others the statement said the fourth man stood trial with the 
six was convicted on a conspiracy count and was sentenced to 12 
years in prison it said 
west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear said wednesday that 
he would investigate any new evidence disclosed by the tv 
broadcast he also said police had never claimed the convicted six 
were the only ones involved 
the iras legal political wing sinn fein denounced the 
television program the quality and strength of the evidence 
which proves the innocence of the six is not not should be 
dependent upon pointing the finger of suspicion at others it 
said 
last week home secretary david waddington ordered a new 
investigation of several matters raised by attorneys for the 
birmingham six waddington has refused to say what specific points 
are under review 
the cause of the six has been taken up by amnesty international 
the irish government and most recently by cardinal tomas o fiaich 
the roman catholic primate of ireland 
five of the six convicts were arrested the night of the bombings 
as they were about to board a ferry to belfast for the funeral of 
an ira man all six johnny walker patrick hill hugh callaghan 
richard mcilkenny gerry hunter and billy power were sentenced to 
life in prison in 1975

single people in the nations secondlargest 
city suffer widespread and often illegal bias ranging from rental 
discrimination to restricted hospital visits it was reported today 
the alleged bias against unmarried people in los angeles was 
documented by the citys consumer task force on marital status and 
reflects a national trend the los angeles times reported 
city attorney james k hahn declined to comment on the 126page 
report until it was formally released later today 
most of us arent living in traditional american families 
anymore and the rights and privileges extended to a few should be 
extended to everyone hahn said when he created the task force in 
october 1989 
according to the newspaper the report details alleged 
discriminatory practices that include landlords who refuse to rent 
to single people or unmarried couples auto insurers that levy 
higher premiums or refuse policies for singles and airlines that 
restrict the sharing of frequentflier awards to spouses or blood 
relatives 
most of these practices are illegal in california said 
thomas f coleman a family law expert and chairman of the task 
force 
discrimination based on marital status is arbitrary 
inappropriate illegal and unfair but it is also a pervasive 
national problem coleman said 
our report represents the emergence of a new dimension of the 
consumer protection movement he said call it singles 
rights 
the report also noted that singles are often charged higher 
health club dues than married people and can be denied hospital 
bedside visits that are sometimes limited to spouses or family 
members 
the task force report is the result of three public hearings 
where about 30 witnesses including business representatives legal 
experts and politicians testified about alleged discrimination 
the single divorced separated and widowed collectively make up 
55 percent of people 15 years or older said coleman

an 11yearold boy placed in an orphanage at 
christmastime by the parents who had adopted him six year earlier 
has plenty of offers of a new home 
the hephzibah childrens association orphanage in suburban oak 
park said countless people telephoned after the boys story 
appeared in news accounts wednesday 
one man called crying and said he wanted to adopt him said 
annette anderson a receptionist at the orphanage 
dozens more calls offering a home or financial help came to the 
illinois department of children and family service and cook county 
guardian patrick t murphy who has sued the parents to secure 
visitation rights for the children 
its every little boys nightmare murphy said wednesday 
mom and dad were talking about something and they said they 
were going to put me up for adoption i thought they were kidding 
they werent the boy says in a tape recording made available by 
murphy 
the boy blames himself for the situation in which he was 
separated from his 8yearold brother 
murphys lawsuit filed this week in circuit court also seeks 
to force the parents to pay at least 50000 in damages for 
emotional harm to rick not his real name 
ricks parents told him they were going to put him into an 
orphanage and they did it its like telling a kid youre going to 
send the bogey man after him and then doing it he said 
he continually blames himself for what happened thinking hes 
a bad boy he said 
the two boys were adopted by the couple in suburban bellwood in 
august 1984 after their biological mother abandoned them 
the parents put rick in an orphanage at christmas and got 
approval march 9 from circuit court judge walter williams to 
surrender their parental rights to him 
in the tape rick then apologizes to his brother for a fight the 
two had 
remember that day that i hurt your nose when i beat you up 
im sorry for that i didnt mean it i hope i get to see you 
again 
the childrens adoptive parents identified in the lawsuit only 
as joseph and pamela doe said rick did not bond to them 
murphy said 
the parents said rick is only out for what he can get and 
they prevented his younger brother from seeing him according to 
murphy 
the parents lawyer mary c martin declined to discuss the 
case tuesday calls to her office wednesday were not returned 
murphy said rick was taken to an oak park orphanage and is now 
in a temporary foster home he called rick a normal kid whos 
never been in trouble with the law 
this is not a schizophrenic kid who is climbing the walls and 
throwing feces at people he said hes a normal kid 
the lawsuit describes the parents as a middleclass couple who 
own two small businesses murphy said the lawsuit was unusual only 
because parents usually dont separate adopted children 
before brothers and sisters werent separated murphy said 
and now youve got bureaucrats and judges who say its ok

the office for six years has submitted his resignation district 
attorney charles hynes said

seven whites are charged with murdering a young black man yusuf 
hawkins last summer in the bensonhurst section of brooklyn a 
predominantly white neighborhood the first trial in the case was 
scheduled to begin next week 
mcintyre resigned monday because he believed he was playing a 
nonessential role and had been assigned to the case merely for 
appearances sake according to published reports 
the daily news citing unidentified sources said mcintyre told 
colleagues earlier this week that he didnt go to law school to 
be a token black

case but acknowledged that he had hoped to have a black on the 
prosecution team

the us nuclear arsenal will suffer severe 
ramifications if the government is unable to get its key weapons 
production plants back in operation soon energy secretary james d 
watkins says 
testifying wednesday to a house armed services subcommittee 
watkins strongly hinted that one casualty of the production 
breakdown could be the trident ii ballistic missile considered by 
experts to be the most accurate us missile 
one key breakdown is at the rocky flats plant in colorado which 
makes plutonium triggers for nuclear arms it has been closed since 
last november to correct safety and management problems watkins 
said he hoped it would be back in operation by this summer but no 
firm date for restart has been set 
the energy department owns all facilities that develop and 
produce us nuclear arms 
reps norman dicks dwash and patricia schroeder dcolo 
asked watkins whether the indefinite shutdown at rocky flats could 
force delays in outfitting newly deployed trident submarines with 
the new missiles 
watkins replied that he could not discuss details in public but 
he added that as a general comment i can guarantee if we dont 
move aggressively to get the weapons production complex back in 
full operation soon there will be severe ramifications 
he then added in reference to the trident missile program 
that wont be the last to be hampered by the interruption at 
rocky flats and other weapons facilities 
watkins also said his department had notified the defense 
department yes there would probably be a negative impact on the 
weapons stockpile this year and next 
lt bruce williams a navy spokesman said watkins comments 
came as quite a surprise here he said the navy had not been 
notified of any impending shortage of warheads for the trident or 
other navy nuclear weapons systems williams said he could not 
comment on specific deployment plans for security reasons 
also out of service due to safety problems are three reactors 
at the savannah river plant in south carolina that make tritium a 
radioactive gas needed to boost the explosive power of nuclear 
warheads 
watkins told lawmakers he hoped to get one reactor restarted by 
the end of this year but stressed that questions of reactor safety 
and other matters remained to be resolved 
the los angeles times reported earlier this month that the 
warhead stockpile is now so small that the navy has only enough 
armed trident ii missiles known formally as the d5 to equip two 
trident subs with a full complement of 24 missiles 
the first of those two subs the uss tennessee is expected to 
go on its first operational patrol from its base at kings bay 
ga by this weekend said william arkin a nuclear arms specialist 
for the environmental group greenpeace 
the navy has declined to comment on the timing of the 
tennessees deployment 
a second trident sub the uss pennsylvania is scheduled to go 
to sea with trident ii missiles in december arkin said 
the times report citing unidentified government officials said 
subsequent deployments of trident subs are being jeopardized by the 
rocky flats shutdown 
that would mean the uss west virginia which is to enter service 
next spring might have to be armed with existing trident i 
missiles instead of the new version 
the first eight trident subs were deployed with the trident i 
missile which is less accurate than the new version the vessels 
are scheduled to be reequipped with trident ii missiles during the 
1990s as they brought in for overhauls 
the navy plans to build 24 trident subs and buy nearly 900 
trident ii missiles according to arkin whose organization favors 
killing the missile program 
in an interview arkin said the rocky flats shutdown is 
interfering with other nuclear weapons programs including the 
tomahawk sealauched cruise missile the stealth airlaunched 
cruise missile and the b61 and b83 gravity bombs

soviet citizens are split down the middle on 
whether government should be responsible for peoples wellbeing or 
individuals should be responsible for themselves a new poll finds 
a poll of 2500 soviets also found that the minority group a 
person belongs to not age education or communist party 
membership governs soviet thought on many issues 
the poll released wednesday by former president jimmy carters 
public policy center found 46 percent of respondents favored the 
traditional communist idea that the state is responsible for 
people 45 percent said responsibility fell to individuals 
many of those who want rapid change to solve social problems 
also hold the state responsible for individual wellbeing wrote 
ada finifter a michigan state university political science 
professor in a summary of the findings the fact that so many 
others believe in individual responsibility makes it likely that 
there will be shifting and unstable majorities for various reform 
efforts she said 
the national center for public opinion research in moscow helped 
direct the poll with american researchers from the university of 
pennsylvania michigan state and the atlantabased carter center 
which is affiliated with emory university 
pollsters conducted 90minute interviews with 2485 soviet 
citizens in their homes last november and december carter who 
commented briefly as the poll was presented called it the first 
ever definitive poll conducted in the soviet union 
the soviet union covers about half of europe and 40 percent of 
asia russianspeaking people live in every part of the country but 
are just one of more than 100 national groups they make up only 
about 53 percent of the population 
the pollsters said deep divisions among ethic groups could spell 
trouble for those seeking change 
there is no question that the policies and reforms that will 
be implemented have to be so crafted as to take into account 
the fact that on the most fundamental and deeply felt questions 
the peoples of the soviet union inhabit vastly different worlds 
wrote ellen mickiewicz a carter center fellow and political 
science professor at emory 
the poll found that only 1 percent of the baltic residents but 
29 percent of russians said the soviet army always acted in the 
interests of the people since the poll was taken one of the 
baltic republics lithuania has proclaimed its independence 
communist party membership did not guarantee support of party 
policies the poll found only 25 percent of party members polled 
expressed full confidence in the party and 12 percent expressed no 
confidence party members were somewhat more supportive of rapid 
change than nonmembers the pollsters said 
forty percent said organized religion always acted in their best 
interests and 7 percent said it never does but 38 percent gave no 
answer among soviet georgians who include a heavy moslem 
minority 69 percent gave high marks to religion 
nationwide 54 percent said they support free speech even at the 
cost of political disorder 37 percent said public order should be 
more important only 11 percent of the respondents said they agreed 
with the old order precept of strict income equality 84 
percent want to permit varying incomes 
pollsters said that because some soviet polling methods differ 
from those in the united states no margin of error was assigned to 
the study

south africa will propose a new 
constitutional plan in talks with black leaders that includes 
measures ensuring the political participation of whites a cabinet 
minister said today 
ministers from the whiteminority government plan to hold 
preliminary talks with leaders of the blackled african national 
congress on april 11 
the government will come to the negotiating table with 
definite proposals said minister of constitutional development 
gerrit viljoen 
in later formal negotiations he said the government will 
demand that the white minority is guaranteed political and cultural 
rights in any new government in south africa 
viljoen said the april 11 talks will center on procedural 
arrangements and obstacles standing in the way of formal 
negotiations 
he said the south african delegation will be led by president 
fw de klerk and foreign minister pik botha 
the african national congress has not yet named its delegation 
but it is known that it will be headed by anc leader nelson 
mandela mandela was released from prison and the anc legalized in 
february 
anc leaders have called for national nonracial elections to 
choose delegates to a constitutional convention but the government 
has said that negotiations should include known and proven leaders 
of all political persuasions without necessarily holding elections 
viljoen said leaders participating in the formal negotiations 
will have to show a clear commitment to a peaceful negotiated 
solution and have abandoned violence 
no such requirement has been made for participants in the april 
11 talks and leaders of the ancs military wing are expected to 
participate in the discussions once the government passes 
legislation guaranteeing they will not be arrested 
six days before the talks de klerk is scheduled to meet with 
leaders of black tribal homelands and other black officials not 
connected to the anc

congress is moving toward sweetening an 
already sweet loan deal for israel by slashing millions of dollars 
in fees the united states has always charged other countries 
israel supporters easily won concessions in the house and senate 
on wednesday to lower or eliminate fees normally charged borrowers 
who take advantage of a ussubsidized housing loan program 
the concessions are the first of their kind in the programs 
30year history 
as part of a supplemental money bill that was going before the 
full house today israel would be able to arrange 400 million in 
private loans to build housing for the thousands of soviet jews now 
emigrating under moscows newly loosened policies 
repayment of the loans is to be guaranteed by the us treasury 
making them less risky and therefore obtainable at a lower than 
normal interest rate 
the house foreign affairs committee on wednesday approved a 
provision sponsored by rep howard berman dcalif that would 
allow the united states to charge a maximum loan origination fee of 
onefourth of 1 percent of the loan amount rather than the 1 
percent charged all other borrowers in the program that would save 
israel 3 million 
in addition bermans language would let the government charge 
israel no more than 150000 a year over the life of the 30year 
loan to service the account instead of the normal fee of onehalf 
of 1 percent of the outstanding balance that would save another 
185 million the first year and slightly declining amounts in 
later years 
acting on similar legislation the senate foreign relations 
committee was even more generous it set the same limit on 
origination fees but waived annual service charges entirely 
israel last used the housing guarantee program in the 1970s 
when it obtained eight separate 25 million loans it has paid the 
full fees on those loans said peter kimm of the agency for 
international development who has administered the program for 
most of its 30year life 
but israel supporters successfully argued that the unusually 
large size of the current loan the largest ever under the program 
and israels excellent repayment record entitle it to special 
treatment 
kimm likened the fees to what any homebuyer pays for mortgage 
insurance a sort of risk pool which helps defray the costs to the 
treasury of making good on defaulted loans overall program fees 
will generate about 10 million this year on outstanding loans of 
about 15 billion he said 
even with the fees the loan would be a good deal for israel he 
said 
the borrower gets a loan he could not otherwise obtain under 
far more favorable conditions including a lower interest rate 
he said thats a very good business deal for the borrower and 
theyre anxious to do so even with the fees he said 
in addition to the financial benefits israel also will receive 
waivers of several normal requirements of the program including 
some oversight and a stipulation that 90 percent of housing built 
is targeted to people with belowmedian incomes 
the bush administration has been lukewarm to the loan 
guarantees saying it could accept them only if israel promises not 
to use the money to settle jewish emigres in the disputed occupied 
territories 
israel is the largest recipient of us foreign aid receiving 
3 billion a year in military and economic support in addition 
the us ally receives hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
other special benefits largely because of its clout with congress

hundreds of people today took 
refuge in churches and schools after savage fighting between zulu 
war bands with guns and knives left at least 25 people dead and 
scores injured authorities said 
local reporters described the edendale area of the southeastern 
province of natal as a valley of death following the battle 
between rival groups for control of several villages bodies were 
seen lying in village streets and on hillsides in the rugged 
countryside 
much of the violence has been between supporters of nelson 
mandelas african national congress and mangosuthu buthelezis 
zulubased inkatha party which are fighting for control of black 
townships in the natal province 
buthelezis office said today that the two leaders plan to 
appear together at a monday rally to appeal for peace 
police and hospital officials said at least 25 people had been 
killed and 32 critically injured in two days of bloody clashes 
scores of other people suffered minor wounds and more than 200 
homes were burned the officials said 
a police report today said three people were killed in factional 
fights in other areas during the past 24 hours including two women 
stabbed to death in a battle between rival groups 
about 5000 black trade union members paraded through central 
johannesburg today to protest against government plans to sell off 
state enterprises the chanting marchers some of them carrying 
clubs called for nationalization of the economy to aid poor blacks 
police some of them using tear gas broke up about 2000 
workers taking part in a similar march in pretoria 
in edendale hospital workers said the death toll was higher 
than 25 because some bodies were removed by relatives and the 
deaths not reported the workers spoke on condition of anonymity 
police maj piet kitching said police had been fired on several 
times as they struggled to halt the fighting one police officer 
had been wounded he said 
police commanders said the situation was quiet around edendale 
today but some local journalists said they had reports of clashes 
in remote rural areas south african army troops were helping 
police patrol roads and villages to restore order authorities said 
some roads were blocked by bands of armed men and warned travelers 
not to use them 
hundreds of people mainly women children and old people fled 
their homes as bands of zulus armed with guns knives and sticks 
battled for control of the villages dotting the rugged edendale 
valley frightened people crammed into community halls and schools 
for protection and shelter 
thousands of people stayed away from work today because bus 
service was suspended or because they were too afraid to leave 
their homes some government offices and courts suspended 
operations 
opposition lawmaker pierre cronje of the democratic party 
appealed to president fw de klerk to visit the area to witness 
the devastation cronje said police were unable to stop the killing 
and that the government needed to take drastic action to halt the 
violence 
thousands of zulu fighters from the united democratic front and 
the conservative inkatha movement have been battling around 
edendale since tuesday 
both groups are antiapartheid but inkatha is more tribalbased 
and favors a zulu state 
some 3000 people have been killed in the factional fighting in 
natal since 1986 the latest fighting began after buses bringing 
inkatha supporters back from a rally sunday were stoned by rival 
groups

the palestine press service an arabrun news 
agency that played a key role in reporting the start of the 
palestinian uprising was allowed to reopen today after a twoyear 
closure 
ibrahim karaeen coowner of the agency said police returned 
the key wednesday and that the telephones began working today 
i hope this means that israeli authorities will realize that 
we can make peace only by letting the other side talk and not 
stifling us he said 
the agency was founded in 1977 by karaeen and raymonda tawil 
now a washingtonbased journalist and was long the main source of 
news about palestinian causes for both the israeli media and the 
foreign press 
palestinian journalists said they hoped the move would signal 
more openness toward palestinianowned media which have been 
targeted by authorities as a major source of inciting unrest in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
karaeen said army officials told him the office had been closed 
because authorities believed it had received funding from the plo 
he denied the accusation contending the real issue was the 
agencys ability to report violence and unrest more quickly than 
the army 
the reopening coincided with a marked decrease in antiisraeli 
violence the number of palestinians killed in clashes with 
israelis in february was nine the lowest monthly figure since the 
uprising began on dec 8 1987 
since the uprising started five arabowned news agencies or 
newspapers have been closed six palestinian journalists have been 
deported as uprising activists and 90 arab reporters have been 
detained many without formal charges said radwan abu ayyash head 
of the arab journalists association 
in the west bank a 70yearold arab man died today of stabbing 
and beating injuries he sustained tuesday while trying to protect 
his 32yearold son from a group of axwielding assailants arab 
reports said 
they said the masked youths suspected that said kamous son who 
was killed in the attack had cooperated with israeli authorities 
kamous was the 201st palestinian killed by other arabs since the 
beginning of the uprising in the unrest 669 palestinians have 
been killed by israelis and 43 israelis and three foreigners have 
died 
in baghdad palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafat said palestinians will resort to all possible means to 
achieve their goal of an independent state in the israelioccupied 
territories 
we will enter jerusalem victorious and will raise our flag on 
its walls arafat said at a rally 
i tell them the israeli leaders we will fight you with 
stones with rifles and with alabed arafat said referring to 
the missile which iraq tested in december it is believed capable 
of striking targets within israel 
also today the israeli government lifted a 30year ban on 
contact between amateur radio operators and fellow hobbyists in 
arab countries an official at the communications ministry said 
but israeli radio enthusiasts are likely to meet a wall of 
silence on the other side since most arab countries still bar 
communications with the jewish state 
the ministry official said the measure was taken to permit 
israelis to contact foreigners in arab countries 
arab nations with the exception of egypt ban radio 
communications with israel as part of their overall boycott of the 
jewish state

congress is sailing toward creation of a new 
department of the environment but the proposal ran into trouble 
again at the white house today with a fresh threat of a veto 
the house voted 37155 on wednesday to elevate the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet level the move is intended to give 
the agency greater prestige and influence within the administration 
president bush has said he wants to sign such a measure on earth 
day april 22 but the white house strongly opposes parts of the 
house bill saying they would infringe on the presidents authority 
to manage the executive branch 
the administration particularly opposes a provision that would 
give full autonomy to a new bureau of environmental statistics 
within the department including a requirement that none of its 
technical reports would be subject to administration review 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
president needs the authority to run his cabinet as best he sees 
fit he said the house version gives a degree of independence 
to this unit of the agency which we feel is unconstitutional and 
certainly is not in the best interests of separation of powers and 
presidential authority 
fitzwater added we think we would have a shot at sustaining 
a veto noting that bush has won every veto battle so far 
a similar bill elevating the epa to cabinet rank has been 
approved by the senate governmental affairs committee it has yet 
to be taken up by the full senate which has been preoccupied with 
cleanair legislation 
in addition to creating the governments 15th cabinetlevel 
agency the house bill requires for the first time that the federal 
government comply with the same environmental laws on disposal of 
toxic wastes as industry 
were asking the federal government to live by the same rules 
as everyone else said rep hank brown rcolo he said several 
federal facilities in his state have violated toxic waste disposal 
requirements for years 
the house bill also would require 
the new department of the environment to limit its use of 
private consultants and guard against conflicts of interest 
involving consultants and outside advisory panels 
the director of the independent bureau of environmental 
statistics to be a civil servant who would not be subject to 
dismissal except for malfeasance 
a certain share of senior department officials including 
regional administrators to be nonpolitical appointees 
strengthening of enforcement against polluters including the 
hiring of additional investigators the number of criminal and 
civil investigators would be increased by 30 percent a year over 
five years 
house republicans argued that many of the additional provisions 
were designed to embarrass the president and force him to veto 
the legislation 
were not here to fine tune or micromanage complained 
minority leader robert michel rill 
but rep john conyers dmich a key sponsor of the 
legislation said the bill was intended not only to change the name 
of the epa but to address some of its problems 
the bill will depoliticize the epa provide reliable 
environmental statistics and put a halt to conflicts of 
interests at the agency conyers said in a statement 
conyers cited a 1989 incident in which government scientists 
were directed by the office of management and budget to change 
their congressional testimony on global warming 
neither version of the bill envisions a significant expansion of 
the epa an independent regulatory agency the epa has about 16000 
employees and a budget of 55 billion

tokyo ended a campaign aimed at reducing city 
garbage with a trash bash thursday that featured a fashion show 
of used clothing appliances plucked from dumps and model 
apartments filled with discarded furniture 
trash was all over the tokyo dome stadium as sanitation 
department employees tried to demonstrate just how much refuse this 
city of 119 million people generates 
one of the displays was a collection of garbage trucks from 
around the world 
the idea was to help people figure out how to produce less trash 
according to department figures tokyo produced 4783 million 
tons of garbage in 1988 that was enough to fill the 55000seat 
dome stadium 15 times over 
more than 6400 garbage collectors in 3547 garbage trucks pick 
up after metropolitan tokyo residents who each throw away a daily 
average of 34 pounds of trash 
tokyo is facing a major crisis said soji agata head of the 
tokyo metropolitan assemblys committee on sanitation we and the 
sanitation department pray every day that our city will not end up 
buried in rubbish 
the tonnage had remained at a stable level for several years 
but it began to grow at a much faster pace in 1985 and continues to 
increase by about 6 percent a year 
the sanitation department says paper trash from computers and 
offices has increased rapidly in recent years and accounts for 
about 42 percent of tokyos garbage 
tokyos 13 trash incineration plants are capable of handling 
only 80 percent of an annual 35 million tons of garbage that can 
be burned

a san francisco travel agencys plans 
to sponsor a nineday third world in america tour has riled 
appalachian tourism directors 
for 500 global exchange will take participants on an excursion 
through virginia west virginia and tennessee on june 1725 to see 
impoverished families crumbling coal mining towns and 
appliancestrewn streams 
i suggest that those folks could save a lot of money and get a 
great dose of third world reality simply by walking through the 
barrio in los angeles west virginia commerce commissioner john 
brown said wednesday 
global exchange which has been in business for 1 years 
specializes in awareness tours to such countries as haiti the 
dominican republic and brazil 
appalachia will be the agencys first domestic trip 
what brings a place alive and what makes it so interesting are 
the people who live there and the problems theyre confronting 
tour coordinator laurie adams said wednesday people would want 
to see how they are dealing with unemployment and environmental 
problems 
adams said global exchange participants are usually students 
community volunteers or government officials interested in meeting 
grassroots activists trying to solve social and environmental 
problems 
one of the reasons we focused on appalachia is there are 
people working hard to solve their problems adams said 
the tentative itinerary includes a visit to a coal mining 
symposium in knoxville tenn talks with members of the commission 
on religion in appalachia in tennessee and a final stop at the 
highlander education and research center in new market tenn 
adams said she also was considering visiting camp solidarity 
the former headquarters for union coal miners in west virginia 
during their 10month strike against pittston coal group inc 
don wick director of information for the tennessee department 
of tourism development said hes afraid the tour will reinforce 
stereotypes he said the real south includes the 
sophisticated and prosperous cities of nashville knoxville and 
chattanooga 
if youre looking for poverty and environmental problems yes 
you can find them in our three states said cindy ford 
spokeswoman for the nashville chamber of commerce but i dont 
think we have any more problems than any other state 
and brown said if they want to visit west virginia they can 
come for the whitewater rafting or to visit one of our state parks 
it might be a chance for them to breathe clean air

president bush proclaiming the government 
on a wartime footing to find a cure for aids today urged an 
end to discrimination against aids sufferers in the workplace 
were in a fight against a disease not a fight against 
people and we will not and we must not tolerate discrimination 
he said in a speech to the national leadership coalition on aids 
bushs comments reflected no new policy initiatives on the 
deadly disease nor did he address the controversial issue of 
immigration restrictions on people infected with the aids virus 
instead he touted the 35 billion he is seeking this year to 
fund aids treatment education and research at the national 
institutes for health in bethesda md and the centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
were on a wartime footing at nih and cdc tonight like every 
night the lights will burn late in bethesda and atlanta as a 
group of american pioneers work to solve this problem if they do 
i should say when they do it will be one of the greatest things 
our nation could do for the world 
bush was interrupted several times by aids activists 
urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force waved a sign reading talk is cheap aids funding is 
not vaid who was escorted out by security personnel later said 
she thought bush said some good things but should have addressed 
the immigration issue 
bush eventually paused and interrupted his speech to say that he 
hoped he could help the protesters understand that not only you 
care but we care too and im going to continue to do my very very 
best 
five protesters were arrested before bush arrived when they 
tried to gain admittance to the conference to hear the presidents 
speech 
bush called for compassion stating that he and his wife 
barbara have lost friends to the disease friends for whom their 
love was just as great and just as intense as for anyone lost to 
heart disease or cancer or accidents 
bush called on congress to pass legislation barring 
discrimination against those infected with the virus and he urged 
business executives in his audience to keep hivinfected people in 
the workforce 
they can serve many more productive years with no threat to 
you your other workers or your companies he said 
the president consulted this morning with members of his 
presidential commission on aids before speaking to the arlington 
audience 
the immigration issue has prompted several organizations to 
announce they will boycott an international conference on aids in 
san francisco this summer because they want bush to lift 
immigration restrictions on aidsinfected people 
the white house however has been trying to deflect the heat to 
congress saying the administration has done all its authority 
allows 
the french and swiss have said they wont send official 
delegations to the sixth international conference on aids in june 
the european parliament also has called on european scientists 
not to attend because of the us immigration policy and other 
organizations including the league of red cross and red crescent 
societies have declined to participate 
aids activists had hoped bush would use his appearance today 
before the national business leadership conference on aids his 
first major speech on aids to address the visa issue but he did 
not mention it 
the immigration restriction was ordered by congress which 
passed legislation in 1987 directing that infection with hiv the 
human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids be added to the 
list of contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from 
entering the united states 
the white house last year adopted a policy granting 30day 
waivers for people to attend conferences or get medical attention 
it also has expedited waivers for people planning to attend the san 
francisco conference 
the waiver process was designed to ensure confidentiality with 
no permanent identifying mark on a persons passport said white 
house spokeswoman alixe glen 
but administration officials say thats as far as they can go 
we have done everything within our executive powers to 
facilitate travel to this country for the conference ms glen 
said 
as to hiv being on the list of excludable diseases its a 
congressional law its up to congress to change it she said 
some lawmakers dispute the white houses interpretation of the 
law and say the administration unilaterally can remove hiv 
infection from the list 
the federal centers for disease control has indicated it wants 
to remove hiv infection from the list because there is no medical 
reason to exclude hivinfected people from entering the country 
legislation is being drafted by rep nancy pelosi dcalif to 
direct the department of health and human services which includes 
cdc to review and revise the list said steve morin the 
congresswomans legislative assistant for health policy but he 
said nothing will happen without input from the white house 
dana van gorder an organizer of the aids conference said 
several thousand potential participants are boycotting the event 
which had expected to register 12000 participants 
groups that have said they will boycott the conference are from 
france austria brazil england spain west germany norway 
denmark sweden and canada also canceling were the national gay 
and lesbian task force the international association of people 
with aids and the international planned parenthood foundation

a coalition of national groups called thursday 
for steppedup government research on aging to fight the illnesses 
that rob the elderly of their independence 
the task force for aging research funding said the nation is 
pouring increasing amounts of money into sick care for older 
americans while it fails to adequately finance research to help the 
elderly stay healthy 
the coalition called for federal spending of 1 billion a year 
on aging research bringing the spending level up to par with that 
for other major health concerns such as cancer aids and heart 
research 
the alliance for aging research which is leading the coalition 
issued a report warning that the gaps in federal research are 
placing the successful aging and independence of older americans at 
risk 
the successes in health and medicine in the 20th century have 
primarily saved lives in youth and middle age it said 
advances affecting the cure and prevention of chronic illnesses 
in late life have been few 
john l steffens the alliances chairman and president and 
chief executive officer of merrill lynch consumer markets said the 
nation pays a heavy price for its inability to cure or prevent 
alzheimers disease osteoporosis urinary incontinence breast 
cancer arthritis and other conditions that affect the elderly 
research that will help us avoid these illnesses and the costs 
they bring is the most effective investment we can make steffens 
said 
ed truschke president of the alzheimers association said 
alzheimers alone costs the nation more than 90 billion a year 
yet the government spends just 130 million a year seeking a cure 
research is the only way to control the skyrocketing cost of 
alzheimers disease he said 
the alliance report said that as the baby boom generation turns 
into the senior boom in the next century older americans will 
account for onehalf of a health care bill approaching 2 trillion 
a year 
americans age 65 and older represent more than 12 percent of the 
population and those 85 and older represent the fastestgrowing 
segment of the population by 2020 the over65 population is 
expected to more than double to more than 65 million the report 
said

america will shed some light on its evenings 
starting sunday 
thats right its time once again to switch to daylight saving 
time 
that means moving the clock ahead one hour you remember 
spring forward 
the change means later sunsets so people can enjoy working on 
gardens or outdoor projects playing sports having barbecues or 
just idly relaxing outside 
for the record the official change occurs at 2 am sunday 
local time 
most folks are scofflaws though making the change before 
retiring or in the morning 
the law calls for the change to be the first sunday in april 
since sunday is april 1 this year the switch is as early as can 
be under current rules 
while its known as daylightsaving time the change doesnt 
really save any daylight it just moves it from morning to evening 
that means that some children wind up waiting for school buses 
in the dark in exchange for more time after school to play ball or 
join the family in backyard cookouts 
the idea has been attributed to various people including 
benjamin franklin but it was william willett of england who 
launched the eventually successful campaign for the idea in 1907 
more time for evening recreation less need for costly 
artificial lights and a possible reduction of evening crime were 
cited as major advantages 
it was the energy saving that prompted first use of 
daylightsaving time in germany in 1916 other countries followed 
during world war i returning to standard time afterward and 
resuming daylight time during world war ii 
it was the confusion of a crazyquilt pattern of time 
differences that finally led to the adoption of the us uniform 
time system in 1966 before then local communities decided 
individually for or against daylight time 
today daylight time is in effect in all areas of the country 
except arizona hawaii puerto rico the virgin islands american 
samoa and the part of indiana in the eastern time zone 
surveys have found that daylight time is generally more popular 
in urban areas where the afternoon and evening leisure time is 
appreciated 
rural areas seem to be the focus of opposition largely because 
of the loss of morning light for travel to work and school and 
adjusting to the change in dealing with livestock since animals 
dont observe differences in clocks 
the actual affect on people seems to vary considerably by 
geography 
the standard time zones were set up to be about an hour wide 
that means it should be the same time throughout an area covered by 
the apparent movement of the sun in about an hour 
but even though the clocks display the same times sunrise and 
sunset actually take place on the eastern edge of a time zone about 
an hour before these events arrive at the western edge of the zone 
for example while the time is the same in portland maine and 
detroit the sun will actually rise considerably earlier in maine 
since sunrise is already later by the clock in places like 
detroit that are close to the western parts of time zones shifting 
it another hour later in the summer can cause a certain amount of 
discomfort 
the result is that the annual shift to daylight time is 
generally more popular in places close to the center or eastern 
edge of time zones such as new york washington st louis 
chicago and san francisco 
it may be less appreciated in cities located farther to the west 
in their respective time zones such as atlanta dallas detroit 
cincinnati fargo and boise

the deltawinged pegasus 
rocket designed to put small satellites in orbit after launch from 
an aircraft will have its first flight next week the defense 
department said 
if all goes well the 41000pound rocket will be strapped under 
a b52 and taken to 40000 feet for launch wednesday over the 
militarys western test range according to the pentagons defense 
advanced research projects agency 
the 440pound launch payload dubbed pegsat will be placed in a 
polar orbit of 368 miles 
pegsat will release a small experimental navy communications 
satellite agency spokeswoman jan bodanyi said wednesday 
remaining on the pegsat frame will be an instrument package to 
send data back to scientists about the stress on pegasus and its 
payload as it goes through the atmosphere and into space bodanyi 
said 
two canisters designed to release chemicals to produce an 
artificial northern lights effect also will be aboard 
barium mixed with a small amount of strontium will be released 
over central canada shortly after sunset to allow national 
aeronautics and space administration scientists to study the 
resulting glowing space cloud to learn more about the earths 
magnetosphere and ionosphere 
pegasus developed by virginiabased orbital sciences corp and 
delawarebased hercules aerospace corp is designed to put small 
satellites into orbit cheaply 
the pentagon and nasa want to use pegasus for military and 
science satellites but pegasus also is expected to attract 
business from companies foreign governments and university 
scientists who need a cheap way to put small payloads in orbit 
an orbital science corp official estimated the cost of a 
pegasus launch at between 6 million and 8 million depending on 
how much business it gets

the chemist who said he discovered a way to 
produce nuclear fusion in a lab jar said the overwhelmingly 
negative response to his work from other researchers has shaken his 
faith in science 
stanley pons commented wednesday as the british journal nature 
published a highly critical analysis of his discovery in todays 
edition that was based on measurements by his university of utah 
colleagues 
pons galvanized the science world a year ago when he and a 
colleague announced that they had achieved cold fusion such a 
feat if true would give the world a limitless supply of energy 
two months after last springs announcement michael h salamon 
a physicist at the university who was uninvolved in the research 
set up sensors in pons lab for five weeks to check the nuclear 
output of his cold fusion equipment 
we did not see a peep salamon said in an interview there 
was not an iota not a sniff of conventional fusion occurring we 
saw no neutrons or gamma rays that could be attributed to a fusion 
process 
pons responded that salamons experiment was poorly performed 
and done to please physicists at other universities who were 
unhappy that such an important discovery had been made by a 
chemist not a physicist 
its pretty distressing because most of the allegations in 
the paper are not true pons said in an interview 
he said the physicists ignored energy cells in his lab that were 
producing large amounts of heat and instead set up their monitoring 
equipment to check ones that were making only low amounts he said 
the sensors were also placed at an angle that missed evidence of 
nuclear activity 
they were in the lab for political reasons said pons 
they were embarrassed by this they were embarrassed that a 
chemist had fallen into a nuclear reaction so simply their outside 
colleagues were putting tremendous pressure on them 
pons again defended his research in his remarks today at the 
opening session of a threeday cold fusion conference in salt lake 
city he said more than 200 experiments involving 2000 
measurements have produced excess heat that can only be the result 
of nuclear fusion 
indeed he said a few experiments generated twice the energy 
output that you would expect in a watercooled nuclear fission 
reactor 
on wednesday pons also accused nature of trying to undermine 
his work by publishing negative studies while ignoring supporting 
evidence 
a series of critical editorials in the prestigious journal has 
been part of a drumbeat of unfavorable publicity much of it 
occurring after other scientists could not duplicate pons results 
its strange to me that if people totally disbelieve it why 
do they persist pons asked why dont they leave us alone and 
let us get on with our work are they afraid something is going 
on 
pons said he has lost a year of research because of the need to 
duplicate his initial findings to try to answer the skeptics 
its overwhelming you cant work scientifically in an 
atmosphere like this pons said my confidence in science is 
shaken 
however he said he plans soon to publish three massive 
papers covering heat output from cold fusion in which we hope 
to set the record straight 
others saw the latest report in nature as one more reason to 
doubt claims about cold fusion 
its another nail in the coffin commented ronald parker 
director of the plasma fusion center at massachusetts institute of 
technology they did a very careful search for fusion effects 
and they came up empty 
pons equipment consists of a palladium electrode wrapped in 
platinum and immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide or heavy 
water when electricity is run through the metals proponents say 
deuterium atoms fuse giving off more heat than the energy put in 
nuclear fusion is the reaction that powers the stars 
traditionally scientists have believed that fusion could occur only 
at extremely high temperatures

three people charged with trying to smuggle 
devices for triggering nuclear weapons to iraq appeared in court 
today and two were ordered held without bond until a later hearing 
british authorities also said they were investigating the 
alleged smuggling of naval equipment to iraq but few details were 
released one news report said documents had been seized in two 
british cities and that arrests were expected 
in san diego today an indictment opened in us district court 
charged five people and two britishbased companies with illegally 
exporting electrical components that could be used in the 
detonation of nuclear warheads two of the five people indicted in 
san diego were arrested in london on wednesday 
iraq today denied any involvement in the alleged attempt to 
smuggle the usmade nuclear weapons devices iraq also told 
britains envoy in baghdad that it reserves the right to acquire 
any advanced technology it wants 
president saddam hussein of iraq told a rally in baghdad that 
enemies of the arabs were trying to hinder iraqs march of 
progress he did not specifically mention britain or the 
smuggling case 
in the house of commons foreign secretary douglas hurd today 
indicated britain would not sever diplomatic relations with iraq 
but said britain may pursue some action through the united nations 
security council 
i can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off 
diplomatic relations and no actual advantage hurd said 
the two men and a woman who appeared in uxbridge magistrates 
court in west london today were arrested wednesday following an 
18month investigation by us and british authorities in which 
american companies cooperated 
britains customs and excise department identified the three as 
lebanese engineer toufic fouad amyuni 37 ali ashour daghir 49 a 
company director with dual iraqi and british nationality and 
export executive jeanine celestine speckman 41 a french citizen 
all gave addresses in or near london 
they were charged with being involved in the attempted export of 
40 electrical capacitors with intent to evade the export of goods 
control order 1989 amyuni and daghir were remanded in custody 
until a hearing april 5 while mrs speckman was granted bail she 
is to appear in court may 10 
the san diego indictment also named daghir and mrs speckman 
along with three iraqis karim dhaidas omran wallid issa ahmad and 
dafir alazawi 
the two companies euromac ltd and an affiliated company atlas 
equipment ltd were both operated by daghir according to the 
indictment the document identified mrs speckman as euromacs 
export executive 
omran ahmad and alazawi were identified as representatives of 
an agency of iraqs ministry of industry and military 
industrialization it was not immediately clear whether the three 
men were today 
british customs officials said the devices were seized wednesday 
in a freight shed at londons heathrow airport as they were about 
to be put on an iraqi airways flight to baghdad 
some news reports said that fake devices has been substituted 
for the real ones before customs officials moved in to make the 
arrests 
customs officials in london speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the capacitors are electrical components used in the 
detonation of a nuclear bomb 
hussein in his speech marking palestinian land day did not 
refer directly to nuclear technology or nuclear weapons but he 
attacked unidentified antiarab forces he said were holding back 
iraqs march of progress 
lately iraq has developed longrange missiles thought to be 
capable of delivering a nuclear warhead 
the fires are intensifying whether by aggressions or 
conspiracies but the iraqi people will not be worn down hussein 
said 
british charge daffaires robert kealy was summoned to the 
foreign ministry in baghdad and told by deputy foreign minister 
nizar hamdoun that iraq reserves the right to acquire advanced 
technology from other countries 
the iraqi news agency which reported the meeting also quoted 
hamdoun as criticizing what he called a british campaign against 
the socalled iraqi nuclear program 
the current british campaign is trying to provide the 
groundwork for an israeli aggression on iraq reminding us of the 
year 1981 when israeli jets bombed an iraqi nuclear plant 
an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman also said in a 
statement carried by ina that iraq has the right to take 
measures based on the principle of reciprocity it did not 
elaborate 
relations between iraq and britain have been strained since 
iraqs execution march 15 of farzad bazoft an iranian reporter who 
was working for a british newspaper iraq accused bazoft of spying 
britain reacted by withdrawing its ambassador from iraq but it has 
shown reluctance to let relations with baghdad worsen further 
the british customs and excise office said today that 
investigations were under way in scotland and northwestern england 
into alleged attempts to export naval equipment to iraq but it did 
not elaborate 
press association britains domestic news agency reported that 
two arrests were expected but a customs spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity would not confirm or deny that report 
press association also said authorities seized documents in 
liverpool and edinburgh on wednesday in connection with the alleged 
naval smuggling 
military experts said the capacitors are available only to a 
handful of major powers and their export is strictly controlled 
they recalled two previous smuggling attempts one involving israel 
and the other pakistan both believed to have or to be trying to 
develop nuclear weapons 
gerald kowalsky president of csi technologies inc which made 
the devices seized in london said the san diegoarea company 
cooperated with us and british authorities in the investigation 
kowalsky said in an interview on abcs good morning america 
today that he tipped off authorities when the devices were first 
ordered from london 
the whole object of the sting was to get the parts shipped 
into the uk so they come under british law and then in turn for 
british law to be violated an export had to be attempted he 
told abc 
the massachusetts company egampg said late wednesday that it also 
was cooperating with authorities 
five people were arrested in and around london in the case one 
iraqi national omar latif was served with a deportation order 
another a cypriot with a british passport was released after 
questioning 
in washington the us customs service said sealed indictments 
had already been returned in us district court in san diego

christa mcauliffe never got a chance to 
show schoolchildren the wonders of space but a planetarium built 
in her memory will begin fulfilling her goal this week 
mcauliffe smiles down from a portrait in the lobby of the 26 
million planetarium new hampshires tribute to the concord teacher 
killed with six other crew members when the challenger exploded in 
january 1986 
its almost like we feel she is looking over our shoulders and 
we want her to be proud planetarium director clinton hatchett 
said wednesday everything we do we want to be of the kind of 
excellence that she would want it to be 
her husband steven said the planetarium appears to have 
succeeded 
i know christa would be delighted he said after watching a 
multimedia computergenerated program under the planetariums 
40foot dome and then taking a behindthescenes tour 
he and other guests including gov judd gregg traveled to the 
far reaches of the galaxy watched from the moons surface as a 
lunar lander approached went for a ride inside the human body and 
watched from space as a shuttle approached a space station 
the feeling of motion was so realistic that some of the vips 
invited to the preview held onto arm rests 
it puts disney world to shame gregg said 
mcauliffe said the planetarium captured one of the attributes 
that led the space agency to choose his wife for a shuttle mission 
communicating complex topics in an understandable way 
thats exactly whats happening he said it really 
graphically demonstrates the beauty of science the beauty of math 
its a hard concept to convey by words but it certainly is an easy 
concept the way its been arranged here 
the museum will open to schoolchildren and teachers on friday 
until its official dedication in june the public will be admitted 
only on weekends and holidays and possibly for some weekdays

colombias largest drug cartel 
threatened today to retaliate against the governments renewed 
extradition of trafficking suspects to the united states 
on wednesday the government extradited its 15th suspect since 
its drug war began seven months ago 
the extradition and threat came amid allegations that the 
government was easing its fight with drug traffickers 
we will not remain indifferent in the face of betrayal 
torture and assassinations of our companions said a communique 
signed by the extraditables as the leaders of the medellin drug 
cartel refer to themselves 
the communique was delivered to news media in medellin 
the medellin group is the countrys largest drug cartel and was 
responsible for 263 bombings and other terrorist attacks since the 
governments antidrug crackdown began 
the bombings ended after a truce was declared on jan 17 
on wednesday fernando gutierrez perez was put on a plane bound 
for the united states said diva rojas a spokeswoman for the 
secret police 
gutierrez perez was flown from bogota to miami on a drug 
enforcement administration jet and then flown to phoenix arriving 
shortly before midnight said bill dempsey a spokesman for the 
us marshals service 
he was expected to be arraigned today in phoenix dempsey said 
the us marshals service said gutierrez perez was indicted on 
may 27 1987 in the us district court in phoenix on charges of 
participating in a cocaine smuggling conspiracy in arizona 
california florida colombia and costa rica 
the drug smuggling scheme resulted in the importation of 1256 
pounds of cocaine in february 1987 the marshals service said 
gutierrez perez was arrested in late november by colombia 
officials dempsey said he was not sure why it took so long to 
extradite him although he noted there had been a slowdown in 
extraditions the past couple of months 
ms rojas said in an interview that she had no details about the 
extradition the 15th of a colombian drug suspect since the 
government intensified an antidrug campaign after the aug 18 
assassination of presidential hopeful luis carlos galan 
it was the first drugrelated extradition by president virgilio 
barcos administration since jan 21 and came after speculation 
that the government had suspended the policy as part of secret 
negotiations with traffickers 
on sunday interior minister carlos lemos simmonds resigned 
saying government resolve to fight traffickers had waned 
also wednesday police announced they seized 880 pounds of 
cocaine in a raid on a processing laboratory on colombias southern 
border with ecuador 
the raid tuesday was along the san miguel river the national 
police chief gen miguel gomez said in a communique 
led by pablo escobar the medellin cartel bosses have said they 
would abandon their business and submit themselves to colombian 
justice in exchange for an end to extradition traffickers have 
been able to intimidate or kill judges in colombia to thwart 
justice here 
barco and lemos simmonds said extradition the governments main 
weapon against traffickers was not negotiable 
but there have been allegations that the government has been 
secretly negotiating with the traffickers through intermediaries 
on wednesday two businessmen said they had represented the 
medellin cocaine cartel in talks with the administration 
but administration officials said extraditions were being 
delayed by legal tactics of defense lawyers the government now 
holds 16 suspects wanted on drug charges in the united states 
many top traffickers including escobar remain at large

national hearings on possible changes in the 
pricing methods used in federal milk marketing orders will be held 
later this year agriculture secretary clayton yeutter announced 
today 
in recent years the milk order program has come under 
increasing criticism yeutter said many believe that the 
programs pricing arrangements do not treat dairy farmers in all 
areas of the country fairly 
yeutters announcement and remarks were prepared for a meeting 
in minneapolis minn and released here by the agriculture 
department 
federal marketing orders set minimum prices that handlers or 
bottlers must pay dairy farmers for grade a milk based on the way 
milk is used the highest price is for class i milk used for 
drinking class ii milk used in soft products such as cottage 
cheese yogurt and ice cream is priced lower 
class iii milk at the bottom of the scale is used for hard 
products such as butter hard cheeses and nonfat dry milk 
some of the criticism arises because important elements of the 
orders have not been reviewed at a public hearing for many years 
and changes in marketing conditions may warrant updating them 
yeutter said 
recent studies by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress and the usdas economic research 
service recommended hearings and a comprehensive review of the 
pricing provisions 
yeutter said the plan is for the hearings to be held in several 
regions including the central states upper midwest northeast 
southeast southwest and west he said the first could begin in 
early september

a growing wave of violence is 
threatening south africas fragile stability and there are fears 
it will undermine efforts to build a multiracial democracy 
the violence most of it among black factions flared just as 
the government launched reforms aimed at ending whiteminority 
rule it is frightening whites already nervous about government 
moves toward ending apartheid 
while the reforms announced in february have given radical black 
groups more freedom to stage protests the violence results from 
many causes and frictions 
it reflects the deep divisions in south africa over apartheid 
and poses a major threat to hopes for a peaceful future 
hundreds of people have been killed in clashes in recent weeks 
mostly between rival black political and ethnic factions the 
violence is the worst since major antigovernment protests in the 
mid1980s 
it ranges from factional tribal battles in natal province and 
military coups in the black homelands to clashes between rival 
black political groups and unrest in the black townships 
the causes range from ancient tribal rivalry to conflicting 
views on the countrys future 
there also have been violent confrontations between whites and 
blacks 
in some areas rightwing whites have formed armed and uniformed 
groups that have attacked and beaten blacks involved in political 
activities in one rural town rightwingers have started to take 
the place of the local police 
political analysts say the whiteblack clashes relatively minor 
to this point represent the most serious threat to peace they 
fear a backlash by the powerful 5millionstrong white minority 
against antiapartheid efforts and black violence 
the war in natal with its ghastly death toll the killings in 
townships and the burning of properties and people are raising 
fears of a situation that could get out of hand the citizen 
newspaper said in a march 29 editorial 
a white backlash is grave cause for concern in the 
end we may descend into the kind of beirut situation that would 
destroy this country the newspaper said 
unease among whites is matched by growing militancy among many 
young blacks in the townships radical blacks are reluctant to wait 
for negotiated or gradual reform and are flocking to militant 
groups that talk of seizing power 
the high incidence of unrest points to a revolutionary 
climate and that is dangerous at a time when restraint is 
necessary in order to negotiate one analyst said on condition of 
not being identified 
nelson mandela and other black leaders have had little success 
in curbing the violence 
mandelas african national congress the main black opposition 
group favors negotiated settlement but it is under pressure from 
the pan african congress and more radical groups who oppose a 
negotiated deal 
president fw de klerk faces similar problems in retaining 
white support he stunned the nation in february by legalizing 
black opposition groups then freed mandela after the black leader 
had spent 27 years in prison 
talks between the government and black leaders are scheduled 
april 11 to try to clear the way for fullscale negotiations on 
changing the constitution to give blacks a voice in national 
affairs 
many whites are stunned by the lightning pace of change in south 
africa after some 350 years of white domination they also fear 
demands by black groups for a redistribution of wealth from whites 
to blacks 
the president must persuade a majority of whites to accept the 
end of apartheid if a new political system is to be established 
failure to keep white support would imperil the governments 
chances of reforms

the case of two brothers charged with their 
parents yom kippur murders became a cainandabel tale of betrayal 
as one sibling confessed and agreed to help prosecutors seek the 
death penalty for his brother 
stewart woodman decided to testify against his brother neil 
and two other men in order to save his own life his lawyer said 
wednesday as woodmans surprise decision was announced 
when we began this case it was our earnest desire to be 
certain that stewart woodman would not receive the death penalty 
said attorney jay jaffe 
stewart woodman and i are satisfied that he does not face the 
prospect of being executed in the california gas chamber jaffe 
said he has more years to live and think about what happened 
jaffe called the decision to turn states evidence a cleansing 
of the soul for his client 
the announcement by the 40yearold woodman came the day the 
deathpenalty phase of his trial was to begin he was convicted 
march 7 of two counts of firstdegree murder and one count of 
conspiracy 
the pudgy balding defendant affirmed in a brief superior court 
appearance wednesday that he would testify for the prosecution 
against the three others their trial is set for april 6 
deputy district attorney patrick r dixon said he would 
recommend that stewart woodman be sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of parole if he abides by his agreement to 
testify woodman waived all rights of appeal as part of the deal 
dixon said he would seek the death penalty for neil woodman 46 
and the two alleged hitmen and ruled out agreeing to any type of 
deal for them 
the woodman brothers were accused of hiring assassins to kill 
their parents for their mothers 500000 life insurance policy and 
out of hatred toward their father 
how could they hate their parents so much dixon asked 
during stewart woodmans trial the answer is greed they hated 
their parents 
the prosecutor said relations in the jewish family soured when 
the sons started working in the familys suburban chatsworth 
plastic business and managed to oust their father from the company 
the elder woodmans gerald 67 and vera 63 were ambushed in 
the parking garage of their condominium on sept 25 1985 as they 
returned home from a yom kippur gathering 
the case originally had been tagged the ninja murders 
because the assailants were dressed in black garb similar in 
appearance to that worn by the mythical japanese warriors 
dixon said stewart woodman confessed during a tearfilled 
eighthour videotaped session that was very rich in detail of 
the roles played by other defendants 
another defendant anthony majoy was convicted of the same 
charges as stewart woodman and was to have faced jurors with 
woodman but the prosecutor said he also would recommend life 
without parole for majoy 51 said to have acted as lookout 
stewart woodmans sentencing was set for june 27 and majoys for 
june 29 
in addition to neil woodman the remaining defendants are steven 
homick 49 who was a los angeles police officer for 14 months in 
1963 and 1964 and his 38yearold brother robert homick a los 
angeles attorney 
steven homick the alleged triggerman in the couples killing 
already was sentenced to death for a triple murder in las vegas

hundreds of soldiers and police 
officers stormed a prison today where inmates rioted and set fires 
and one prisoner was killed and 30 people were injured the state 
news agency said 
the report said authorities were forced to open fire on the 
inmates 
the riot at leopoldov prison began wednesday afternoon when 
hundreds of inmates refused to be moved to other prisons they were 
apparently being moved because of poor conditions at the facility 
which repeatedly had caused unrest 
slovak premier milan cic told the official ctk news agency that 
handtohand fighting was required to clear the prison 
he said the facility was virtually destroyed by the fires the 
rioting inmates set to block about 2000 soldiers police officers 
and guards who tried to stop the riot and remove the prisoners 
one inmate at the prison 250 miles east of prague was found dead 
in a ruined building after the inmates were evacuated cic was 
quoted as saying doctors said the prisoner died about four hours 
before troops stormed the prison buildings and he was thought to 
have fallen to his death from a roof 
twentynine prisoners and one prison guard were injured in the 
fighting ctk said without giving details of the wounds 
the news agency said authorities fired their guns but only when 
absolutely necessary the report said all 1200 inmates were 
eventually moved to the kurin jail in bohemia or to prisons in 
slovakia although leopoldov housed hardened criminals and 
murderers it also contained some political prisoners 
most of the prisoners in leopoldov were not affected by the 
presidential amnesty that released more than 20000 lesser 
offenders at the new year just after former political prisoner 
vaclav havel took office as president 
riots were reported at leopoldov in january and the inmates had 
staged sporadic strikes for improved conditions ever since 
since march 1 inmates had occupied their cells and some refused 
food to press demands for abolition of provisions that allowed 
authorities to lengthen the sentences of hardened criminals 
bratislava radio reported on saturday that efforts by 
authorities to reduce the sentences of some inmates and negotiate 
with others had been hampered by what it termed the excessive 
radicalism of some

north dakota officials asked congress on 
thursday to ignore president bushs opposition and finish the 
garrison diversion water project or give us the dam back 
state officials asked house and senate appropriations 
subcommittees to provide 45 million for 1991 construction 15 
million more than it got this year 
the 1 billion projects future is under a cloud because bush 
has proposed cancellation and a recent report by the interior 
departments inspector general said it probably isnt financial 
feasible 
the whole thing is very frustrating north dakota gov 
george sinner told the house panel people teeter on absolute 
outrage at what is taking place 
sinner departed from his prepared remarks to attack the 
inspector generals report which he called badly flawed 
because it doesnt take into consideration the economic and 
environmental benefit the project will provide the state 
the inspector general said the farmers who would get irrigation 
water from the project will have to pay a larger share of the 
construction cost than they can afford 
the interior department must develop an acceptable plan for 
allocating the construction costs before the government can sign a 
repayment contract with the conservancy district without the 
contract no additional money can be spent on building irrigation 
facilities 
we are owed this project said rep byron dorgan dnd 
give us this project or give us the dam back 
charles richter chairman of the garrison diversion conservancy 
district said we ask the congress to not add to the litany of 
broken promises and committments to the state of north dakota 
we agree with you that the government ought to keep this 
commitment and i hope we will be able to work with you on this 
said the panels chairman rep tom bevill dala 
although the administrations official position is that the 
project is uneconomical interior secretary manuel lujan agreed 
wednesday to form a working group representing the congressional 
delegation and the administration to discuss ways to continue 
construction

president bush declared his administration 
on a wartime footing against aids thursday and called for 
compassion not discrimination toward people infected with the 
virus 
our goal is to turn irrational fear into rational acts he 
said in his first major presidential address on aids for bush it 
was an unusually personal speech 
addressing the national leadership coalition on aids he said 
that education is the key to curbing the spread of the deadly 
disease 
every american must learn what aids is and what aids is not 
he said 
bush presented no new policy initiatives instead spotlighting 
as unprecedented his proposed 35 billion in federal spending on 
aids research treatment and education 
aids activists dismiss the proposal although it would 
drastically escalate the federal commitment to the fight against 
aids as a small fraction of what is needed to find a cure and to 
treat victims 
bush vowed to press further research at the national institutes 
of health in bethesda md and the centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
were on a wartime footing at nih and cdc tonight like every 
night the lights will burn late in bethesda and atlanta as a 
group of american pioneers work to solve this problem 
bush urged business executives in his audience not to fire 
employees infected with hiv the human immunodeficiency virus that 
causes aids these people he said deserve the same compassion as 
others who are sick 
there is only one way to deal with an individual who is sick 
with dignity compassion care confidentiality and without 
discrimination he said 
once disease strikes we dont blame those who are suffering 
we dont spurn the accident victim who didnt wear a seat belt we 
dont reject the cancer patient who didnt quit smoking we try to 
love them and care for them and comfort them we do not fire them 
or evict them or cancel their insurance 
bush urged congress to get on with the job of passing a law 
to prohibit discrimination against people infected with aids or hiv 
were in a fight against a disease not a fight against 
people he said 
the president said he and his wife barbara have lost friends 
to the disease 
our love for them when they were sick and when they died was 
just as great and just as intense as for anyone lost to heart 
disease or cancer or accidents the president said 
he expressed empathy with families of aidsinfected babies 
recalling the death of his own 4yearold daughter from leukemia 
we asked the doctor the same question every hiv family must ask 
why why this was happening to our beautiful little girl he said 
two aids activists in the audience tried repeatedly to interrupt 
bush they eventually were escorted out by security personnel 
why did it take you 14 months to say this one man shouted 
when bush said federal support for the aids fight had risen from 
8 million to almost 35 billion the heckler snapped too 
little too late 
urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force waved a sign reading talk is cheap aids funding is 
not she later said bush had had some good comments but should 
have talked about immigration restrictions on aids sufferers 
bush did not mention the controversy which involves a 1987 
congressional directive that hiv infection be added to the list of 
contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from entering the 
united states 
bush departed from his text to tell the hecklers i can 
understand the concern that these people feel and i hope that if 
we do nothing else by coming here i can help them understand that 
not only do you care but we care too 
the president spoke to the audience of 500 business and health 
executives and aids activists in a ballroom where the walls were 
covered with several of the colorful quilts that memorialize the 
nations 70000 aids dead 
bush who was out of town when the full aids quilt was displayed 
on the mall recently called it an amazing sight 
one quilt showed balloons each bearing a name another bore the 
names and badge numbers of two san francisco policemen and six 
sheriffs deputies

authorities on thursday arrested a 
retired deputy interior minister who ran a camp in northern 
bulgaria in which hundreds of prisoners may have been killed during 
todor zhivkovs regime 
the arrest of 80yearold gen mincho spassov followed a series 
of reports about the camp that have stirred memories of stalinist 
repression 
the arrest tersely reported by the state news agency came a 
day after spassov told the communist party daily rabotnichesko delo 
that he visited the camp in lovech only once 
the military prosecutors office said it was holding spassov in 
connection with events at lovech and another camp near sofia and 
on charges of aiding and abetting embezzlement when he was head of 
the communist party office overseeing foreign travel 
the communist party daily meanwhile quoted a former guard at the 
lovech camp tsvyatko goranov as saying spassov visted lovech once 
or twice a week during the period from 1959 to 1962 
he would always tell us work them to death recalled the 
guard he said windows have been smashed at his home and graffiti 
reading living butcher daubed on his walls since the 
disclosures about lovech began to emerge 11 days ago 
the reports in staterun and independent media are part of a 
general probe of the past since zhivkov bulgarias stalinist 
leader for 35 years was ousted in november 
tales of how zhivkov and his fellow communists jailed and 
sometimes murdered political opponents have come into the open 
but none of the reports has been so shocking to bulgarians as 
those about lovech where hundreds of prisoners were reported 
clubbed to death tied in sacks and even fed to pigs at a nearby 
camp 
the disclosures could add to eventual charges against zhivkov 
who is being held pending an investigation of his actions 
spassov told rabotnichesko delo that zhivkov must have known 
about the torture everybody knew he said 
but until march 18 when a popular sunday news program broke the 
story of lovech most bulgarians did not know the torture and 
murder at lovech had been chronicled only in a secret 1962 report 
for the top echelons of the communist party 
president petar mladenov and other top communists have now 
called for investigations by the prosecutorgeneral into the doings 
at lovech and other camps and prisons which were run by the 
interior ministry 
meanwhile rabotnichesko delo the independent daily 
demokratsiya and tv have brought new reports each day 
an exconvict bozhidar petrov telling of his 14 months in 
hell in lovech from jan 1961 to march 1962 charged in one 
newspaper interview that about 1000 prisoners died in the camp 
another former prisoner valter vasilev put the death toll at 
300 in his account of lovech in rabotnichesko delo a capt gazdov 
said to have been one of the three security officers running the 
camp says about 150 people died 
petrov said prisoners faced daily torture if they did not meet 
the nearimpossible work quotas set at the camp wounds from daily 
beatings were left untreated and festered so badly that worms 
crawled in them he claimed 
at least two prisoners were driven to suicide by the cruelty 
petrov told demokratsiya 
the accounts about lovech mark another stage in bulgarias 
gradual break with its stalinist past 
after the hungarian uprising in 1956 bulgarias worried 
communist leadership began rounding up political prisoners petrov 
said one camp inmate who died at lovech while he was there was a 
sofia violin player imprisoned for telling a joke 
torture and murder at lovech and possibly at other camps 
appear to have peaked in the late 1950s and early 1960s the 
cultural thaw and destalinization in the soviet union under 
nikita s khrushchev at that time apparently prompted zhivkov to 
close the camps

a house subcommittee voted thursday to 
continue the peanut price support program virtually intact for 
another five years after talks among industry groups seeking 
changes broke down 
the bill would allow the 631 per ton support price for 
domesticuse peanuts to increase up to 6 percent a year as the cost 
of production increases 
the bush administration had proposed a 20 percent reduction in 
the support price and the elimination of the annual price escalator 
however debate in the agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and 
peanuts focused on negotiations that have been going on for months 
between peanut growers and manufacturers 
rep charles hatcher dga who initiated the talks said the 
effort to reach a compromise failed when growers outside of georgia 
refused to accept demands from manufacturers in three major areas 
the manufacturers he said wanted the support price adjusted 
every two years instead of annually although they agreed to a 
biennial increase of up to 12 percent 
they also insisted on changes dealing with peanut quality and 
regulatory complexity hatcher said and they demanded creation of 
a committee of representatives from all segments of the industry to 
advise the secretary of agriculture on peanut regulations 
hatcher said georgia growers who produce 45 percent of the 
nations peanuts were willing to accept the manufacturers demands 
in exchange for their support to continue the supply management 
program with a 631 per ton support price and a price escalation 
clause 
but other grower groups would not agree he said and unless a 
compromise can be reached in the next few weeks peanut growers 
face a potential repeat of the 1981 and 1985 farm bill debates 
when manufactuers tried to kill the peanut program on the house 
floor 
peanuts and tobacco are the only commodities in which the 
government price support program is based on a supply management 
concept 
the secretary of agriculture each year determines the volume of 
peanuts needed to meet domestic demand then divides that quota 
among farmers who produced peanuts for domestic use in previous 
years 
farmers with government quotas are guaranteed the 631 per ton 
support price while other peanut farmers who produce for the 
export market are guaranteed about 150 a ton for their peanuts

stars his friend danny glover when director steven hopkins 
suddenly appeared 
hopkins told an embarrassed blades it was time to begin shooting 
his scene then he stood in front of the abctv camera and yanked 
the earplug from blades ear and ordered him back on the set 
as you can see a startled lunden told viewers the 
director of the film carries a lot of weight 
viewers could hear blades say sorry as the microphone was 
removed from his chest 
well it is a movie about violence said lunden who filled 
in the remaining time with anecdotes about the hazards of live 
television interviews 
i think people are very understanding of the uncertainties of 
live television said cohost charles gibson

from 13 to 26 have written raps for other community projects 
the 1990 complete count project a milwaukee effort to increase 
minority participation in the census could help keep wisconsin

ada gremlins but norquist who frequently sings at the citys 
summer festivals left the rapping to the youngsters

julie a smit is trying to save face by putting a 
new wrinkle into efforts to prevent wrinkles 
with a little help from her mother smit invented the face saver 
pillow which she believes can forestall wrinkles caused by a 
pillows surface pressing into delicate facial tissue 
the pillow has a concave cutout portion so theres nothing to 
rub against the nose and eye area which smit says is particularly 
sensitive 
it makes sense especially if you squish your face into the 
pillow at night said smit 34 people sleep eight to 12 hours 
they get up and look in the mirror and see wrinkles 
i sleep on my side and my face presses into the pillow she 
said i noticed wrinkles on that side 
dr paul lazar a dermatologist said the pillow probably has no 
medical value although it would take an elaborate medical study to 
prove it 
i can tell you this i wouldnt buy it lazar said 
smit and her mother helen also have teamed up on other 
inventions including a stuffed animal that doubles as a hot water 
bottle and hats made of the kind of mesh used in window screens

rocky as the symbol of the boggy bayou mullet festival after a 
dispute over copyright control of the old logo 
wayne goodson had sought royalties for commercial use of his 
cartoon fish mascot he said he feared that the mascots cleancut 
image might be diluted by things like putting beer mugs in rockys 
fins which are covered with boxing gloves and raised as in 
sylvester stallones movie rocky 
the festivals committee wanted anyone to be able to use the 
logo without restriction for maximum exposure rather than fight 
goodson the committee decided to switch selecting buckshot from 
about 50 entries tuesday 
buchshot is the creation of jack thompson 64 a retired air 
force and navy man from nearby seminole who also created emblems 
for several military outfits instead of boxing gloves the new 
mascot holds a fiddle and wears bib overalls and a straw hat 
it kind of went country because we have a small town 
thompson said 
actually two small towns the festival is celebrated in 
niceville and neighboring valparaiso 
rejected entries included a mermaid dog pelican pink 
flamingo a mullet wearing a camouflage hat and hunting vest and a 
cat carrying a mullet in its mouth mullets named mikie millie and

a judge has ruled that jesus christ was 
innocent of the charges that sent him to his death at the hands of 
roman authorities in galilee two millennia ago a newspaper in this 
southern city reported thursday 
judge eduardo rodriguez told the ideal newspaper the idea to 
symbolically overturn christs conviction on charges of political 
rebellion came to him while he was preparing a prayer for 
traditional passion week ceremonies 
i consider myself almost a blasphemer because im nobody to 
judge christ the daily quoted him as saying but my intention 
was to give jesus of nazareth a just sentence and teach a lesson to 
those who judged him 
jesus of nazareth was crucified under roman law around the year 
30 after being condemned as a political rebel 
if that trial had been held with all the due guarantees he 
would have been absolved among other reasons because nobody was 
defending him he only had accusers rodriguez said 
he used biblical texts to prepare the case and concluded his 
ruling by asking jesus for forgiveness

the centers for disease control said today its 
longawaited study of agent orange shows vietnam veterans at 
increased risk of only one type of cancer and no evidence 
that the risk stems from exposure to the dangerous herbicide used 
in the war 
the study which had been criticized by veterans groups even 
before it was released focused on vietnam veterans and cancer and 
only indirectly evaluated agent orange exposure the cdc said 
but it added that the cancer risk among the vets in the study 
seemed to be the opposite of the pattern for use of agent 
orange veterans who served on navy ships were somewhat more 
likely to get cancer than those who served on land and veterans 
who served in the region of heaviest agent orange use were at 
somewhat lower risk than others the cdc said 
agent orange sprayed by the us military to remove jungle and 
crops in vietnam contained dioxin a highly toxic chemical that 
some studies have found to increase the risk of cancer 
the cdc study conducted over five years surveyed male cancer 
patients who were the right age to have served in vietnam whether 
they did serve or not they were compared with a group of similar 
males with no history of cancer 
the patients medical records were examined for six kinds of 
cancer including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas a group 
of cancers which the cdc concedes has been of great concern among 
vietnam veterans 
vietnam vets were found to be at a roughly 50 percent increased 
risk for nonhodgkins lymphoma a relatively rare cancer of 
the lymphatic system the cdc said 
the study did not find any evidence that the increased risk 
might be due to agent orange exposure said cdc director william 
l roper 
there was no evidence the cdc reported that 
nonhodgkins lymphoma was more likely to develop in one group of 
vietnam veterans than in another 
specifically the yearly risk of nonhodgkins lymphoma is about 
one in 10000 for men 35 to 59 the age group of most vietnam vets 
the risk for vietnam vets is about 15 per 10000 roper said 
but the cdc found no increased risk for sarcomas usually 
cancers of the bodys connective tissues or for other cancer types 
the veterans administration has been awaiting the study before 
making its decision on whether to award benefits to veterans 
exposed to agent orange nearly 35000 claims have been filed 
citing the chemical as a cause of disabilities including cancer 
skin disease and miscarriages by veterans wives 
veterans secretary edward j derwinski said today that based on 
the study he would order compensation paid to veterans suffering 
from nonhodgkins lymphoma 
derwinski in announcing the move in washington mentioned only 
the link between vietnam service and the lymphoma he did not say 
the connection was because of agent orange 
his announcement speeds up va action on the findings the agency 
had said it would submit the study to a review panel 
american legion officials told their vietnam veteran members in 
advance of todays announcement that they should not be too 
optimistic about this study which was mandated by congress 
the government has ducked the issue of agent orange for more 
than a dozen years said the legions national commander miles 
s epling we are tired of waiting for more studies especially 
irrelevant ones 
the legion has accused cdc of ignoring military records that 
could have produced a more detailed study 
the cdc study found that the risk of nonhodgkins lymphoma was 
nearly double 90 percent higher for navy veterans stationed on 
ocean ships than for nonveterans that was the only statistically 
significant risk for any branch of service said dr daniel a 
hoffman assistant director for science at the cdcs center for 
environmental health 
for all veterans the 50 percent higher risk of that type of 
cancer is what epidemiologists call a weak association hoffman 
said while statistically significant anything less than a 
twofold increase can sometimes be caused by other factors he 
said 
the cdc study did not suggest reasons for the increased risk for 
one cancer over another or for the increased risk among navy 
sailors at sea 
the study did not include blood tests to determine the actual 
amount of dioxin that might remain in the cancer patients 
bloodstream two decades or more after military service 
hoffman said such tests were not a practical way to determine 
dioxin exposure because it is possible that test findings might be 
tainted by the patients illness itself

in a hushed voice a boy told a judge how 
he molested two preschoolers one while babysitting in her home 
and the other in a church nursery and then threatened to kill the 
children if they told anyone 
david hawkey pleaded guilty wednesday to two counts of 
firstdegree criminal sexual conduct his 14th birthday was 
thursday 
muskegon county prosecutor tony tague said the boy has told 
police he raped molested and fondled at least 55 children between 
the ages of 18 months and 4 years while he worked as a volunteer at 
fruitport bethel baptist church from 1985 to 1988 
but tague said he would not pursue further charges against the 
boy partly because of the ages of the children involved and the 
time elapsed since the molestations 
juvenile court judge neil mullally ordered the boy returned to a 
residential sex offender treatment program and postponed sentencing 
for 90 days pending a progress report the boy faces a maximum 
penalty of detention in a youth home until his 19th birthday 
david spoke quickly and quietly when mullally asked him to 
describe how he molested a 4yearold boy in the closet of the 
church nursery sometime between january and june 1988 and the 
3yearold girl in her ottawa county home in november 1988 
i said if she told what i just did to her id kill her the 
youth said in court adding that he made a similar threat to the 
4yearold 
davids 17yearold brother paul also has been charged with 
firstdegree criminal sexual conduct he is accused in juvenile 
court of molesting a 4yearold boy between january and march 1988 
at the church where he also volunteered tague said additional 
charges against the brother are possible before his june trial 
paul hawkey who remains free and lives with his father in 
nunica has denied the charge 
the boys mother connie kersting filed for divorce from dennis 
hawkey in 1988 
mullally ordered the entire hawkey family to undergo counseling 
the rev clay nuttall who was pastor of the church at the time 
of the molestations has said the father often brought home 
hardcore pornography to which the children were exposed 
the parents who were in the courtroom wednesday have declined 
to comment on their childrens cases 
davids attorney gerald gibbs said his client pleaded guilty 
because he wanted to put the case behind him 
he pleaded guilty because he is guilty because he doesnt 
want a trial because he doesnt want his victims to have to appear 
at trial and because he is already in treatment gibbs said 
david has been undergoing courtordered treatment at bethany 
christian services in grand rapids since last summer after pleading 
guilty to seconddegree criminal sexual conduct for molesting a 
young boy in his care at the church in march 1988 
as part of his treatment he was urged to identify any other 
victims as his treatment progressed he admitted to molesting 
dozens of other children at the church he also implicated his 
brother authorities said 
the confessions given to authorities so the other children 
could get treatment were made public last month in the muskegon 
chronicle soon after tague issued warrants for the additional 
counts 
tague whose department has been investigating the allegations 
of widespread abuse for six months said david has been cooperating 
with police

six major record companies plan to create an 
album labeling system so retailers and purchasers can identify 
explicit recordings 
the label reading parental advisory explicit lyrics 
does not mean that the music industry is buckling to pressure 
groups complaining about sexual and violent songs officials said 
at a recent convention here of the national association of 
recording industry merchandisers 
this will absolutely remain a voluntary decision to be 
determined solely by the label said trish heimers vice 
president of the recording industry association of america 
more than a dozen states are considering record censorship 
bills said executives at the narim meeting 
the labeling decision may not solve the controversy some 
retailers said adding they were fearful that legislation wont be 
derailed 
this legislation will put an impossible burden on us and the 
record manufacturers have ducked the problem said stanley gold 
of shamrock holdings which owns music plus stores this should 
be an easy area of cooperation but i see little progress being 
made

the soviet army offered amnesty 
thursday to lithuanian deserters who return to their units in what 
appeared to be a first step toward compromise in the crisis over 
lithuanias independence drive 
the decision announced by the defense ministry general staff 
came a day after lithuania offered two compromises it suspended a 
plan to institute its own border guard and it told citizens not to 
resist soviet attempts to seize their firearms 
both sides seemed to be yielding in the war of wills over 
lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence the strongest 
defiance of mikhail s gorbachev in his five years as soviet leader 
i think lithuania is seeking a way out and i think gorbachev 
is seeking a way out said algirdas brazauskas head of the 
lithuanian communist party which split with moscow in december 
but the war of words did not die down entirely 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis asked about the 
defense ministrys offer said i dont have much trust in this 
promise there have been instances where very high military 
officials have lied 
lithuanian leaders are angry that the military said nothing 
before arresting 23 deserters tuesday they said the military had 
agreed to discuss any such move in advance 
defense ministry officials told tass that lithuanians who left 
the soviet armed forces when their republic declared independence 
would not be punished if they resumed their military service 
however those who continue to hide will be searched out 
detained and be subject to criminal punishment in accordance with 
current law they said 
red army soldiers on tuesday stormed two psychiatric hospitals 
in lithuania to apprehend deserters witnesses said some of the 
deserters and a policeman who tried to stop the detentions were 
beaten 
the lithuanian prosecutors office said thursday it had opened a 
criminal investigation into the beating of the police officer the 
republics interior ministry said the policeman sustained a 
concussion 
lt gen frants markovsky of the military general staff told 
tass a special military commission had been set up to track down 
deserters 
soviet officers visited the families of 97 soldiers who 
deserted and in 40 cases were told the soldiers would return 
markovsky told tass in 42 other cases parents said they were 
willing to help the military but did not know where their sons 
were markovsky said 
no reasoning and appeals for common sense and for parental 
wisdom however worked with the parents of the other 15 
deserters he said 
markovsky said 51 soldiers already had returned to their units 
soviet officials estimate 250 lithuanian soldiers have deserted 
lithuanian figures put the number at about 900 
wednesday was the deadline for lithuanians to comply with 
gorbachevs order issued last week to turn in their firearms or 
have them seized 
deputy interior minister vaclavas zabarauskas said thursday that 
only 1500 of the 30000 registered guns had been turned in local 
officials have said they will not cooperate with moscow to collect 
them 
lithuanias chief prosecutor arturas paulauskas said a general 
of the soviet interior ministry vladimir maximov had arrived in 
vilnius to take charge of the collection of guns 
i gave him maximov a warning that using force to break into 
homes is a violation of the law paulauskas said he said i 
am here to fulfill gorbachevs order but i dont know how hes 
going to do it 
tass said the signup for a volunteer lithuanian territorial 
defense border guard continued in the port of klaipeda and in 
lithuanias secondbiggest city kaunas despite lithuanian 
leaders assurances it was being suspended 
landsbergis meanwhile appealed again for the us congress to 
extend recognition to lithuania which was forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 
support for lithuania is support for freedom and democracy in 
eastern europe he said in a telegram to congressmen and 
senators this support would also undoubtedly help mr gorbachev 
it would stop him from making a great mistake 
czechoslovakias state news agency reported thursday that 
president vaclav havel had offered his country as a neutral site 
for talks between gorbachev and landsbergis 
the offer came in a telegram sent to the two men the ctk news 
agency reported 
it reported the telegram said any forms of force including a 
mere threat can severely damage the peaceful arrangement in 
europe 
the government of iceland on thursday also offered to mediate 
the dispute and provide a venue for possible talks between 
lithuania and the soviet union

libya has conducted inflight refueling tests 
for jet fighterbombers a key step for increasing the range of 
moammar gadhafis military aircraft throughout the middle east 
pentagon sources said thursday 
pentagon spokesman pete williams declined to confirm the report 
of such tests publicly but said such a development would be 
troubling to us officials 
obviously it would be a matter of very serious and deep 
concern to the united states williams said when queried about 
the report 
a pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
thursday that the libyans have been working on this for quite 
some time 
we consider it a serious matter said the source 
the administrations concern about libya obtaining such 
capabilities have been compounded in light of recent reports that 
the middle eastern nation has been producing chemical weapons 
last year administration officials reported that the soviet 
union had sold libya 6 su24 fencers highperformance 
fighterbombers that can be refueled in flight this would allow 
the jets to conduct longrange strikes posing a potential threat 
to several nations in the region including israel 
according to a report published thursday in the new york times 
the recent libyan test involved a mirage f1 and an americanmade 
c130 transport plane that had been converted into a refueling 
tanker 
during the test the report said a refueling probe mounted on 
the c130 was connected to the mirage on four out of six attempts 
but it wasnt clear whether fuel was actually transferred during 
the maneuver 
libya also has tried to obtain an aerial refueling system from

ussupported rebels said they shot down a government supply 
plane killing all 25 people aboard 
in france the foreign ministry announced that a french 
technician abducted by angolan rebels died during a long rugged 
march with his captors through the southern african country 
angolas state airline confirmed a plane was lost and was 
investigating the cause of the crash the other claims could not 
immediately be verified the rebels have been fighting to share 
power with luandas sovietbacked government since shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
angolas state news agency angop said 270 guerrillas of jonas 
savimbis national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita were killed in fighting in six provinces in central and 
southern provinces last week the report said 37 government 
soldiers were killed and 63 wounded in the fighting 
the rebels released a statement in lisbon saying they shot down 
a government supply plane tuesday as it flew from huambo to cuito 
the capital of central bie province they said all 25 people on the 
plane died 
the portuguese news agency lusa reported from luanda that a

the senate today narrowly rejected a 500 
million assistance plan for coal miners despite pleas from senators 
from highsulfur coal states that tougher pollution controls would 
drive thousands of miners out of work 
the senators rejected the amendment offered by sen robert byrd 
dwva by a vote of 5049 
the vote was a major victory for senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and the white house both had strongly opposed 
the assistance package as being too expensive and discriminatory 
against other workers 
byrd saying he was making an appeal for justice had 
pleaded with senators to support the aid arguing that coal miners 
were being singled out under the new clean air legislation which 
will require severe cuts in emissions from coalfired midwest power 
plants 
those pollution controls are expected to cause some utilities to 
switch from highsulfur coal to other fuels threatening the jobs 
of as many as 5000 miners 
but mitchell and other opponents called the aid plan 
disriminatory because thousands of workers in other industries such 
as steel and petrochemical also could lose their jobs but would 
have no such benefits 
this amendment discriminates against all workers who are not 
coal miners declared mitchell 
the byrd proposal has been vigorously opposed by the bush 
administration and the senate leadership because it goes contrary 
to a compromise agreement reached with the white house on clean air 
legislation 
critics of the amendment also argued that coal miners should not 
be singled out when workers in other industries might also face job 
losses and would receive no assistance 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine fearing the 
assistance plan might threaten the entire bill has put pressure on 
fellow senators to defeat the amendment and has tried to persuade 
byrd to go along with a cheaper assistance package that would 
include workers in other occupations 
byrd dwva told a group of coal miners wednesday that 
mitchells compromise doesnt do what needs to be done and that 
he would take his chances on the senate floor a roll of the 
dice as he has characterized it on one occasion 
senators have not been eager to cross either byrd the powerful 
chairman of the appropriations committee or mitchell who can 
determine when a senators pet legislation will come up for floor 
action 
at one point byrd was believed to have enough votes for 
approval of the coal miner assistance proposal but mitchell 
refused to bring the matter up for a vote 
about 500 miners and family members demonstrated outside the 
capitol on wednesday to protest the clean air legislation 
this is a human issue with real people and real jobs on the 
line said robert murray president of ohio valley coal who 
addressed the miners he said he wanted senators to see the 
faces of the people who stand to become unemployed

the rocket that launched a 157 
million communications satellite but failed to put it in the proper 
orbit burned up harmlessly in the atmosphere or fell into the 
ocean authorities said thursday 
the titan 3 booster came down at 920 am est wednesday about 
the time the us space command had predicted said army maj 
thomas niemann a space command spokesman 
we dont have any indication that it survived the fiery 
descent through the atmosphere niemann said but any fragments 
that made it to earth would have landed in the pacific southeast of 
taiwan 
the uninsured intelsat vi satellite launched by the rocket 
march 14 is about 300 miles above earth a temporary position 
thousands of miles lower than it is supposed to be 
we can keep it there for several months if not up to a 
year said tony trujillo a spokesman for intelsat a 118nation 
consortium that owns the satellite its basically where we want 
to keep it for a while 
officials of intelsat and hughes aircraft co the satellites 
builder on tuesday held their second meeting with officials of the 
national aeronautics and space administration to discuss rescue 
possibilities including a space shuttle rescue 
obviously there are a lot of technical issues that have to be 
dealt with trujillo said but were very heartened by nasas 
willingness to explore the possibility with us 
nasa has said a rescue attempt is feasible but more talks are 
needed before any decision can be made 
the 5ton intelsat vi satellite was intended for a 
geosynchronous orbit 22300 miles high from where it would have 
transmitted three tv channels and up to 120000 telephone calls 
simultaneously it was to have eventually replaced two older 
satellites over the atlantic and was supposed to last 13 years 
the satellite wound up in its uselessly low orbit after failing 
to separate properly from the second stage of the booster intelsat 
engineers managed to separate the satellite via computer commands 
then maneuvered it into the slightly higher 300mile orbit 
the second stage of the booster however remained trapped in an 
orbit that swung within about 100 miles of earth and gradually was 
pulled down by gravity 
martin marietta corp which conducted the 272 million launch 
has blamed the failure on an engineering design error the same 
problem was found and corrected on a titan 3 rocket scheduled to 
launch another intelsat vi satellite in three months said company 
spokeswoman judy stowell

workers hooked up telexes and cleared away 
debris in the palestine press service on thursday after police 
lifted a twoyear closure of the agency that once served as the 
main source of news on the palestinian uprising 
the reopening of the arabrun service was one of the first 
easings of the tough restrictions that israel imposed on 
palestinian journalists at the height of the uprising 
yossi olmert head of israels government press office said 
there was decreased international interest in the 27month revolt 
so authorities adopted a more liberal attitude 
the uprising is declining and some of the pressure is off 
olmert told the associated press we can live with the press and 
the uprising at the same time 
arab newspapers still must submit all articles to the israeli 
military censor the army also continues to block foreign 
journalists from entering trouble spots by declaring them closed 
military areas 
two weeks ago the army gave a hint of easing restrictions when 
its spokesmans office issued a directive ordering its employees to 
respond to queries by arab journalists 
such a practice was unthinkable early in the uprising when 
palestinian journalists often put the spokesmans office on the 
defensive with uptotheminute reports of troops firing on 
palestinian stonethrowers 
at the time the palestine press service was the main liaison 
between palestinians and the foreign press it distributed 
information from a network of dozens of stringers accompanying 
foreign journalists to trouble spots and providing translation 
services 
in the beginning of the uprising hundreds of journalists 
would come here we were the main source of information said the 
agencys coowner ibrahim karaeen speaking in his office in 
israeliannexed arab east jerusalem 
on march 30 1988 four months into the uprising police ordered 
the agency closed karaeen said army officials told him the office 
was shut because of suspicions it was funded by yasser arafats plo 
for the next two years the fourroom office stood vacant its 
door sealed by a police lock pigeons sneaked through an open 
window leaving behind piles of droppings and three nests of eggs 
on a table in karaeens corner office 
karaeen said he was given no explanation why the ban was lifted 
karaeen said the organization now faces tough competition from 
more than a dozen palestinian news agencies set up in the last two 
years often oneman offices with a computer and a fax machine 
since the uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and 
gaza strip began in december 1987 authorities have closed five 
arabowned news agencies or newspapers deported six palestinian 
journalists for alleged uprising activities and detained 90 others 
said abu ayash former editor in chief of the palestine press

state appeals judge richard brown reviews 
court testimony using a video monitor connected to a stenographers 
machine that displays words as they are spoken 
being deaf hasnt hindered his performance in court nor has it 
dimmed his aspirations in tuesdays nonpartisan election brown 
will challenge justice donald steinmetz for a seat on the wisconsin 
supreme court 
the candidates deafness hasnt been an issue in an unusually 
hotly contested campaign that includes sparring over abortion 
court workloads and campaign funding 
in wisconsin the seven supreme court justices are chosen in 
statewide elections for 10year terms incumbents seldom are 
challenged 
brown a district judge since 1978 lost his hearing to a brain 
tumor in 1983 
while he relies on the video monitor during campaign debates and 
court sessions he also reads lips and can now detect sounds with 
a device implanted in december in his inner ear 
my brain is still trying to figure out certain sounds he 
said 
steinmetz 65 was elected to the bench in milwaukee in 1966 and 
joined the high court in 1980 
brown has accused steinmetz of backing out of a televised debate 
because he didnt want to discuss abortion the environment and 
the supreme court workload 
steinmetz said the judicial code of ethics prevents him from 
stating his personal position on issues but hes been endorsed by 
the political action committee of wisconsin right to life 
steinmetzs wife is involved with the pregnancy hotline of the 
antiabortion group but steinmetz said it was wrong for brown to 
suggest that abortion is a campaign issue 
brown has said he personally favors abortion rights and hes 
been endorsed by the abortionrights group voters for choice in 
wisconsin but he too cautioned that legally i have no 
position im bound by the law of the state of wisconsin and the 
constitution 
brown has rankled steinmetz as well as chief justice nathan s 
heffernan with a campaign claim that supreme court productivity has 
declined and justices spend too much time bickering 
steinmetz disputes the claim and alleges that browns candidacy 
is bankrolled by special interest groups particularly unions 
and trial lawyers 
brown denies he is tied to special interests and has called on 
steinmetz to cancel a television commercial that quotes reports 
saying brown was offered 250000 from lawyers to challenge 
steinmetz

the two major political parties agreed 
thursday on a basic plan to form east germanys first free 
government but thousands of demonstrators said the leadership was 
tainted by ties to the former secret police 
crowds marched through major cities to demand that the newly 
elected parliament be purged of members who reputedly worked for 
the notorious security apparatus of the old communist order 
the rallies were held a few hours after the main political 
parties said they had agreed on most of the conditions for forming 
a coalition government 
lothar de maiziere leader of the christian democraticled 
alliance that finished first in the march 18 elections is trying 
to form a government with the leftleaning social democrats who 
finished a distant second 
in a joint statement the groups said they concurred on most 
basic points and that their differences are negotiable 
more talks are expected next week but no date was given de 
maiziere has said he hopes to have a governent in place in two 
weeks 
a coalition with the social democrats would give de maiziere the 
twothirds majority he needs to control the 400member parliament 
and muscle through his proposal for swift reunification with west 
germany 
the social democrats have expressed concern about whether they 
can work with the more conservative members of de maizieres 
threeparty alliance the social democrats also favor a more 
gradual process for reunification than the conservatives 
the groups that led last falls revolt which toppled the former 
communist government called for nationwide demonstrations thursday 
to demand an investigation of the newly elected members of 
parliament the groups claim many of the lawmakers were informers 
for the hated secret police known as stasi 
the 85000member stasi and its 109000 informers were used by 
east germanys hardline stalinist government for decades to 
control the country 
under pressure from prodemocracy groups outgoing premier hans 
modrow ordered the secret police disbanded after the overthrow of 
hardliner erich honecker last fall 
about 20000 people marched through downtown east berlin to the 
parliament building to protest what they called the continued 
influence of the stasi 
stasi equals nazi and this is irony stasi in 
parliament read placards 
tourists took photograhs spectators lined the march route and 
music blared from speakers as the protesters marched from alexander 
square to the parliament building 
the state news agency adn reported that about 10000 people took 
part in a demonstration in the city of leipzig where the peaceful 
revolt against four decades of communist rule began last year 
protests also were held in jena karlmarxstadt and dresden 
adn said 
the shadow of the massive secret police network has clouded 
talks on forming a new government considered a prelude to eventual 
unification with west germany 
ibrahim boehme temporarily resigned as head of the social 
democrats until his name could be cleared of allegations he was a 
stasi informant similar allegations have been made against de 
maiziere and others both men have denied them

the enslavement of blacks was no big deal 
compared to the current breakdown of civilization says onetime 
civil rights pioneer james meredith 
meredith 56 who in 1962 was the first black admitted to the 
university of mississippi and is now an aide to conservative sen 
jesse helms rnc made his remarks during a speech wednesday at 
suffolk university 
the making of slavery as an institution does not have near the 
significance as is placed on it meredith said other races also 
were enslaved including the ancient israelites and white 
europeans he said 
the reason we are where we are is not because we were 
slaves he said and if we continue to use that as an excuse 
were going to default the future of our children 
the fact that blacks were slaves is no big deal the breakdown 
of civilization is a big deal 
meredith said blacks remained secondclass citizens however 
and he blamed the nations liberal elite most of them white who 
he said have conspired to keep black people down 
meredith said there exists no documentation of whites ever 
capturing african blacks for slavery rather he said blacks sold 
each other into slavery 
the enslavement of the blacks was the decision and work of the 
black race and in my judgment a wise one to reach the reality 
of the human experience at the time he said 
literacy rates among blacks were actually higher in the 1800s 
than today meredith said 
ethelbert miller director of the afroamerican resource center 
at howard university said thursday that merediths views should 
not be taken seriously 
if he gave a seminar i wouldnt go but he is entitled to his 
opinion said miller adding that he also acknowledges merediths 
importance to the civil rights movement

the united states and the soviet union should 
review their nuclear failsafe systems the chairman of the senate 
armed services committee said thursday 
if nationalists or terrorists overran a soviet nuclear storage 
site in one of the republics would the superpowers coordinate 
their actions sen sam nunn dga asked in a speech on the 
changing threat worldwide 
ethnic unrest in azerbaijan and lithuanias declaration of 
independence march 11 have led moscow to resort to military force 
the bush administration nunn said should urge the soviet union 
to join the united states in conducting separate but parallel 
reviews of failsafe and control programs 
nunn also suggested using the nuclear risk reductions centers 
for talks about how the two superpowers could avoid an inadvertent 
nuclear war 
in his second major speech in a week nunn acknowledged the 
lessening soviet conventional threat and questioned whether the 
bush administration is correctly characterizing the soviets 
modernization of its strategic forces 
defense secretary dick cheney has said unequivocally that there 
has been no change in soviet strategic forces and that the only 
change at all has been in improving their forces 
the administration has tended to overstate its case nunn 
said 
us intelligence he said has found a cutback in the soviets 
blackjack bomber production in addition the soviets have ceased 
patrolling us coasts with its yankeeclass ssbm and patrolling 
north of canada with its nucleararmed bearh bomber 
in his speech delivered on the senate floor nunn also 
discussed 
his complaints last week that the administrations fiscal 1991 
defense budget has several major holes congress will fill if the 
pentagon doesnt 
cheney disputed some of nunns allegations and said the pentagon 
is accounting for rapid changes in eastern europe in fashioning a 
spending plan for fiscal 1992 to 1997 
it is crucial to note however that secretary cheney made no 
claim that the administrations fiscal 1991 budget request reflects 
all these assumptions nunn said thursday 
questioned about nunns comments pentagon spokesman pete 
williams said thursday 
it would be very difficult if not dare one say imprudent 
to send up a 91 budget on the basis of things that havent 
happened yet as events change we will adjust our plans 
accordingly 
the likelihood of the soviet launching a goitalone attack 
on western europe the chances of such an offensive is remote 
according to nunn who also said the kremlin would have a difficult 
time reestablishing a credible threat of a largescale 
conventional attack on nato 
the dispute within the bush administration over the potential 
for reversing the dramatic events in the soviet union and the 
warsaw pact nations cia director william webster has told congress 
it will be difficult cheney disagrees 
shortly after websters comments cheney said the cia directors 
testimony was not helpful to bushs policies

abortion providers in washington are 
gearing up for the possibility of neighboring idaho enacting 
legislation banning abortion as a method of birth control 
well probably see an increase in the number of idaho women 
coming to washington for abortions and well probably see many of 
these women taking chances with their lives if the governor signs 
the bill said joyce cameron spokeswoman for planned parenthood 
of spokane and whitman counties 
idaho gov cecil andrus has promised by saturday to either sign 
or veto a bill that abortion opponents pushed through the 
legislature in hopes of getting the us supreme court to overturn 
the legalization of abortion 
it would ban abortion except in cases of rape reported in seven 
days incest if the victim is under age 18 severe fetal deformity 
or a threat to the mothers life or health 
andrus expressed concern thursday that the bill may be too 
restrictive even for his antiabortion views im looking at 
that im agonizing over it he said 
there are six abortion providers in idaho three in boise and 
one each in moscow coeur dalene and pocatello in 1988 there 
were 1650 abortions performed in idaho said jan wick of the 
department of healths statistics unit there were 13 million 
legal abortions nationally 
there are a lot of women who are really outraged in idaho 
ms cameron said weve had a lot of calls from women willing to 
help shuttle women they say theyll do whatevers necessary 
many idaho women already travel to washington for abortions 
in 1988 the latest year figures are available 445 idaho women 
had abortions in washington 365 in utah 31 in oregon and four in 
other states wick said 
jim anderson spokesman for rescue northwest an antiabortion 
group said that if the idaho bill becomes law he did not expect a 
dramatic increase in women traveling to spokane for abortions 
im grateful that the people of idaho have chosen life 
because the inconvenience will cause mothers to rethink their 
position and choose life for that child anderson said 
planned parenthood paints a different picture 
young women in particular are going to be frightened and 
theyre not going to know what to do ms cameron said 
abortion is much safer in the first trimester but getting money 
for the abortion and then rounding up money for travel and maybe 
for overnight accommodations will force women to wait 
i think idaho will probably see their rape statistics 
skyrocket she added if young women cant have abortion unless 
theyve been raped youll see a lot more women saying theyve been 
raped 
mayor sheri barnard who considers herself prochoice said she 
anticipates an increase in antiabortion activity if idaho women 
come to spokane for abortions 
i presume the level of protest would rise in spokane if we see 
an increase in abortions here the mayor said in the state of 
washington abortions are legal and its our responsibility to see 
that our laws are upheld

after weeks of stormy discussion 
and mounting tension between czechs and slovaks parliament on 
thursday chose a new name for the country and eliminated the 
outmoded socialist label 
since the winter revolution everbody even the ousted 
communists had agreed that socialist no longer had a place in 
their countrys name 
but should the socialist republic of czechoslovakia be changed 
to the czechoslovak republic the federation of czechoslovakia 
or for those in the antihyphen camp czechoslovak federative 
republic 
the antihyphen group finally prevailed after hours of debate 
when the czechoslovak federative republic won the required 
threefifths majority in parliament 
the debate over the hyphen characteristic both of czechoslovak 
love of detail and absurdity split the czechs and slovaks 
slovaks make up about onethird of czechoslovakias 155 million 
people taking their cue from writerpresident vaclav havel who 
proposed changing the countrys name and coat of arms in january 
they waged a solid campaign for the hyphen 
they argued the hyphen would show the world that czechoslovakia 
contains two distinct peoples czechs and slovaks 
the slovaks will hyphenate the countrys title in writing to 
make it the czechoslovak federative republic 
czechs and moravians who speak the same language and tend to 
regard the natives of rural slovakia as country cousins felt 
slovak sensibilities had received enough attention 
in 1969 under communist leader gustav husak a slovak 
slovakia became a separate republic that entitled it to half of 
most federal resources 
the name and hyphen debate raged for weeks in newspapers and 
over glasses of czech beer and slovak wine it finally moved to 
parliament after the government withdrew an attempt to get the 
issue put off until after the june election 
havel hospitalized after a hernia operation pleaded from his 
bed for what he termed the compromise solution of czechoslovak 
republic that pleased the prohyphen slovaks 
czechoslovakia so far has had two great presidents tomas 
garrigue masaryk and vaclav havel slovak deputy roman zelenay 
told fellow legislators masaryk was czechoslovakias first 
president 
both of them have put their signature under the same name of 
the republic zelenay said referring to 1918 documents that 
agreed to set up a czechoslovak republic that hyphen was dropped 
for reasons of expediency shortly afterward 
havel had a second compromise suggestion czechoslovak 
federative republic 
after intense debate the slovak deputies voted predictably en 
bloc for the hyphen the czechs and moravians outnumbered them and 
opposed it meaning czechoslovak republic failed to win the 
day 
czechoslovak federative republic almost made it the first 
time through but fell short it was approved in a subsequent vote 
after it was agreed that slovaks can use a hyphen when writing the 
name 
milos zeman a radical economist who sits in parliament for 
civic forum the movement that led the november revolution 
reminded the nation during the televised debate that there were 
more crucial issues facing the nation 
there is no connection between the name of the country and its 
quality he said 
but deputy premier josef hromadka suggested it was a matter of 
supreme importance 
when an agreement is not reached in the election of a pope 
he said the rules say that there should be a oneday break but 
nobody is permitted to leave the conclave and they may take there 
only bread and water to search their conscience

leaders of the national commission on aids 
welcomed president bushs first major speech on the epidemic as a 
good first step but aids activists said he was long on 
compassion short on commitment 
dr june osborn the commissions chairwoman said that even 
though the president offered no new initiatives it was important 
that he show concern about the issue and compassion for people with 
aids 
in terms of changing the public mood we desperately need that 
rhetoric as a first step toward action osborn said at a news 
conference following bushs speech to the national leadership 
coalition on aids 
aids activists said they were glad to see bush talking about 
aids and said he has done more than his predecessor ronald reagan 
on the issue 
but they were disappointed that bush did not address some of the 
major issues relating to aids including an immigration policy that 
bars people with aids from entering the country 
he has shown sensitivity and concern that we have yet to 
witness from this office but in the end the speech that we heard 
today was long on compassion short on commitment said jean 
mcguire executive director of the aids action council 
if today is the beginning and not an end to the presidents 
efforts we can be hopeful but a decade of neglect requires a more 
aggressive and substantive and meaningful leadership than we heard 
today she said 
she warned that the sensitivity were seeing could mask the 
inaction weve had for the last decade 
in his speech bush said his administration is on a wartime 
footing against aids and called on congress to pass the americans 
with disabilities act which would bar discrimination against 
people with aids and those who are infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids 
the president also touted his administrations budget proposal 
of 35 billion for treatment research and education about aids 
next fiscal year 
but aids activists said that bush was trying to inflate the 
administrations commitment to the aids battle by including among 
other things spending on medicaid and medicare patients who have 
aids that amounts to more than 1 billion of bushs total for aids 
spending 
the public health service budget for aids which includes money 
for the national institutes of health and the centers for disease 
control accounts for 17 billion of the total and is 7 percent 
above current spending 
many activists had hoped bush would address the immigration 
policy which has prompted dozens of organizations and agencies to 
boycott an international conference on aids to be held in san 
francisco in june 
we have become an embarrassment in the global community that 
is dealing with this disease mcguire said 
david rogers vice chairman of the aids commission whose 
members are appointed by congress and the white house called the 
immigration policy critical 
the administration has been granting waivers of the policy to 
people entering the united states for conferences and to seek 
medical attention but pressure is building on the white house and 
congress to take hiv infection off a list of contagious diseases 
used to bar entry to the country 
osborn and rogers along with commission member belinda mason 
who has aids met with bush at the white house for about 15 minutes 
earlier in the day 
they said they were pleased with the meeting although they said 
they received no commitments from bush on any specific issue 
weve set the stage for future conversations osborn said 
mason said bushs remarks leaned rather heavily on rhetoric 
but we have to give the man a lot of points for coming out as 
far out as he has

no one has been properly watching over 
maintenance of the alaskan oil pipeline to prevent a land spill as 
disastrous as the ocean spill in prince william sound says a 
government report released thursday 
but since the exxon valdez ran aground and unleashed nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil into the pacific ocean last year the 
appropriate agencies are waking up the study by the general 
accounting office said 
people still should be skeptical said rep george miller 
dcalif chairman of the house interior subcommittee on offshore 
energy rerources 
i will be very skeptical he said 
miller has been leading a congressional investigation of the 
march 24 1989 spill and the safety of other oil industry 
operations in alaska 
the regulators and the regulated have been too cozy he said 
of the relationship between the government and the oil industry 
he said its too early to tell if there has been significant 
improvement but various studies under way by the government and 
the criminal case against exxon for the spill should lead to 
improvements 
the gao said that while several federal and state agencies have 
authority over the transalaska pipeline system the pipeline has 
not received the systematic comprehensive oversight needed to 
ensure compliance with operational safety emergency response and 
environmental requirements 
thats particularily worrisome because of recent news that the 
pipeline is corroding james duffus director of the gaos division 
on natural resources management said at a hearing before millers 
subcommittee 
he said that since the exxon valdez spill the federal and state 
governments have increased checkups of pipeline operations and 
efforts are under way to improve coordination among the agencies 
with oversight responsibilities 
these efforts show promise if organized and staffed 
appropriately he said 
the interior departments bureau of land management has the 
major responsibility to make sure the oil industry is operating 
properly but the department of transportation and alaskas 
departments of natural resources and environmental conservation 
also have enforcement duties 
the gao said that because of limited finances the state has 
relied on blm to monitor the pipeline but blm has been criticized 
for basically allowing the alyeska pipeline service co which runs 
the pipeline monitor itself 
alyeska has been blamed for not being prepared for the spill in 
prince wiliam sound because of cutbacks it made over the years in 
emergency safety procedures 
miller said alyeska is now under new management which is being 
open about the problems that exist and has shown interest in making 
improvements 
michele brown of the alaska department of environmental 
conservation said however that in the past alyeska has fought 
the government on environmental improvements 
until recently alyeska took an adversarial approach to state 
oversight she testified she said that wasted state money on 
court action that could have gone to collecting data relating to 
environmental protection and to doing inspections

some passersby grimaced at yuri and the 
lithuanian newspapers he hawked illegally in moscows pushkin 
square 
but some bolstered him calling out molodyets russian for 
good for you quite a few forked over a ruble 150 and 
snatched up the latest edition hoping for more news than the 
staterun media have been providing about the situation in the 
republic 
the spectrum of reactions reflects the varying attitudes among 
russians toward lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence 
and the influence it may have on the soviet unions other 14 
republics 
sometimes they say youve done such a mean trick or you 
sold out the union to spread this vileness said yuri 
but others say good for you we support you and were 
watching you to learn from you how to live said the the young 
lithuanian who lives in moscow 
the average opinion of the lithuanian action he said is 
its not bad what youre doing but maybe you rushed maybe you 
didnt think things through maybe you should have waited for more 
support 
spontaneous groups of debaters have become a fixture near the 
moscow news building on the square and most voices support 
lithuanian independence 
i think every nation should choose its own road whether for 
better or worse said a retired economist who identified herself 
only as valeriya 
she said however that she could understand the kremlins 
reluctance to recognize the lithuanian declaration 
no one wants children to run away she said 
one circle of debaters agreed that if president mikhail s 
gorbachev resorted to force whether imposing martial law or 
arresting lithuanian leaders it would mark the end of current 
reforms 
if lithuania is crushed there will be no democracy in 
russia one man said 
few seemed to think this would happen 
even an outspoken army lieutenant colonel with a penchant for 
quoting lenin and marx said that power should not come by means 
of a rifle but only by political democratic methods 
objections to lithuanian independence focused on concern for the 
russians poles and other minorities who together make up 20 
percent of the population of the baltic republic 
our russian people cant live there theyre persecuting 
communists one woman said 
an older man said the mistake of the lithuanian government 
was to allow chauvinism he was apparently referring to new laws 
that favor the lithuanian language and culture 
a middleaged tiredeyed woman who said she was a russian who 
had left lithuania out of fears for her safety touched off a hot 
exchange 
why did you go there a man asked her belligerently 
they sent us she replied her entire family worked for the 
military she later said 
another group debated why the central media including such 
progressive tv shows as glance and seven days have 
reported relatively little on lithuania some said the media were 
intimidated by lithuanians accusing them of onesidedness others 
believed the media were left in a bind by a soviet leadership that 
hadnt given them a wellformulated line to follow 
yuri the young newspaper seller also fielded questions from 
several buyers about what was happening in lithuania 
when the shriek of a whistle sounded the warning that the police 
might be coming to clamp down on his illegal sales yuri calmly 
slipped his packet of newspapers into a gym bag and went on talking

prices farmers get for raw products increased 
13 percent from february to march raising the overall commodity 
index 27 percent above a year ago the agriculture department said 
thursday 
overall the departments prices received index matched the 
record level set in january the index declined in february then 
rose again to the january level 
higher prices for hogs eggs cattle and potatoes were mostly 
responsible for the increase from february the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary report 
but the report said lower prices for tomatoes milk and wheat 
partly offset the gains for the other commodities most prices are 
midmarch averages which will be revised next month 
hog and cattle prices moved up sharply from february while the 
allmilk price declined for the second consecutive month the 
report said tomatoes declined sharply from february but 
continuing short supplies kept prices well above normal for this 
time of year 
milk prices had risen to record levels until they tumbled 
sharply in february reflecting production increases the price 
decline had been predicted by usda economists 
prices of feed grain food grains and oilseeds were mixed 
the report said corn and soybean prices increased slightly while 
the wheat price was down hay prices showed a moderate increase 
from february 
the report did not include new figures on farm expenses those 
are computed every three months in january however new quarterly 
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 11 percent from 
october the previous reading and averaged 29 percent more than a 
year earlier 
department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 
may be in the range of 54 billion to 58 billion compared with 
about 53 billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 45 billion to 49 
billion compared with 49 billion last year 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda economists to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 57 
percent in 1989 the sharpest rise since 1981 
based on the preliminary figures the march price index for 
livestock and poultry was up 24 percent from february and averaged 
75 percent more than a year ago 
milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in march to an 
average of 1380 per l00 pounds even so the preliminary march 
price was up 110 from march 1989 
crop prices overall rose 08 percent from february but were 
29 percent below the yearearlier level fruit prices led by 
grapfruit and oranges were up 7 percent from february and averaged 
64 percent more than a year ago 
the index for commercial vegetables dropped 49 percent from 
february but still averaged 39 percent more than in march 1989 
the effect of lower prices for tomatoes was moderated somewhat 
by higher prices for sweet corn and onions the report said 
even though the tomato prices declined from last month they are 
still well above normal for this time of year due to short supplies 
brought on by the december freeze 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7540 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 7460 in february and 72 in march 1989 those 
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 52 per 100 pounds compared with 4820 in 
february and 3930 a year earlier 
corn at 234 a bushel edged up from 232 in february and 
was down from 260 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 342 per bushel compared with 356 in february and 
407 a year earlier 
rice averaged 760 per 100 pounds compared with 752 in 
february and 660 in march 1989 
soybeans were 558 per bushel compared with 557 in february 
and 751 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 624 cents per pound up from 
606 in february and 556 a year earlier 
eggs were 793 cents per dozen compared with 704 in february 
and 801 in march 1989 
milk was 1380 per 100 pounds down from 1440 in february

yevgeny chazov personal doctor to kremlin leaders 
and cowinner of the 1985 nobel peace prize for his work with an 
antinuclear organization was dropped thursday as soviet health 
minister 
the official news agency tass said president mikhail s 
gorbachev had relieved chazov 60 of his duties in connection with 
his transfer to other work 
his new job was not specified and no replacement was named 
such wording can signify official displeasure 
chazov signed the death certificates for the three soviet 
leaders prior to gorbachev leonid i brezhnev yuri v andropov 
and konstantin u chernenko 
chazov and us cardiologist bernard lown were cochairmen of 
the international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war the 
two men shared the 1985 nobel peace prize for their work in the 
organization 
chazov had been a deputy head of the health ministry for 19 
years and the head of the department that provided care to top 
soviet officials for two decades before being named health minister 
in february 1987 
soviet health care is under frequent attack for poor equipment 
and training shortages of medicines and personnel that often 
seems uncaring and lazy

parents would be taught prenatal care and ways 
to develop their babies coordination memory language and social 
skills under provisions of a bill introduced thursday 
we know that parental involvement in the education of their 
children is the key to longterm gains for youngsters said sen 
christopher bond rmo parents are their childs first and most 
influential teachers 
bond was joined in introducing the bill by sen thad cochran 
rmiss and sen howell heflin dala 
the bill would create a national parents as teachers program 
based on a missouri model a fiveyear 100 million competitive 
grant program would be set up for states to begin or expand parents 
as teachers 
the program which operates in 26 states uses homes visits 
group meetings videotapes and written material to teach new and 
prospective parents the skills of raising an infant there also are 
periodic health screening of children 
bond said the average operating costs for a parents as teachers 
program in a school district are about 20000 per year he 
estimated that about 1000 school districts nationwide could 
participate in the program annually with federal assistance 
the bill would force states to eventually pick up the cost of 
the program as federal funding would decline to 75 percent in the 
third year 50 percent in the fourth year and 25 percent in the 
fifth year of the fiveyear authorization 
heflin said the legislation does not conflict with head start 
and other early childhood programs 
this focuses on the parents while the others focus on the 
children he said 
head start touted by president bush and virtually every 
proponent of early childhood education provides day care health 
screening nutritious meals and other services to disadvantaged 
children between the ages of 3 and 5 
parents as teachers is even more critically needed than head 
start because so much of human development is atrisk during 
infancy by beginning at the beginning prevention can replace 
remediation said heflin adding that all parents are eligible 
regardless of socioeconomic status

the nations most widely circulated medical 
journal is moving its release date to wednesday from friday giving 
it a oneday jump on a prestigious rival but the rivals editor 
says we dont feel threatened 
the journal of the american medical association says the main 
reasons for its publishing earlier in the week are improved 
production capabilities a desire to release important findings 
quickly and a wish to give news reporters more time at weeks end 
to develop spinoff stories the change begins next week 
but if you read the ama press release carefully they want 
to come out first before the new england journal of medicine 
said dr arnold relman editor of the bostonbased new england 
journal which publishes on thursday 
i cant understand any other reason beyond the obvious 
competitive one relman added in a telephone interview wednesday 
dr george lundberg editor of jama acknowledged in a news 
release announcing the change last month i want jama to be 
poised to be able to publish new research findings before other 
medical and scientific journals 
but lundberg maintained on thursday that competition is a lesser 
motive 
lundberg said though articles appearing each week in the new 
england journal and in jama are independent of each other they do 
cover overlapping subjects occasionally 
in such instances we would prefer our authors to have an 
earlier publication date than theirs lundberg said 
we at jama value media coverage greatly because one of our 
basic missions is to educate the public to lead healthier lives 
both journals are heavily covered by the media and their 
release dates have more to do with determining when their contents 
reach airwaves and newspapers than when they reach physicians 
jama published by the chicagobased ama the nations largest 
organization of doctors has a regular englishlanguage circulation 
of 293000 including the amas more than 290000 members the 
journal also has 290000 copies going overseas each week in 12 
languages lundberg said 
the 178yearold new england journal the nations oldest 
medical journal is published by the massachusetts medical society 
it has a circulation of about 230000 including 10000 society 
members and about 50000 overseas subscribers relman said 
though it is smaller the new england journal carries the 
hottest articles said david pendlebury of the 
philadelphiabased institute for scientific information the 
institute tracks how many times articles in 3200 journals 
worldwide are subsequently cited in published research 
pendlebury said a study about a year ago indicated that the 100 
mostcited articles in life sciences in the previous year included 
nine from the new england journal and three from jama 
we dont feel threatened by a change in their publication 
day relman said it seems to me that the content of what is 
published is vastly more important than the day of the week on 
which it is published 
dr aran ron assistant to the medical director at beth israel 
medical center in new york city and a reader of both journals 
agreed though for different reasons 
i think that jama has more general interesttype articles and 
covers ground a little wider while the the new england journal has 
more scientific specialty and indepth articles ron said 
i dont perceive a big competition from my perspective for the 
two added ron who has had research published in jama i think 
they serve different purposes

gov cecil andrus on thursday expressed his 
first public doubts about signing what would be the nations most 
restrictive state abortion law 
i am concerned that this bill may narrow it to the point where 
a woman who has suffered rape who has suffered incest or the 
mothers life is in danger might not be able to receive an 
abortion andrus said at an impromptu news conference 
im looking at that he said im agonizing over it 
but the democratic governor quickly cautioned against 
interpreting his remarks to mean he has decided to veto the bill 
dont read anything into it andrus said my views being 
prolife havent changed but i am concerned about the bill 
prochoice forces meanwhile staged another rally on the 
capitol steps dumping 10000 potatoes in a show of support for the 
campaign to launch a national boycott of idahos biggest cash crop 
should the bill become law 
to counter that threat symbolically thursday wisconsin right to 
life inc delivered a half ton of potatoes to the salvation army 
office in milwaukee and a group called concerned women for 
america which claims 600000 members said it will increase potato 
purchases to offset any boycott by the national organization for 
women 
this is a longterm commitment said beverly lahaye 
president of concerned women our membership is committed to 
this cause out of respect for the courageous men and women in the 
idaho legislature 
a day earlier the governor said business leaders in key idaho 
industries told him they were already losing sales because of the 
evolving boycott but while expressing concern he said economic 
considerations would not be the crucial factor in his decision 
later in the day a major buyer of idaho potatoes mcdonalds 
corp said it had no plans to participate in any boycott over the 
abortion controversy 
andrus promised earlier in the week he would act by saturday on 
the legislation that would ban abortion as a method of birth 
control both sides in the debate agree it would make more than 90 
percent of the abortions performed in idaho illegal if signed it 
would take effect july 1 
the bill makes abortion illegal except in cases of nonstatutory 
rape reported within seven days incest if the victim is under age 
18 severe fetal deformity or a threat to the mothers life or 
physical health 
some legal scholars have said it is so restrictive it will be 
voided by the us supreme court but the national right to life 
committee helped draft the bill so that a promised challenge will 
give the high court the opportunity to reverse its 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion 
andrus who has a longstanding record of opposition to abortion 
except in cases of rape incest and a threat to the womans life 
has been consulting with legal scholars church officials and 
others he said thursday there was no consensus on the issue 
there is a difference of opinion he said but my own 
personal attorney in the office and some of the others i think 
are united in that question he would not elaborate

the state department called in iraqs 
ambassador on thursday and registered concern that the arab country 
is trying to circumvent us restrictions on nuclear technology 
shipments 
we do not foresee a neartime iraqi nuclear capability 
spokesman richard boucher said however we remain concerned 
about the danger 
richard mccormack the undersecretary for economic affairs met 
with ambassador mohamed almashat and expressed our deep concern 
over iraqs attempt to circumvent controls over military items a 
us official said 
mccormack also reiterated us opposition to the spread of 
missile technology in the middle east said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
iraq in december lauched a longrange threestage rocket that is 
capable of reaching israel 
i am sure the israelis are quite concerned another us 
official said 
the other major cause for us concern relates to the seizure 
wednesday by british customs officials of a shipment of usmade 
nuclear trigger components destined for iraq the fbi cooperated in 
the case 
the ambassador denied on wednesday that his country is trying to 
develop nuclear weapons he said all iraqi nuclear facilities were 
subject to international inspection under the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
still spokesman boucher said the arrest of the iraqis in 
london raises once again the administrations deep concern about 
proliferation in the middle east 
iraq has a nuclear facility near baghdad that israel bombed in 
1981 
the washington times reported in its friday editions that iraq 
is installing sovietmade ballistic missiles capable of hitting 
israel turkey and cyprus 
the newspaper quoting unidentified us intelligence officials 
said the missiles were photographed by a us intelligence 
satellite earlier this month and are being deployed at three remote 
locations in iraq 
state department officials declined to either confirm or deny 
the times story 
boucher said the seizure of usmade nuclear triggers raised 
our concerns about sales to the middle east 
but he said we are not aware of any irregularities in 
iraqs commitment to permit international inspections under the 
nonproflieration treaty 
asked if the bush administration would impose sanctions against 
iraq the spokesman replied we will be examining very carefully 
the information from this case and we are discussing our concerns 
with iraq both here and in baghdad 
despite its oil riches iraq is believed to have a debt of 70 
billion to 100 billion for weapons and other costs of its long 
persian gulf war with iran the bush administration could hurt iraq 
by trying to block loans to the middle eastern country 
its record on human rights also has caused concern here iraq 
was accused by the bush administration of using poison gas against 
iran and against kurds a nonarab minority 
president bush on wednesday called upon nuclear suppliers to 
exercise special restraint in providing materials related to the 
development of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and 
intermediaterange missiles in this volatile area 
bush said iraqi officials are well aware of our views on 
nuclear proliferation which we have made clear on several 
occasions 
on thursday marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
bush felt very strongly about this as a nonproliferation issue 
he added i dont have a decision for you in terms of any kind 
of conclusions about violation of the treaty and legal process 
those are matters that well have to consider

nelson mandela and zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi said thursday they will hold an unprecedented 
joint peace rally to stop fighting in zululand that has killed 25 
people in two days 
i hope that when we stand on the platform together and appeal 
for an end to violence the people will heed our call mandela 
leader of the african national congress told the independent south 
african press association 
anc spokesman ronnie mamoepa said of the gathering to be held 
monday people are dying horrendously in natal and that is the 
reason it is going ahead as soon as possible 
mv ngema administrative secretary of buthelezis inkatha 
party said it is the most important thing in the world for them 
to meet 
the two leaders were friends in their youth but have not met 
since mandela was freed feb 11 after 27 years in prison although 
they spoke on the phone 
they had planned to discuss the violence but this weeks 
upsurge prompted the announcement of a rally at taylors halt 
township one of the most violent areas around the natal provincial 
capital of pietermaritzburg 
ngema said inkatha would contact employers to let workers have 
the day off 
police and hospital officials said at least 25 people died and 
32 were critically hurt in two days of pitched battles and assaults 
among war bands armed with guns knives clubs and sharpened sticks 
since 1983 supporters of the anc mostly from the united 
democratic front and inkatha have struggled for control of the 
townships in natal and the adjacent zululand tribal areas governed 
by inkatha nearly 4000 people were killed the past four years 
the anc and inkatha have never met at a joint gathering both 
oppose apartheid but differ on tactics to fight the racial 
segregation system the form of a future majority government and 
on the status of tribal structures 
white democratic party members of parliament from natal met with 
president f w de klerk in cape town and asked for immediate 
action 
pietermaritzburg mayor mark cornell suggested at a city council 
meeting that the national government declare martial law in the 
edendale valley where most of the fighting has occurred since 
tuesday 
about 200 homes were burned and hundreds of refugees fled many 
villagers were crammed into churches and schools on the outskirts 
of the capital 
edendale is burning and i really fear that maritzburg itself 
will become the scene of fullscale fighting cornell said 
the council requested more security forces 
about 5000 black trade union members some carrying clubs 
marched through johannesburg thursday to protest government plans 
to privatize transportation hospitals and other public assets 
they presented a petition to the johannesburg stock exchange asking 
that the economy be nationalized to aid poor blacks 
police broke up a similar march of about 2000 workers in 
pretoria and arrested 39 union officials said 40 protesters were 
bitten by dogs beaten and teargassed police said no information 
on injuries was available but the south african press association 
said bloodied marchers were seen in pretoria central police 
station where they were charged with taking part in a banned march 
police commanders said the situation was quiet around edendale 
thursday but some local journalists said they had reports of 
clashes in rural areas hospital workers speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the toll was higher than listed because relatives 
removed some bodies and the deaths went unreported 
police denied on thursday that officers had favored inkatha in 
the fighting as a member of parliament white monitors of the 
unrest and some township residents charged earlier 
the fighting broke out after rival groups stoned buses bringing 
inkatha supporters back from a rally sunday 
police said they did not disarm combatants as further 
bloodshed would have inevitably resulted

president bush and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher agree there is a need for restraint on both sides 
in lithuanias struggle for independence from the soviet union a 
white house spokesman said thursday 
mrs thatcher has spoken out publicly about the need for 
restraint we have spoken similarly said marlin fitzwater we 
still believe that peaceful dialogue is the best way to resolve 
this matter and to provide selfdetermination for the people of 
lithuania 
bush and mrs thatcher are pretty much in alignment on what 
is the best course for achieving peaceful dialogue fitzwater 
said 
a senior administration official said bush was working intently 
behind the scenes to prevent a blowup in lithuania the white house 
toned down its rhetoric this week after repeatedly cautioning 
moscow against escalating the situation 
it isnt in anybodys interest to have this thing blow up 
the official said insisting on anonymity nobody really wins 
from the blowup now it may happen some things are just like a 
greek tragedy but nobody profits by it and therefore what were 
hoping is with some gentle help and encouragement that logic will 
prevail 
the official said the united states hopes gorbachev survives 
this test but that its out of our hands and is not in the 
end anything that the united states is likely to have a decisive 
influence on 
bush called mrs thatcher in london on wednesday after receiving 
a cable from the british leader reviewing her 50minute 
conversation with soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
bush has not talked with gorbachev since the lithuanian 
parliament declared independence march 11 
asked why bush had not called gorbachev fitzwater said 
the president simply feels that this is not the time to make a 
direct contact to chairman gorbechev we believe the appropriate 
posture is to consider this matter with our allies 
fitzwater called the situation a complex and delicate 
diplomatic matter 
we would not want to take moves that disrupted that diplomatic 
effort he said 
fitzwater declined comment on the soviet offer of amnesty for 
lithuanian deserters who return to the army he also had nothing to 
say about some conciliatory moves by lithuanias leaders 
on wednesday lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
suspended plans to set up border posts and advised his countrymen 
not to resist if soviet authorities came to seize their hunting 
guns 
we dont want to put ourselves in the position of approving or 
disapproving of daily events over there fitzwater said

authorities said a usbritish investigation was 
under way thursday into alleged illegal exports of naval equipment 
to iraq a day after customs officers foiled a bid to smuggle 
nuclear triggering devices to baghdad 
the customs and excise department said the naval equipment had 
already been shipped to iraq but refused to give details 
as three people appeared in court in the nuclear devices case 
britain rejected calls to cut ties with iraq but said it was 
contacting international agencies to try to prevent future 
smuggling of material for nuclear weapons 
british military experts said the iraqis have been trying to 
acquire sensors to develop advanced sea mines 
it seems that the naval weapons are acoustic detonators 
paul beaver publisher of janes defense weekly said in an 
interview on abctvs good morning america program 
it could lead to speculation that iraq is not only 
involved in putting warheads onto ballistic missiles but also could 
be involved in trying to develop a nuclear depth bomb with perhaps 
the idea of taking out the iranian oil wells in the neck of the 
persian gulf and that really sort of ups the ante considerably 
iraq denies seeking nuclear capability iraqi president saddam 
hussein accused the arabs enemies thursday of trying to hinder 
iraqs march of progress 
the state department in washington called in iraqi ambassador 
mohamed almashat on thursday and registered concern that the arab 
country is trying to circumvent us restrictions on nuclear 
technology shipments 
department spokesman richard boucher said we do not foresee a 
neartime iraqi nuclear capability however we remain concerned 
about the danger 
british customs officials said investigators seized documents on 
wednesday at undisclosed premises in northwestern england and 
scotland a spokesman said the investigators want to talk to two 
officials of an english company who are abroad but stressed the 
probe is only halfcomplete with no arrests imminent 
press association the domestic news agency said the documents 
allegedly contain proof at least one acoustic detonator has already 
been smuggled to iraq 
the naval equipment investigation sprang from an 18month 
investigation by us and british police and customs that 
culminated in wednesdays seizure at heathrow airport in london of 
nuclear components about to be put on an iraqi airways flight to 
baghdad customs officials said 
three people were charged in uxbridge magistrates court in west 
london on thursday with violating the export of prohibited goods 
control act by trying to export 40 capacitors essential components 
in detonating a nuclear bomb 
lebanese engineer toufic fouad amyuni 37 and ali ashour daghir 
49 a company director with dual iraqibritish nationality were 
held over until april 5 
export executive jeanine celestine speckman 41 a frenchwoman 
married to a briton was granted bail until may 10 provided she 
surrender her passport and report weekly to police 
iraqi national omar latif who was also arrested was 
immediately served with a deportation order 
press association said without attribution that latif was also 
coordinating the naval equipment operation 
in san diego thursday an indictment opened in us district 
court charged five people and two britishbased companies with 
illegally exporting electrical components that could be used in the 
detonation of nuclear warheads 
it named daghir mrs speckman and three iraqis karim dhaidas 
omran wallid issa ahmad and dafir alazawi identified as 
representating an agency of iraqs ministry of industry and 
military industrialization the three iraqis whereabouts thursday 
were not known 
the two companies euromac ltd and an affiliated company atlas 
equipment ltd were both operated by daghir according to the 
indictment it identified mrs speckman as euromacs export 
executive 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons 
the attempted spread of nuclear weapons is very very serious 
indeed 
we shall be urgently contacting signatories of the 
nonproliferation treaty and also those who signed the missile 
technology control regime to see what we can do to see that there 
is no repeat of this very very serious incident 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said britain was urgently 
consulting the 139 signatories of the nonproliferation treaty 
which include iraq to minimize the risk of evasion 
he said britain wanted more countries to sign the missile 
technology control regime adopted in april 1987 by the seven major 
industrialized countries to control the export of missile 
components 
gerald kaufman foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition 
labor party urged britain to sever diplomatic relations with iraq 
raise the issue at the un security council and ask the 
international atomic energy agency to inspect iraqs facilities 
hurd said the agency conducted an inspection a year ago and 
added i can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off 
diplomatic relations and no actual advantage 
we have two empty embassies in two important middle east 
countries and we do not want to add to that number hurd said 
referring to iran and syria with whom britain has broken relations

pentagon officials are hopeful a resolution 
will be worked out with congress to avoid tens of thousands of pink 
slips going to military men and women by october a spokesman said 
on thursday 
i think were confident that were going to get what we 
need pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters this is 
something that we continue to negotiate and discuss with congress 
in a variety of ways 
defense secretary dick cheney is personnally involved in the 
negotiations williams said 
williams said that in light of such negotiations were not 
about to announce implementation of force reductions we are 
confident that we are going to get an agreement that will allow us 
to do what we want to do 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis has 
said however that he intends to stick to his position of 
rejecting the pentagon request to shift 900 million from other 
accounts to spend on personnel as chairman of one of the four 
major committees dealing with the issue aspins stand amounts to a 
veto of the request 
the pentagon wants to realign its funds to avoid massive layoffs 
caused by reductions required under the grammrudmanhollings 
budgetcutting law 
if congress does not allow the pentagon to switch the money 
williams said several weeks ago that rough estimates indicated 
that between 44000 and 68200 military personnel would have to be 
fired outright by oct 1 the end of the current fiscal year 
tens of thousands of others would have to be frozen in their 
current jobs promotions would be delayed and fewer men and women 
could be brought into the services currently there are around 21 
million men and women in uniform 
the senate armed services committee has voted to grant the 
pentagon part of the auhority to transfer money to military 
personnel accounts and avert massive layoffs 
but that action has little overall effect on the departments 
request since aspin has refused to take up the issue in his panel 
such shifting of funds must be approved by the house and senate 
armed services panels and the house and senate appropriations 
committees 
some members of congress have argued that the administration 
brought the problem on itself in light of last years budget 
agreement in which the administration got capitol hill to agree to 
four months worth of automatic spending cuts under the 
grammrudmanhollings budget law 
president bush had the option of exempting military personnel 
from the grammrudman law but he didnt aspin argued that while 
bushs decision is painful for the military the administration 
must realize that accepting the grammrudman cuts meant accepting 
the results

actor paul newman denied thursday that 
he ever promised stock from his food companies to a delicatessen 
owner and said his socalled saladdressing trial was longer 
than the academy awards 
newman and his charity food companies newmans own inc and 
salad king inc are being sued by julius gold who claims he was 
promised stock for services in helping to launch the companies 
eight years ago 
newman asked to relate how the companies had developed 
testified that sales were promising when he launched them back in 
1982 but there was no guarantee they would succeed 
ive had films open promising and go right through the 
floor the academy awardwinning actor said and on the other 
hand ive had some pictures that started out very badly and became 
successful the most embarrassing thing is the salad dressing is 
outgrossing my films 
salad king and newmans own which make salad dressing 
spaghetti sauce popcorn and lemonade reaped 42 million in sales 
last year all 28 million in profits since 1982 have gone to 
charity 
newman denied promising stock in the company to gold or anyone 
else he also denied ever having any conversations with gold about 
giving him stock 
this is getting longer than the academy awards here newman 
said when asked to give some background about how the business 
began 
it started off as a lark newman said i did not expect it 
to go any place 
earlier thursday newmans corporate lawyer leo nevas 
reasserted on the stand that he did not promise 8 percent of the 
companies stock to gold who brought suit in bridgeport superior 
court against the actor his business partner ae hotchner and the 
companies 
nevas said he recalled discussion at a meeting about newman 
holding twothirds of the company stock and some shares possibly 
distributed to others but the lawyer said he had no authority to 
promise 8 percent to gold 
newman and hotchner formed salad king in 1982 on a whim to sell 
the dressing newman had been making for friends in the basement of 
his westport home the two branched into spaghetti sauce the 
following year 
gold a westport deli owner says hotchner contacted him for 
help in distributing the dressing beginning three years of 
involvement in the project he also says nevas promised him 8 
percent of the stock 
newmans lawyers deny any such deal they have tried to minimize 
golds dealings in the venture saying he tried to thrust himself 
on the project and invited himself to meetings 
the tiny courtroom which seats only 30 was full again thursday 
with media and spectators television crews manned cameras outside 
the courthouse to film newman during breaks 
it is the second time the case has gone to trial the first 
ended in a mistrial in june 1988 after the jury mistakenly saw 
depositions not admitted as evidence

an immigration law passed four years ago to 
stem the flow of illegal aliens across the southern border of the 
united states has caused widespread hiring discrimination the 
general accounting office reported thursday 
gao believes many employers discriminated because the laws 
verification system does not provide a simple or reliable method to 
verify job applicants eligibility to work said the report from 
the congressional agency 
the report triggered calls on capitol hill for repeal of the 
laws civil and criminal penalties or sanctions for employers 
who hire illegal aliens 
immigration and naturalization service commissioner gene mcnary 
rejected those calls describing the report as soft and 
hedged 
as many as 10 percent of the 46 million employers considered 
under the gao survey may be discriminating based on national 
origins because of confusion over the 1986 immigration reform and 
control act the report said 
discrimination related to the law is widespread and 
serious but not pervasive according to the 162page report 
employers discriminate because the laws verification system 
does not provide a simple or reliable method to verify job 
applicants eligibility to work the report said 
it indicated that those who do the hiring are uncertain about 
just which applicants they may hire and discriminate lest they 
incur federal sanctions 
bias might be reduced the report said by more information for 
employers and a simpler more reliable system 
the law requires employers to complete an eligibility form for 
each newly hired worker and allows employees to establish their 
eligibility by presenting any of 17 different documents such as a 
us passport or birth certificate or an alien registration card 
ins and the labor department may inspect the forms employers 
who knowing hire unauthorized workers are subject to sanctions 
the provisions were part of an overall bill designed to reduce 
the number of illegal aliens flooding over the nations southern 
border in search of jobs concerns were raised in congress during 
debate on the bill that employers would discriminate against 
individuals who were foreign looking 
to compile data for its report the gao used methods ranging 
from surveying employers to a socalled hiring audit in conjunction 
with the urban institute in which pairs of testers went job 
hunting in chicago and san diego 
in each pair one tester appeared and sounded hispanic while the 
other did not both were equally qualified 
both testers applied for the same jobs the gao said 342 
anglo testers completed job applications while 327 hispanics 
did a total of 229 anglos received interviews compared with 172 
hispanics and 129 anglos were offered jobs compared with 85 
hispanics 
although the primary focus of the law was illegal immigration 
the gaos overall study concerned itself with discrimination based 
on national origins and not just bias against one group 
mcnary said some of the figures in the report are also soft 
because there is no base of comparison in the past he cited a 
statement within the document that some interpreters may not agree 
they own up to the fact that others may disagree and for good 
reason he said at a news conference 
his remarks brought a swift retort from officials of the 
american civil liberties union 
the gao grappled with this question very specifically and very 
carefully said lucas guttentag director of the aclu immigration 
project 
who is the commissioner to question whether the documentation 
is soft asked wade henderson associate director of the aclus 
washington office this is not the victims of discrimination who 
are complaining this is the employers themselves 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said the report confirms 
exactly what many of us in congress feared when employer sanctions 
were enacted in 1986 the sanctions would be discriminatory against 
hispanic american citizens asianamerican citizens and other 
ethnic minorities and it would be difficult to implement the law 
in a way that avoids such discrimination 
kennedy said he would introduce legislation to repeal the 
sanctions in an expedited fashion provided for under the 1986 law 
however sen alan simpson rwyo who has taken a leading role 
in writing immigration legislation expressed strong disagreement 
with the gao report 
he noted that the report found that only 66 percent of 
employers said they began not hiring job applicants whose foreign 
appearance or accent led the company to suspect they might be 
unauthorized aliens 
while that was the case the survey also found that 147 percent 
of the employers began to hire only people born in the united 
states and 13 percent stopped hiring individuals with temporary 
work eligibility documents

the food and drug administration said thursday 
that two lots of an antidepressant drug called desipramine are 
being recalled because some bottles may contain a bloodthinner 
that could cause serious bleeding 
the manufacturer pharmaceutical basics inc of denver told the 
fda it was recalling the products after distributor hl moore of 
new britain conn found a mislabeled bottle of the drug earlier 
this week 
the bottle was labeled as containing 25 milligrams of 
desipramine but it contained 5 milligram tabelets of warfarin a 
bloodthinner 
the fda said people taking the antidepressant should examine 
their tablets to see if any are marked with the name warfarin 
warfarin is a noncoated pink tablet with 5 on one side and 
832 and the word warfarin on the other side 
desipramine is a coated lavender tablet with the numbers 
832 and g254 imprinted on it 
pharmaceutical basics is notifying moores 350 customers by 
phone of the possible label mixup the fda said 
the recall applies only to desipramine made by pharmaceutical 
basics for distribution by moore about six other manufacturers 
make despiramine 
the fda said it is likely that pharmacists would catch 
mislabeled tablets because the two tablets are so different 
however the fda said people who have filled or refilled a 
prescription for moores 25 milligram desipramine within the last 
six months should return the prescription to the pharmacy to be 
checked or replaced 
the lots being recalled are g87301 and g68508 
carl peck director of the fdas center for drug evaluation and 
research warned that if people taking four to eight tablets a day 
of desipramine took the same number of warfarin tablets in the 
worst case they could experience severe bleeding such as stomach 
or intracranial hemorrhage

a missiledevelopment arm of the iraqi 
government allegedly tried to buy nuclearwarhead triggers made by 
a california company according to a federal indictment unsealed 
thursday 
the alleged role of alqaqaa state establishment in the scheme 
to illegally export the electronic triggers was laid out in the 
indictment against five people and two companies 
two of the five people named in the indictment unsealed in san 
diego were arrested in london wednesday the three others were 
identified as alqaqaa engineers and are believed to be in iraq 
authorities said 
the indictment says that in discussions with an undercover 
agent the iraqis did not specifically say the triggers would be 
used to detonate nuclear warheads but they insisted on design 
specifications that left nothing to the imagination said john 
c kelley who directs the us customs services strategic exports 
unit 
kelley said the iraqis also expressed an interest in obtaining 
other components of timing devices for the warheads 
the prospect of nuclearwarhead triggers being sold to iraq is 
not only illegal it is a very frightening situation we are dealing 
with customs commissioner carol hallett said 
the indictment returned last month by a federal grand jury 
charges that euromac london ltd and atlas equipment uk ltd 
acted on behalf of the iraqi government to illegally obtain the 
devices 
mrs hallett said euromac was a purchasing agent for the iraqi 
government and had done millions of dollars worth of business 
in buying arms for iraq during that countrys war with iran 
the indictment followed an 18month undercover investigation 
conducted by us and british customs agents 
the indictments description of iraqs alleged role in the 
scheme contradicts denials by iraqi officials that their government 
is seeking to develop a nuclear arsenal 
the indictment said that ali ashour daghir who was ordered held 
without bond in london was managing director of the companies 
jeanine speckman who was released on bail after her appearance 
in a british court was accused of being an executive for the 
companies who participated in the negotiations to buy the triggers 
the indictment charges that the companies and the five 
individual defendants conspired to illegally export the 
warheaddetonation capacitors made by csi technologies inc of san 
marcos calif 
the indictment charged that the defendants did not seek export 
licenses from the state department as required by us law after 
ordering the detonators from csi 
the defendants are also charged with money laundering arising 
from the alleged transfer of 10500 from britain to csis account 
with the bank of america in escondido calif to pay for the 
detonators 
the indictment was returned feb 23 and amended with an 
additional charge last week the alqaqaa engineers charged in the 
indictment are karim dhaidas omran dafir alazawi and wallid issa 
ahmad 
alqaqaa is a weapons development unit of iraqs ministry of 
industry and military industrialization the indictment said 
it was not immediately clear when and if the defendants in 
britain could be extradited for the crimes charged in the 
indictment mrs hallett conceded there was little likelihood 
the three engineers believed to be in iraq would ever be arrested 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said officials were 
reviewing which crimes charged in the indictment were subject to 
the usbritish extradition treaty 
while we could request extradition tomorrow according to the 
treaty they would not be extraditable until they go through the 
british legal system 
the indictment charges the conspiracy began in september 1988 
when the two british companies allegedly contacted a london 
representative of csi about obtaining the detonators 
mrs hallett said the company immediately notified customs 
agents of the iraqi overture the company entered into negotiations 
that fall about the price and design specifications 
a representative of the british company told csi officials that 
a delegation from iraq had placed the order the indictment stated 
customs agent daniel supnick posing as a csi executive joined 
the negotiations last fall in london the indictment said 
to disguise the shipment speckman suggested that it be labeled 
as components for air conditioning the indictment also said 
the moneylaundering charges stem from the alleged transfer of 
money to further an illegal conspiracy

the rev laszlo toekes an ethnic hungarian whose 
resistance ignited romanias december revolution accused the new 
regime thursday of abuses reminiscent of ousted communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
toekes 37 an outspoken ceausescu critic has been elected 
bishop in the reformed church an announcement thursday by state 
bucharest radio said he will serve in the northwestern city of 
oradea near the hungarian border 
in comments thursday in geneva toekes said extreme nationalist 
romanian groups were to blame for deadly clashes between ethnic 
hungarians and romanians last week in tirgu mures a transylvania 
city about 250 miles northwest of bucharest 
toekes who was traveling in the united states during the ethnic 
unrest accused the interim romanian government of failing to 
intervene and of spreading false information that ethnic 
hungarians provoked the clashes 
he questioned the value of a proposed official inquiry saying 
authorities blamed the hungarian population from the outset 
many romanians believe ethnic hungarians in transylvania want to 
secede and join hungary the ethnic hungarians say they only want 
more cultural autonomy last weeks unrest in tirgu mures 
reportedly killed six people and left 300 injured 
in a statement distributed to a meeting at the genevabased 
world council of churches toekes said misinformation from the 
interim government and the romanian media reminds one of the 
practices of the ceausescuera 
ceausescu argued in the same way in keeping with his 
longstanding policy of dividing the nationalities and playing 
the hungarian minority as if the jews of the country against 
the romanian nation he said 
ceaucescu was executed during the revolution which broke out in 
the western city of timisoara when demonstrators tried to evict 
toekes from his church 
toekes had run afoul of authorities by championing hungarian 
rights after the outbreak of the revolution ceausescu loyalists 
tried to assassinate toekes but he escaped without injury 
in his statement thursday he said allegations that ethnic 
hungarians in transylvania want unification with neighboring 
hungary are unfounded and intended to incite hatred 
what happened in tirgu mures was something like a pogrom its 
perpetrators came exclusively from among romanians stirred up in 
the spirit of ceausescuism he said 
at a press conference in thursday in geneva toekes said former 
reform church leaders had collaborated with ceausescu and his hated 
secret police he accused senior church officials in the town of 
cluj of harassing and persecuting him for his outspoken stance 
he also criticized the world council of churches for being too 
loyal to hardline communist governments in power throughout 
eastern europe before last years changes swept the region 
he said that while the world council had consistently criticized 
racial discrimination in south africa it had shown great tolerance 
toward atheist regimes that were most dangerous to the christian 
faith 
the world council groups about 300 nonroman catholic churches 
in more than 100 countries 
the reformed church is the largest protestant denomination in 
romania it has an estimated 800000 faithful mainly etnnic 
hungarians living in transylvania

crew members fought over survival suits in the 
final minutes before a fishing boat sank in the bering sea a week 
ago a survivor testified at a hearing thursday 
crew member harvey dale philpot also told the coast guard and 
national transportation safety board inquiry that he couldnt close 
the suit he had grabbed because the zipper was corroded 
philpot 20 testified he had received no safety training aboard 
the 162foot trawler aleutian enterprise which capsized and sank 
march 22 nine crew members are missing and presumed dead 
twentytwo crew members survived 
the crewman said there was little warning the ship was in 
trouble and that he first noticed something was wrong when it 
began to list while he was in a freezer on the lower deck 
when he went up to the next level the list had increased and the 
port side of the deck was covered with four or five feet of water 
philpot said 
philpot said he tried to turn on a pump but it didnt work 
crew members then began yelling to abandon ship and he ran to the 
next deck up to wake up his friend matt price 19 and to get a 
survival suit 
at a box where the flotation suits were stored he and four or 
five men struggled over the suits he said 
people were trying to grab from one another he said 
philpot said somebody tried to grab his suit but i was 
holding on to it i wasnt letting go 
once he was topside philpot donned the suit and tried to zip it 
up but found the zipper corroded it just wouldnt go he said 
by that time the ship had heeled far to port and philpot and 
others on deck were swept into the nearfreezing water he said he 
clung to buoys and debris until he was picked up by one of the life 
boats he said 
the survivors later were picked up by other fishing boats 
philpot said that on another fishing boat he worked on the crew 
ran through safety drills and suit zippers were waxed to ensure 
they worked none of that happened on the aleutian enterprise he 
said 
terry baker chief executive officer of arctic alaska fisheries 
corp the operator of the cod fishing and processing boat said 
outside the hearing he was surprised at the testimony about the 
suits 
its the first ive heard of it baker said adding there 
were more than a total of 30 suits at three locations on the boat 
he declined to comment on philpots testimony about safety 
training except to say we try to give as much training as 
possible 
philpot the leadoff witness in the hearing that is expected to 
continue through early next week also said he thought he smelled 
marijuana in the ships pilot house early in the voyage under 
questioning by coast guard officers he said that was the only 
occasion he detected any illegal drugs and that he did not know 
the crewman in the pilot house 
the aleutian enterprises captain mark siemons was outside the 
pilot house at the time he said 
philpot said alcohol was banned on the boat 
as the hearing opened attorneys for arctic alaska and siemons 
objected that it was being held so soon after the accident 
attorney jim whitehead representing the company said some family 
members were still conducting memorial services for the missing 
and the coast guard was showing unintended insensitivity to 
them 
coast guard capt rene roussel the hearings chairman said the 
coast guard wanted to get the information about the sinking on 
record as soon as possible

albanias hardline communist regime is 
considering liberalizing its penal code and creating a justice 
ministry to oversee its courts that countrys official news agency 
reported thursday 
draft laws before the council of ministers propose penal code 
changes that would allow for rehabilitation of prisoners and an 
early release program the ata news agency said 
albanias leaders have steadfastly rejected the reforms that 
swept other hardline communist regimes from power in eastern 
europe last year 
however under communist leader ramiz alia this small balkan 
country has increasingly emerged from decades of selfimposed 
isolation 
in past years it has sought more contact with other balkan 
nations this month albania opened direct telephone service with 
the west 
in another sign of cautious change the official media 
acknowledged last month that romania holds 83 political prisoners 
thursdays ata report monitored in vienna gave no details of 
the draft law on rehabilitation and early release it also did not 
explain exactly what the ministry of justice would do

new yorks highest court on thursday upheld 
the manslaughter convictions of three men found guilty in the 
howard beach racial attack case 
jon lester scott kern and jason ladone had appealed their 
convictions contending their lawyers were wrongly prohibited from 
rejecting blacks as jurors in the racially charged case 
lester kern and ladone all white were convicted in december 
1987 of manslaughter assault and conspiracy for attacking three 
black men in the predominantly white howard beach section of 
queens a new york city borough in 1986 
one of the blacks 23yearold michael griffith was struck by a 
car and killed as he fled across a nearby highway another man 
cedric sandiford was beaten with tree limbs and a baseball bat 
the case before the state court of appeals centered on whether a 
1986 us supreme court ruling that prohibits prosecutors from 
excluding jurors based on race also applies to defending lawyers 
state supreme court justice thomas demakos the presiding judge in 
the howard beach case applied that standard to defense lawyers 
we agree with the courts below that such purposeful racial 
discrimination is prohibited by our state constitution said 
court of appeals judge fritz alexander in a 70 decision 
obviously were disappointed john pollok a lawyer for the 
three men said thursday he said he hadnt seen the decision but 
that he would consider asking the us supreme court to hear an 
appeal 
pollok argued before the court of appeals that prosecutors 
systematically excluded whites without giving justification to 
help gain a conviction at the same time the defense was prevented 
from doing the same with prospective black jurors he said 
as it turned out only one black was on the 12person jury 
there were also six whites three asians and two hispanics 
brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes who was appointed 
special prosecutor in the howard beach case praised thursdays 
decision 
it means that 12 judges in two separate rulings have 
unanimously affirmed that the defendants received a fair trial 
hynes said 
in criminal cases lawyers for each side may exclude a set 
number of jurors without having to give a reason however 
prosecutors may be stopped if the court believes they are rejecting 
jurors because of race in the howard beach case prosecutors asked 
that the same standard be applied to defense lawyers 
the court of appeals also rejected arguments that the three men 
were convicted with insufficient evidence 
lester was sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and is in jail 
kern was sentenced to up to 18 years and ladone up to 15 years in 
prison kern and ladone were still out on bail thursday said 
pollok

the soviet economy is heading inevitably toward 
polishstyle shock therapy to introduce a market system if 
consumers do not become so disgruntled that they block all reform 
a senior official said thursday 
vyacheslav senchagov chief of the state price committee told 
deputies of the supreme soviet that under the most radical of three 
alternatives being considered prices for raw materials and 
consumer goods are likely to rise drastically the value of the 
soviet ruble will plummet and unemployment will soar 
the government favors a more moderate approach with a transition 
period he said in remarks before his committee carried by the tass 
news agency 
but tass said senchagov acknowledged that choosing the most 
radical approach is inevitable if during the transitional period 
the populations confidence in the government does not fall so 
low as to make no reforms possible 
senchagov said the government has not yet decided which approach 
it will try to implement 
president mikhail s gorbachev said after being sworn in as the 
countrys first executive president on march 15 that his most 
important task was to take more radical steps to cure the economy 
last week a source confirmed previous news reports that 
gorbachev economists are working on a 17point program leading to a 
market system and convertibility of the soviet unions currency on 
world markets 
the source who is working on the program said soviet 
economists were encouraged by polands tough measures that went 
into effect on jan 1 but were worried they might create huge 
unemployment and the need for a vast welfare program 
the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
many reports in moscow say a radical economic shakeup will be 
put into effect this summer 
senchagovs bureaucracy sets soviet prices without regard to 
actual costs creating artificially low prices for oil and gas and 
many natural resources as well as for food and basic consumer 
goods 
but the artificially low return for soviet industry stifles 
production and initiative 
subsidies to keep prices low now cost the government the 
equivalent of onefifth the total volume of the countrys retail 
trade senchagov reported 
soviet consumers have become used to a system that offers a 
minimum of choice for low prices and many react with alarm to 
reports that the government is planning to free prices public 
concern has forced the government to delay key price reforms 
several times 
as a result of government management of prices one 
videocassette costs about twice as much as a 1200mile airline 
trip 
also the country has long told its people they have a right to 
a job but many enterprises lose money because of bloated payrolls 
polands prices have increased 1366 percent during the 12month 
period ending feb 28 the warsaw government says and more than 
200000 people are unemployed but inflation has dropped from 79 
percent in january to an estimated 6 percent in march 
poland has restocked its store shelves while soviets see their 
stores becoming emptier and emptier 
the most conservative of the three approaches in moscow would 
raise some prices for raw materials and some manufactured goods by 
fixed amounts another would free completely up to 30 percent of 
all prices set an acceptable range for other prices and control 
prices for staple goods 
under the most radical approach oil and coal prices will 
increase 35 times the number of collective and state farms known 
for their inefficiency will drop by 80 percent unprofitable 
enterprises will be closed and unemployment will increase fast 
tass quoted senchagov as saying 
the official ruble rate against convertible currencies will 
drop many times even in the most moderate plan the rubles 
value will be cut in half 
a ruble now ranges in value from 159 for locals in the soviet 
union to about 16 cents when foreigners exchange their hard 
currency

parliament moved to end a 123year ban 
on abortions thursday by voting to allow abortion during the first 
12 weeks of pregnancy if the woman is deemed to be in distress 
the senate approved the bill last november and it now must be 
signed into law by king baudouin 
that would leave ireland as the only european community nation 
with a total ban on abortions 
the house of representatives voted 126 to 69 with 12 
abstentions to scrap an 1867 law that made abortion a criminal 
offense and provided terms of up to five years in prison for 
offenders 
that law has been spottily enforced in recent years belgian 
women have been getting abortions for years with little 
interference from authorities also many traveled outside belgium 
to have abortions 
thursdays vote split prime minister wilfried martens 
centerleft coalition along christian democraticsocialist lines 
but coalition partners agreed beforehand the vote would not result 
in a government crisis 
church officials in in this overwhelmingly catholic country 
vigorously opposed the bill though opinion polls indicated most 
belgians feel abortion should be decriminalized 
under the new measure a woman can get an abortion during the 
first 12 weeks of pregnancy if she and her doctor feel she is in 
distress due to the pregnancy 
opponents attacked the term distress as too vague creating 
a situation of abortion on demand 
conservative legislator annemie neyts who supported the bill 
said i have trouble with claims saying the bill is the dawn of 
an age of moral depravation 
christian democrat paul hermans who opposed the measure said 
supporters considered the fetus an inferior being which merits 
only inferior protection 
the government of flanders belgiums dutchspeaking northern 
half meanwhile granted 51 million in subsidies for an 
information campaign on preventing undesired pregnancies 
over the last 20 years the abortion issue became a bitter 
political fight thousands took to the streets in the 1970s over 
the issue 
protests heated up in 1973 when a doctor was jailed for more 
than a month accused of performing hundreds of abortions he was 
later released 
the bill approved thursday capped a 16year period in which more 
than a dozen proabortion bills were voted down in parliament

violence that has terrorized the population of this impoverished 
caribbean nation since avrils ouster

the dreaded paramilitary thugs known as tonton macoutes were 
outlawed after dictator jeanclaude baby doc duvalier was

as special agents and have often been accused of statesponsored 
terrorism

the medellin cocaine cartel hinted 
thursday it will retaliate for the governments renewed extradition 
of drug suspects to the united states 
the cartels message came in a communique a day after the 
government of president virgilio barco sent 29yearold fernando 
gutierrez to arizona for trial on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges it was the first extradition of a drug 
trafficking suspect since jan 21 
the cartel which has been waging a war with the government 
claimed thursday it had been betrayed by officials who started and 
then backed out of talks aimed at a settlement to a bloody conflict 
that has left more than 200 colombians dead since the august 
slaying of a presidential candidate 
accusing the police of murdering suspects the group said we 
will not remain indifferent in the face of betrayal torture and 
killing of our companions it did not elaborate 
it again called extraditions illegal and attacks against 
colombian sovereignty 
the traffickers communique given to medellin news media was 
signed by the extraditables the name adopted by the medellin 
cartel 
the government has been using extraditions feared by the 
traffickers as a weapon in its usbacked war with traffickers 
extradition is considered necessary because traffickers often 
evade colombian justice by killing and bribing judges gutierrez 
was the 15th colombian extradited since august and police are 
holding 17 more colombians wanted by the united states 
in a statement thursday barco said the government this year had 
captured 845 drug suspects and seized more than 19000 pounds of 
cocaine other seizures include 31 million in cash 387 pounds of 
gold and about 21000 pounds of dynamite 
on jan 17 the cartel declared a unilateral truce it said it 
was prepared to surrender to the government in exchange for an end 
to extradition 
speculation about possible talks between the government and 
traffickers increased during the last two months because no one 
else was extradited 
that speculation peaked sunday when interior minister carlos 
lemos simmonds resigned he said the government had lost its will 
to fight the traffickers 
in thursdays communique the cartel said two businessmen acted 
as intermediaries in the talks it said they were received by barco 
on various occasions to negotiate the release of the son of the 
presidents closest adviser german montoya 
the cartel kidnapped alvaro montoya on dec 20 and released him 
on jan 23 in one of a series of what it called goodwill gestures 
to show the government its desire for peace 
barco denied thursday that the government had negotiated with 
traffickers and said it would continue fighting the criminals 
there has not been nor will there be official nor 
extraofficial contacts between the government and representatives 
of drug traffickers much less pacts treaties and agreements 
between the government and drug traffickers barco said in his 
communique thursday 
barco acknowledged that the businessman had been received but 
he called it an informal gathering without official status 
the cartel communique claimed that while the government was 
negotiating with traffickers it sent police death squads to wipe 
them out the cartel accused police of murdering 40 of its members 
the barco administration took more action thursday against 
traffickers declaring martial law in a medellin area township that 
is reportedly controlled by medellin cartel leader pablo escobar 
the move allows a military administrator to take over policing 
power from the popularly elected mayor of envigado

astronomers have identified for the first time 
what they believe is a brown dwarf star a stellar body that lacks 
the mass to trigger the fusion reaction that gives stars their 
brilliant light 
the national science foundation announced thursday that philip 
a ianna of the university of virginia and michael s bessell of 
the stromlo and siding spring observatories in australia identified 
the candidate brown dwarf after taking measurements of its 
brightness and mass 
visible only in the skies of the southern hemisphere the dim 
red stellar body equals about 5 percent of the mass of the sun the 
sun emits about 4000 times more light than the dwarf 
the dwarf is in the milky way the galaxy which includes the 
sun and is about 68 lightyears away the astronomers said a 
lightyear is the distance light travels in a year a bit less than 
6 trillion miles 
brown dwarfs have been theorized to exist for years with most 
experts predicting they would have 7 percent to 8 percent of the 
mass of the sun 
this would not be sufficient mass for gravitational forces to 
compress it and heat it to the point where its hydrogen fuses into 
helium without fusion such a stellar body would give off only a 
faint red glow caused by its modest gravitational compression 
ianna and bessell said they found the candidate brown dwarf by 
studying a group of very very faint stars first discovered by 
michael r s hawkins of the royal observatory in edinburgh 
scotland 
we have measured the distance from earth to what seemed like 
the dimmest of these stars and found that the star is truly 
faint ianna said in a statement released by the foundation 
this supports the hypothesis that this whole group of stars is 
faint and contains other brown dwarf candidates 
some astronomers have suggested that brown dwarfs may be the 
socalled missing matter of the universe 
the missing matter question arose when astronomers studying the 
movement of stars and galaxies concluded that gravitation forces 
acting on visible stellar bodies are too great to be explained by 
the mass of the observed objects in space some believe that up to 
90 percent of the matter in the universe is not seen brown dwarfs 
it has been proposed could be part of the undetected matter 
there is also a theory that the missing mass is cold dark 
matter such as interstellar molecules black holes and a subatomic 
particles called neutrinos which cannot be observed 
ianna and bessell studied the candidate brown dwarf using an 
electronic camera on the onemeter telescope at the siding spring 
observatory 
sighting from two different perspectives within the earths 
orbit of the sun the scientists were able to calculate the 
distance of the object from earth the mass of the object was 
estimated based on studies of its luminosity or brightness

the countrys top investigating agency 
thursday accused four former government officials of accepting 
bribes from airbus industrie to award a 147 billion contract to 
the european consortium 
the central bureau of investigation filed preliminary charges 
against ss sidhu the former aviation secretary rk prasad 
indian airlines former managing director kamini chadha another 
former managing director of the airline and former deputy managing 
director bk bhasin 
also accused were unidentified officials of airbus industrie 
based in toulouse france and international aero engines a 
company based in switzerland and east hartford conn it 
manufactured the v2500 engines used in the a320s 
under indian law preliminary charges are registered before the 
court and state that enough evidence exits to investigate final or 
regular charges are filed when investigations are completed 
the charges said the officials accepted kickbacks to reverse a 
decision to purchase usmade boeing 757 jetliners and instead buy 
38 airbus a320s they did not say how much the alleged kickbacks 
amounted to 
airbus officials in france said they had not been notified 
officially about the investigation they said they were surprised 
by the allegations and refused further comment 
the charges also said other public servants a term that would 
include politicians in office at the time of the alleged wrongoind 
were involved 
the bureau began investigating the deal completed in june 
after an indian airlines a320 crashed feb 14 while landing at the 
southern indian city of bangalore the crash killed 92 of the 146 
people on board 
prasad resigned after the accident 
the crash triggered criticism in the indian press it questioned 
the roles played by members of prime minister rajiv gandhis 
government in awarding the contract to airbus 
the previous government pushed through the deal with undue 
haste said india today a respected news magazine a month after 
the crash it ignored other options as well as warning signals 
about the inadequacy of the ground support system and brushed aside 
the need for more time to evaluate the aircraft 
indian newspapers said the bangalore crash was a result of the 
planes engines not responding in time to a computer command by the 
pilot when he found the aircraft was coming in too low for its 
landing 
it was the second crash involving an a320 the only passenger 
aircraft with computerized flight controls three people were 
killed in june 1988 when an a320 crashed during an airshow in 
france 
the government grounded all indian airlines a320s pending the 
report of a committee investigating the bangalore crash further 
deliveries of the plane have been halted 
the investigation is the third launched by prime minister vp 
singhs government into deals made by previous governments 
singh replaced rajiv gandhi as prime minister in december after 
triumphing in parliamentary elections he campaigned on a promise 
to end government corruption 
the central bureau of investigation is also inquiring into the 
purchase of artillery guns from the swedish company ab bofors and 
the purchase of submarines from the west german firm howaldt 
deutsche werke both have been clouded by allegations of kickbacks

the new legislature of the baltic republic estonia 
on thursday agreed to debate a more gradual path to restoring 
independence than that of lithuania a legislator said 
the supreme soviet of estonia on the first day of its session 
also elected arnold ruutel president of the republic reported the 
official soviet news agency tass ruutel is a former chairman of 
the legislatures presidium 
mart laar an independent deputy said in a telephone interview 
that the legislators friday are to debate a declaration saying the 
republic will work toward restoring the independence estonia 
enjoyed before it was annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
a second proposal calls for the legislature to cooperate with 
the estonian congress an informal group of 500 people that met 
earlier this month they consider themselves the real 
representative of estonians 
a bill calling for a transition to independence is on the 
agenda but the legislation probably will not be discussed friday 
laar said he said the length of the transition period so far has 
not been set 
tass said the proposals had been put forward by the estonian 
peoples front political movement which controls more than 40 of 
the 105 supreme soviet seats the legislators were elected in 
contested balloting march 18 
the estonian legislatures approach to restoring independence 
mirrors the path taken by the republics communist party meeting 
sunday the party established a sixmonth transition period to full 
independence from the soviet party 
estonians have taken a more cautious approach than lithuanians 
that baltic republic declared independence from moscow on march 11 
and it has been embroiled in a tense standoff with soviet 
authorities ever since 
estonian activists say they must act more cautiously because 
they do not have such large ethnic or legislative majorities as the 
lithuanians do in their republic the estonians also say they want 
to establish the conditions for independence before formally 
breaking with moscow 
the deputies also must elect a premier tass said a close 
election was expected between the current head of government 
indrik toome and the leader of the peoples front edgar savisaar

a longawaited government study of cancer among 
vietnam veterans found no evidence linking the disease with 
exposure to the herbicide agent orange officials said thursday 
the study by the us centers for disease control which looked 
only indirectly at agent orange did find veterans at increased 
risk of a relatively rare cancer called nonhodgkins lymphoma but 
researchers noted the risk was greater among veterans who served on 
ships than those who served on land where the herbicide was used 
in washington veterans secretary edward j derwinski quickly 
said he would order the department of veterans affairs to pay 
disability compensation to vets suffering from nonhodgkins 
lymphoma 
the study was immediately attacked by veterans groups which 
complained it failed to sufficiently examine the cancer risks among 
the thousands of soldiers who actually worked with the dangerous 
herbicide during the war 
it is not an agent orange study objected mary r stout 
president of the vietnam veterans of america 
this is only a look at vietnam veterans who had cancer 
added john hansen spokesman for the american legion 
and sen tom daschle dsd cochairman of the vietnamera 
veterans in congress caucus said this action has been a long 
time coming however it is not the final word we cannot forget 
the many other veterans who are also suffering and dying from agent 
orangerelated diseases and who have just as much evidence 
supporting their claims 
agent orange sprayed by the us military to remove jungle 
cover and crops in vietnam contained dioxin a highly toxic 
chemical which some studies have found to increase cancer risks 
criticism of the study focused on its methods which involved 
comparing cancer patients of vietnamveteran age to healthy 
counterparts 
the study only indirectly evaluated agent orange exposure 
because of the technical difficulties in determining two decades 
later how much a patient may have been exposed to the herbicide 
the cdc said 
specific analysis of dioxin exposure was impractical partly 
because researchers dont know how cancer may skew the results of 
blood tests for dioxin levels said dr daniel a hoffman 
assistant director for science at the cdcs center for 
environmental health 
our study was designed to look at vietnam experience and 
history and secondly to ascertain the likelihood of exposure 
hoffman said 
the study conducted over five years surveyed 2067 cancer 
patients who were of approximate vietnam service age between 15 
and 39 in 1968 at the height of us troop involvement they were 
compared to 1776 men of similar age who had no history of cancer 
both groups were studied for risk of six kinds of cancer 
including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas a group of 
cancers that the cdc concedes has been of great concern among 
vietnam veterans 
vietnam vets were found to have a roughly 50 percent increased 
risk for nonhodgkins lymphoma 
the study did not find any evidence that the increased risk 
might be due to agent orange exposure said cdc director william 
l roper 
that conclusion the cdc said came in part because the cancer 
risk among vietnam veterans seemed to be the opposite of the 
pattern for use of agent orange 
vets from the navys ocean ships had somewhat higher cancer 
risks than those who served on land and veterans from the region 
of heaviest agent orange use were at somewhat lower risk than 
others the cdc said 
specifically the yearly risk of nonhodgkins lymphoma is about 
one in 10000 for men 3559 the age group of most vietnam vets 
the risk for vietnam vets overall is about 15 per 10000 roper 
said 
the risk nearly doubled 90 percent higher for navy veterans 
stationed on ocean ships 
the 50 percent higher risk is what epidemiologists call a weak 
association hoffman said it is statistically significant but 
anything less than a twofold increase can sometimes be caused by 
other factors 
the cdc found no increased risk for sarcomas usually 
cancers of the bodys connective tissues or for other cancer types 
the va had been awaiting the study before deciding whether to 
award benefits to vets exposed to agent orange nearly 35000 
claims have been filed citing the chemical as a cause of 
disabilities including cancer skin disease and miscarriages by 
soldiers wives 
in announcing the nonhodgkins lymphoma benefits derwinski 
mentioned only the link between vietnam service and the lymphoma 
he didnt say the connection was because of agent orange 
payments which would be retroactive are expected to cost 23 
million the first year and 25 million a year in succeeding years 
va officials said based on the study the va estimated 1800 
veterans are due compensation and there will be 450 new cases each 
year 
the complaints before the va arent the only ones about agent 
orange a classaction lawsuit against the seven manufacturers of 
agent orange was settled in 1984 in us district court in new 
york and payments began last year 
the court has estimated that 30000 veterans and 18000 survivor 
families would be eligible for benefits from a settlement fund of 
at least 240 million 
the settlements courtappointed administrator washington 
attorney kenneth feinberg had yet to see the cdc study and 
couldnt say what effect if any it might have on the case his 
office said

authorities uncovered hundreds of human 
skeleton parts near a camp where soviet soldiers kept nazi 
prisoners after world war ii east germanys news agency said 
wednesday 
the adn news agency said remains of 200 to 1000 people were 
unearthed from mass graves near a former soviet internment camp in 
the district of oranienburg about 30 miles north of berlin 
authorities began excavating at oranienburg after a 66yearold 
resident told local officials last week that he remembers watching 
soviet soldiers shoot 100 to 400 german prisoners in the area from 
1946 to 1948 
east germanys berliner zeitung newspaper said last week that up 
to 12000 german inmates may have died at another soviet internment 
camp near fuenfeichen about 80 miles north of berlin 
many of the camps used by the soviets had been used as prison 
camps by the nazis 
although the paper said most were nazi soldiers it said many 
innocent people including youngsters died at the camp at 
fuenfeichen 
there have been reports for years that large numbers of nazi 
prisoners died in stalinera prison camps but little evidence 
until east germany shed its hardline communist government in last 
years popular revolt 
during the nazi era 6 million jews were exterminated and 
hundreds of thousands of gypsies poles and others were killed 
a west german official said this week that 65000 to 70000 
german prisoners may have died at the postwar soviet camps

most of the 12000 contra rebels 
have returned to nicaragua from honduran base camps and the rest 
will return by this weekend ahead of an april 20 deadline a 
contra chief said thursday 
they did not wait for the un forces and turn in weapons 
said oscar sovalbarro a military chief of the nicaraguan 
resistance the rebels umbrella group only about 3000 
warwounded and their families remain in the camps 
under an agreement reached friday between the contras and 
representatives of presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro the 
rebels are to disband and turn in their weapons five days before 
the new government takes over april 25 from the leftist sandinistas 
rebels in nicaragua are to gather in unsupervised security 
zones under the toncontin accord but there is no deadline for their 
demobilization the agreement takes its name from the honduran air 
base where it was signed 
a large majority of our combatants have already crossed the 
honduran border to go to nicaragua sovalbarro said the 
nicaraguan resistance in that way fulfills its promises 
us ambassador chris arcos congratulated president rafael 
leonardo callejas for his role in getting the rebels to leave 
honduras 
the contras have been dissolved and callejas resolved that 
problem arcos said in a news conference at the presidential 
offices it was a notable feat by callejas 
callejas sponsored the negotiations in which nicaraguan 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo archbishop of managua also 
participated 
in our camps in yamales there are few weapons and few 
combatants left and before the end of the week they will be in 
nicaragua sovalbarro said 
yamales 125 miles southwest of tegucigalpa and just inside the 
border with nicaragua has been used by the rebels since the start 
nine years ago of their usbacked war to overthrow the 
sandinistas 
sovalbarro 29 known as commander ruben signed the agreement 
with the incoming government 
we want to turn in our rifles in nicaragua because if there is 
going to be democracy in our country then we will exchange our 
weapons for the plow to cultivate the land he said 
the camps will be completely deserted in the next three weeks 
no one will remain here he said 
reporters who visited camps this week said they were nearly 
deserted 
an estimated 80000 hondurans displaced by the rebels including 
20000 coffee producers were forced to move to the interior of the 
country or traveled illegally to the united states or mexico to 
find work

the mother of one of the 87 people killed in a 
fire at an illegal social club filed a 510 million lawsuit 
thursday the first stemming from the inferno an attorney said 
the lawsuit seeks that amount in damages from the owners 
lessees and proprietors of the happy land social club in the bronx 
it also names the man charged with setting the fire 
attorney harry lipsig said he filed the lawsuit in bronx state 
supreme court new yorks triallevel court on behalf of jennie 
mae danzler mother of natalie danzler 31 
lipsig said he also notified city officials he planned to sue 
the city because of its reckless conduct in connection with the 
club 
earlier thursday angry city council members pressed top city 
officials about how happy land could have remained open despite 
repeated warnings that such clubs were catastrophes waiting to 
happen 
if you dont learn from the past youre condemned to repeat 
its mistakes council member sheldon s leffler said as he 
questioned police commissioner lee brown at a meeting of the 
councils public safety committee 
we all bear the blame bronx borough president fernando 
ferrer said outside the meeting weve got to keep the heat on 
until we can resolve this problem 
the fire occurred early sunday as the clubs patrons many of

the senate by a razorthin margin turned back 
pleas for special aid to coal miners thursday rejecting a measure 
senate leaders and the white house said could have jeopardized 
broader clean air legislation 
the 500 million assistance amendment was voted down 50 to 49 
after five hours of debate during which supporters argued the 
miners needed help because they would be adversely affected by 
tougher air pollution controls 
the measure was seen as the biggest remaining obstacle to 
passage of major air pollution control legislation that is 
scheduled for a final vote next tuesday a similar bill is pending 
in a house committee 
the government has estimated more than 5000 miners of 
highsulfur coal are likely to lose their jobs as midwest utilities 
switch to other fuels to meet new pollution requirements in the 
coming years 
the narrow vote was a victory for senate leaders of both parties 
george mitchell dmaine and bob dole rkan as well as the 
bush administration which had opposed the assistance proposal as 
too expensive and discriminatory against other workers 
the white house had threatened to withdraw support from any bill 
that exceeded the current estimated 21 billionayear cost and 
mitchell said the amendment pressed by sen robert c byrd 
dwva probably would have pushed the total beyond that level 
in separate action late thursday the senate agreed to an 
amendment that would require the use by 1993 of a cleaner blend 
of gasoline in automobiles in the nine cities with the worst smog 
problems the measure was approved by a voice vote after an attempt 
to kill it failed 6930 
in the house the energy and commerce committee beefed up a 
provision in its clean air legislation with a similar requirement 
calling for the use of reformulated gasoline in the same nine 
cities by 1995 a proposal to require the cleaner fuel in a broader 
area covering as many as 40 cities was rejected 
the vote on the byrd amendment to help coal miners came after 
days of intense lobbying from both sides including last minute 
telephone calls from the white house to key senators some calls 
coming even as the vote was under way byrd whose power as 
chairman of the appropriations committee is widely respected had 
visited dozens of senators in search of support 
he got the votes of 38 of the senates 55 democrats and 11 of 
its 45 republicans 
byrd said later that under intense white house pressure three 
of my votes took wings among those voting with byrd was sen 
spark matsunaga dhawaii who suffers from cancer and was brought 
into the chamber in a wheelchair 
sen joseph biden ddel said he voted against the proposal in 
the last minutes after a telephone call from white house chief of 
staff john sununu who told him president bush would veto the clean 
air bill if the assistance proposal were included 
senate leaders also had feared that if the measure were approved 
other senators would seek similar financial aid for workers in 
other industries sen phil gramm rtexas promised to do just 
that 
this amendment discriminates against all workers who are not 
coal miners declared mitchell minutes before the vote 
mitchell and other senators said thousands of workers in other 
fields including the steel and petrochemical industries also 
could suffer job losses and would not have such benefits 
byrd who has been a staunch advocate for miners for years 
argued that the issue was a matter of fairness and justice 
because of the severe impact that new acid rain controls would have 
on midwest utilities and in turn on miners in highsulfur coal 
fields 
the main clean air bill which is scheduled for a vote in the 
senate next week calls for sweeping pollution controls on 
industry automobiles and utility plants 
new controls on sulfur dioxide emissions from midwest electric 
power plants an effort to combat acid rain are expected to 
cause utilities to shift away from highsulfur coal to cleaner 
fuels causing mines in appalachia and the midwest to close and 
miners to lose their jobs 
calling on senators to hear the cries of people and respond 
to them byrd said help for the miners is no different that the 
federal assistance given to victims of a hurricane or earthquake 
who suffer because of no fault of their own 
were not asking for welfare he declared 
for nearly two weeks byrd a former senate majority leader who 
still wields considerable power as chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee has cajoled pressured and pleaded with 
senators to line up in support of his proposal 
at the same time mitchell his successor as democratic leader 
has sought to persuade byrd to go along with a cheaper compromise 
proposal that might be acceptable to the white house byrd on 
wednesday said the compromise doesnt do what needs to be done 
under the byrd proposal miners of highsulfur coal who lose 
their jobs because utilities switch to other fuels would receive 
up to 70 percent of their salaries for three years and also 
additional funds if they undergo a special retraining program 
the benefits would be available as long as the miner is 
unemployed 
byrd originally sought a sixyear assistance program costing 
13 billion but he scaled down the proposal twice to garner 
additional senate support 
the government estimates that about 5000 miners of highsulfur 
coal many of them in byrds west virginia are likely to lose 
their jobs as midwest utilities switch to other fuels because of 
the new curbs on sulfur dioxide emissions

an education bill that would radically 
overhaul a school system declared unconstitutional by the state 
supreme court won final passage thursday in the state house 
house bill 940 which also raises taxes by 126 billion and 
which many called the most important bill of the century in 
kentucky was passed by the senate on wednesday with several 
amendments 
with a single vote thursday the house accepted the changes it 
then voted 5842 to pass the bill and send it to gov wallace 
wilkinson senate majority floor leader joe wright said wilkinson 
has assured him he would not veto the bill 
were going to do innovative things in kentucky for once 
said rep greg stumbo the majority floor leader were not going 
to be a follower anymore were going to be a leader 
the bill repeals and replaces all kentucky laws on elementary 
and secondary education the kentucky supreme court last year 
declared the entire school system unconstitutional because its 
quality varied so greatly between rich school districts and poor 
the court found that kentucky students were performing in the 
lowest quarter nationally as measured by standardized tests 
the legislation will mean more money for schools in general and 
dramatically greater funding for poor districts it also calls for 
a largescale investment in technology emphasis on early childhood 
education and extra help for potential dropouts 
under the current system spending for the states 570000 
students varies from 1800 to 4200 a year per student depending 
on the district under the new plan the minimum spending level 
would be 2900 in the 199091 school year overall state financing 
for elementary and secondary education would increase from 15 
billion this year to 19 billion next year 
under the plan local districts will gain more control over 
daytoday operations of schools which are to be judged by how 
successfully their students learn cash rewards will await 
employees of schools that improve each year 
in addition control of the system would be shifted from an 
elected state superintendent to an appointed education commissioner 
about half of the money from the tax increase would be spent on 
schools the senates most important amendment would eliminate 
immediately the state deduction that residents receive for federal 
tax payments raising 141 million in the next two years the house 
version of the bill would have phased out the deduction 
the governor hailed the senates passage of the bill wednesday 
as history in the making

after 20 years of playing his violin in the 
subways james graseck had nowhere to go but up the underground 
artist surfaced thursday night in lincoln center trading the a 
train for alice tully hall 
the special show for grasecks straphanging fans was a new 
experience for the violinist who usually plays beethoven over 
screeching brakes or performs paganini on a packed platform 
it is a dream come true in a way graseck said hours before 
his performance but at the same time the main thing is ive 
worked very hard to develop a rapport with my fellow new yorkers 
those new yorkers 1096 of em at 16 a pop bought out the 
hall at lincoln center for grasecks show the violinist planned a 
75minute program of classical music but played at least a dozen 
encores most were excerpts running no longer than three to five 
minutes about the time one has to wait for a train 
i learned these playing youknowwhere he told his fans 
with a grin 
after the show he hung out with the audience in the lobby 
elaine from the world trade center stop good to see you 
he said hugging one straphanger fan and waving to another bob 
ill see you at the long island railroad ok 
lillian binder said she knew him from the broadwaylafayette 
stop on the d line i cant tell you how many times ive missed 
my train listening to him she said one time i was late to 
work and told my boss im sorry i was listening to this guy in 
the subway play scheherazade my boss said i know that guy 
hes great 
everyone in the hall with the exception of my family is 
someone ive met playing on the street im taking them from 
outside in the subways to inside at the concert hall said 
graseck 
his subway supporters actually helped finance his show graseck 
said the 5000 he has paid to rent alice tully hall for the night 
came partially from the change tossed his way by commuters 
graseck studied at juilliard one of his teachers christine 
dethier planned to attend thursdays performance he also taught 
for a few years in columbus ga 
his initial mass transit performance came in 1968 on a long 
island rail road car graseck said he made 10 in five minutes 
and a star was born 
these days a subway performer can make about 100 a day said 
graseck who also does freelance orchestra work and make no 
mistake graseck loves the music but he started in this line of 
work for the money 
at first i did it just for the money he confessed but 
the applause the smiles made me feel as though i was reaching the 
hearts of people its very spontaneous very communicative 
graseck has played on and on since then his favorite platform 
to play on is at 53rd street and lexington avenue although he pops 
up at stations throughout the system he has memories some of 
them pretty strange about each spot 
he remembers playing the nutcracker suite for a nude 
dancing man in the 77th street subway station he met his wife 
suzanne while playing beneath 666 fifth ave he once handled a 
request for the billy tell overture in times square 
and through it all he says hes kept smiling 
the enjoyment the benefit is when youve finally gotten 
through you know youve touched some people said graseck 
its a nice feeling

west german chancellor helmut kohl on 
thursday called on poland to acknowledge that it inflicted an 
injustice on innocent germans who came under polish rule after 
world war ii 
kohl quickly added that there was no obligation to apologize to 
his country saying we germans are not entitled to such words 
and even less must we try to balance accounts in one way or 
another 
but he indicated such a gesture would be appreciated in his 
speech at a dinner with prime minister margaret thatcher 
the occasion in this english university town marked the 40th 
anniversary of the koenigswinter conference set up to foster 
anglogerman relations five years after the allied defeat of nazi 
germany 
kohl recalled that one of vaclav havels first acts as president 
of czechoslovakia was to express his countrys remorse at the 
expulsion and persecution of its german population after the war 
he suggested poland could follow havels example 
mrs thatcher declared in her own speech that german unification 
should not weaken security and said us and british troops and 
nato nuclear missiles must remain in a united germany 
she also unveiled a plan to turn a 35nation eastwest summit 
this year into a newly enlarged alliance of democracies across 
europe 
in the aftermath of world war ii about 13 million germans were 
expelled from prewar german territories that now are part of poland 
and czechoslovakia 
germany also became divided into communist east and capitalist 
west germany but with the reforms that swept eastern europe last 
fall also came the present drive toward german unification 
kohl said thursday that he had time and again recalled the 
untold suffering inflicted on the polish people by germans during 
the nazi occupation of poland 
but departing from his prepared text kohl toned down his 
remarks to refrain from directly accusing poland of mistreating 
germans 
the prepared text said 
it would no doubt be beneficial for the relationship between 
our two people if poland were to refer with equally clear and noble 
words as president vaclav havel did for czechoslovakia to the 
injustice committed by poles against innocent germans 
when he spoke kohl noted that havel had mentioned the 
injustice that was also inflicted on innocent germans and said 
it would be good if such words were also possible now between 
german and polish people 
he said such a word such a gesture would point the way to a 
future in which the relationship between the polish and german 
peoples is marked by a spirit of goodneighborliness in a common 
europe 
the west german newspaper die welt quoted kohl in its friday 
edition as suggesting in an interview that poland show 
understanding to the millions of germans forced to leave land 
now polish after the war 
his comments were seen in west germany as suggesting a new 
effort to keep the exiles and their offspring on his side with 
federal elections coming up dec 2 
we know that horrible things happened in poland in the name of 
the germans we should never forget that the paper quoted kohl 
as saying 
but it is also completely true that at the end of the war a 
nightmare was created for innocent germans through flight and 
expulsion a word of remembrance of understanding and of 
reconcilation sent to those germans concerned would be a good 
deed 
according to die welt kohl added naturally i know we cannot 
make such a demand 
onethird of poland was german territory before the war and 
kohl indicated in his cambridge speech that he was not making a 
polish apology a condition of honoring his pledge to respect 
polands borders 
kohl said a united germany will enshrine polish borders in an 
internationally binding treaty with poland after german 
unification 
he finally made a forthright pledge last month about polands 
borders after months in which his position on the issue appeared 
equivocal upset poland and worried officials in other european 
countries particularly britain 
kohl said the west german government and the new democratically 
elected east german government should both quickly issue identical 
declarations reaffirming the inviolability of the polish borders 
this declaration should unequivocally express the idea that 
immediately after unification of the two german states the 
allgerman government and parliament will definitively settle the 
border question along these lines in an internationally binding 
treaty with the republic of poland he said 
days before kohls arrival in london the polish issue became a 
source of friction when the hamburg magazine der spiegel said mrs 
thatcher claimed kohl was still saying he did not recognize 
polands western border 
a kohl spokesman denied it saying the prime minister 
misinterpreted kohls comments a thatcher spokesman would say only 
that der spiegel accurately reported the interview with her 
mrs thatcher suggested thursday that the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe should stipulate conditions 
for free elections hold formal meetings of foreign ministers twice 
yearly and call emergency sessions in times of crisis the summit 
is expected to take place this fall 
she also said every nation should guarantee private property and 
private enterprise 
the conference consists of the united states canada and all the 
nations of europe except albania 
the prime minister said her proposals would stress that west 
germanys defense remains with the 16nation nato alliance 
we cannot push aside history it would be absurd to try to do 
so she said we must try to learn the lessons of past peace 
settlements the americans must not go home nor must britain 
retreat from the continent 
her stipulations on nato troops and nuclear missiles remaining 
in a united germany could make waves for the sixnation group 
overseeing the external aspects of german unification 
the group the socalled twoplusfour consists of the two 
germanys and the victorious world war ii allies the united states 
the soviet union britain and france 
their agreement is to go before the csce summit 
kohl also said a united germany must remain in the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
secession from nato must not be the price for german unity 
he said at the dinner

the national assembly still dominated 
by sandinistas late thursday legalized the confiscation of 
thousands of houses during a decade of leftist rule including the 
luxurious residences of party leaders 
property ownership has been one of the touchiest aspects of the 
transition talks between the outgoing sandinistas and the united 
national opposition which won february elections 
the sandinistas have armed thousands of people and urged them to 
defend conquests of the revolution the conservative 
probusiness uno includes many victims of the confiscations among 
its supporters 
thursdays move by the assembly also lets party organizations 
keep the confiscated homes and buildings they occupy 
when the sandinistas were in power they said they wouldnt 
own property that everything belonged to the state and they would 
leave as poor as they came complained opposition deputy carlos 
cuadra of the marxist leninist popular action movement 
the law is expected to benefit about 10000 people who live in 
homes confiscated between the victory of the revolution on july 19 
1979 and the feb 25 election uno leader violeta barrios de 
chamorro is to take over the presidency from daniel ortega on april 
25 
the legislation provides some compensation guaranteed by the 
finance ministry to former owners on a sliding scale with 20 years 
to pay 
however cuadra lambasted the compensation as absurdly low 
for 2000 a top sandinista ends up in a home worth 50000 or 
100000 or more he told reporters he said the law amounts to 
institutionalizing the spoils of war 
the law says it is intended to contribute to social order 
national reconciliation and the tranquillity of nicaraguan 
hearths 
a transition accord between uno and the sandinistas said the new 
government will respect the property rights of people who obtained 
confiscated homes 
the sandinistas have pushed through several measures in the 
final weeks of their term including an amnesty for party members 
as well as the usbacked contra rebels they fought

antinarcotics inspectors now supervise 
cultivation of opium poppies which have grown on the dusty 
anatolian plain for 5000 years that pleases narcotics police but 
farmers say theyre losing money 
in 1971 poppy production was halted by a militarycontrolled 
government under pressure from the united states to cut the supply 
of opium to heroin traffickers 
cultivation resumed in 1974 after civilian rule was restored 
with controls intended to restrict production to pharmaceutical use 
us and turkish narcotics police praise the system which they 
say is smuggleproof a small army of inspectors makes sure the 
crop is used exclusively for medical purposes and does not make its 
way to traffickers 
farmers do not share the official pleasure they say the program 
costs them money 
in the old days we could marry off two sons in one season 
with the earnings from our poppy fields said halil altimtas 
headman of ozburnu village in bolvadin township now the bride 
prices are up but the price for poppies remains too low 
just as the current us battle against cocaine focuses on south 
american coca leaves turkish poppies were the target of an 
antiheroin campaign in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
the united states claimed at least half the heroin reaching its 
territory originated in the poppy fields spread across seven 
provinces of central turkey 
most problems encountered since the new system took effect in 
1974 have to do with production and pricing 
us narcotics officials say no heroin from the turkish poppy 
crop has been discovered on the illicit market 
one important reason is that farmers must use the poppy 
straw harvesting method instead of slitting the tangerinesized 
pods to let opium gum ooze out the method used for heroin they 
let the pods dry in the fields 
morphine derivatives used as painkillers can be extracted from 
dried poppies only in a sophisticated alkaloids plant 
turkey spent 90 million to build the worlds largest and most 
advanced alkaloids factory 150 miles southwest of ankara the 
capital in the heart of the poppygrowing region 
over a decade while the factory was being built the government 
paid another 15 million to farmers whose poppies it was legally 
obligated to buy 
about 76000 tons of unprocessed pods piled up in storage 
because it was difficult to export something of such light weight 
and great bulk that kept the factory going at full capacity for 
four years 
low official prices for the poppy pods discouraged cultivation 
and the plant was in full production by 1986 the turkish alkaloids 
board captured more than half the us market and 40 percent of the 
world market for morphine and codeine and earned about 10 million 
a year 
the good times did not last the plant has been idle since 
december for lack of pods to process 
last years pod crop was only 3000 tons because of autumn 
drought winter frost and the unwillingness of farmers to grow 
poppies for the equivalent of 14 cents for a kilogram 22 pounds 
of dried pods 
india is the only other legal producer of poppies on a large 
scale but australia recently entered the market the united states 
supports the control efforts of india and turkey with a pledge to 
buy 80 percent of its needs from them 
demand for morphine and its derivatives is not flexible and 
averages about 200 tons a year competition is fierce and the price 
has dropped to about 180 a kilogram it was 800 when turkey drew 
the plans for its factory 
the government tripled its price for pods this year to encourage 
growers but attila yildirim manager of the akaloids plant said 
paying too much could put turkey at a competitive disadvantage 
farmers and officials agree the poppy is the most suitable cash 
crop for the sandy soil of the arid anatolian plain 
yildirim and officials of the state soil products office are 
proud of their security arrangements 
about 600 inspectors aided by reconnaissance planes keep track 
of the fields to prevent unlicensed cultivation or slitting of pods 
for opium gum 
morphine is stored behind steel doors at the alkaloids plant 
armored trucks with military and police excorts carry the products 
to cargo planes 
this place is better protected and less accesible to outsiders 
than most military bases yildirim said

the government says having many 
children is a womans patriotic duty but decades of large families 
have overloaded the school system and created a serious 
unemployment threat 
in the 1950s the communist government set out to increase the 
population of mongolias 930000 square miles by offering money and 
special privileges to couples with more than four children 
in other countries the population policy is to keep it at 
the same level or to keep it low but mongolia is different 
navch head of the government demography department said in an 
interview 
we have a small population she said thats why we have 
such a policy 
mongolias population was 649300 when it became independent in 
1921 it experienced a baby boom in the 1960s and 1970s and the 
birthrate peaked in 1963 at 43 per thousand people well over the 
19801985 world averge of 277 births per thousand 
by 1989 government incentives combined with better living 
conditions and health care had raised the population to 209 
million

annually for each child under 16 depending on the childs age and 
the total number of children 
those with more than five children get a medal and the title

children is a mother of the first degree the records say

encouraging large families had unforeseen results nursery 
schools can accommodate only one child in six and kindergartens 
only one in three the communist party newspaper unen reported 
three shifts operate at some schools in ulan bator where 
onefourth of all mongolians live the paper said and only 21 
percent of the nations doctors are pediatricians 
unemployment is a major potential problem about 50 percent of 
mongolians are under age 18 and will create a glut when they enter 
the labor market unless the economy grows more rapidly 
now our policy is not just increasing the population but also 
to raise the quality of the population said gerel head of the 
population bureau we have to look at the labor force and balance 
everything 
a new health law that took effect in january gives women the 
right to decide how many children they will have and when 
it makes abortions free to all and lengthens maternity leave 
from nine months to two years abortions previously were restricted 
to women over 35 with four or more children 
many younger women balk at raising large families and feel they 
can show their patriotism in other ways

not intend to have more 
thats enough she said after 35 its too old

average number of children per woman of childbearing age was 48 
down from seven 20 years ago

this has been a season in which many new shows 
gave bush league a bad name but miracles do occur like cbs 
bagdad cafe premiering tonight and a saturday preview of 
nbcs carol amp co 
cbs show a situation comedy costars whoopi goldberg and jean 
stapleton 
nbcs effort which will get a regular saturday slot is 
anthology comedy a series of different shows performed by carol 
burnett and a talented troupe 
each debut episode is excellent in its own way particularly 
carol amp co which has the different kind of look and feel a 
network needs to battle the diverse wares offered by the 
evergrowing cable tv monster 
bagdad cafe adapted from the 1988 movie of the same name 
is by no means revolutionary 
but it is unique in that its from the same network that this 
year has given you sydney normal life city and his 
amp hers all examples of how not to commit comedy 
bagdad shows how to do it right not with a string of 
feeble oneliners but with believeable characters a fine cast and 
the awareness that the best humor often has the edge of sadness to 
it 
at the shows start stapleton the sweetly dense mrs archie 
bunker of all in the family becoes somewhat of a middleaged 
waif when she can take no more of her husbands verbal abuse and 
walks out on him 
a small problem shes in the middle of californias mojave 
desert when she walks their car has broken down but in time she 
wearily trudges into goldbergs dingy rundown cafe and motel 
located somewhere between desolation and hard times 
in future episodes shell start working there even though 
tonights episode indicates the place should be called cafe woe 
goldbergs philandering husband cleavon little caught while 
attempting adultery walks out on her her teenaged daughter 
monica calhoun takes up with a greasyhaired biker whose idea of 
speech is to grunt 
there are problems too for her grown son scott lawrence a 
decent guy and the father of a baby girl his wife has run off 
leaving him to tend the tyke and help his mother 
all this might be fodder for a situation tragedy instead its 
a forum for gentle humor even with goldbergs explosive style 
and compassion both neatly illustrated when stapleton notices that 
goldberg has been crying 
goldberg nods ive been peeling a husband she explains 
these and other scenes are wellsketched and wellplayed with 
nice little offbeat touches here and there like the son playing 
classical music on an ancient upright piano in the cafe or the 
lecherous old cowboy who introduces himself to stapleton thusly 
my name is rudy im from hollywood 
written by mort lachman and sy rosen this is the kind of show 
thats both interesting and easy to like 
so is the debut saturday of carol burnett as an nbc regular 
after her long successful stay at cbs as the star of an hour 
series famed for its comedy sketches 
in carol amp co which starts with a chap giving her roses 
and saying deadpan welcome back nancy she greets the studio 
audience and explains the premise of the evenings story 
in tonights case she is a perfect loving wife who discovers 
that her overbearing husband paul richard kind is cheating on 
her for the third time 
she decides to have him bumped off after a neighbor a young 
widow explains thats what she did as did another new widow down 
the block 
the idea is to make it look like an accident with that 
established darrel campbells script proceeds toward daft doom 
namely a murder inc operation lurking in the phone book as hit 
parade parties 
the company offers a wide range of fatal services among them 
midnight grenade and a floozy with an uzi i just dont know 
burnett sighs to the salesman who comes calling paul is so hard 
to shop for 
it gets sillier yet each plot twist is turned with precision 
and generally acted straight which makes things funnier than if 
the players were called on to ham it up a bit or even mug 
the players working with burnett are firstrate in addition to 
kind they are terry kiser meagan fay anita barone and jeremy 
piven alas nbcs press release on the show specifies only the 
role kind plays 
on the bright side burnett amp co definitely will be on nbc 
on coming saturday nights true that isnt the best of all nights 
its when the fewest viewers watch network programs generally 
speaking 
but those who do tune in for burnetts return to weekly tv will 
find a wellwritten solidly professional show as the trombonist 
said when he missed his bus i rest my case 
 
elsewhere in television 
hoho historical note 60 minutes may have andy rooney the 
beleagured humorist but humor of a different kind reruns and new 
stuff is afoot sunday from cable tvs ha the tv comedy 
network 
the newcomer will start at 7 pm edt which by sheer 
coincidence is when cbs durable news show begins the first 
ha offering is a saturday night live repeat featuring 
eddie murphy the nights only firstrun show is the big room 
featuring mort sahl 
ha will bring to two the number of 24hour chuckles 
channels in cable the other being the comedy channel begun last 
fall whether theres room enough for two has yet to be decided by 
viewers and cable system operators

sweeping changes in the world political 
order and localized conflicts such as panama and the persian gulf 
are prompting swift wholesale revision of the lessons being taught 
at americas advanced military colleges 
at the naval war college the nations oldest such institution 
officials say 98 of the 145 readings assigned to students last fall 
no longer are on the list for the third trimester that began this 
month 
thats just one measure of the changes that are taking 
place said william e turcotte a former naval officer who heads 
the schools national security decision making department and is a 
key planner of its curriculum 
as the morning fog rolls in from narragansett bay the 360 
students at the nwc are focusing their attention on 
contingencies military scenarios involving us forces in a 
role far more constricted and less predictable than the 
natowarsaw pact showdown that has been the basis of military 
doctrine for 40 years 
increasingly say officials of the college their curriculum and 
war gaming will stress urban warfare terrorism and low 
intensity crises in which the united states interests are 
ambiguous and its capacity to act is affected by special political 
or geographical factors 
students also will be asked to consider monetary costs a factor 
the officials say has not figured significantly in classroom 
discussions before 
the cost of military operations is one of many questions that 
must be examined in a new light turcotte said 
this year will be especially traumatic for the students but 
its also a great time for the students a very dynamic period in 
which they will be as close to the problems as the major policy 
advisers the congress and the press he said 
turcotte also said that for the schools faculty experts the 
supposed end of the cold war is doing much more than simply 
altering their lesson plans 
never have we spent so much time trying to learn for ourselves 
whats happening he said but it is the most exciting time 
that ive ever been in the classroom here 
the naval war college founded in 1884 in this picturesque 
seaport famed as a summer resort of the superrich is one of a 
halfdozen colleges run by the defense department to provide 
advanced schooling in military and political subjects for career 
officers government officials and other selected individuals 
including military officers from other countries 
while each school is mainly concerned with the mission of one 
branch of the armed forces the pentagons policy of jointness 
in military affairs means faculty and students are drawn from all 
services 
thus a typical nwc seminar of 15 to 20 students might be led by 
a civilian or an army officer and include officers from the navy 
army air force marines and coast guard 
turcotte who has taught at the nwc since 1974 said curriculum 
changes reflecting political upheavals in the soviet bloc actually 
began last summer and the first trimester ended just as the berlin 
wall was starting to crumble in november 
in place of the cold war doctrines spawned by four decades of 
tension between the two superpowers the revised program will 
concentrate on the types of crises that might now arise and how 
us strategy and forces should be designed to deal with them 
in any contingency we are most likely to have the preponderant 
force but the objectives are confusing said turcotte we will 
win but the nature of how we win and what we leave behind is 
complex there are a lot of dark alleys in contingencies 
among new issues to be examined he said are such questions as 
whether smaller countries freed from superpower influence become 
less stable and more aggressive toward their neighbors and whether 
the united states can or should continue to press japan and germany 
to spend more on selfdefense as washington cuts its military costs 
and the two germanys draw closer together 
the persian gulf where the navy conducted a major operation in 
198788 to safeguard commercial shipping endangered by the 
iraqiran war offers an important case study a regional conflict 
in which the united states is not directly involved but has 
crucial interests to protect 
another model for the classroom was provided by the bush 
administrations invasion of panama which nwc officials said 
raised not only political issues but moral and practical questions 
about the conduct of urban warfare in which civilian lives are at 
risk 
they also cite the proliferation of missiles and other modern 
technology possibly even nuclear weapons among smaller nations 
the question of whether us military forces should be used in drug 
interdiction and the lack of an effective policy on terrorism and 
hostagetaking 
turcotte said the changes in europe have led nato to extend its 
presumed warning time for a soviet attack from several days to six 
months but might also increase the relative importance of 
strategic nuclear forces which remain in place and moscows 
internal security forces

from king kongs banana breath to et from 
jaws to the 1906 san francisco earthquake 
universal studios is arriving in orlando like gangbusters to 
compete with the oldest established entertainment show in town 
the 600 million universal studios florida based on some of 
hollywoods great movies goes public in may exactly a year after 
the disneymgm studios theme park opened for business a few miles 
down the road 
come to universal and ride the movies says steven 
spielberg the bearded movie genius acting as creative consultant 
for the 440acre attraction 
company executives speak in terms of waging war against walt 
disney world for the hearts minds and pocketbooks of the millions 
of tourists who will be dividing their attention between the 
competing studio theme parks 
i think theyre very vulnerable says jay stein an mca vice 
president about the disneymgm studios 
it is a little like war it means that when you invade you 
make damn sure that your army is big enough and strong enough to 
win 
the florida attraction is a bigger modernized version of 
universals studio tour in california and is owned jointly by mca 
inc and the rank organization of london stein is president of the 
division that created and built the park mca recreation services 
company officials say the key differences between their park and 
disneys is universals more sophisticated technology and its 
fullfledged involvement of the customer in each of the 15 
attractions they speak of superrealistic technology providing 
wraparound experiences for young and old 
in a blunt attack on the competition stein said in a recent 
interview that what the disneymgm studios are offering their 
guests is approximately onethird of what were offering 
across the board were going to deliver a more impressive 
entertainment experience 
stein acknowledged however that the disney organization was 
a strong wellfinanced company with a marketing potential that 
is intimidating at worst 
because of that he said universal needs to create and 
deliver an entertainment experience that is so different and 
superior that we can assure ourselves that were going to capture 
enough segments of the market to make this thing profitable 
stein and mca president sid sheinberg have for years disputed 
disney chairman michael eisners claims that the disneymgm studios 
theme park is the realization of walt disneys ideas from 50 years 
ago 
stein and sheinberg contend that disney copied the concept from 
universals studio tour which has been in operation in the 
hollywood area since 1964 and that eisner rushed into construction 
to beat universal into florida 
eisner and other disney officials usually softpedal the 
criticism and the rivalry insisting that the competition is good 
for each other as well as florida 
besides the theme park attractions universal studios florida 
has the largest movie and television production area outside 
hollywood it has three times the amount of soundstage space that 
disney has 
production has been under way since 1988 
scheduled to go before the cameras this year studio executives 
say are 13 feature films and 500 television episodes 
the back lot tour includes 50 locations including famed 
hollywood boulevard a new england village the san francisco wharf 
and new yorks penn station there are 40 restaurants and snack 
shops including schwabs drug store the studio commissary and 
mels diner from american graffiti 
also a part of the complex will be the first hard rock cafe in 
florida 
with universals long tradition of blending public participation 
and filmmaking the florida park encourages superlatives 
kongfrontation pits a skyway tram containing 50 people 
against the 37foot tall computeranimated gorilla in what is 
billed as the largest sound stage in the world king kong will be 
so real that visitors will be able to smell his banana breath the 
sixstory king kong building has 50 facades modeled after midtown 
manhattan 
in jaws a 24footlong computerized shark weighing three 
tons crunches its jaws onto a 40passenger boat on 7acre amity 
bay rocking the craft in both directions before the shark is 
killed 
a subway train carrying 200 guests into a san francisco 
station is buffetted by an earthquake a recreation of the 
1906 san francisco temblor that measured 83 on the richter scale 
trains crash into each other the overhead roadway comes tumbling 
down and 60000 gallons of water flood the scene 
ghostbusters is a recreation of the largest set ever 
built on a hollywood sound stage eightstories high the action is 
a special effects thriller with 13 largerthanlife mechanical 
ghosts getting zapped by neutrana wand beams until their 
ectoplasmic energy explodes 
spielbergs pet project et the extraterrestrial is a 
soaring obstaclefilled adventure on a dirt bike it starts with a 
chase through a forest and takes the visitor all the way to ets 
home the green planet 
the moviethemed rides and participatory attractions include a 
highspeed chase inside the world of hannabarbera cartoons a 
phantom of the opera horror makeup show and visitor input into 
alfred hitchcocks stylized thrillers 
and so it goes one funtastic happening after another in the 
park that officials say will take visitors two days to cover fully 
universal plans a soft opening in early may the official 
grand opening is june 7 with spielberg and a collection of 
hollywood stars presiding 
spielberg who dreamed up et jaws and other film 
fantasies calls his job as creative consultant a storytellers 
dream come true 
weve made the movie experience something that fans can see 
feel touch and smell he says 
the parks most ambitious undertaking back to the future 
will not be ready for the parks opening 
it will have two adjacent theaters each measuring 80 feet in 
diameter and use projected images along with complex motion 
simulators topped with delorean automobiles visitors will ride 12 
of the cars in each dome as they go crashing through the centuries 
with the mad scientist doc brown 
because of the complex technology it is taking longer to build 
than originally contemplated said its inventor peter alexander 
vice president of shows and rides for mcas recreational services 
group 
its probably the most responsive and complex motion simulator 
ever built said alexander 
nickelodeon the tv network for kids celebrated its 10th 
birthday in march by beginning construction of a new home at the 
orlando park 
the nickelodeon production complex will consist of two sound 
stages and an interactive entertainment area for children it will 
produce shows here throughout the year and visitors to the park 
will be able to audition for shows as well as to view production 
video audio and control room operations 
universal expects to draw at least 5 million people in its first 
year and stein and other officials say those who see will become 
instant converts passing the word on to others 
were going to be the new kid on the block and people are 
going to give us a try he said and were going to deliver

democrats used to dine out on the old will 
rogers wisecrack i belong to no organized party i am a 
democrat 
the joke doesnt fit these days democrats are organizing all 
over the place choosing up sides and lining up in factions and 
caucuses but they cant get together on policy or on spokesmen to 
carry it to the voters their congressional majorities seem 
immobilized more often by intramural disputes than republican 
opposition 
theirs always has been a fractious coalition thats what rogers 
was joking about but they usually found ways to glue it together 
at campaign time sometimes they kept warring then they lost 
whats happening now is not so dramatic or clearly defined as 
the old battles over civil rights or the escalation of americas 
involvement in the war in vietnam in confrontations like those 
democrats acknowledged their unyielding differences on one point 
bargained over them then quietly collaborated on other matters 
their differences now are more mundane and the handling is more 
businesslike that wont necessarily make them easier to bridge 
the situation is a mirror image of the one republicans faced 25 
years ago out of power lacking a pulpit and a spokesman they 
dealt with it by creating the awkwardlynamed soontobeforgotten 
republican coordinating committee a panel of party leaders 
convened periodically to issue policy pronouncements 
the betterknown voices of the gop came from congress in 
regular joint appearances by sen everett m dirksen of illinois 
the minority leader and his house counterparts that became the ev 
and jerry show when rep gerald r ford of michigan was the house 
leader it featured a senate showman and a house straight man 
congress is short on showmen these days the democrats leaders 
sen george j mitchell of maine and house speaker thomas s foley 
of washington tend to business work together but usually speak 
separately they tried a joint appearance before the television 
cameras late last year but it didnt click 
ev and jerry had one clear advantage over george and tom the 
speaker and the majority leader have to make congress run minority 
leaders dont 
but in a divided government congress is the democratic branch 
and could become the platform for opposition initiatives and 
rebuttals to president bush so far thats been done as a series 
of solos with no clear message or voice 
that tendency was underlined last weekend by conflicting 
schedules that put the democratic national committee in 
indianapolis at the same time the democratic leadership council was 
holding a conference in new orleans 
the national committee is dominated by state party leaders the 
leadership council is an organization set up five years ago by 
moderate and conservative democrats seeking to pull the party 
toward the center 
after three months of congressional hedging the national 
committee endorsed sen daniel patrick moynihans bill to cut 
social security taxes so as to bar government use of surpluses 
they produce to offset deficit spending on current programs 
the democratic national committee can do exactly what it 
wants said rep richard a gephardt of missouri the house 
majority leader they are not in the congress and they dont have 
the responsibility to actually produce a budget 
so much for consensus on what would seem a popular salable 
democratic proposition cutting a payroll tax the moynihan measure 
used to make the white house nervous because the democrats could 
have used it to force bush into vetoing an electionyear tax cut 
that prospect has faded 
organized into their rival caucuses and umbrella groups 
sometimes with competing agendas the democrats show no sign of 
progress toward finding their voice 
gephardt insists that they are the ones coming up with ideas for 
national leadership even if the message is not coming through that 
way 
in the familiar lament of the party out of white house power he 
said that is because the president is the dominant player the only 
leader who can push a program to national acceptance and block 
congressional moves with vetoes that onethird minorities in either 
house can sustain 
he has a pen in his pocket thats worth twothirds of us 
gephardt said

the cops raced up the subway station stairs 
looking for two men whod robbed a passenger at knife point they 
wheeled into the park and almost bumped into a girl holding out a 
plastic bag of crack 
her jaw dropped said officer william smith and my jaw 
dropped 
she was just a child all baby face and wide eyes then she 
opened her mouth 
she called us every name you can think of smith said 
jeanette at 12 was carrying a beeper and 20 vials of crack 
twelve days before christmas in the middle of herald square she 
became one of three dozen boys and girls her age arrested last year 
on felony narcotics charges 
jeanette also was not the first in her family arrested in 
connection with crack a year earlier her mother known on the 
street as miss candy was arrested at the same spot police said 
they found 430 vials of crack inside her brassiere 
now they say she has someone else to hold her wares her kids 
jeanette the associated press agreed to a judges request not 
to divulge her last name in return for access to family court 
hearings turned heads in the prosecutors office but more and 
more children are entering the lower levels of the cocaine business 
as touts lookouts runners holders and dealers 
in the first 10 months of 1989 new york city police arrested 
1330 children 15 and younger on felony narcotics charges a 20 
percent increase over 1988 and a 530 percent increase over 1983 
when the crack epidemic was just emerging 
nationally according to the fbi arrests of children 16 and 
younger for dealing in cocaine or heroin have risen 900 percent in 
five years 
to a drug dealer a child can seem the perfect employee 
inconspicuous loyal and perhaps their chief attraction almost 
immune 
children are overlooked by officers who cant believe the kid in 
braids on the corner is a drug courier if arrested children go 
free faster than adults if convicted they are less seriously 
punished in one crucial sense children are more reliable they 
are less apt than older teens to use crack 
the kids are rewarded with danger long hours and irregular 
wages terry williams a sociologist who has studied the crack 
trade in new york says big payoffs are a myth children are

at a hearing in family court jeanette admitted she had a bag 
with crack that night but said it was given her by a neighborhood 
boy named sean he didnt say what was in the bag he just 
asked me to take it to brooklyn for him 
the judge who convicted jeanette described her story as 
incredible smith says he saw jeanette near the park about 10 
days after her arrest at 130 in the morning she just smiled 
at me and said hello i didnt know what to say 
the mother blames the martinique period for jeanettes runins 
with the law and notwithstanding the girls arrest maintains her 
daughter has been better behaved since the family moved she says 
jeanette regularly attends junior high school where she does well 
in reading but needs work in math other than that she stays home 
and helps care for the younger children 
jeanette loves the house the mother said she doesnt 
like to jump to go out she loves singing shes always wanted 
to write rap music 
the mother was standing on the street next to her boyfriends 
car as she spoke jeanette looked on silently occasionally 
nodding in agreement finally bored she slapped a cassette into 
the car tape deck closed her eyes and moved to the rhythms of rap 
when police are told the mothers story they laugh 
shes running the park controlling crack sales there said 
mchale he said he hadnt seen her at night in several months but 
was told she now has youngsters including some of her own doing 
most of the street dealing 
the family continues to visit herald square even though they 
now live almost an hours subway ride away even though they 
complain of police harassment 
the mother said they return because they know the shops and the 
people smith says its because they know the neighborhood and

for this time of year it was a 
deceptively warm day tall pines and hemlocks reached for a 
cloudless sky big thickcoated dogs sprawled along dusty roads 
locals walked to lunch in shirtsleeves 
but breaking through the still mountain air was the rhythmic 
thwack of hammers the whine of drills the beep of heavy equipment 
backing up and the roar of bulldozers 
in north creek these days modern townhouse communities seem 
to sprout from the mountainsides more thickly than wildflowers and 
a developer is reshaping two blocks that make up nearly half of the 
business district in this tiny adirondack village 
this kind of development has environmentalists worried about the 
future of the adirondack park a 6 millionacre tract of forest and 
mountains bigger than any other state or national park in the lower 
48 states 
but it also represents the kind of economic revitalization that 
some north creek natives like restaurant owner francis smith have 
been waiting for smiths restaurant a pinepaneled coffee shop 
and tavern has been in his family since the early 1920s 
im a businessman so to me the development is a good thing 
said smith sitting in a worn red vinylpadded booth on the 
other hand there seems to be just too much construction going on 
maybe its going overboard 
how much is too much is on the minds of many in the adirondack 
park a vast patchwork of private and public land much of the 
latter guaranteed by the state constitution to remain forever 
wild 
the state regulates all new development in the park through a 
21yearold landuse plan its provisions have made for plenty of 
strife among those wanting to protect the parks undeniable beauty 
those trying to make a living and a home within its boundaries and 
those looking to make money exploiting its riches 
with the 20th anniversary of earth day just three weeks away 
the battle over land use in the 98yearold park has flared in 
anticipation of a report to be presented to gov mario cuomo on 
sunday from the commission on the adirondacks in the 21st century 
cuomo cited increasing property values development and land 
speculation last year when he appointed the commission to help map 
the parks future 
in 1969 a similar commission appointed by thengov nelson 
rockefeller devised what was at the time considered a bold plan to 
control development seen as a threat to the adirondack wilderness 
of the parks 35 million acres of private land 53 percent was 
restricted to having just one house for each 43 acres home sites 
of 7 acres were mandated for an additional 35 percent the 
remaining 12 percent of private land fell into six various use 
categories 
the plan slowed development immediately but bred contempt among 
many local residents officials and developers the next several 
years were a time of angry words broken windows slashed tires and 
punches mounds of animal waste were delivered to the adirondack 
park agency the state body set up in 1973 to regulate development 
bad feelings are welling again as many adirondack people 
anticipate the cuomo commission will recommend even stricter land 
use controls 
when these people were picked for the commission we knew 
their position said francis casier a 71yearold saranac lake 
builder 
the state has designated 15 million acres as wetlands for 
grasses and bugs but only a few thousand acres for human beings 
he said the highest and best use for our land should be for 
homes and amenities for people and their families 
development would bring jobs and money to a region where the 
quality of life is great as long as you dont need to spend any 
money said barbara delczeg who works for the gore mountain 
region chamber of commerce 
the per capita income of the 130000 park residents is just 72 
percent of the state average its about 94 percent of the average 
for the states rural counties 
we need this growth so much said delczeg we need the 
jobs we need the money we need it to survive 
north creek isnt the only place ringing with the sounds of 
development and dissent 
in lake placid a developer wants to rebuild the lake placid 
club a rambling turnofthecentury hotel that is on the national 
register of historic places but has fallen into disrepair but the 
development would include hundreds of luxurious second homes and a 
golf course 
were seeing increased development pressure everywhere said 
eric siy of the adirondack council a regional environmental group 
if we dont act now we may not have a park by the year 2000 
the adirondack council advocates a twoyear building moratorium 
in much of the park as well as major additions to the parks 
wilderness and wild forest areas they say developers fearful 
about the cuomo commission recommendations are rushing to build 
while they still can 
development and subdivision applications submitted to the 
adirondack park agency will rise by 75 percent from 631 in 1989 to 
about 1100 this year agency executive director robert glennon 
predicts 
the commission itself in an interim newsletter gave a strong 
indication that tighter controls might be in the cards 
controls once seen as daring and stringent are now considered 
weak and ineffective the newsletter said environmental 
policies and laws once heralded as being on the cutting edge of 
environmental protection now seem outdated 
george davis executive director of the cuomo commission helped 
create the current adirondack landuse map while working for the 
rockefeller commission davis said the original plan failed to 
foresee that wealthy city dwellers in the 1990s would be able to 
afford little miniwildernesses 50acre building lots for 
second homes that fit the landuse restrictions 
like davis casier has noted the impact of rich secondhome 
owners people come in from the city and they want their little 
piece of the adirondacks said the developer the minute they 
get their little piece they dont want anyone else to have a 
little piece 
but he regards george davis as an enemy of adirondack 
people the lotsize limitations have made it almost impossible 
to build affordable housing in the region casier said 
to keep things affordable and save jobs some environmentalists 
are concentrating less on halting development and more on 
persuading officials to expand the state easement acquisition 
program under this the state buys development and recreation 
rights to a parcel of land but the property owner keeps title and 
can use the land for timber production 
the easements cheaper than buying the land outright also give 
the state more for its money said neil woodworth of the adirondack 
mountain club and he noted even when loggers are finished with 
the land the state will control the development rights 
a lot of the land we need to preserve to protect from 
development is also land critical to the forest products industry 
and provides an awful lot of jobs woodworth said so 
preservationists cant just buy it all up

it once was known as the fortune 500 
drugmaker that soothed millions of throats with robitussin cough 
syrup coated dried lips with chap stick balm and gave generously 
to charities and higher education 
today ah robins still makes those products and other 
remedies but its owned by another company after a long bout with 
bankruptcy court 
to many women its name now is more synonymous with cruel 
stinginess all tied to one of the most notorious products ever 
sold the dalkon shield birth control device 
the family that formerly ran the company still has considerable 
wealth but keeps a low profile partly because of the furor over 
the dalkon shield the device which maimed thousands of women in 
one of the nations worst product liability cases is no longer 
sold 
as the leading family member said when he surrendered the 
company late last year some of the unhappiest people ive known 
are people who have a lot of money 
the surrender was one of the most traumatic moments in the life 
of e claiborne robins a millionaire whose grandfather albert 
hartley robins founded the company as a threeemployee apothecary 
shop 
e claiborne robins took over the business in 1933 parlaying it 
through hard work into one of the largest us pharmaceutical 
companies 
as the business prospered robins and his relatives became known 
for their philanthropy with gifts to the university of richmond 
its graduates include robins 79 and his son e claiborne robins 
jr 46 
the senior robins and other members have donated millions of 
dollars to the university including 50 million in 1969 that at 
the time was the largest personal gift ever made to a private us 
college 
women seeking payment for dalkon shield injuries have a 
different view of the robins largesse many argue that despite 
immense public and legal pressure the company erected obstacle 
after obstacle to prevent them from receiving compensation 
earlier this month 85000 dalkon shield claimants the last of 
the 200000 eligible for redress were mailed packets explaining 
options for receiving payment for injuries some had used the 
device more than 15 years ago 
they made it very difficult for the women they injured to get 
compensation said linda hightower director of the dalkon shield 
victims association in atlanta and herself a former dalkon shield 
user 
in the users eyes robins never has provided a simple direct 
public apology not to mention a sympathetic attitude toward 
compensation e claiborne robins has said he doesnt consider 
money important and that any amount above whats needed to live 
comfortably means nothing really 
yet money or the lack of it has shaped his life 
two years after robins was born in 1910 his father died 
leaving to his mother the responsibility of holding together the 
family business founded in 1878 
robins worked his way through the university of richmond by 
stacking books at the city library for 25 cents an hour he 
graduated at the height of the depression in 1931 and enrolled in 
pharmacy school at the medical college of virginia where he 
graduated with honors in 1933 
it was a case of financial necessity he once said of 
attending summer school to finish pharmacy college early 
later robins borrowed 2000 to take over the family business 
and went on the road selling pharmaceuticals his work and 
salesmanship turned the company into a multimilliondollar 
enterprise by the time the dalkon shield was added to robins 
product line in 1971 
before long however the corporation began hearing complaints 
from doctors and women who used the iud some users suffered 
miscarriages some became sterile a few died 
as concerns multiplied about the dalkon shields safety the 
company yanked it off the market that same year 1974 robins 
began to have health problems suffering two heart attacks he 
stepped down the next year as president of the company but stayed 
on as board chairman 
both robins and his son who became the companys president in 
1977 have refused numerous requests for interviews in recent years 
as they watched a wave of lawsuits seeking damages from dalkon 
shield injuries tear at the foundation of their business 
in 1985 the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization last dec 15 the case ended a 25 billion trust 
fund was established to compensate dalkon shield claimants and ah 
robins was taken over by the american home products corp of new 
york 
neither robins has a role in the business anymore still they 
emerged from the 4 years of bankruptcy proceedings with their 
personal fortunes intact forbes magazine has reckoned the family 
holdings are worth 325 million 
lawyers for dalkon shield users long have charged that the iud 
was rushed to market without adequate testing and that attempts 
were made to mask its flaws 
a federal judge once accused ec jr and two other company 
executives of creating monstrous mischief with an instrument 
of death mutilation and disease 
you have taken the bottom line as your guiding beacon and the 
low road as your route us district judge miles lord of 
minneapolis said this is corporate irresponsibility at its 
meanest 
the robinses and their aides never were charged with criminal 
negligence in the dalkon shield case and the younger robins said 
later that lord had committed gross abuse of judicial discretion 
and power 
friends of the family are reluctant to talk about the father and 
son but some say privately that they were more distressed at 
losing the company than at the high price of the dalkon shield 
settlement 
the men said in a joint farewell letter to employees that they 
would remember shared times both difficult and rewarding we have 
been tested and the results achieved in spite of those difficult 
times are witness to what good people can accomplish 
the troubled history of the dalkon shield has affected what the 
elder robins once called the most satisfying accomplishments of his 
career 
one has been the joy of watching the company grow he said 
and theres the fact that youve made some contribution to public 
health

a doctors recommendation that a young 
patient wear a helmet while skateboarding or bicycling brought a 
familiar rebuke 
the mother was appalled by that recommendation said 
stephanie rifkinsonmann a pediatric neurosurgeon at westchester 
county medical center in valhalla she said wearing a helmet was 
socially unacceptable among her sons friends because of the peer 
pressure 
rifkinsonmann already was treating the boy for a head injury 
which would have been prevented if hed worn a helmet in the first 
place she said 
more parents might consider rifkinsonmanns recommendation 
trauma including head injury is among the leading causes of death 
in children under 14 said samuel kasoff neurosurgeon at 
westchester county medical center 
many head injuries such as ones suffered in school bus 
accidents could be avoided if the proper precautions are taken 
rifkinsonmann said 
school buses dont often load children up appropriately she 
said usually theyre twobytwo in some cases they put them 
three together the kid in the middle is the least protected 
making a child wear a helmet for some recreationl activities is 
another way to prevent head injuries goodquality helmets can be 
lightweight and not hamper movement rifkinsonmann said 
rifkinsonmann also would like to see better safety education 
for children in schools she suggests using a symbol children are 
comfortable with such as big bird to educate youngsters on 
accident prevention 
parents need education too she said 
but it often takes a tragedy to make people aware of the high 
incidence of head injury to children she said 
its the gory part that piques peoples interest she said 
cancer is a generalized fear we all have the only way to make 
people know head injury is to be equally feared is to get the image 
of how absolutely crippling it can be especially to a young 
child

from the newly initiated quest to send people to 
mars to the decadesold search for a cure for cancer the 
governments science programs are a source of technological 
breakthroughs and national pride federal spending on science is 
far from the largest or fastestgrowing part of the budget but it 
is a favorite target for budgetcutters this is the first in a 
series of articles this year that will track the progress of one 
portion of the federal budget science spending

when the white houses chief science adviser 
visited the senate budget committee recently he spent much of his 
time responding to a single recurring complaint 
the panels chairman rep james sasser of tennessee said 
costly projects such as the space station 30 billion over several 
years shortchange other researchers and science students in favor 
of a highvisibility highmedia type operation 
the adviser d allan bromley countered that the expensive 
projects will benefit thousands of scientists and make possible 
scientific understanding of the world of our universe 
the dispute was left unresolved but it sums up a growing 
concern in todays era of relentless federal deficits that a 
burgeoning array of bigticket science programs threatens to crowd 
out a much larger number of less expensive but valuable efforts 
as part of his proposed 12 trillion budget for next year 
president bush wants to spend 68 billion on research and 
development or rampd the studies and experimentation that are at 
the core of science 
billions more spread throughout the budget and not totaled 
would be spent for scientific work that has progressed beyond the 
rampd stage such as the space shuttle 
more than 4 billion would be devoted to five science projects 
alone the space station a study of climatic change missions to 
the moon and mars a giant atom smasher called the superconducting 
super collider and a study of human genes 
investment in research and development is a top priority for 
an administration that believes in investing in the future 
bushs budget request said 
but with congressional work on the fiscal 1991 budget just 
beginning sasser and many of his colleagues are questioning 
whether the government can afford longterm costly initiatives that 
threaten to become more expensive each year 
exploring and uncovering the mysteries of the universe stirs 
us all sasser said but i am afraid we are looking at the 
stars right now from a rather deep fiscal hole 
federal spending on science is not large relative to the rest of 
the budget for example the military will take close to 300 
billion this year 
nor are federal science expenditures growing at an alarming 
rate compared to other accounts adjusted for inflation they are 
barely larger than in the late 1960s medicaid spending meanwhile 
is expected to grow by 15 percent to 40 billion this year alone 
but the grammrudman deficitreduction law is forcing congress 
and the white house to find new sources of savings every year 
making science vulnerable 
large parts of the budget such as social security are too 
politically sensitive to be cut dramatically nor can the 176 
billion in this years interest payments on the national debt be 
cut without causing the government to default 
despite pressure to reduce deficits many people argue that the 
united states cant afford to eliminate largescale science 
programs 
supporters make the same arguments that were heard in 1957 after 
the soviets launched their sputnik satellite the united states 
must remain at the forefront of technology and not just for 
economic reasons 
this country had a goal and a dream when we went to the moon 
what this country is looking for now is goals and dreams said 
robert roe dnj chairman of the house science space and 
technology committee 
one thing this country still has is an advantage in its 
science and technology base says frank press president of the 
national academy of sciences from that point of view the total 
investment in science is justifiable 
but others worry about the tradeoffs 
science is an unmet need but its competing against housing 
education the human side of the ledger says house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
still others complain that too many science spending decisions 
are made by politicians interested primarily in jobs and other 
economic rewards for their home districts 
its like everything else people are getting reelected by 
delivering the bacon says former sen william proxmire dwis 
who until 1989 chaired the senate appropriations subcommittee that 
oversees nasa spending 
congressional support for science is widespread and rarely 
breaks down along party lines but to generalize it has stronger 
backing from conservatives than from liberals who from time to 
time try to shift some science spending into social programs 
as with many areas of the budget support for specific projects 
tends to be strongest from those whose congressional committees 
oversee the programs or whose districts will benefit from them 
hence sen phil gramm rtexas one of congress most fervent 
advocates of spending cuts strongly supports the costly super 
collider because it is to be built in his state 
many who question federal support for expensive science programs 
say they soak up money that would be better spent for small 
projects that involve basic science that work often conducted by 
individual researchers involves a search for basic knowledge 
regardless of its potential application 
for example they note that this year for the first time in a 
decade the number of research awards by the national institutes of 
health will fall below 5000 
money also is scarce because of the way the government spends 
its research and development money of the 1990 64 billion total 
only 24 billion will be for civilian projects nearly twothirds 
40 billion will go to military work largely weapons testing 
with little or no application to the rest of the economy 
adding pressure are the peculiarities of the federal budget 
process which pits programs against each other 
the budget committees will make recommendations for spending 
levels that are politically influential but not legally binding 
the appropriations committees make the final decisions 
their subcommittees have jurisdiction over seemingly random 
groupings of programs it is at that level that dollars are 
distributed among competing demands 
rep robert traxler dmich chairs the appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees nasa the national science foundation 
housing veterans and environmental programs 
what am i supposed to do for science he asked take money 
from the homeless

jockeying for federal science dollars is 
intensifying as demands increase but the money available remains 
roughly constant 
when inflation is considered the government spends barely more 
for research and development today than it did at the height of the 
apollo moon program in the late 1960s 
adding to the competition is the sheer number of participants 
involved in distribution and pursuit of science funding dozens of 
congressional committees and federal agencies thousands of private 
companies and institutions and an estimated 53 million american 
scientists and engineers 
when world war ii ended the government was spending less than 
1 billion annually on research and development most of it for 
atomic weapons work spending grew slowly until the soviets orbited 
the sputnik satellite in 1957 provoking concern about the 
competitiveness of american science and sparking the growth of the 
us space program 
as a result government science spending grew well into the 
1960s leveling off during the vietnam war dollar amounts 
increased with the energy crisis of the late 1970s and president 
reagans defense buildup of the 1980s but spending adjusted for 
inflation changed little 
president bush is proposing 68 billion in science spending for 
the next fiscal year up about 4 billion from this year 
translated into 1982 dollars to even out the effects of 
inflation the government will spend the equivalent of 482 
billion this year for research and development barely more than 
the 46 billion it spent in 1967 
but nearly twothirds of the spending goes for military 
research mainly on weapons making the competition for civilian 
research and development money even more intense 
again using 1982 dollars the government will spend 181 
billion on civilian research and development in 1990 less than 
the 224 billion spent in 1966 
today 26 house and senate committees are involved in science 
policy and spending ninetysix federal agencies and agency 
subdivisions play a role in research and development according to 
the national science foundation 
but just five agencies spend 95 percent of the money the 
pentagon the department of health and human services the energy 
department the national aeronautics and space administration and 
the national science foundation which distributes grants and keeps 
track of federal science efforts 
in 1988 15 agencies accounted for more than 99 percent of 
federal academic support for science they distributed money to 
2769 universities and colleges 46 offices of academic systems 
such as state university headquarters and 717 nonprofit 
independent institutions such as hospitals 
to conduct its own scientific work ranging from the study of 
aids to development of highspeed trains the government employs 
218000 scientists and engineers according to the science 
foundation 
some work at the more than 700 national laboratories the 
government either operates directly or pays other institutions to 
run on the large end of the scale are the 8400 employees at the 
sandia national laboratories in albuquerque nm and livermore 
calif at the other extreme are the 16 workers at the kodiak 
national laboratory in kodiak alaska where shellfish are studied 
in his proposed 1991 budget president bush is pressing for 
annual installments for a number of major scientific initiatives 
that will take years to complete 
six of the biggest and their projected overall costs are 
a 3 billion effort to map human genes in an effort to treat 
genetic diseases and advance agriculture medicine and other fields 
the 8 billion super collider a circular atomsmasher that 
will measure 54 miles around about to be built in texas it will 
be the worlds most expensive scientific instrument 
the socalled mission to planet earth involving nasa and other 
agencies to study global change at a cost of at least 20 billion 
over 20 years 
the 30 billion space station scheduled for construction in 
the mid1990s 
a return by astronauts to the moon in the 1990s and a manned 
mission to mars early in the next century which nasa says could 
cost 541 billion 
the aerospace plane considered part of the moonmars effort 
but which could be developed independently it would take off and 
land like a conventional airplane yet reach speeds above 4000 mph 
if approved construction of two aircraft would begin in 1993 take 
four to five years and cost more than 5 billion

us scientists are examining bits of 
leg muscle removed from highflying rats as part of a joint 
nasasoviet experiment to determine how injured astronauts would 
heal in a weightless environment 
our hypotheses go everywhere from disaster to normal 
healing said william stauber a physiologist at west virginia 
university medical center and one of two scientists conducting the 
study 
a disaster would be if the muscle healed but you got cancer or 
just useless cells growing that wasted away said stauber my 
guess is the answer is somewhere in between 
soviet researchers used forceps to crush the calf muscles of 10 
specially bred rats from czechoslavakia before placing them aboard 
a vostok spacecraft for nearly two weeks last september 
the bruise was similar to something a batter would get if he 
was hit by a pitched baseball at home plate stauber said they 
tried to make it equivalent to a realworld situation 
within hours of the landing researchers removed the rats calf 
muscles and froze them once in the united states the muscle 
samples were shipped to stauber and barry festoff a neurologist at 
the veterans administration hospital in kansas city mo 
festoff and stauber are analyzing slides containing the red and 
white tissue to trace the healing and regrowth of the rats muscle 
cells and nerve fibers 
were taking a look at the muscles themselves to see if they 
are any different from the rats who suffered the same injury but 
healed on earth stauber said 
he and festoff brought soviet officials up to date on their 
research recently at a meeting at nasas ames research center in 
mountain view calif 
longterm space flight may cause deconditioning of the 
cardiovascular musculoskeletal blood and immune systems as 
kaplansky who oversees the program for the soviets said through 
an interpreter it is of crucial importance to clarify mechanisms 
underlying the changes and to develop effective countermeasures 
the study is expected to be completed this fall the results 
will be reviewed by soviet scientists before the findings are 
published 
our very preliminary data would seem to indicate that repair 
after the crushing did not take place in the flight animals said 
festoff 
stauber said researchers also hope to gain a better 
understanding of how the human body reacts to heavy work in outer 
space a critical consideration in light of a planned us space 
station 
i think there is a fair amount of knowledge of what happens to 
man if youre out there floating around for a long time but we 
really dont know what happens when you start doing hard physical 
labor in space stauber said 
stauber said there may be occupational hazards that we dont 
know about it has been known for years that astronauts muscles 
atrophy during space flights even relatively short ones 
and overuse injuries caused by working in a weightless 
environment are another concern stauber said 
behavior is going to be very different when we start working 
in space he said legs will become perching devices used to 
push off and other light work while the upper body will be used 
more 
the project is part of a longstanding agreement between the two 
superpowers to collaborate on space research 
it goes back to 1973 and the nixon administration said 
richard grindeland biospecimen program manager for the cosmos 
program at ames 
we have collaborated on seven space flights since 1975 using 
everything from guppies to monkeys grindeland said its been 
an extremely good relationship regardless of what the political 
climate has been 
the experiments have included studies on the effect of space on 
the brain immunity red blood cells and the endocrine 
reproductive and digestive systems the soviets are committed to 
participating in an american space flight slated for 1991 and the 
united states is scheduled to take part in a soviet flight in 1992

russ eide says the centrifuge machine he 
built to mash garbage encompasses two basic scientific facts 
winds in a tornado can drive straw through a board and paper is 
sharp enough to cut skin 
challeged with a dare the 51yearold inventor who grew up 
remodeling wornout farm equipment designed the dynaforce garbage 
processor a 220000 centrifuge that may help communities looking 
to conserve landfill space 
the machine is slightly larger than a pair of telephone booths 
and uses the cutting edges of garbage itself to shred waste and 
reduce its bulk by up to 80 percent 
it is like a big washing machine said eide owner of light 
work inc based in minneapolis 
eide a former mechanic and a onetime auto parts store owner 
has worked on the lw 421 for six years investing most of his life 
savings 
it can revolutionize the handling of a lot of things said 
eide his 6foot4 250pound frame circling his invention at the 
ashland landfill where it is being tested 
a marketing company is hoping to soon sell 130 units to toronto 
canada eide said some cities in ohio are looking at the machine 
ashland is leasing one and allowing eide to do more testing on it 
henry simon ashlands director of public works believes that 
coupled with the citys mandatory recycling program the processor 
could prolong the life of the towns landfill from 75 years to 50 
years 
a market exists for the machine if eide can develop conveyors 
for moving the garbage in and out of the machine and a way to 
detect heavy metals before they get dumped simon said 
if he can deal with those two items the machine is golden 
he said 
sant arora a mechanical engineering professor at the university 
of minnesota in minneapolis and some of his students spent several 
weeks studying eides invention and his theories about garbage 
disposal 
arora said the machines design is similar to old rock 
crushers a concept that hasnt been widely applied for shredding 
garbage 
eides basic theory is right but more testing is needed arora 
said 
bob ham a professor of civil and environmental engineering at 
the university of wisconsinmadison said he had no knowledge about 
eides invention but the concept was developed by a british 
company years ago 
unfortunately in the garbagehandling business there are a 
lot of new companies that keep reinventing the wheel ham said 
but eide is undaunted noting he has applied for two patents and 
has refused offers for rights to the machine 
dumped into the top of the machine garbage falls onto a series 
of 1inch thick steel bars that spin at 850 revolutions per 
minute creating a tumbling action 
things are thrown against the wall you get that constant 
impact if things are flying around in there they are going to cut 
things up eide said 
shredded garbage flies out of the machine ready to be composted 
or buried eide said 
do you smell anything here a slight musty smell he said 
sifting shredded garbage through his hands when it goes through 
this machine it practically deteriorates it 
the processor driven by a 300horsepower engine can reduce 22 
55gallon barrels of aluminum cans into one barrel of what looks 
like shrapnel eide said 
i did run a mattress in it it shredded it up it was gone 
except for the wire the inventor said 
eide said his idea started out as a dare over drinks 
somebody probably said it cant be done you cant cut without 
knives he recalled having cut myself with paper i knew how 
sharp it was when you put in the right position 
eide and his son built the first processor in the family garage 
i have sold everything i own to do this the inventor said 
i even had to get divorced my wife told me i was crazy but i 
believe in it

water managers have joined the 
fight against the thirsty melaleuca tree an australian import that 
in less than a decade may take over threequarters of the 
everglades 
wiping out the tree will take more than 10 million and as long 
as 25 years a task force has concluded and the souh florida water 
management district governing board has provided 75000 for the 
first years work 
introduced in 1906 by a university of miami forestry professor 
who saw it as a potential timber source the melaleuca had no 
natural enemies 
scientists believe it infests 625 square miles more than 60 
square miles of that an area nearly as big as washington dc 
is solid melaleuca the report says 
the tree overwhelms habitats disrupts food chains and takes 
three to six times as much water as sawgrass and other plants it 
burns hot and spreads its seeds after fires it also has a foul 
odor and may cause respiratory problems 
the task force has suggested using chemicals for now and 
eventually introducing insects that are its natural enemies but 
there is concern the bugs could become as much a threat as the 
trees they kill 
the task force concedes the tree will never be eradicated its 
goal is to stop its spread and manage it 
the tree thrives in warm climates with infrequent frosts 
tolerates a range of soils and water qualities and can grow in 
flooded and dry areas the melaleuca is identified by a papery bark 
and white flowers that look like bottle brushes

a national organization for fat people 
wants to make discrimination based on size illegal in minnesota 
the national association to advance fat acceptance recently 
asked several state senators and state human rights commissioner 
stephen cooper to amend the minnesota human rights act to protect 
large people 
the act protects against discrimination in housing employment 
education public accommodations and public services on the basis 
of race color gender religious beliefs marital status and age 
fat people often the target of cruel jokes throughout their 
lives need human rights protection said sarah johnson chairwoman 
of the groups 20member north central chapter which includes 
minnesota iowa and western wisconsin 
you can get hired into an organization and you can do a very 
good job but you will never be put out in front if youre a big 
person she said 
michigan is the only state in the country which bars 
discrimination on the basis of size johnson said 
cooper said it is probably too late to get an amendment through 
the present legislative session he also said the group would need 
to establish that fat people are losing opportunities for jobs 
housing or public services because of their size 
i am willing to talk to them between now and next session and 
listen and learn cooper said

texas heart institute surgeons plan to implant a 
batterypowered heart assist device in a patient this summer if 
they get federal approval 
if successful the patient could move freely and perhaps leave 
the hospital while awaiting a transplant said dr oh frazier 
director of the houstonbased institutes cardiovascular surgical 
research laboratories and heart transplant service 
thi and thermo cardiosystem inc have applied for a food and 
drug administration exemption that would permit them to use the 
batterypowered device in patients awaiting transplants 
thi and the massachusettsbased bioengineering company have 
worked together on heart pumps for several years and their experts 
believe the batterypowered device is an important step forward 
currently such devices are powered by large airdriven pumps 
making movement difficult 
with this newer electrical pump you do have a wire through 
the skin but its battery controlled said frazier 
the heart assist pump or left ventricular assist device performs 
most of the pumping function of a normal hearts left ventricle 
many patients can live for months with such a device 
the batterypowered pump is vented to the outside through a 
small tube frazier said the only other part that passes through 
the skin is the wire that leads to the external battery worn under 
the patients arm 
frazier said sending patients home while they await surgery will 
save tens of thousands of dollars those who have sedentary jobs 
might even be able to go back to work he said

hal riney amp partners created the advertising 
that said its perfect its perrier but last month bottles 
of the sparkling water were recalled because they were 
contaminated now riney has lost a job 
perrier group of america inc the us importer of perrier 
said it was dropping the san franciscobased agency after four 
years of making ads for the perrier brand which had been the 
leading imported water in the united states 
the announcement wednesday was a surprise company officials had 
said earlier this month that riney was working on a new ad campaign 
expected to be launched once the brand is restocked in stores bars 
and restaurants 
the company never announced it was looking for a new agency 
we strongly feel it is the right time for a totally new 
strategic and creative thrust for our brand said kim e jeffery 
senior vice president for sales and marketing for perrier group 
perrier said it had hired waring amp larosa inc a new yorkbased 
firm which preceded riney as perriers ad agency for five years 
ending in 1986 
in its first tour of duty for perrier waring amp larosa created 
an ad campaign that described the brand as earths first soft 
drink 
perrier expects to spend 8 million to 10 million on the new 
advertising campaign which is expected to start this summer 
at the moment the importer is using advertising that relies 
heavily on humor to keep consumers interested while new shipments 
of perrier are brought into the united states it is now expected 
that the first new bottles carrying the special mark nouvelle 
production will be available on the east coast in late april or 
early may and later elsewhere 
calls placed to rineys offices in san francisco and new york 
seeking comment were not returned 
perrier said riney continues as its agency for four other 
bottled waters arrowhead calistoga ozarka and zephyrhills 
riney was the agency that created the ad characters frank 
bartles and ed jaymes for the wine cooler from the gallo winery and 
is also remembered for its lush portrayals of weddings and family 
celebrations for gallo wines 
its advertising for perrier described the unique set of 
ecological events that resulted in the creation of the spring in 
vergeze france from which perrier is drawn 
in february traces of the chemical benzene were discovered in 
bottles of perrier in north carolina eventually perrier was 
recalled worldwide the problem was traced to a dirty filter at the 
bottling site 
perrier said steps have been taken to prevent recurrence of the 
contamination 
jeffery said waring amp larosas past association with perrier 
provided a unique historical perspective and comprehensive 
understanding that was a major factor in perriers decision to 
change ad agencies 
the new ads will remind consumers of the 1990s how perrier 
fits into their changing lifestyles jeffery said 
joseph larosa chairman and creative director said waring amp 
larosa got the assignment after a series of discussions that 
evolved over time and grew more intensive in the past few weeks 
he declined to say what his agency had in mind for the new 
advertising campaign 
larosa said the brand can rebound it had been the biggest 
selling imported bottled water in the united states and the third 
bestseller overall with about 57 percent of the 22 billion us 
market in 1988 
its a terrific product and should be back to its original 
status he said

directors of the ual corp have met for the 
second time in a week but arent saying whether they are any closer 
to approving a buyout deal for the parent of united airlines 
the meeting is over and there is no statement ual spokesman

session 
ual is the chicagobased parent of united airlines the nations 
secondlargest carrier after american airlines 
a group representing uniteds pilots machinists and flight 
attendants nearly twothirds of uals 71000 employees proposed 
on march 19 a buyout that would give uals entire workforce 75 
percent ownership of the company 
the proposed deal for 150 a share in cash and 25 in debt 
securities plus nonvoting stock would leave 25 percent of ual in 
the publics hands 
the board is seeking a higher price and also is exploring the 
possibility of selling some of uals assets to make a big payout to 
shareholders in an effort to bolster its share price 
the bid is supported by uals largest shareholder coniston 
partners which is threatening to wage a proxy fight to oust uals 
board at the companys annual shareholders meeting april 26 
uals board agreed last week to negotiate with the unions but 
cited serious deficiencies in their offer including the price 
and a lack of financing commitments 
the board has been wary of the unions overtures following the 
collapse last october of a 68 billion attempt led by the pilots

for peter lynch retiring as head of the nations 
largest stock mutual fund at the young age of 46 was just another 
step that set him apart from most other money managers 
lynch managed the magellan mutual fund for fidelity investments 
for 13 years guiding it through bull markets and the wall street 
crash to establish an unparalleled record of strong growth and 
performance 
on wednesday he announced he was cutting short his phenomenally 
successful career to spend more time with family and community 
i spent about 21 years with fidelity lynch said id like 
to spend 21 years doing something different 
the magellan fund has 13 billion in assets today compared with 
approximately 100 million in 1981 when it became publicly 
available to investors 
helping draw assets was the funds performance 10000 invested 
in the fund on may 31 1977 would have grown to 270007 on dec 
31 1989 according to fidelity estimates 
lynch also amassed a personal fortune estimated by boston 
magazine at 25 million and now wants to spend his days more 
leisurely with his wife and three children 
lynch noted that his father died of cancer at age 46 
theres nothing magic about 46 he said but you think 
about those things 
lynch who officially retires may 31 will join the board of 
trustees for fidelity the nations largest operator of mutual 
funds 
fidelity chairman and chief executive edward c johnson 3rd 
issued a statement saying even if he never invests another 
dollar peter lynch has won a place of honor in the history of 
money management 
during the last five years when it was the nations largest 
common stock fund magellan has outperformed the standard amp poors 
500 by an average of 6 percent annually the company said 
underpinning lynchs success was his method of longterm 
investing in sound companies rather than trying to outguess the 
market as a whole a strategy he outlined in his bestselling 
book one up on wall street 
despite this success lynch said in recent months it was 
becoming more difficult to find underperforming stocks that can 
yield big returns because stock prices have continued their annual 
growth 
lynch said magellan now has about 13 percent of its assets in 
cash about 17 billion a level company officials say is an 
alltime high for the fund 
what you need is a drop in the market or a big recession for 
big winners he said 
but lynch said hes still finding stocks to invest in and is 
confident the magellan fund can continue outperforming the stock 
market as a whole 
fidelity is loaded with talented people he said its 
possible magellan will do better in the next five years with 
another person 
magellans new portfolio manager will be morris smith 33 
currently manager of fidelity otc portfolios 
smiths fund which focuses on smaller companies listed in the 
national overthecounter market also has performed well in the 
five years ended dec 31 1989 the fund had an annualized average 
return of 2505 percent compared with 1396 percent for all small 
company growth funds according to lipper analytical services 
magellan shareholders will be notified of the changes in the 
funds annual report due to be mailed in may officials said 
joy smith a fidelity spokeswoman said the company was not 
immediately seeing many redemption orders from magellan investors 
in the wake of lynchs announcement

thomson mckinnon securities inc has filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection to hasten its liquidation 
after failing to find a buyer since the 1987 stock market crash 
the 105yearold firm once the nations ninthlargest 
brokerage said the filing was long anticipated the firm 
stopped doing business eight months ago after selling most of its 
operations 
wednesdays filing in us bankruptcy court freezes pending 
legal action against the collapsed wall street house and places 
other contentious issues in liquidating the firm under the auspices 
of a federal judge 
thomson mckinnon listed 89 million in assets and 139 million 
in liabilities in filing for protection from creditors 
last july the firm sold its retail brokerage offices and 
customer accounts to prudentialbache securities corp for about 
60 million that deal followed the collapse of a proposed merger 
of the two firms that would have created one of the largest 
securities houses on wall street 
since then thomson mckinnon has sold its seats on the nations 
stock and commodity exchanges but it still needs to liquidate part 
of its securities portfolio and other assets 
it became apparent that we were at a point where we could do 
better if we have the assistance and protection of the bankruptcy 
court said donald g mccabe thomson mckinnon general counsel 
brokerage firms generally are not permitted to seek chapter 11 
protection voluntarily but thomson mckinnon officials said the 
filing was allowed because the firm no longer had active accounts 
and most of its holdings had been liquidated 
the firm has been liquidating under the auspices of the 
securities and exchange commission and the securities investor 
protection corp the officials said both agencies endorsed the 
bankruptcy filing 
the securities firm has been reduced to about 100 employees from 
4700 before the prudentialbache deal mccabe said 
thomson mckinnon said it lost 337 million in 1987 and 385 
million in 1988 in addition to stock and bond losses the company 
said losses from a real estate investment trust heightened its need 
for a buyer 
the bankruptcy filing names commonwealth bank of australia as 
its largest unsecured creditor owed 275 million from a 
subordinated loan the second largest claim is an 11 million 
subordinated loan from hill samuel bank of london 
the filing also says thomson mckinnon wants to segregate 22 
million in assets for the accounts of former customers 
several classaction lawsuits filed on behalf of former thomson 
mckinnon employees recently were consolidated in federal court in 
new york they allege broad financial mismanagement including 
buying apartments and a yacht with company assets at least one 
suit seeks 100 million in damages 
under federal law all legal action against the brokerage unit 
is suspended during bankruptcy proceedings the lawsuits though 
also name the parent company thomson mckinnon inc and that 
action can proceed 
the parent still is seeking to liquidate all its assets the 
company said in a statement that its efforts are focused on 
attempting to sell its 63 percent interest in its other operating 
entity thomson mckinnon asset management lp 
that unit a mutual fund and private account money manager for 
67 billion in assets is not affected by the bankruptcy filing 
it has operated as a separate entity since a public stock offering 
in 1987

few more days to see whether this is a sign of a real change in the 
recent trend 
he said the dollar continued to weaken during afternoon trading 
in tokyo as participants sold the us currency for profittaking 
while the bank of japan intervened intermittently 
the bank of japan was seen selling at least several million 
dollars in an attempt to support the yen the total amount was not 
available immediately as the bank does not usually comment on its 
market interventions 
fuji bank dealer kenzo shinomiya said many market players have 
accumulated large dollar positions over the recent weeks 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said thursday he hopes 
exchange rates will come to reflect real economic conditions kyodo 
news service reported 
kyodo also quoted hashimoto as saying he intends to urge 
cooperation among the group of seven industrialized nations in 
currency stability at their meeting scheduled for april 7 in paris 
analysts have attributed the stock markets recent plunge in 
part to higher interest rates resulting from the yens weakness 
against the dollar 
on march 20 the bank of japan boosted its official discount 
rate by one percentage point to 525 percent in an attempt to head 
off inflation and strengthen the yen 
traders attributed the nikkeis fall today to indexlinked 
selling that triggered sales by other participants they said the 
nikkei index failed to maintain an early upswing because of 
continuing pessimism in the market 
although the yen jumped today market players are still 
cautious about currency trends because the yens strength could be 
just a temporary movement said yoshio shimoyama a senior trader 
with nikko securities co 
also individual market players have come to pay more 
attention to company performance instead of to daytoday changes 
in currency and interest rates for their investment criteria he 
added 
the price of benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds ended 
at 8672 points up from wednesdays 8614 their yield fell to 72 
percent from the previous days close at 732 percent

proxy fights could be good news for newspaper 
advertising managers 
about a dozen newspapers shared in an advertising windfall 
generated by the proxy fight for control of lockheed corp when the 
combatants decided to plead their cases in fullpage ads over the 
past month 
neither lockheed the californiabased defense and aerospace 
concern nor the group led by harold simmons that is trying to put 
its own slate of nominees on the lockheed board would estimate 
wednesday how much they spent on ads 
but it is likely their monthlong courtship of lockheed 
shareholders cost them several million dollars for advertising 
the extra ad revenue has been a welcome if shortlived respite 
from the recent sluggishness in ad spending especially in 
financial advertising 
more pleasant surprises could be in store if proxy fights 
replace takeover offers as the weapon of choice in deciding who 
rules the boardroom 
ads for lockheed and simmons showed up in the wall street 
journal the new york times the los angeles times san francisco 
chronicle and the washington post 
in the past 10 days alone lockheed and simmons group each have 
purchased eight full page ads in the journal and four to five each 
in the new york times 
both sides also bought ads in papers near sites where lockheed 
has plants such as the san jose calif mercury news the marietta 
ga daily journal and the telegraph in nashua nh 
we are getting some lift particularly in the last couple of 
weeks said roger may a spokesman for dow jones amp co publisher 
of the wall street journal if proxy fights are back in vogue we 
would be the beneficiaries of it 
the journals overall advertising linage was down 51 percent 
per issue in the first two months of the year may said most of 
the lockheedsimmons proxy fight has been fought in march 
the journal charges 99384 for a single fullpage national ad 
although companies with regular contracts for ad space pay less 
may said the comparable onetime charge for a page in barrons is 
14478 
the lockheed fight has made a significant impact on our 
financial advertising linage said spokeswoman laura morgan of 
the los angeles times 
she estimated the paper has carried 15 pages of ads related to 
that battle alone in the past month the onetime fullpage rate is 
about 50000 
the new york times has seen some increase in business from the 
proxy fight but not enough to call it a trend said spokeswoman 
nancy nielsen 
she said financial advertising linage was up by an unspecified 
amount at the times this year owing mostly to strong mutual fund 
activity 
the new york times charges 51408 for a single national 
fullpage ad in its business section during the week she said 
the simmons group developed about a dozen ads one had photos 
and descriptions of its 14 nominees another outlined the groups 
credentials and others featured comments from individual nominees 
sidney herman a lawyer for the simmons group said it planned 
to spend 6 million on the proxy fight including the costs of 
mailing proxy solicitation and advertising 
lockheed based in calabasas calif said it would spend 8 
million on all aspects of the proxy fight including advertising 
the company said it developed at least 10 different ads 
including one offering an open letter from its chairman and another 
in which the lockheed board advised dont risk your investment 
on nls promises 
both sides said the advertising supplements the message they 
deliver shareholders by mail telephone and in person 
its just a matter of keeping the message in front of the 
shareholders said lockheed spokesman ron meder 
jack von deck advertising manager for the telegraph in new 
hampshire where a lockheed division plant is located said the 
proxy fight generated some linage we didnt expect but that the 
increase was shortlived and would not significantly raise profits 
he estimated the paper which charges 1795 for a onetime 
fullpage ad got about 10 to 12 pages of ads as a result of the 
proxy fight 
it has been helpful and we are glad to get it but we are 
not going to florida on it he said

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca is wrongly 
blaming consumers for chryslers stumbling sales foreign car 
dealers say 
lee iacocca became famous for ending his commercials by saying 
if you can find a betterbuilt car buy it said walter e 
huizenga president of the american international automobile 
dealers association 
now he is complaining because the american consumers have 
taken his advice huizenga said 
iacocca visited new york on wednesday as part of a sixcity 
campaign to convince buyers his companys cars are as good as 
japans he launched his tour earlier this month traveling with an 
array of 1990 chrysler models 
in addition to touting chrysler iacocca has criticized trade 
barriers that keep us companies from competing in japanese 
markets 
what we sell in one year in japan they sell in 46 hours here 
this crap has got to stop he said at wednesdays new york news 
conference 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said the company wasnt 
bashing imports or telling americans not to buy them 
what we are saying is chrysler builds as good a product or 
better he said what we are doing is speaking out to dispel 
the myth that us cars are inferior 
cars with japanese nameplates made up 258 percent of the us 
car market last year up from 211 percent in 1982 the combined 
share of the big three domestic automakers chrysler general 
motors corp and ford motor co slipped from 698 percent to 675 
percent during that period 
in 1989 for the first time the bestselling car had an import 
nameplate honda accord although 60 percent of accords are built 
in the united states 
chryslers 1989 domestic sales totaled 917506 cars among the 
imports honda was closest at 389472 
chryslers national television advertisements featuring iacocca 
contend that chryslers quality is as good as japans nobody 
knows it and thats going to change he says in the commercials 
huizenga said wednesday the free market is an excellent 
barometer of relative automobile quality and the american consumer 
is an excellent judge of that quality 
they know the quality of imported cars is better and they 
are better he said no amount of complaining is going to 
change that 
the import group said japanese vehicles sold under chrysler 
nameplates such as the dodge colt and ram 50 pickup truck 
accounted for 7 percent of chryslers 1989 sales it also said more 
than half the 400000 plymouth and dodge minivans sold last year 
had mitsubishi engines 
huizengas association represents 9700 dealers selling japanese 
and other imported cars among other things it lobbies for an end 
to the voluntary import restraints on japanese automakers 
spokesman paul donnellan said

the white house today rejected democratic 
criticism of its selection of attorney t timothy ryan jr to 
regulate the savings and loan industry but acknowledged it had a 
little trouble finding a banker who would take the job 
at a confirmation hearing democrats on the senate banking 
committee gave a chilly reception to ryan questioning his ethics 
and lack of experience in banking or savings and loans 
in response white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
frankly weve had a little trouble finding people in the banking 
industry who want to take this job 
and also frankly i think its not at all certain from the 
track record from the sampl industry that thats the best place to 
draw on expertise the press secretary added 
i think the feeling here is we need somebody who is a tough 
enforcer who knows how to go in there and get things done and 
clean up this mess and knows how to use the law and use the 
resources at his command to crack some heads and get things 
moving fitzwater said 
ryan 44 a former senior labor department official now is a 
private attorney specializing in pension and employee benefit law 
he told senators complaining about his lack of relevant 
experience that he was surprised when treasury department officials 
approached him about the job about four weeks ago 
nevertheless ryan replied absolutely when senators asked 
if he was fully qualified to direct the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision which supervises 2600 thrift 
institutions 
i am not an absolute expert on the thrift industry i can 
tell you though that in the last four weeks ive spent an 
enormous amount of time trying to educate myself he said 
ryan said he was an experienced manager of large organizations 
citing his 198183 tenure as solicitor of the labor department 
where he managed 600 attorneys working in washington and 16 field 
offices 
despite their misgivings senators are under intense pressure to 
confirm ryan quickly president bush nominated him march 22 hoping 
to blunt a constitutional challenge that has put its sampl bailout 
program in limbo 
a us district court judge in washington ruled last week that 
the acting director of the thrift office salvatore martoche and 
his predecessor m danny wall lacked the constitutional authority 
to close failed thrifts because they were never confirmed by the 
senate 
the banking committee could vote on the nomination as soon as 
its next meeting on april 3 but chairman donald w riegle jr 
dmich said he could not guarantee the outcome 
some members have already expressed to me serious reservations 
about your nomination riegle told ryan 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio who is not a committee member 
but attended the hearing contended that conflicts of interest 
between the nominees public and private careers raise basic 
questions about mr ryans sense of propriety 
while in government ryan helped select former attorney general 
william b saxbe as independent counsel overseeing the teamsters 
unions central states pension fund 
after ryan left the department saxbe received court permission 
to join ryans law firm bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in fees from the pension oversight contract 
in 1985 the labor department asked ryan to resign as a member 
of an advisory council on pension fund issues after it discovered 
that he was also serving as counsel to a trade group the employee 
stock ownership association of america 
metzenbaum also criticized ryan for sitting on the council while 
a client the washington business group on health had an interest 
in issues before it 
and he said ryan should not have advised the national maritime 
union of america on a union election that the labor department had 
begun investigating shortly before ryan left government 
in his defense ryan said a federal court concluded it was not 
improper for saxbe to join his firm he said he never participated 
in employeeowned stock matters while working for the advisory 
council did not represent the business group on the pension matter 
that came before the advisory board and never dealt with the labor 
department directly concerning the maritime union 
ryan was strongly dfended by sen john warner rva who 
employed him as an aide in his last three campaigns 
the president the secretary of the treasury and to some 
extent i have been involved in this nomination and were going to 
stand by this man warner said the mans tough the mans 
fair the mans honest 
some democrats also are uneasy about ryans record as a 
republican activist he served as an aide or attorney in 
presidential campaigns for richard nixon in 1972 gerald ford in 
1976 and george bush in 1988 he was a legal counsel to ronald 
reagans 1980 transition team 
i pledge to you this agencys work will be done on a fully 
nonpartisan basis ryan told the committee

inquiries had been received about buying the miamibased company 
its assets or stock

the glitter of the casinos that began 
operating here 12 years ago is fading and many say a 
billiondollar donald trump resort could make or break atlantic 
city following its debut next week 
the unsafe streets trashstrewn lots and rusting casino 
projects that surround the citys swank gambling districts suggest 
the casinos have failed to deliver the financial wellbeing 
promised when they began reopening in 1978 
many say the key to the future of the 3 billion business is the 
taj mahal casino resort the third casino to be opened by trump 
who received a oneyear gaming license today from the state casino

we think its going to be a tremendous success trump said 
today 
both trump and his competitors hope the novelty and sparkle of 
the giant casino will widen the citys drawing power city 
officials hope more money will be generated to cure its problems 
the casinos can be very successful trump said in a 
telephone interview monday atlantic city can still be an 
entertainment island

a while 
the satellite was intended for a geosynchronous orbit 22300 
miles high from where it would have transmitted three tv channels 
and up to 120000 telephone calls simultaneously for more than 13 
years it was to have eventually replaced two older satellites over 
the atlantic 
martin marietta corp which conducted the 272 million launch 
has blamed the failure on a faulty design 
officials of intelsat and hughes aircraft co which built the 
satellite met tuesday in washington with nasa representatives to 
discuss the possibilities of saving the spacecraft it was the 
second time the groups had met 
among the possibilities being considered is a space shuttle 
rescue 
things are looking quite positive trujillo said 
obviously there are a lot of technical issues that have to be 
dealt with but were very heartened by nasas willingness to 
explore the possibility with us 
the national aeronautics and space administration has said a 
rescue attempt is technically feasible but more talks are needed

a new agency that controls millions of dollars 
in federal housing money is the prize in a power struggle pitting 
top aides to housing secretary jack kemp against kemps handpicked 
choice to head the panel 
kemps personal involvement in the fight for control o the 
federal housing finance board is unclear but actions by a top 
deputy conflict with statements by kemp and others that the 
department of housing and urban development still wants mary k 
bush to lead the agency 
the battle could come to a head today kemp summoned ms bush 
for an afternoon meeting in his office 
the board was created as part of the savings and loan bailout 
legislation it oversees the 12 federal home loan banks and is to 
channel some of their profits into housing programs the board 
selects which projects get housing funds nearly 80 million in 
the current fiscal year and roughly 100 million annually within a 
few years 
seven months after ms bush assumed her duties as acting 
director her promised appointment as chairwoman has yet to be 
made nor have appointments of the three other board members been 
made 
publicly hud and finance board officials blame the agencys 
slow start on delays in recruiting candidates and a disagreement 
over whether board members should serve full time or part time 
the effect has been to leave the independent agency and the 
subsidies under kemps control 
the agency has about 100 jobs including about a dozen with 
annual salaries in the 100000 range about 50 of the staff 
positions have been filled 
this place is a lot more important than they thought said 
one congressional source now we have a big fight they are 
trying to take control and she ms bush isnt going along with 
them 
according to several agency sources hud undersecretary alfred 
dellibovi is at the center of the effort to guarantee that hud 
keeps considerable influence over the finance board 
dellibovi however denied in an interview that he was trying to 
discredit ms bush or exert undue influence over her or the agency 
dellibovi has longstanding ties to sen alfonse damato rny 
and is not among kemps inner circle but his efforts have been 
supported by scott reed one of kemps two top aides according to 
sources 
in congress meanwhile democrats who pushed for the new 
infusion of housing money are critical of the delays in naming a 
board and wary of huds motives 
at a recent senate banking committee hearing sen alan cranston 
dcalif told kemp he was worried hud was trying to set agency 
policies and make major hiring decisions before a board was named 
several attempts to reach kemp through top aide mary brunette 
this week were unsuccessful she did not return repeated telephone 
calls 
ms bush who refused to be interviewed said in a statement 
there have been rumors circulating for some time that there 
are people who would rather see someone else in this position my 
loyalties are to jack kemp and to the missions of this agency 
dellibovis public statements appear to conflict with comments 
he made seven weeks ago in an internal hud memo obtained by the 
associated press 
among them 
dellibovi told the ap on friday that kemp had slashed ms 
bushs contracting powers after learning earlier in the week of 
three nobid contracts she had given to friends the agency does 
not have to put contracts out for competitive bids 
dellibovi said hud officials had been unaware of the contracts 
including one to kemps former chief of staff wendell gunn until 
last week 
but dellibovis memo written feb 5 refers to wendell 
twice once in a listing of people paid by the agency 
gunn in an interview said he told kemp of the consulting 
arrangement face to face last late year gunn wrote an angry 
letter to dellibovi this week accusing him of media mischief 
that sets a dangerous trap for you and unfortunately secretary 
kemp 
supporting kemps public statements dellibovi said in the 
interview that he and the secretary stood by ms bush for the job 
despite the concern over the contracts and dismissed assertions 
from capitol hill sources who said dellibovi wanted ms bush to 
leave 
but in his memo to six hud officials dellibovi mentioned that 
wendell was hoping to soon end his consulting arrangement 
if he goes lets hope he takes mary with him is how 
dellibovi concluded the memo 
the struggle is for an agency that at first was treated by the 
administration as an unwanted orphan of the sampl bailout 
congress made the housing secretary the only permanent member of 
the board and left control of the agency with kemp until a full 
board was named the white house passed its power to find a 
chairman to kemp who recruited ms bush 
hud has kept a presence at the agency since its inception at 
first temporarily assigning kemp aide russell paul to the staff 
when paul returned to hud full time in february the agency hired an 
83000ayear consultant patrick pizzella who according to 
several hud and finance board sources was appointed over ms bushs 
objections at dellibovis insistence 
dellibovis memo recounted pizzellas efforts to get details of 
the finance boards hiring and staff structure 
several sources said ms bush accepted the job with the 
understanding that she would be nominated a fulltime chairwoman 
only to be told later that hud officials had determined all board 
members should serve part time that word came according to hud 
sources after kemp deputies determined he would have more 
influence over a parttime board 
hud has persisted in saying the board can be part time despite 
being repeatedly told by congress that the positions are full time 
said a senate aide who helped draft the bill we didnt 
authorize paying 100000 a year for parttime people

mobil corp criticized by environmentalists for 
allegedly misleading advertising said today it would delete all 
references to degradability on its hefty trash bags 
mobils announcement follows a federal trade commission 
investigation started earlier this month into charges of deceptive 
advertising and packaging the investigation was prompted by 
environmental claims made by a variety of consumer products from 
trash bags to hair spray and criticized by consumer groups as 
misleading 
mobil chemical co a division of the nations secondlargest 
oil company said it would continue to make hefty trash bags with 
an environmentally safe additive which speeds their 
decomposition when exposed to sunlight but will delete the 
references to degradability on the packaging 
mobil spokesman allen gray said the company was taking the 
action in response to confusion regarding the definition of 
degradability 
environmentalists say the reference to degradability is 
misleading because the majority of trash bags are not exposed to 
sunlight long enough to biodegrade but end up in landfills that are 
rarely exposed to sunlight 
if left out in arizona somewhere a bag with the additive can 
quickly decompose in a couple of months gray conceded but in 
a northern climate like chicago it could take well over a year 
ftc chairman janet steiger said earlier this month the agency 
had joined a task force of state attorneys general to determine 
whether environmental claims made by various products could be 
substantiated 
no specific companies were named by the ftc but various 
environmental groups had targeted claims made by various 
manufacturers as misleading and in many cases false 
mobil chemical has said its claims that the bags degrade in 
sunlight have been fully substantiated by tests and that the 
company never said the bags would be the answer to the countrys 
waste disposal problem 
gray acknowledged that the company began marketing the 
degradable bags because of competitive pressures 
gray said the phaseout of the labeling is expected to take 
several months

british telecommunications plc on thursday 
announced a major restructuring that its chairman said was designed 
to make britains predominant telephone company leaner and more 
supple 
the restructuring substantially reorganizes the company but 
does not involve any major layoffs however some managers might be 
let go after the restructuring is completed in about a year a 
spokesman said 
british telecom also said that managing director graeme odgers 
would leave the company shortly by mutual agreement 
odgers departure was not related to the restructuring said the 
spokesman who was not identified in accordance with british 
practice but he declined to be more specific 
analysts speculated that odgers would have preferred more 
costcutting at the company british telecom chairman iain vallance 
is more customerminded they said 
the analysts said the streamlining was not particularly 
significant beyond improving customer service british telecom 
still needs costcutting they said 
the spokesman said the changes would remove substantial 
barriers and provide a firm foundation for cost control a 
company the size of bt does present a challenge with control he 
said 
british telecom said it would divide individual and business 
customer services into two divisions and eliminate the confusion of 
dealing with 27 service districts 
businesses with operations spread across britain and 
multinational corporations will be able to coordinate their various 
telecommunications needs with a single branch of what will be the 
business communications division the spokesman said 
in addition to the business service and the personal 
communications division british telecom said it would gather its 
special business operations such as telephone directory 
information into a third unit 
the company also said it plans to unify its british sales and 
marketing team under single management which eventually will 
absorb the international sales force 
our objective is to become a leaner and more supple 
organization structured to meet the differing needs of all our 
customers vallance said

western europe should be able to set up 
an americanstyle central banking system in 1993 under an 
accelerated timetable for economic and monetary union according to 
a european community official 
henning christophersen vice president of the trading bloc said 
in a recent interview that the economic merger of the 12 countries 
is now going to be part of the european architecture 
it is not only an ambition for some governments or for the 
commission the european communitys executive body he said 
finance ministers of the common market nations plan to meet this 
weekend in western ireland to discuss informally their plans for a 
monetary union that eventually would lead to a single currency in 
western europe 
in advance of the meeting christophersen said the governments 
could follow a faster schedule to meet their ambitious goals 
the monetary plans are part of the communitys campaign to 
remove trade barriers among the dozen nations by late 1992 and 
create a single market of some 320 million consumers 
the recent political upheavals in eastern europe have prompted 
many to urge a steppedup pace in efforts to tightly link the 
nations 
many of the trading partners want west germanys powerhouse 
economy firmly anchored in the community many of their currencies 
are tied to the strong german mark and decisions by germanys 
inflationconscious central bank affect their economies as well 
west german chancellor helmut kohl traveled to brussels last 
friday to reassure trading partners that germany had no intention 
of going its own way 
the community is considering a threestage blueprint for 
economic and monetary union that calls for a european system of 
central banks dubbed eurofed and use of the ecu the european 
currency unit as the common currency 
christophersen said the plans second stage marked by the 
central bank system could begin as early as jan 1 1993 
last week he unveiled a proposal drawn up by the communitys 
executive body to establish the new eurofed institution to 
coordinate monetary policy among the dozen nations each country 
now has its own central bank to set monetary policy 
eurofed was patterned after the independent central banks of the 
united states and west germany it would be controlled by a council 
made up of the 12 central bank governors and a smaller group of 
directors directors would be appointed for long terms 
the common market leaders plan a special conference next 
december in italy to make needed revisions in their founding treaty 
of rome for putting the eurofed system in place 
kohl and french president francois mitterrand have indicated the 
talks should end by mid1991 
once the treaty revisions are drawn up it will take a year or 
so for ratification by all nations said christophersen 
he gave no date for the start of the third stage on monetary 
union during which the ecu would be introduced as the joint 
currency but he said it would be better for the economic system 
to move quickly to that phase 
the first stage of the monetary plan will go into effect on july 
1 when governments coordinate much more closely their economic and 
monetary policies moreover capital and exchange controls will be 
abolished so money can move freely among the nations 
the plan calls for all currencies to be linked in the exchange 
rate mechanism of the european monetary system which keeps their 
values roughly steady within certain ranges the currencies of 
britain portugal and greece remain outside the linkage 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who has resisted 
entering the pound into the mechanism has promised to do so but 
has given no timetable 
she has opposed calls for the sweeping monetary changes arguing 
that such plans would force countries to give up some of their 
sovereignty to new institutions 
however a british alternative proposal to make all european 
currencies legal tender throughout the common market has gathered 
little support

continental airlines has settled a 336 million 
lawsuit against united airlines that charged united with unfair 
competition in the use of its computerized reservation system 
the airlines agreed not to disclose the amount of the settlement 
reached wednesday 
i think its fair to say were pleased said continental 
attorney david boies 
as part of the agreement houstonbased continental will drop 
another suit that alleged chicagobased united breached its 
contract with continental in operating the reservation system 
between 1980 and 1984 boies said 
at this point both companies have put all differences between 
them behind them he said 
united spokesman joe hopkins said the company had no comment on 
the agreement 
the settlement was reached shortly before the beginning of jury 
deliberations in the 10week trial of the suit in federal court in 
los angeles 
continental had sought 336 million in damages claiming united 
programmed its computer reservation system to unfairly favor united 
flights over those of competitors even if a competitors flight 
was more convenient for a customer 
they rearranged the order in which flights appeared on the 
computer screens boies said 
last year american airlines settled with continental over 
similar allegations for a reported 100 million 
in the suit continental a division of texas air corp also 
accused united of overcharging it and other carriers for the 
reservation service 
united a ual corp division last december prevailed in a 
similiar suit filed in 1984 on behalf of 11 other airlines

lockheed corp chairman daniel tellep 
bowing to pressure from major shareholders promised today at the 
aerospace companys annual meeting to make major concessions to 
them in the future 
the concessions came at the behest of big pensions funds and 
other institutional shareholders many of whom defected to the side 
of harold simmons the texas investor who bought 19 percent of 
lockheed and wants to oust the companys board and replace it with 
his nominees 
results of voting at the meeting held in a vast hangar wont 
be known for at least a week 
tellep said he met with 70 institutions during the proxy contest 
over the past two weeks and he considered this his baptism by 
fire and a highly valuable experience 
we believe in shareholder democracy he said offering the 
following concessions to prove it 
if there is significant support as expected for a resolution 
that voting by shareholders be confidential lockheed would develop 
such a procedure 
a provision to opt out of the strict antitakeover provisions 
of law in delaware where lockheed is incorporated tellep said 
even if that provision does not pass but there is a significant 
minority vote for it he would recommend that the lockheed board 
support an amendment at the next meeting to have lockheed opt out 
of those provisions 
a promise to seat up to three shareholder representatives on 
lockheeds 15person board he earlier offered only one 
an offer to meet regularly with representatives of simmons nl 
industries inc to discuss the future of lockheed 
simmons says lockheed with a recent history of sagging earnings 
and underestimating costs of developing new programs must insist 
on better profits in its noncore businesses or sell them off 
the company portrays him as a corporate raider intent on 
personal profit with no knowledge of how to run lockheed the 
nations sixthlargest defense contractor with 1989 sales of 99 
billion 
simmons who has lost 100 million on his 530 million 
investment in lockheed because of a slumping share price insists 
he can better focus the company to profit from its core space 
missiles and aeronautics businesses that would pull up the share 
price for all investors he claims 
simmons says he has a solid track record of profitably running 
companies he purchases like nl industries inc amalgamated sugar 
co and keystone steel and wire co he maintains he wants to run a 
leaner more streamlined lockheed not just cash out 
win or lose in todays vote were in this for the long run 
insisted j landis martin president of nl industries and chief 
strategist for the texas investor 
martin said he was particularly optimistic about the prospects 
for passage of simmonssupported shareholder rights proposals 
including measures to overturn lockheeds antitakeover provisions 
denied seats on the board by tellep simmons solicited support 
for his own slate of directors including john tower former head 
of the senate armed services committee and retired adm elmo r 
zumwalt jr the former chief of naval operations and former member 
of the joint chiefs of staff 
tellep and simmons spent wednesday the same way they have spent 
most of the past few weeks trying to persuade big pension funds 
and other institutional investors that their strategies would serve 
the companies best 
historically few proxy battles have succeeded in unseating 
directors however harris and other analysts said simmons has made 
surprisingly strong inroads into the ranks of the institutional 
investors who hold 60 percent of lockheeds shares 
simmons chief coup was persuading californias huge public 
employees pension fund known as calpers to vote its nearly 1 
percent of lockheed shares for him harris said calpers has led 
institutional investors in pressing for more control over companies 
they own and its defection was seen as likely to influence other 
big investors 
i still think the incumbent will win the proxy fight said 
harris but given the indication by calpers recently it probably 
will be closer than i had anticipated 
he noted that under simmons assault tellep had made 
concessions to shareholders saying he would appoint at least one 
representative of shareholder groups to the board after today 
the company is sensitive to some of criticisms mr simmons has 
made and may pay closer attention to return on investment 
earnings per share and cash flow harris said 
however he said that without the speculative interest stirred 
up by simmons lockheed shares would be selling for less than their 
3687 closing price wednesday i believe the shares would be 
fairly priced in the 3032 range 
lockheed stock sold for as high as 5475 a share last year but 
has fallen along with other defense stocks amid expectations of a 
steep drop in military spending 
martin characterized telleps overtures to shareholders as 
deals cut at the last minute for votes 
we feel very good about the response were getting from 
institutions and were very hopeful about the outcome he said 
asked if he were surprised by the strength of simmons 
challenge tellep said early this week i think that hes waged a 
strong campaign it will be up to the institutions to decide how 
strong it is

consumer spending narrowed to a 04 percent 
increase in february the government said thursday 
analysts blamed weak car sales for the slowdown and some said 
buying momentum was building in other areas of the economy 
the commerce department said personal consumption totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 trillion the smallest 
increase since a 03 percent gain in october 
consumer spending which accounts for about twothirds of the 
nations economic activity jumped 1 percent in december and 
january the january increase was even stronger than the 06 
percent originally reported 
personal income rose 09 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 464 trillion after a 07 percent increase in 
january which was revised down slightly from 08 percent first 
reported the february income gain matched a 09 percent advance 
november 
the spread between income and consumption growth in the near 
term is a negative for the economy because consumers have buying 
power but are not unleashing it said michael p niemira an 
economist with the mitsubishi bank in new york 
but over the longer term building up savings is a positive 
for future consumption growth he said 
the spread contributed to a savings rate of 57 percent 
savings as a percent of disposable income compared with a 53 
percent rate in january 
the increase in personal consumption which includes everything 
except interest payments on debt totaled 159 billion 
spending on durable goods expensive items expected to last 
more than three years dropped 146 billion due in part to weak 
car sales 
autos were still a depressant going into march niemira 
said but on the other hand department store sales were doing 
quite well in march 
there seems to be a momentum that is building in the 
nonautomotive area consumer confidence is up in recent surveys 
he said 
purchases of nondurable goods gained 109 billion while 
spending on services rose 196 billion 
the february and january increases in personal income were 
affected by several special factors the department said 
including farm subsidies that both raised the february change and 
lowered the january change 
a pay raise for federal government employees raised the 
changes in both months it said the january change was also 
boosted by costofliving adjustments to several transfer payment 
programs and was lowered by an increase in personal contributions 
to social insurance 
payroll increases were spread through all industry categories 
it said government payrolls also were up reflecting the federal 
pay raise 
the report said americans incomes after taxes rose 09 percent 
in february up from 08 percent the previous month 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
jumped 235 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate

as wall streets big investment houses rein in 
their payrolls and egos during a broad consolidation the nations 
regional firms are recovering steadily from the 1987 stock market 
crash 
profits slumped 28 percent industrywide last year but doubled at 
the smaller regional firms which specialize in trading stocks and 
bonds for individual investors and operate in limited geographic 
areas 
the reasons regionals didnt expand like the major houses 
during the heady 1980s have lower overhead costs and rely on 
customer service rather than on marketing newfangled investment 
products 
turning the battleship around is always a lot more difficult 
than turning a speedboat around raymond chip mason chairman 
of legg mason wood walker inc in baltimore said thursday 
fourthquarter performance showed regional superiority the 
industry lost 92 million while regionals made 123 million the 
overall loss was the first since 1987s fourth quarter when the 
stock market crashed 
preliminary figures show that for all of 1989 the industry made 
18 billion down 28 percent from 25 billion in 1988 regional 
income rose to 215 million but still was the third lowest in the 
1980s and far short of the record 546 million in 1986 
since the crash all forms of business are down from mergers 
and securities underwriting which fueled wall streets boom to 
stock market activity that regionals rely on for retail brokerage 
business 
but regionals such as legg mason ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in minneapolis and 
raymond james amp associates inc in st petersburg fla all 
reported record 1989 earnings 
the nations two biggest securities firms merrill lynch amp co 
and shearson lehman hutton inc which have huge retail networks 
both had disappointing years together they have laid off more than 
5000 employees in recent months shearson recently closed 50 
retail offices 
the bigger firms wanted to become financial supermarkets and i 
think theyre backing away from that now said carter jones 
executive vice president of boettcher amp co a denverbased 
brokerage we dont seem to be facing the same trauma 
financially 
disgust with wall street engendered by publicity about turmoil 
at shearson the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc and 
problems at companies financed by junk bonds also may steer 
investors to local brokerage firms analysts said 
a public perception of greed on wall street fueled by current 
bestsellers such as barbarians at the gate and liars 
poker doesnt help 
in the 90s the client is going to be attracted to service 
jones said regionals are already doing that and its easier for 
them to move to that if theyre not 
longterm relationships with brokers are more likely to be found 
at a regional firm analysts said 
joe trusts bill and bills going to get the business said 
donald f howard deputy chairman of gray judson amp howard a 
cambridge mass firm that consults for regional brokerages 
securities executives and analysts said with wall street layoffs 
soaring total industry employment is down by more than 40000 
since the crash regionals are hiring topflight brokers from 
large firms 
boettcher a subsidiary of kemper financial companies inc of 
chicago has added about 90 brokers in the last 15 months many 
from major brokerages boosting its staff to 300 legg mason has 
hired nearly 200 brokers in the last three years 
honing broker skills and improving relationships appears to be 
paying off productivity per broker increased to 169000 in 
commissions generated at regional firms last year from 140000 in 
1988 
still a slow stock market is slow for everyone average daily 
volume on the new york stock exchange so far this month is 151 
million shares down from 165 million last year and 56 percent 
below the big boards 1990 projection 
but in a securities industry association survey 83 percent of 
35 regional executives said the 1990s will be good for retail the 
graying of america with the oldest baby boomers hitting age 45 
next year was cited as a factor that will help 
they are moving into their prime savings and investment 
years adrian l banky an sia executive vice president told a 
regional brokerages conference in chicago wednesday they are

house members clashed thursday over 
establishing minimum standards for daycare centers and subsidizing 
churchrun centers as they began debate on competing versions of 
major childcare legislation 
their disputes obscured earlier bipartisan agreement on key 
portions of the bills however and came as the white house renewed 
its threat to veto the more ambitious democratic proposal 
both versions would expand tax credits for poor working families 
that have childcare expenses and create a system of stateissued 
subsidy vouchers for parents who want to use religious daycare 
centers both would expand the head start program for poor children 
the more expensive democratic version would go further to 
establish minimum standards and provide money for a new program of 
day care based in public schools 
the time has come for us to put our money where our mouths 
are said rep thomas downey dny a sponsor of the democratic 
version children are our most important national resource in our 
country and for too long we have neglected them 
republicans said the more expensive democratic plan would face a 
veto by president bush 
this bill does not pay as you go it spends as they went 
said rep bill frenzel rminn what a wierd tortured way of 
taking care of children by giving them an iou for 30 billion 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater meanwhile said bush 
would veto the democratic version if enacted the white houses 
budget office issued a statement calling the democratic version 
an exercise in fiscal irresponsibility 
fourteen democratic governors and one republican gov john r 
mckernan jr of maine signed a letter to house speaker thomas 
foley endorsing the leaderships version of the childcare bill and 
opposing a proposed conservative alternative 
the house planned a vote on the alternative sponsored by reps 
charles stenholm dtexas and clay shaw rfla and backed by the 
white house 
the house defeated on a 243182 vote a democratic amendment that 
would have made the voucher system optional for states it faced 
another that would prohibit subsidies for churchrun centers that 
offer religious instruction 
republicans attacked the democratic version because it instructs 
states to set minimum standards for daycare centers including a 
requirement that daycare workers receive 15 hours of training a 
year 
rep thomas tauke riowa charged the regulatory requirements 
reduce the choices available to parents and harm churchrun 
centers 
rep george miller dcalif said congress has passed 
regulations for the handling of farm animals and should do no less 
for children 
this is not a philosophical argument miller said this is 
an attack on americas children and quality child care 
the cause of child care has been embraced by both political 
parties with president bush supporting some form of increased 
assistance to parents during his 1988 presidential campaign but 
the bills bogged down in congress last year amid partisan and 
internal disputes 
if the childcare legislation were an actual child congress 
would be charged with abuse and neglect said rep olympia snowe 
rmaine 
the senate approved its version of a childcare bill last year 
when the house approved conflicting versions the latest house 
action was an effort to reach a new position going into a 
conference with the senate where a final version will be forged 
the conference report will reflect a broad multifaceted 
approach to child care which i believe the president will sign 
said foley dwash 
a principal difference between the two versions centered around 
schoolbased day care the democrats would provide federal funds 
for school systems to set up programs of yearround before and 
afterschool care and preschool care for 3 and 4yearolds 
based in the public schools 
the democrats version gives conservatives much of what they 
wanted on the issue of religious care it requires states to 
provide subsidy vouchers to families that want them for use in 
sectarian daycare centers including those that offer religious 
instruction and discriminate based on church membership or tenets 
the stenholmshaw version would not set minimum standards for 
day care it would create an additional tax credit for families 
with infants 
both childcare packages would be financed in part by ending the 
existing dependent care tax credit for upperincome families that 
credit would be reduced for families earning 70000 a year and 
eliminated for those earning more than 90000

japanese business executives once thought they 
could solve their image problems in the united states by making 
corporate charitable donations and hiring lobbyists to represent 
them in washington 
now in response to accusations that tokyo has been buying 
support from us officials and academics some japanese protest 
what they call a japanlobby hunt reminiscent of mccarthyist 
anticommunist campaigns 
the criticism they say is souring constructive ties between 
the worlds two largest economic powers 
why pick on us the consultants and lawyers who have the 
misfortune of representing a currently unpopular ally are the very 
people that senior business executives and government officials in 
japan have lent an ear to said kazuo nukazawa managing director 
of keidanren or the federation of economic organizations japans 
most powerful business group 
todays trade policy mccarthyites seem determined to ostracize 
those scarce few who have experience and expertise on the country 
the us has serious business negotiations with he wrote in a 
recent commentary in the japan times newspaper 
other japanese also express frustration over accusations in the 
united states that many american trade negotiators and scholars are 
suspiciously vulnerable to japanese influence 
the debate was created largely by a jan 22 article in the new 
republic a prominent american magazine titled the japanese 
megaphone tokyos americans that say yes 
in it author john b judis wrote that the hundreds of millions 
of dollars funneled by japanese corporations to us think tanks 
and lobbyists are tilting the debate about americas economic 
future without the public being aware of it 
japan has assembled a virtual whos who of lobbyists and 
advisers in washington judis wrote this army of lobbyists and 
advisers furnishes japanese companies with the troops necessary to 
win battles in washington 
such charges have generated a japanologist hunt reminiscent 
of a mccarthyist red hunt tetsuya shibayama wrote in a recent 
issue of the weekly asahi journal alluding to sen joseph 
mccarthys diatribes over what he saw as communist subversion of 
the us government circles in the 1950s 
shibayama blamed the problem on what he calls japanese ignorance 
of exactly how their wealth and power are perceived overseas 
one of japans top authorities on the issue agrees 
japanese companies spare no expense to hire big names but 
often their money is wasted said masatake takahashi a 
commentator who has published several books on lobbying in the 
united states 
i keep telling executives of companies they should be more 
selective theyre being criticized mainly because their approach 
is wrong you have to know how to use lobbyists properly or its 
not worth the trouble and expense he said 
japanese officials at several major companies declined to 
comment on the issue 
our activities are mainly community oriented we commit 01 
percent of our total sales to grassroots activities and we make 
academic contributions to professorships at top universities but 
we have no particular comment on lobbying activities said akira 
nagano spokesman at matsushita electronic industrial co maker of 
major electronics brands like national and panasonic 
the accusations of excessive japanese influence have led to 
congressional hearings on tightening us control of foreign 
agents with emphasis on lobbyists for japanese business 
unlike the us congress japans parliament does not have 
institutionalized lobbies and influential japanese rarely accept 
requests to lobby on behalf of foreign interests 
the american tobacco pharmaceutical rice and electronics 
industries have offices working on their behalf in tokyo they and 
executives at major us firms like ibm and atampt have managed to 
cultivate support for easing restrictive regulations through 
practices similar to lobbying 
but they keep a much lower profile than lobbyists in washington 
american firms mistakenly have paid little attention to 
getting things done through private discussions with elected 
officials said john p stern executive director of the us 
electronics industry japan office and perhaps tokyos bestknown 
us lobbyist 
stern said the criticism of the japanese lobby in the united 
states is understandable 
the main reason its subject to so much criticism is its so 
huge he said it is used to stifle american misgivings about 
japan and to drown out american voices its properly the subject 
of criticism 
nukazawa however said those criticizing japans lobbyists are 
using smear tactics to force us officials to adopt tougher 
attitudes toward tokyo in trade disputes 
he said criticism of japanese corporate contributions to us 
academic and research institutions could backfire if the donors 
reconsider their generosity 
some in tokyo who have responded positively to past 
solicitations are now saying that if the us starts pointing 
fingers at japanese contributors it is a situation of damned if 
you do damned if you dont he said

ibm chairman john akers pay was cut last year 
as the computer giants profit tumbled according to ibms annual 
proxy statement 
but although akers compensation was shaved the 3 percent 
reduction didnt compare with the 35 percent earnings slide at 
international business machines corp 
ibms 1989 profit totaled 376 billion compared with 581 
billion in 1988 the company blamed a costly restructuring plan and 
unfavorable currency exchange rates for most of the decline

setting akers salary 
his pay isnt just a reflection of the year but includes 
other factors such as the companys longterm management thonis 
said in addition the chairmans compensation is kept competitive

executive compensation committee a group of the companys board of 
directors that are not covered by the compensation plan 
akers actual salary last year was 712500 the remainder of

mobil corp targeted by environmentalists for 
alleged misleading advertising said thursday it no longer will 
refer to its hefty trash bags as degradable 
but the head of a task force of state attorneys general 
investigating deceptive advertising and packaging by mobil and 
other companies claimed the oil giant merely was trying to deflect 
potential liability ahead of a scheduled negotiating session next 
week 
people need to know this didnt come out of the blue said 
hubert humphrey iii minnesotas attorney general it comes as 
the result of a meeting two weeks ago with state and federal 
agencies that are very much looking at enforcement action 
mobil has been criticized for advertising on its hefty trash 
bags that claims the product decomposes after exposure to 
elements like sun wind and rain 
environmentalists say the reference to degradability is 
misleading because more than 80 percent of trash bags are not 
exposed to sunlight long enough to degrade but end up in dry 
landfills that rarely are exposed to sunlight 
in thursdays announcement mobil said its chemical division 
would continue making hefty trash bags with an environmentally 
safe additive that speeds their decomposition when exposed to 
sunlight but the company will delete the references to 
degradability on the packaging 
mobil spokesman allen gray said mobil chemical co was taking 
the action in response to mounting confusion regarding the 
definition of degradability 
gray conceded that if left out in arizona somewhere a bag 
with the additive can quickly decompose in a couple of months but 
in a northern climate like chicago it could take well over a year 
nontheless gray said claims that the bags degrade in sunlight 
have been fully substantiated by tests and that the company 
never said the bags would be the answer to the countrys waste 
disposal problem 
humphrey and other task force members said mobils action could 
send a signal to other companies making similar claims 
this retreat by mobil however admirable is just the opening 
victory for new york and other states in our war over dishonest 
advertising claims about the environmental benefits of certain 
products robert abrams new yorks attorney general said in a 
prepared statement 
gray said the company began marketing the degradable bags 
because of competitive pressures he said the phaseout of the 
labeling was expected to take several months 
mobil officials are scheduled to meet monday in st louis with 
legal representatives from the eightstate task force including 
california massachusetts minnesota missouri new york texas 
washington and wisconsin humphrey said mobil may be subject to 
fines or further injunctive relief including a binding legal 
agreement to halt similar advertising on other mobil products such 
as styrofoam plates and plastic grocery bags 
officials from the federal trade commission which joined the 
investigation earlier this month are expected to attend the 
meeting said ed barbini spokesman for abrams 
ftc chairman janet steiger said earlier this month the agency 
had joined the task force to determine whether environmental claims 
made by various products from trash bags to hair spray could be 
substantiated 
no other companies have been named by the task force or the ftc 
although several companies are under investigation

cocoa futures prices surged to new sevenmonth highs thursday on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange on persistent speculation 
that economic turmoil in brazil and the ivory coast could cause 
significant supply disruptions 
on other markets livestock and meat futures mostly were lower 
grains and soybeans advanced precious metals rose and energy 
futures were mixed 
cocoa futures settled 21 to 27 higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 1190 per ton the highest settlement of a 
nearmonth cocoa contract since aug 16 
the rally followed a rise of 47 in the may contract on 
wednesday 
analyst harry schwartz of cargill investor services inc said 
most of the buying was again by speculators and for the same 
reasons as on wednesday fears of supply disruptions from the 
worlds two largest cocoa producers 
no disturbances were reported thursday in the ivory coast the 
no 1 cocoa grower after wednesdays violent confrontation between 
police and demonstrators in abidjan the capital of the west 
african nation 
last years collapse of cocoa prices to 14year lows was 
disastrous for the ivory coast citizens recently have been calling 
for the resignation of 30year president felix houphouetboigny 
who has ordered strict austerity measures to save the country from 
bankruptcy 
meanwhile cocoa movement out of brazil remained extremely slow 
amid continuing confusion about economic reform measures introduced 
two weeks ago in an attempt to halt hyperinflation 
schwartz discounted fears of supply disruptions 
in the fullness of time brazil will get its house in order 
and start exporting again he said 
he noted there had been no indication of shipping halts in the 
ivory coast and said the price rise could trigger the release of 
a significant amount of ivorian cocoa in storage outside the 
country as well as hedge selling of futures by the cocoa trade 
i havent seen any concrete evidence of anything occurring 
other than apprehension about what could happen he said 
livestock and meat futures fell on the chicago mercantile 
exchange led by the pork markets on selling ahead of fridays 
quarterly agriculture department hogsandpigs inventory report 
the report is expected to show a 26 percent decline in us hog 
herd but analysts said market gains earlier this week may have

frozen pork bellies were 25 cent to 110 cents lower with may at

most grain and soybean futures advanced on the chicago board of 
trade largely reflecting expectations for a bullish usda report on 
spring planting intentions 
the report scheduled for release after the close is expected 
to show that farmers plan to sow more corn than last year while 
cutting back on soybean and spring wheat acreage 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with may at

analysts said crude oil prices remained under pressure from 
slackening seasonal demand and building inventories 
conversely gasoline and heating oil supplies have declined due 
partly to the slowdown in refinery operations since last month for 
annual maintenance and repairs 
crude still looks heavy because of high inventories said 
tom bentz director of futures trading for united energy inc 
however bentz said the market may soon stage a reversal as

polaroid corp which has been reorganizing since 
fending off a hostile takeover effort two years ago said thursday 
it would take additional steps to restructure itself to boost sales 
and respond better to market demands 
the reorganization is a major step in redirecting the company 
toward growth said i macallister booth president and chief 
executive of cambridgebased polaroid 
polaroid officials said the announcement caps a companywide 
restructuring polaroid undertook in 1988 while fighting a hostile 
takeover attempt by shamrock holdings 
key elements of the new organization are three business units 
family imaging business imaging and technical imaging that will 
focus on specific markets and product applications 
separately the company will create three major groups that will 
provide support in research sales and product development and 
manufacturing 
the executives overseeing the business units and support groups 
will report directly to a newly created office of the chief 
executive officer sheldon buckler polaroids executive vice 
president will join that office and share responsibilities with 
booth 
analysts said the changes are important because polaroid must 
show stronger sales growth 
polaroid earned 145 million last year compared with a 226 
million loss in 1988 during the takeover fight but sales grew only 
2 percent in 1989 to 19 billion 
analysts said the improved earnings resulted from cost cutting 
to have further increases in profits the company must accelerate 
its sales they said 
eugene glazer an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said 
the new organization should help accomplish this task by making 
polaroid a more market driven company 
historically this company has been research driven he 
said adding that polaroids philosophy was great inventions 
create new markets 
an example of polaroids new strategy is the way it has marketed 
instant photography the company increasingly has promoted instant 
cameras not only for family use but also for businesses such as 
insurance agencies 
buckler said however the companys direction will not be 
dictated completely by market forces 
what you really need is a blend of market drive and technology 
drive he said when you combine those forces right you 
getting your batting average way up

discount stockbroker quick amp reilly inc said 
thursday it had raised commissions by about 5 a trade in order to 
provide new services for customers 
thomas quick president of the firm said the 8 percent increase 
was not prompted by the downturn in the retail brokerage industry 
stemming from the october 1987 stock market crash 
quick said the new yorkbased firm recently installed a 24hour 
telephone stock quote system for investors in 25 cities and added 
free checkwriting privileges for money market account clients 
these things cost money quick said in light of inflation 
we didnt feel we were really being piggies 
he said the nations third largest discount brokerage had not 
raised its commissions since 1983 the move left quick amp reilly 
commissions still slightly lower than the leaders in the field san 
franciscobased charles schwab amp co and bostonbased fidelity 
investments 
charles schwab last raised its commissions by 6 percent in 
february 1988 and said it has no plans for another increase a 
spokesman for fidelity could not be reached for comment 
under the change at quick amp reilly which took effect monday 
individual investors will be charged according to the principal 
amount of a transaction before quick amp reilly calculated 
commissions based on the number of shares bought or sold and the 
price per share 
quick said while the average commission was 5 a trade charges 
would be higher for trades involving small principal amounts and 
lower for transactions involving high principals 
quick amp reilly on wednesday reported its fourthquarter profits 
rose to 252 million or 27 cents a share for the period ended 
feb 28 from 209 million or 22 cents per share in the same

million or 105 a share revenue climbed to 106 million from 
776 million a year earlier 
discount brokers have reported healthier profits than large wall 
street firms despite a decline in stock trading activity since the 
stock market crash disounts have low expenses and benefit from 
high business volume because of their relatively lower commission 
rates

norton cos board of directors rejected a 16 
billion buyout offer thursday from the british conglomerate btr plc 
and said it might open itself to minority investors and buy back 
some of its stock to thwart a takeover 
but analysts said norton apparently was trying to raise the btr 
bid and they expected the company eventually would accept a deal 
btr based in london announced the 75pershare offer this 
month for norton a worcester massbased maker of abrasives such 
as grinding wheels and sandpaper 
since then norton stock climbed above that level and the 
companys board described the btr deal as inadequate the stock 
closed thursday at 7387 down 112 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading after the boards announcement 
john nelson nortons chairman and chief executive officer also 
said the acquisition would have a significantly adverse effect on 
nortons employees suppliers and customers and the communities 
served by the company 
btr chief executive john cahill responded with a statement 
criticizing the board for spurning all our repeated attempts to 
meet with it and said the company would proceed with its offer 
he urged norton officials to meet with btr to achieve a friendly 
transaction 
alvin donius an analyst with altman brenner wasserman amp co in 
new york said a bidding war likely has just begun 
i think btr has been holding back he said they have 
given body language that they will go higher 
in my judgment norton eventually will negotiate with btr or 
with someone else he said he said the action by nortons board 
was to negotiate a better price 
btr has encountered protests from norton workers and local 
officials who fear the company would be dismantled but btr 
officials have disputed those claims 
norton said it needed more time to consider various alternatives 
to counter the offer and as a result the board canceled the 
companys annual shareholders meeting scheduled for april 26 and 
called for a special shareholders meeting on june 26 
nelson said the btr offer which was made the day after norton 
mailed its annual meeting notice apparently was intended to leave 
the board with the shortest possible amount of time to consider 
the offer and develop and explore alternatives 
the company said it was discussing with other parties the 
possibility of strategic minority investments and that it has 
approached banks to see whether they might lend money for norton to 
buy its own stock

a former top mortgagebacked securities trader 
at merrill lynch agreed to a ninemonth suspension thursday to 
settle allegations that he made an offthebooks trade that cost 
the company 85 million 
the securities and exchange commission announced it had agreed 
to accept the settlement offer of howard a rubin of new york who 
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing 
the sec had accused him in an administrative action of failing 
to disclose to merrill lynch pierce fenner amp smith inc in 1987 
that he had made a 500 million proprietary trade in stripped 
mortgagebacked securities 
such securities are backed by mortgages but unlike conventional 
bonds the interest and principal are sold off separately 
the trade obligated merrill lynch which lost approximately 85 
million on the deal to sell 500 million in government national 
mortgage association interestonly securities according to the sec 
the importance of this case is that if this had happened at a 
firm that was not as well capitalized as merrill lynch it would 
forced them to liquidate harming the investing public said 
martin a kuperberg associate regional administrator of the secs 
new york regional office 
rubin who left merrill lynch in 1987 was not available for 
comment 
his lawyer ira lee sorkin said that at the time the trade 
became known there were wild allegations of fraud this order 
today identifies it as a books and records problem nothing more 
which he neither admits or denies 
in addition to a ninemonth suspension from association with any 
broker dealer investment company investment adviser or municipal 
securities dealer rubin will be barred from acting in a 
supervisory capacity for at least four years 
rubin joined the mortgage trading department at bear stearns in 
november 1987 
while at bear stearns he has been an exemplary employee 
the securities firm said in a statement that added we look 
forward to his return and reassociation with bear stearns in nine 
months 
at merrill lynch a spokesman bill clark said were 
gratified that the sec has imposed a serious sanction which should 
serve as a deterrent for this type of conduct

lockheed corp chairman daniel tellep 
promised major concessions to big shareholders thursday but 
predicted victory in his battle with texas investor harold simmons 
over control of the company 
im expecting a clear majority in every category of 
shareholder except of course mr simmons tellep said at a news 
conference after the aerospace companys annual meeting 
simmons who owns 19 percent of lockheed and his chief 
strategist j landis martin said they believed the contest was 
too close to call although martin later seemed to acknowledge they 
had lost 
its like a political campaign he said sometimes you 
just have to come back again the next time 
simmons however claimed victory in pressuring tellep to make 
concessions to the concerns of big investors seeking more input in 
running the company 
i think we achieved an awful lot simmons said claiming he 
also forced lockheed to concentrate on profits rather than merely 
increasing the amount of business the company does 
lockheed spent about 8 million on the proxy battle while 
simmons said he spent about 6 million both sides said they wished 
they had not had to do so 
it was a tremendous drain of energy away from running the 
company tellep told reporters 
during the meeting held in a giant hangar adjacent to burbank 
airport tellep told shareholders that he met with 70 institutional 
investors during the proxy war over the past two weeks and that he 
considered it his baptism by fire and a highly valuable 
experience 
concessions were forced by big pension funds and other 
institutional shareholders many of which defected to simmons who 
sought to replace lockheeds board with his representatives 
simmons slate included john tower former head of the senate 
armed services committee and retired adm elmo r zumwalt jr the 
former chief of naval operations and former member of the joint 
chiefs of staff 
preliminary voting results may be available next week 
tellep told the meeting he believes in shareholder democracy 
and offered several future concessions including secret votes if 
that is what a significant number of shareholders want 
other promises included 
a provision to opt out of strict antitakeover provisions of 
law in delaware where lockheed is incorporated tellep said that 
even if the provision did not pass but there was a significant 
minority vote for it he would recommend that the board support an 
amendment at the next meeting to have lockheed opt out 
a promise that he would ask for a list of possible shareholder 
representatives to lockheeds 15person board and would select up 
to three directors from that list he earlier offered to select 
only one 
an offer to meet regularly with representatives of simmons nl 
industries inc to discuss the future of lockheed 
martin and simmons objected to the way in which some of the 
shares belonging to an employees stock ownership plan had been 
voted they said the trustee of the plan which holds 19 percent of 
lockheed stock had wrongly voted all the shares even though about 
30 percent of the employees failed to vote 
the 30 percent was voted in proportion with the rest of the 
plans votes which lockheed announced late thursday had gone for 
tellep by more than 90 percent martin suggested that if they lost 
by a narrow margin the result might be challenged on those grounds 
simmons contends that lockheed with a recent history of sagging 
earnings and underestimating costs of developing new programs must 
insist on better profits at its noncore businesses or sell them 
the company portrays simmons as a corporate raider intent on 
personal profit with no knowledge of how to run lockheed the 
nations sixthlargest defense contractor with 1989 sales of 99 
billion 
simmons who has lost 100 million on his 530 million 
investment in lockheed stock insists he can better focus the 
company and has a good record of profitably running companies he 
purchases including nl industries amalgamated sugar co and 
keystone steel and wire co 
during the meeting simmons and martin were bombarded with 
questions from lockheed employees and shareholders worried that 
simmons might want to merely dismantle the company for his own 
benefit 
the most vigorous defense of tellep by an employee came from bob 
strickland a worker at lockheed aircraft services in ontario 
mr tellep and i have one thing in common a great love for 
our company lockheed has always been there for me and now i feel 
its my duty to be there for him strickland said about voting 
his 38 shares for the current board 
historically few proxy battles have succeeded in unseating 
directors however analysts say simmons made strong inroads into 
the ranks of the institutional investors who hold 60 percent of 
lockheeds shares 
simmons chief coup was persuading californias huge public 
employees pension fund known as calpers to vote its nearly 1 
percent of lockheed shares for him said lawrence harris a 
securities analyst at the bateman eichler hill richards brokerage 
in los angeles 
calpers has led institutional investors in pressing for more 
control over companies they own

president bushs nominee for top savings and 
loan regulator appears headed for defeat in the senate banking 
committee the committee chairman said thursday evening 
t timothy ryan jr a former senior labor department official 
nominated only last week met skepticism by committee demnocrats 
during a hearing wednesday on his nomination as director of the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
they questioned his lack of direct experience in banking and 
raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in his work as 
a private attorney after leaving government in 1983 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich after caucusing with 
democrats on his committee for several hours and consulting the 
senior republican sen jake garn of utah said in a senate speech 
he did not believe ryan would win the committees endorsement 
my sense of the canvass of the votes would be and its not 
complete i have not talked with every member directly but i 
think that based on the vote count that i have that there are not 
the votes to confirm this nomination riegle said 
riegle scheduled a vote friday an adverse recommendation from 
the committee could still be overturned on the floor but that 
would be unusual 
it was unclear whether the administration would withdraw ryans 
name it has had difficulty finding a candidate since m danny wall 
announced in early december that he would resign 
treasury spokeswoman desiree tuckersorini said officials had 
not discussed what they would do if the committee failed to endorse 
ryan 
we hope he will pass the committee we stand behind him 100 
percent she said 
the administration has portrayed ryan as an experienced manager 
who supervised 600 attorneys at the labor department and a tough 
enforcer who helped clean up corruption in the teamsters union 
central states pension fund 
democrats have express dismay with his lack of familiarity with 
the thrift industry and questioned whether 
at the department he helped hire former attorney general 
william b saxbe as independent counsel overseeing the pension 
fund after ryan left the government saxbe joined ryans firm 
bringing with him hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the 
fund

the first 747 jumbo jet which changed the look 
of jet travel with its huge size and distinctive upperdeck hump 
has flown into retirement boeing commercial airplane group said 
the redandwhite jumbo jet rolled off the assembly line near 
everett on sept 30 1968 made its first flight on feb 9 1969 
and won certification on dec 30 that year 
boeing has used the aircraft as a test plane for 21 years now 
the city of everett is being donated to the museum of flight in 
seattle 
pan american world airways signed the first contract for 747s 
ordering 25 for a total of 525 million today that amount would 
buy four of the jets boeing said 
the test planes only break in service was from october 1983 to 
august 1986 when it was in storage in las vegas it was then sent 
to wichita kan where it was used as a mockup for two 747200s 
that the air force will use to carry the us president and his 
staff 
the plane had only 5208 hours of flight time thats very low 
considering a jet in normal commercial service flies 3000 to 4000 
hours every year company spokesman tom cole said 
but it was tough stuff they were always putting it into dives 
and stalls he said 
the plane officially known as ra001 had a short final flight 
wednesday about 25 miles from boeing field in seattle to paine 
field where 747s are built near everett 
there its engines will be taken off and returned to pratt amp 
whitney which owns them followed by some restoration work 
eventually the plane will be displayed at the museums 
restoration facility or at a new largeaircraft interpretive center 
the museum hopes to build at paine field said cindy upthegrove 
the museums special events manager 
about 800 747s are in service around the world boeing said

former control data corp chief robert price 
whose fouryear reign yielded 9239 million in net losses has 
received 424 million in retirement and severance pay and will get 
450000 a year under a threeyear consulting contract it was 
disclosed wednesday 
in addition price received 107 million in bonus income during 
the past 3 years under two separate stock award programs and 
possibly could get more bonus money under control datas longterm 
performance incentive plan 
his pension good for the rest of his life will bring another 
300000 a year 
the compensation was detailed in the companys annual proxy 
statement distributed wednesday to stockholders analysts and the 
media in advance of the companys may 2 annual shareholder meeting 
roger redmond a stock analyst for minneapolisbased piper 
jaffray amp hopwood inc said prices compensation is excessive 
considering the computer companys performance since price took 
control in january 1986 
lawrence perlman replaced price as chief executive officer in 
january after the company posted a net loss of 6804 million in 
1989 
the company posted 21 million in profits in 1988 and 1987 but 
suffered a net loss of 2645 million in 1986 
control data has a history of awarding bonuses arbitrarily 
and that is absolutely incorrect redmond said any and all 
bonuses should be tied with stockholder equity and company 
performance 
its unconscionable that these senior executives are receiving 
that much compensation redmond said 
stockholders and employees complained about the companys 
severance agreements at last years annual meeting booing retired 
deputy chairman norbert berg when he was introduced 
berg still a member of the board of directors received nearly 
4 million under a severance package while the company earned a 
mere 17 million in 1988 
price defended such severance agreements at last years meeting 
what kind of company is it that doesnt honor its contracts 
he asked 
price did not return a phone call to his office wednesday he 
retired as an employee on march 15 but the company is providing 
him office space and secretarial support under his consulting 
contract the proxy statement said he also remains chairman of the 
board 
control data spokesman frank ryan said prices severance package 
was part of a contract signed in 1986 when the company was faced 
with an arduous restructuring 
certainly over the life of these contracts the stockholders 
and bob would have liked to have seen better performance ryan 
said but having a contract that protects against the risks and 
takes into account the tasks before the individual the contracts 
do not seem inappropriate 
prices contract brought him severance pay of 2774800 an 
amount equal to three times his final annual base pay of 873600 
and the amount of his accrued vacation according to the proxy 
statement 
he also was entitled to 163054 in annual supplemental pension 
but elected to receive the lump sum present value of the benefits 
1469932 upon his retirement the supplemental pension is above 
prices normal annual pension of 300000 ryan said 
price also had earned options to buy 120000 shares of control 
data common stock as of dec 31 1989 but the option price of 
2227 a share is above the stocks current trading price of 19 to 
20 a share making the options worthless 
but if the stock price rises substantially in the next year 
price would stand to get additional bonus money under the companys 
longterm performance incentive plan the proxy statement said
