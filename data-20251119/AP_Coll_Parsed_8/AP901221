gradually now comes the hurt to the children of chernobyl as 
the silent hidden blight starts appearing theyre beginning to 
get help from scattered groups of american christians 
the situation is bad and its going to get worse said the 
rev paul s moore whose new york city radio ministry citihope 
is raising money for medical supplies 
in a real way it means giving children back their lives he 
said 
a threatening shadow fell over inhabitants of the ukraine and 
byelorussia after the fiery rupture of a soviet nuclear plant on 
april 26 1986 at chernobyl filled the atmosphere with radioactive 
particles 
but only lately has the extent of the effects of that accident 
begun to appear with the impact increasing with time 
pyotr k kravchanka foreign affairs minister of the 
byelorussian republic on which 70 percent of the contamination 
settled said that at the outset the resulting volume of cancer and 
related cases could not be predicted 
we are now seeing only the beginning stage he said in an 
interview citing a doubling of thyroid ailments among children a 
sevenfold increase in anemia cases and a rise in leukemia cases 
the peak volume of sickness has not yet come he said 
scientists project the mounting toll will hit its high point in 
199697 he said but treatment is severely limited by a lack of 
medicine and diagnostic equipment 
a fifth of byelorussias population or 22 million people 
including 800000 children have become innocent victims of 
chernobyl the hostages of postponed effects of radiation he 
told the united nations general assembly 
as the disasters effects grow several small independent 
american religious and other groups as well as ethnic communities 
of byelorussians and ukrainians in some cities have begun limited 
steps to provide medical aid 
a catalyzing influence for such efforts resulted from moores 
visit in september to minsk capital of byelorussia where he 
observed firsthand the spreading marks of radiation to which 
children are most vulnerable 
you cant realize the gravity of it until you experience it 
until flesh touches your flesh and you go through the hospitals 
with the doctors and see the wasting bodies of the children he 
said most americans are not aware of the extent of the 
implications now and in the future 
he said he was told 37000 byelorussian children are being 
treated for precancerous conditions with more cases diagnosed 
daily but he added the supply of medicine is so inadequate that 
only 15 percent can be saved compared to the 85 percent who could 
be saved with sufficient medicine 
soviet pharmaceutical supplies limited and chiefly from east 
germany were said to have been disrupted by german reunification 
moore also an assistant minister at st georges church in 
manhattan said that through sponsorships enlisted on his radio 
ministry his project so far has supplied 650000 worth of 
methotrexate and other anticancer drugs and vitamins 
he said that as a result treatment has been started on 400 
byelorussian children and that by early january he expects to 
have rounded up enough medicine to increase that number to 1000 
moore said pharmaceutical companies will provide the drugs for 
such charitable purposes at 5 percent of costs meaning that the 
usual cost of 4000 to 5000 for two or three years of treatment 
to bring a cancerous condition into remission is reduced to 100 to 
200 per child 
the rev michael christensen of san franciscos hamilton united 
methodist church is coordinator of moores expanding project 
paul maxey associate executive director of interchurch medical 
assistance of new windsor md which serves 15 relief agencies as 
a liaison with drug companies in obtaining medicines for such 
causes said 
reaction to the chernobyl situation has been slow because of 
the incubation time before the effects show up churches have not 
been challenged to do much about it but it has now become a very 
distressing problem 
he said a few mostly local groups now are getting involved 
in richmond va the rev paul f mccleary director of the 
christian childrens fund said his group began sending aid to the 
soviets as a result of a factfinding trip with a virginia medical 
team to minsk in midnovember 
its a very grave situation he said adding that a 
prechristmas shipment of medicine was being assembled 
its a very large medical catastrophe and assistance is needed 
to improve the diagnosis process and start treatment earlier he 
said 
its the first instance of a major nuclear catastrophe 
something entirely new in the human experience its important that 
we monitor it and track the record so if another such event occurs 
we cope with it more properly 
its a very significant activity for us and all mankind

lets face it the tuba gets no respect 
it makes people laugh they call it tubby the tuba it 
reminds them of beergarden polkas danced by fat men in shorts and 
funny hats or blaring bands that strut frantically across football 
fields at halftime 
the tuba is big and ungainly a plumbers nightmare of tubes and 
valves and in the wrong hands alas it sounds like a monstrous 
whoopee cushion 
the derision troubles harvey phillips 61 a music professor at 
indiana university and renowned virtuoso who was once hailed as 
the paganini of the tuba 
for the past 40 years he has led a oneman crusade to rid the 
world of prejudice against the tuba and improve its tattered image 
the tuba is a noble regal majestic instrument that has been 
misunderstood for too long he said 
thus it was that concertgoers arriving at the kennedy center one 
night this week were surprised to find 200 tuba players on a 
makeshift stage in the chandeliered grand foyer oompahing their 
way through silent night under phillips baton 
shiny bass tubas euphoniums and sousaphones some festooned 
with red ribbons and bows played familiar christmas carols with a 
deepthroated sound that phillips likens to a male glee club 
without words 
it was the latest in a series of tubachristmas concerts that 
phillips has sponsored around the country every holiday season 
since 1974 he also presides over annual octubafests at indiana 
university and tubacamps for young musicians at his 
tubaranch home near bloomington ind 
he is especially annoyed by elitists who dont believe tuba 
players are really serious musicians and in fact may be somewhat 
dumb 
i dont take my instrument any less seriously than a surgeon 
regards his scalpel or james galway his flute he said would 
heifetz have been any less a genius if he had played the tuba 
instead of the violin 
when phillips entered the juilliard school of music in 1950 he 
ws appalled by the lack of serious music written for the tuba 
while other students were playing a mendelssohn violin concerto or 
mozart clarinet sonata phillips was learning rocked in the 
cradle of the deep 
it was not until 1954 when english composer ralph vaughan 
williams wrote a concerto for bass tuba that the solo voice of 
the tuba was brought from the back of the orchestra to the front 
phillips said 
since then several hundred solo works have been written for the 
tuba they include 127 commissioned for phillips who has played 
from carnegie hall to the ringling bros and barnum amp bailey 
circus 
in 1960 he said there was only one fulltime college teacher 
of the tuba in the united states today there are 93 and next 
year the first international competition for solo tuba will be 
held in geneva 
phillips flew here from rockefeller center in new york where 
his tubachristmas concerts have become an annual holiday 
tradition from washington the monthlong road show of 124 cities 
in 33 states takes tubachristmas to columbus chicago atlanta 
and nashville tenn this week and to the season finale in dallas 
on christmas eve 
no auditions are held and no tuba player is turned away any 
local enthusiast who brings his instrument and pays a 5 fee can 
join the fun after a onehour rehearsal 
youngsters love the tuba phillips said if i fill a room 
with musical instruments the kids invariably run to the tubas 
at a concert in milwaukee i asked the children what is the 
greatest instrument in the world and they all yelled the tuba 
so i say to parents your christmas shopping can be simple just 
make sure they get a tuba for christmas

us officials are worried that the departure 
of eduard a shevardnadze as soviet foreign minister will slow 
progress in ussoviet relations and perhaps trigger further 
disintegration of the central government in moscow 
this is not a very nice christmas present from moscow said 
one senior us official who emerged thursday from meetings at the 
state department to discuss shevardnadzes resignation which sent 
shock waves through moscow and western capitals alike 
despite public reassurances that the resignation wont change 
the course of superpower relations there is private consternation 
among leading official analysts and more open concern expressed by 
experts outside the government 
john d steinbruner a soviet specialist and director of foreign 
policy studies at the brookings institution called the move a 
severe polarization of the soviet domestic situation 
communist hardliners are pushing soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to get tough with nationalists and radical reformers they 
accuse of trying to split the union the soviet president has 
threatened to use the kgb and police to restore order in the 
increasingly unstable environment aggravated by widespread food 
shortages and a breakdown in supply lines 
youve got the radical intellectuals and nationalists on one 
side arguing sovereignty and some conservatives arguing 
traditional crackdown with gorbachev there in the middle trying to 
preserve the union on reasonable terms steinbruner said 
the middle is a dangerous place to be and shevardnadze is one 
of the few figures who can bring serious political credibility to 
that middle position 
if the foreign ministers resignation proves to be an 
indication that this middle position is not viable then that is an 
alarming sign the brookings scholar said 
a leading official analyst of soviet and east european affairs 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said there is concern that 
this is going to add momentum to the disintegrative forces a sign 
that theyve now hit the central government and the governments 
basically just going to fall apart 
shevardnadze was a party boss in his native georgia and a 
neophyte in foreign affais only six years ago but he took a 
commanding position on the world stage by shucking traditional 
soviet ideology and negotiating tactics in search of a new role as 
a dealmaker and an applicant for soviet membership in the world 
community of nations 
his informal personable style won the confidence of his 
likeminded us counterpart secretary of state james a baker 
iii who said thursday i am proud to call this man a friend 
it will be difficult for any successor to regain that level of 
credibility and confidence 
the state department source said us officials had been tipped 
by the soviets that yevgeni primakov a gorbachev adviser and 
foreign policy emissary was in line to replace shevardnadze if he 
were named prime minister or vice president in gorbachevs promised 
government reorganization 
before gorbachev brought him into the kremlin primakov was 
director of one of several soviet academic institutes on 
international affairs and specialized in the arab world he has 
made numerous visits to the united states 
he doesnt like americans he never has and our judgment is 
hes not as intelligent one state department official said he 
doesnt have the intellectual depth that shevardnadze had despite 
his academic credentials hell be a more difficult man to deal 
with 
the official acknowledged that the same might be said of 
practically anyone in gorbachevs inner circle shevardnadze 
perhaps even more than gorbachev himself was admired by his us 
counterparts for his candid statements about past soviet mistakes 
and his willingness to bargain for the sake of winning agreements 
on tough arms control issues 
shevardnadze had flexibility and enjoyed gorbachevs 
confidence and felt able to improvise on the spot sometimes to 
solve problems the analyst said noting those are rare qualities 
in the history of soviet foreign policy leadership 
primakov the source added is much more cautious and 
ponderous a more bureaucratic figure than shevardnadze 
steinbruner disputed the contention that primakov is 
antiamerican but he acknowledged that no one in the soviet 
hierarchy has shevardnadzes credibility with western leaders 
ilya prizel a soviet affairs specialist at the johns hopkins 
school of advanced international studies took a more pessimistic 
view 
he suggested gorbachev is following the course taken by the late 
nikita s khrushchev who in the 1960s said he faced a choice 
between reform and giving up his power base khrushchev chose to 
cement his power prizel said 
the soviet leader eventually was overthrown in a palace coup 
carried out by his fellow communist party chieftains 
its a very depressing thing prizel said citing a series 
of reformist gorbachev aides and advisers who have left or been 
sidelined in recent months gorbachev has outlived his ability to 
reform

years as chief of the ap moscow bureau now covers foreign affairs

secretary of state james a baker iii banking 
on assurances from moscow says he expects ussoviet cooperation 
in foreign policy to stay on course after the departure of foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
baker at a news conference thursday said soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev sent reassurances that soviet foreign policy 
will not change as shevardnadze leaves 
since the united statessoviet partnership serves the interest 
of peace internationally and the process of reform domestically 
we of course expect that to be the case and we will be watching 
events closely in the weeks ahead baker said 
that means the bush administration intends to continue working 
with the soviets to reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles to try to 
end wars in afghanistan angola and cambodia and to force iraqs 
saddam hussein to reverse his annexation of kuwait 
however baker said shevardnadzes warning that rightwingers 
are pushing gorbachev toward dictatorship must be taken seriously 
the same critics who challenged gorbachev and shevardnadze on 
democratization at home also attacked their liberal policies in 
eastern europe and on german unification 
those policies were appreciated in washington and other western 
capitals west germany absorbed east germany once moscows closest 
ally and the unified country is in nato the other old soviet 
allies in eastern and central europe are groping toward democracy 
it was not clear whether shevardnadze resigned to try to stop 
the hardliners or whether he concluded that they had already 
succeeded in deflecting gorbachev from the path of reform and saw 
no point in staying 
only two weeks ago in houston baker advised shevardnadze that 
heavyhanded treatment of restive nationalities and economic 
profiteers could boomerang against the aid the administration had 
decided to give the soviets 
shevardnadzes credentials in the united states were not 
tarnished as gorbachev tried to cope with food shortages 
separatists in the baltics georgia and moldavia and with 
resistance from the right 
he has come across consistently as a truly committed 
democrat said a knowledgeable us official who requested 
anonymity he said perestroika economic reconstruction and 
democratization cannot be separated he was determined to remain 
true to that and he was careful not to attack gorbachev 
baker worked smoothly with shevardnadze appreciating his candor 
as well as his commitment to reform 
he was in the forefront of the new thinking in foreign policy 
and democratization at home baker said in a tribute and i 
think he that he has earned the respect of leaders all around the 
world 
together they put the finishing touches on a treaty to reduce 
nato and warsaw pact tanks and other nonnuclear weapons across the 
expanse of europe the accord was signed in paris last month 
they came close to agreement on a far more significant treaty to 
cut us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines by about 30 percent overall president bush and 
gorbachev have scheduled a moscow summit feb 1113 to sign the 
pact after it is finished 
in the meantime the carefully coordinated squeeze play on iraq 
is entering a critical stage the un security council at the 
behest of the united states and with soviet support has set jan 15 
as the deadline for the withdrawal of all iraqi troops 
shevardnadze went along with the threat to use force with 
evident reluctance and the soviets are not contributing troops to 
any operation against iraq 
without soviet support the us campaign to reverse the august 
invasion would have run out of steam by now baker said thursday 
that he did not foresee any change 
president gorbachev himself has assured president bush on 
several occasions that the soviets do not intend to diverge from 
the united nations position on this issue baker said

army lt gen calvin ah waller was stating 
the simple truth when he said he will still be short of troops to 
start an offensive ground war against iraq on jan 15 some former 
military leaders say 
but waller deputy commander of operation desert shield may 
have served other purposes as well 
one former government official says waller may have been 
underscoring the militarys deep misgivings about taking on an 
entrenched iraqi army in kuwait iraq won the eightyear war 
against iran largely by staying on the defense and mowing down 
charging iranians 
and the view was expressed in washington that intentionally or 
not waller relieved some of the pressure on president bush to act 
against iraqs saddam hussein if iraq hasnt withdrawn from kuwait 
by the jan 15 deadline set by the united nations 
bush has created expectations by stressing that iraq must 
fully withdraw by the un deadline now waller says it would 
be prudent to wait a month or more 
about 280000 us forces have been sent to the gulf region 
with the buildup expected to reach 430000 
there may be great machinations behind all this said 
retired lt gen william odom but it has long been clear to 
me that a march date was about all we could meet to hear waller 
say that comes as no surprise 
odom is a former army chief of staff for intelligence who headed 
the intelligencegathering national security agency in the reagan 
administration 
lawrence j korb assistant secretary of defense for manpower in 
the reagan administration said of waller a former military 
assistant i think he was just telling the truth 
korb said military commanders in desert shield in calling for 
more forces are avoiding promising an easy victory that we can 
whip the iraqis with two men and a small boy 
robert hunter who was director of middle east affairs on the 
national security council in the reagan white house said wallers 
remarks also may have reflected the militarys misgivings about 
getting involved in what is bound to be a costly war 
and retired army col harry g summers jr a distinguished 
fellow at the army war college said wallers comment made us 
intentions all the more uncertain for saddam 
it clouds the issue and it should be cloudy he said 
waller told reporters in saudi arabia on wednesday that his 
forces will not be ready to go to war on jan 15 
if bush wanted to attack then he said he would advise the 
president defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that until our full 
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate 
hostile activities 
even though cheney said much the same thing although less 
forcefully the statement appeared to undercut bushs strategy of 
steadily increasing pressure on saddam 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater sought to brush it 
off thursday saying it never hurts to build in a little 
uncertainty about what our intentions are as it relates to jan 
15 
i never expected anybody to go to war on jan 16th said 
jack n merritt a retired fourstar general what i heard was a 
guy out in the field whose subjective judgment was that he 
didnt think he had enough force to do what he was supposed to 
do 
summers author of a book critical of the militarys strategy in 
vietnam said senior officers have taken pains not to be overly 
optimistic about warfare in the persian gulf 
the defense department has been very careful about not 
creating another credibility gap he said recalling gen bruce 
palmers conclusion after vietnam that the senior militarys 
cando attitude misled the white house

researchers in california and utah report in 
studies published today new advances toward isolating the gene 
linked to a susceptibility to breast cancer in some families 
maryclaire king leader of a laboratory group at the university 
of california berkeley said her studies have narrowed the search 
for the breast cancer gene to a specific chromosome 
comparing the work to a needleinahaystack quest king said in 
an interview were now at the point of knowing the handful of 
hay in which this needle lies as opposed to having to search 
through the whole haystack 
a research group at the university of utah health sciences 
center meanwhile reported finding that proliferative breast 
disease a condition known to be a precursor of breast cancer has 
been found to be inherited in some families 
based on this study we believe the genetic susceptibility to 
breast cancer is more common than previously thought said dr 
mark h skolnick of the utah group 
both groups have been researching families with large numbers of 
breast cancer cases their studies are published today in the 
journal science 
skolnick and king said their studies could lead eventually to 
tests enabling women with known breast cancer risks based on their 
family histories to be treated even before the smallest of tumors 
have formed 
the longterm goal of this kind of work is to try to develop 
diagnostic techniques that will allow the detection of aberrant 
cells in the breast at an extremely early stage said king 
those cells could be removed and the woman go on with a normal 
life 
with such tests used widely she said it would be possible 
that there would be no mortality from breast cancer 
such clinical applications of the two studies however are many 
years away king said 
in the california project the scientist said her team studied 
more than 400 members of 23 families with a total of 146 cases of 
breast cancer breast cancer in those families she said tended to 
develop at an early age and often involved both breasts 
by analyzing blood samples and then comparing genetic patterns 
king said the scientists found nine families in which 
susceptibility to the early onset of breast cancer was linked to 
chromosome 17q one of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells 
now she said the researchers are attempting to find the 
specific breast cancer gene within that chromosome 
king said that even when the gene is found it will not be the 
final story in inherited breast cancer risk she said a combination 
of genes is involved in developing the disease and that still other 
genes may permit the cancer to grow and proliferate 
furthermore the scientist said most breast cancers may have no 
inherited genetic component 
people need to understand that having a mother with breast 
cancer does not mean it runs in the family she said families 
such as those studied where early breast cancer occurs often are 
really really rare said king less than 5 percent of breast 
cancer patients are in such families 
skolnick said his researchers studied 103 women from 20 families 
in which there were at least two close blood relatives with breast 
cancer the studies included mammography and the removal of cells 
for laboratory and genetic analysis control studies were done on 
31 women who did not come from breast cancerprone families 
thirtyfive percent of the women in families where breast cancer 
was common had laboratory evidence of proliferative breast disease 
or pbd skolnick said 
among women in the control study only 13 percent had pbd the 
study demonstrates that there is an inherited component in 
developing pbd he said 
skolnick said the study also suggests that the inherited risk 
for breast cancer thought previously to be a factor primarily in 
families in which cases develop in young women of childbearing age 
and in women who develop cancer in both breasts may also be a 
factor in families where the cancer develops only in older women 
our study shows that there is a significant genetic component 
for unilateral single breast postmenopausal breast cancer as 
well he said for this reason skolnick said the inherited risk 
of breast cancer may be more common than previously believed it 
will take more studies to prove this however 
science which published the studies is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

battering at home may do more to turn on 
aggressive behavior in a child than any other domestic factor 
including poverty divorce or marital violence said a study 
published today 
three psychology professors reported in the journal science that 
a study that followed 309 children from age 4 into kindergarten 
showed that those who were physically abused by an adult at home 
were more likely to be aggressive or even violent in difficult 
social situations 
john e bates of indiana university said the study attempted to 
eliminate from consideration all factors but abuse and found that 
battering by an adult is the most powerful influence by far on how 
a child learns to cope with society 
included in the study were children from both rural and urban 
areas from different social and economic levels and from areas of 
two states indiana and tennessee boys and girls were about equal 
in the group 83 percent were white 16 percent were black and 1 
percent were of other races 
abused children were identified by physical examinations and 
interviews with parents and children levels of aggression were 
determined by a number of tests including evaluations by 
kindergarten teachers who didnt know if the children had been 
abused and by interviews with classmates 
additionally the studied children were shown videotapes of 
social situations and asked to describe how they would respond if 
the situations happened to them 
the results bates said shows that abuse predicts 
aggressiveness even after you control for factors such as social 
class family disruption and exposure to spousal violence 
he said the study showed that youngsters who had been abused 
were more apt to respond to all provocative social situations in an 
aggressive manner that virtually ignored signals that such a 
response was not appropriate 
gregory s pettit an associate professor of family and child 
development at auburn university and a coauthor of the study said 
one videotape depicted a boy on the playground being hit on the 
head by a ball 
a child with no history of abuse would first assume that he was 
beaned accidentally and would try to determine if that was the 
case a child with a history of abuse however would be more apt 
to assume immediately that being hit by the ball was an intentional 
attack and would respond aggressively 
bates called such a response typical of a social information 
processing deficit common in the abused children 
the deficit he said would make the child inattentive to cues 
that tell the real intent of an accidental act it also would tend 
to make the child think that aggressive behaviors would be 
effective in many social situations where its not appropriate 
and bates said the deficit would tend to make an abused child 
more apt to assume that another persons intent was hostile 
instead of benign 
not all abused kids develop these unfortunate ways of looking 
at a social situation he said how that happens we dont 
know but that is a hopeful thought an abused kid is not 
necessarily lost 
the study has advanced to where some of the children are in the 
third grade although data from beyond kindergarten hasnt been 
processed bates and pettit said they have seen nothing so far that 
would cause them to change their conclusions from the kindergarten 
year 
bates said the children would be followed through school and 
its hoped the study will answer a major question can we take 
abused kids and help them to think in a more productive way about 
provocative situations and then avoid the expression of 
aggression 
a third author of the study was kenneth a dodge of vanderbilt 
university

expected to fight a war but they are prepared to do their job 
whether it is flying an f15 fighter firing a howitzer or washing 
uniforms 
youve got a more educated a more physically fit type of army 
youre working with now said estes a wiry 42yearold 
infantryman from nashville tenn who was in vietnam near the 
height of us involvement in 196768 
morales at an alltime high confidence is real high he 
said watching topoftheline m1a1 tanks rumble off the cargo ship 
cape inspiration 
brig gen steven l arnold assistant chief of staff in the 
army forces central command served two tours in vietnam he said 
the army had recovered from that traumatizing conflict and 
subsequent antagonism to the military 
this is as good a peacetime army as i think has ever 
existed he said i know people are saying the troops are 
complaining soldiers are always complaining about things but 
thats not an indication of morale 
as marine cpl ed walsh of las vegas put it if a marine aint 
griping he aint happy walsh 21 is with the 1st marine 
expeditionary force 
arnold said the key to morale is whether soldiers willingly do 
the right thing without being told and do it well thats 
discipline and a disciplined force is really a highmorale force 
when you have forces that are challenged and youre giving 
them the type of training that meets their expectations i think 
you see a lot of high morale you see it here 
one yardstick for morale is mental health 
weve had very little business said capt frank mullins 
54 of mobile ala a psychologist with the mental health unit at 
the us navys fleet no 5 hospital morale has been excellent 
from what weve seen people can complain a lot bitch and carry 
on but morale can be very high 
desert shield is the biggest us military operation since 
vietnam where us strength reached 545000 at its peak more than 
240000 american personnel now are in the gulf and 200000 more 
will be in place by midjanuary 
complaints in a force of that size are inevitable two of the 
biggest problems are monotony and few escapes 
this is a prison you cant go anywhere moaned lance cpl 
steven jenkins 24 of neptune nj a maintenance man with a 
marine air wing 
army sgt kenneth hetzer 32 had other complaints after nearly 
three months in a forward position with the 75th field artillery 
brigade soldiers had holes in their boots werent allowed to use 
the telephone and had to pay 3 for a block of ice 
walsh said that despite the griping were really locked on 
if war comes itd be like uncoiling a snake theres nothing 
that can stop us 
attitudes differ in front and rear units and between fulltime 
soldiers and the reserve and national guard units mobilized at 
short notice 
morale was very high and it got higher as we got closer to the 
kuwaiti border said rep robert j lagomarsino a california 
republican who visited the troops last month with a 20member 
congressional delegation 
the more primitive the conditions the higher the morale he 
said the people in the more primitive conditions are the combat 
infantry the combat marine forces that were trained in the desert 
so they know what theyre doing 
army sgt 1st class thomas melton 39 of florence ala said 
the guys up there know theyve got a mission down here its 
just sit and wait for your equipment to come in and get to your 
location its very boring to sit around waiting thats the big 
problem 
melton has traveled extensively in saudi arabia as part of the 
207th military intelligence brigade 
in the words of marine cpl carlin walters 21 of vidor texas 
the boredom gets pretty strenuous itd be better just to go 
ahead and get it over with 
the marines all in forward positions near the kuwaiti border 
and army combat units like the 82nd airborne division have 
reputations for high morale in bad conditions 
at the other extreme are rear units with serious problems like 
the 1241st postal unit from the alabama army national guard 
weve got a lot of soldiers ready to go home said sgt 
michael smith 32 of montgomery the morale around heres at the 
very bottom if things were different and we were civilians wed 
probably strike 
for most soldiers the toughest thing is not knowing when they 
will go home 
either an operation or a gohome date is going to boost 
morale said 1st lt bruce lake 29 of newport news va a 
platoon leader with the 24th infantry division 
with the usual gi diversions banned the military has tried to 
keep morale up with sports movies and music 
mail is the biggest booster 
mail equals morale lake said 
veterans like estes who never heard a word of support from the 
american public while fighting in vietnam are overwhelmed by the 
flood of letters his countrymen send to any serviceman in saudi 
arabia 
many gis have found new pen pals including churches clubs and

the next soviet foreign minister will face a 
different world than eduard shevardnadze took on five years ago 
but the possible candidates are all dedicated followers of the 
policy their predecessor set down 
most work in the foreign ministry and have experiences as 
diplomats or scholars the kind of training shevardnadze lacked 
when mikhail s gorbachev appointed him in 1985 to take over for 
andrei gromyko 
unlike shevardnadzes crusade for change the last five years 
the next foreign minister will need to maintain and cultivate the 
soviet unions new role as a selfdeclared mediator rather than a 
supporter of revolution 
but the new foreign minister still will face old guard 
bureaucrats in some departments at the foreign ministry as he 
navigates new relations with israel the vatican japan south 
korea and germany among others 
the new foreign minister likely will have less financial and 
military aid to use as tool in his work with his government facing 
a flagging economy and budget deficit and he will need a knowledge 
of international economics with his leaders expecting more 
materially from its foreign friends 
heres a brief look at those considered prime candidates for the 
job

yevgeny m primakov pronounced preemahkof the first 
possible candidate mentioned in the soviet press after 
shevardnadzes resignation is a 61yearold former professor known 
most recently for his shuttle diplomacy to iraq looking for a 
solution in the persian gulf 
his effort failed after several meetings with iraqi leader 
saddam hussein reported to be a longtime friend but still it 
heightened his status as a savvy envoy who at least tried to deal 
with saddam 
before becoming a deputy foreign minister last year primakov 
was director of the prestigious institute for world economy and 
international relations an expert on the middle and far east as 
well as having a doctorate in economics primakov helped devise the 
new thinking foreign policy that shevardnadze was implementing 
primakov recently was criticized in the soviet press for being 
among officials who received new stateowned apartments without 
the usual waiting period but the news didnt seem to tarnish his 
image he also was mentioned as a possible candidate for the 
proposed new post of vice president

eduard a shevardnadze helped create a new era in 
soviet foreign policy marked by sweeping arms control agreements 
withdrawal from afghanistan and the collapse of communist regimes 
in eastern europe 
shevardnadze who announced thursday he would resign as foreign 
minister was a novice in international affairs when he was chosen 
by mikhail s gorbachev for the highprofile job in july 1985 
he had spent most of his political career working for as a 
communist party functionary 
diplomats and soviet watchers rushed to find out more about him 
he was fairly wellknown within the soviet union for battling crime 
and corruption in his native georgia where was in charge of the 
interior ministry and the police shevardnadze replaced the dour 
andrei a gromyko who was foreign minister for 28 years and was 
known as mr nyet for his tough negotiating stands 
the genial whitehaired shevardnadze quickly reversed gears 
implementing gorbachevs new thinking and promoting a less 
aggressive foreign policy aimed at lessening world tensions 
hardworking wellbriefed and quick to learn shevardnadze 
developed good working relations with his western counterparts and 
often warm personal relations 
it was gorbachev who won the nobel peace prize this year but it 
was the 62yearold shevardnadze who did much of the leg work 
former foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov referred to his 
globetrotting boss as the flying georgian 
like gorbachev shevardnadze is a pragmatist rather than an 
oldstyle hardline communist gorbachev recently credited 
shevardnadze a friend dating back to their teens with helping 
develop the concept of perestroika during a walk along a beach in 
march 1985 
we were walking and talking gorbachev told the communist 
party newspaper pravda we compared notes he said that 
everything was rotten through 
it was not easy for us to reach those conclusions gorbachev 
said we had seen a lot especially considering that we had seen 
the war so we had seen a lot and knew a lot 
together gorbachev and shevardnadze closed the final chapter in 
the cold war permitting the unification of germany and the return 
of democracy to eastern europe and improving relations with the 
united states 
they moved to heal rifts with japan south korea and isreal and 
cooled relations with hardline regimes such as cuba and north 
korea 
when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the soviet union was among 
the first to condemn its longtime ally iraq and call for 
unconditional withdrawal in an unprecedented display of superpower 
cooperation moscow has backed all un resolutions aimed at 
dislodging the iraqi forces 
shevardnadze made a real era in our international policies 
sergei stankevich moscows deputy mayor said in tribute thursday 
shevardnadze a teachers son was born in the village of mamati 
near the black sea on jan 25 1928 he rose through the ranks of 
the communist youth league and the georgian communist party 
became the republics interior minister in 1965 and its party 
leader in 1972 
georgia had a reputation for corruption and as interior minister 
shevardnadze gained national attention for his key role in one of 
the republics most infamous examples of nepotism and bribery 
the case involved otari lazishvili who used a personal 
friendship with a former soviet general prosecutor to protect 
numerous illegal economic dealings 
shevardnadze gradually and successfully moved against lazishvili 
in 1972 he was then made party boss and continued the crackdown 
in his book russia author robert kaiser tells how 
shevardnadze tested his own regulations against exporting georgian 
produce he filled a car trunk with tomatoes dressed in peasant 
clothes and drove north toward the russian border bribing border 
guards en route a purge of the border patrol ensued 
shevardnadze also pioneered the use of public opinion polls in 
the soviet union creating in 1966 an institute for the study of 
public opnion to provide reliable data about the extent of crime 
and corruption 
he promoted economic reform long before perestroika was a 
household word allowing some georgian enterprises such as 
restaurants to adopt elements of private enterprise 
in 1978 shevardnadze was appointed a nonvoting member of the 
national communist party politburo which until recent reforms 
wielded immense power over the government of the country as well as 
the party in 1985 after gorbachev took over leadership of the 
communist party shevardnadze was made a full member

the stunning resignation of foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze seems aimed at revitalizing the flagging soviet 
reform movement and prodding mikhail gorbachev into quashing an 
upsurge by reactionaries 
democrats you have scattered shevardnadze told 
parliamentarians near the end of a rambling 15minute speech 
shevardnadze did not directly criticize gorbachev but he 
confronted him with a clear choice to preserve the fragile 
democratic institutions of perestroika or to risk crushing them by 
strengthening presidential powers to cope with the political and 
economic crisis 
shevardnadze along with gorbachev and alexander yakovlev was 
one of the three pillars of the perestroika reform movement and it 
was not clear whether the policy could stand on two legs at this 
moment of crisis 
gorbachev is asking the congress of peoples deputies to yet 
again strengthen the powers of his presidency hardliners are 
lobbying for him to declare a state of emergency and rule by decree 
in troubled regions particularly the three secessionist baltic 
republics 
shevardnadze noted in his speech that hardliners had succeeded 
in pressuring gorbachev to replace the moderate interior minister 
vadim bakatin with a kgb and an army general and said he thought 
he was their next target 
implicit in his speech was the idea that gorbachev has 
capitulated to the conservatives an idea that enunciated later by 
other reformers 
i think mr gorbachev should take mr shevardnadzes statement 
as a real signal that he is going too far to the right said 
moscow deputy mayor sergei stankevich 
i think gorbachev should make a crucial choice whether hes 
going to continue the course he started in launching the reforms 
in 1985 said stankevich 
the hardliners that shevardnadze accused of persecuting him 
gleefully welcomed his departure 
its a step in the right direction said col viktor 
alksnis a leader of the movement that has been urging gorbachev to 
declare a state of emergency and rule by presidential decree in 
tense areas of the country 
shevardnadze called gorbachev a friend and soulmate but his 
resignation recalled an earlier parting of the ways 
the resignation recalled the fiery speech delivered by another 
reformer boris n yeltsin at a closed party meeting in late 1987 
gorbachev drummed yeltsin out of the ruling politburo and now 
yeltsin stands as his most formidable political foe as president 
of the russian federation 
yeltsin in his speech said gorbachev was jeopardizing the 
reforms by not doing battle with hardliners a point very similar 
to shevardnadzes 
and yeltsin and shevardnadze also angered gorbachev by 
surprising him 
for me shevardnadzes announcement came as a surprise that 
more than anything else to tell the truth hurts me gorbachev 
told the congress picking his words carefully 
yakovlev pointedly made himself available to reporters in the 
cavernous white marble foyer of the kremlin palace of congresses 
he said he regretted shevardnadzes resignation but called the 
georgians prediction of dictatorship nonsense 
i wouldnt jump to such a conclusion he said but there 
are signs that the extreme right is raising its head and they have 
a glint in their eyes 
another gorbachev ally fyodor burlatsky appeared on the floor 
of the congress and asked the body to vote to request that 
shevardnadze remain as foreign minister it complied on a 154052 
vote but a shevardnadze spokesman said that the decision was 
irreversible

bundledup preschoolers will sing carols in covent 
garden on saturday to remind shoppers that british journalist john 
mccarthy will spend another christmas as a hostage in lebanon 
the friends of john mccarthy hope the group of 4 year olds 
chosen because they have lived as long as he has been captive will 
catch news media attention and give a boost to the campaign for the 
television journalists release 
christmas is quite depressing because i think april is right 
round the corner said jill morrell mccarthys girlfriend at the 
time he was kidnapped on april 17 1986 
ms morrell also a television journalist has become the 
reluctant spokeswoman for the campaign and its 9000 members who 
lobby the british government and work to keep mccarthy 34 and two 
other british hostages in the public eye 
its an uphill battle ms morrell 33 said in a recent 
interview at a north london restaurant were a small 
campaignso it takes an effort to get noticed 
gunmen kidnapped mccarthy on his way to catch a plane home from 
beirut no group has ever claimed responsibility for the 
kidnapping 
the mccarthy campaign has also taken up the causes of church of 
england envoy terry waite taken captive on jan 20 1987 and 
retired pilot jack mann who disappeared may 12 1989 
a fourth briton alec collett disappeared in 1985 a group that 
claimed to be holding him released a videotape purporting to show 
collett hanged but his death has never been confirmed 
there are nine other western hostages in lebanon including 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press anderson was kidnapped march 16 1985 and has been in 
captivity the longest 
a small woman with a soft voice sparkling blue eyes and an easy 
smile ms morrell also displays a steely resolve that gained her 
meetings with palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
and nabih berri leader of amal the largest shiite militia 
by staging media events to mark mccarthys kidnapping and his 
birthday on nov 27 and acting as spokeswoman for his cause ms 
morrell has made mccarthys name and herself familiar to millions 
of britons 
but the last four months of the campaign which has now lasted 
longer than she and mccarthy were together have been particularly 
tough 
britains renewed diplmatic relations with iran and syria have 
brought few results 
false rumors of mccarthys imminent freedom have been especially 
frustrating after the euphoria surrounding the release of 
mccarthys fellow captive brian keenan on aug 25 
keenan a teacher from belfast northern ireland spent months 
with mccarthy and gave ms morrell a detailed picture of his life 
much of it very cruel 
it was like having john back hearing about him he is coping 
very well but the treatment and the misery and the pain some of it 
wasnt pleasant she said her voice trailing off as she sipped a 
cup of tea 
after three years together ms morrell and mccarthy had been 
about to buy an apartment and were thinking about marriage 
now she said she thought that when mccarthy was freed he might 
want to meet other women 
like keenan he might want to experience everything with new 
enthusiasm and make up for lost time

when candidates and parties face off in 
mexican elections the battle often doesnt end at the ballot box 
fraud charges fly for weeks after 
four state elections over the past two months showed the issue 
of fraud is as alive as ever despite president carlos salinas de 
gortaris pledges of clean elections reforms in electoral laws and 
promises from his institutional revolutionary party or pri that 
its changing its ways 
most accusations are aimed at the pri whose 61 years in power 
have made it synonymous with the government thus helping it 
continue to win 
what has changed since salinas took office two years ago is that 
clear opposition victories are recognized said luis h alvarez 
president of the national action party or pan 
the businessoriented national action party for many years was 
the only significant opposition and even so won few elections 
with the leftist democratic revolutionary party it remains one of 
the two main minority forces 
here one has to win by knockout by an ample majority 
alvarez said its more difficult when the vote is close 
now if we win and we show the documentation that we won they 
recognize our triumph but that shouldnt have to be 
we have to prove it the one who is robbed has to say they 
robbed me and then catch the thief and put him in jail 
for eight days the rightist opposition party and the governing 
party claimed victory in the close nov 25 mayoral race in merida 
if the pri wins its fraud if the opposition party wins 
its democracy yucatan state gov victor manzanilla schaffer 
was quoted as saying of the opposition allegations 
pans ana rosa payan cervera was declared the winner after 
recounts and the inclusion of six disputed ballot boxes local 
governing party officials then said they would challenge the 
results 
it is a significant advance not because the pan has won in 
merida but simply because they are giving the real results the 
government newspaper el nacional said in an editorial 
the 1979 electoral law reforms invited more opposition by making 
it easier for parties to register 
minority parties receive congressional seats according to the 
percentage of the vote they win and are guaranteed at least 100 of 
the 400 seats in the chamber of deputies 
before the central characteristic of the mexican elections 
was their lack of competitiveness today that characteristic has 
been reduced to the simple absence of credibility lorenzo meyer 
a leading historian at the prestigious colegio de mexico wrote in 
his frontpage column in the newspaper excelsior 
when results arent credible the opposition frequently protests 
by taking over the local city hall other times the results turn 
tragic 
riot police fired tear gas into a democratic revolutionary party 
rally dec 12 in tejupilco in the central state of mexico to 
protest fraud in municipal elections a month earlier three people 
were killed and dozens of others injured in the shooting that 
followed 
public discontent over fraud was so great by 1988 that salinas 
in his inaugural speech said the countrys most pressing political 
need was clean elections 
many mexicans still insist that salinas himself lost to 
cuauhtemoc cardenas who heads the democratic revolutionary party 
governing party documents released this month say the 
legitimacy of suffrage is an unavoidable element of the new 
national consensus it is the final hour for noncompetitive 
electoral systems 
but arnoldo martinez verdugo a democratic revolutionary leader 
and alvarez allege the pri machinery merely went hightech 
computerized altering of voter registration lists has become the 
main means of rigging elections with opposition supporters 
disappearing and fictitious names being added they said 
the pri denies that and argues that opposition parties get the 
lists from the government for review before elections 
martinez said parties arent able to check the thousands of 
names when he complained that rolls for the mexico state elections 
carried the same names several times he got a meeting with the 
interior secretary but no change in the list he said 
under 1989 electoral reforms a new national voter registration 
list will be drawn up by next years congressional elections and 
meetings of electoral bodies will be public the new law sets fines 
and jail sentences for violations 
the pri dominated all four recent state elections its most 
notable loss outside merida being pans mayral victory in 
saltillo the coahuila state capital 
if recent elections had been spotless alvarez said the 
governing party still would do well simply from inertia custom 
but the opposition would have much greater presence than is 
officially recognized 
when turnout is high as it was in 1988 and this month in 
yucatan the governing party loses martinez said

with it and save her life a thousand dollars would buy pure milk 
for 100 babies during june july and august and save 50 of their

it would furnish an education for an ambitious boy i am told

yesterday you could move to a new hampshire town and live 
respectably two years on it you could rent madison square garden 
for one evening with it 
these days a christmas shopper could buy a giorgio armani suit 
at saks 18carat gold horse cuff links at tiffany a 4foot long 
stuffed tiger at fao schwarz toy store or 15 pounds of scottish 
salmon and 1282 bagels at zabars deli 
with a thousand dollars you can buy a 25foot oak tree a box 
seat at baseballs allstar game a faberge egg made of cocabolo 
wood a set of akg k1000 headphones or 869 subway tokens 
with the same amount the childrens aid society can send five 
homeless kids to camp for three weeks or two handicapped kids to 
camp for two weeks the coalition for the homeless can serve 685 
meals at grand central terminal 
a thousand dollars would buy 20 hours in a stretch limousine 
four sessions at la coupe hair salon with colorist daniel galvin 
three makeovers by ilana at il makiage it also would clothe 50

a gourmet might invite four guests to join her for dinner at the 
quilted giraffe where the menu promises dishes such as wasabi 
pizza with sashimi tuna and confit of duck with creamy garlic 
potatoes or if she doesnt mind eating while standing she could 
treat 500 people to a hot dog and a cup of juice at a papaya king 
stand 
a thousand dollars would cover a month in a phoenix house 
program for drug addicts but staffer steve dnistrian says money 
isnt the problem if someone gave us a million we couldnt open 
another treatment center nobody wants one on their block 
nor can a thousand dollars buy most of the things on old 
brysons list 
the median cost of a happy home in metropolitan new york is 
176700 but a thousand dollars will buy a doll house fully 
furnished wallpapered and carpeted at schwarz 
a thousand dollars would buy a weeks formula for 40 babies in 
covenant houses motherandchild unit but the average cost of a 
year at a private college or university is 13544 and madison

usx corp will pay a record 325 million fine 
to settle government allegations that it deliberately and 
repeatedly violated workersafety standards at two pennsylvania 
steel plants 
the settlement announced thursday stemmed from allegations 
leveled last year by the occupational safety and health 
administration the agency accused uss the steelmaking division of 
usx corp of more than 2000 federal job safety violations 
osha originally proposed a record 73 million fine for the 
violations which included hazards the government said were blamed 
for fatalities and not corrected the 325 million settlement is 
the largest workersafety fine to be collected eclipsing the 16 
million chrysler corp paid for violations at a plant in newark 
del 
the original osha citation charged that pittsburghbased usx 
permitted some of violations at the pennsylvania plants even 
though the company agreed two years ago to eliminate them at all 
its facilities 
in a statement the company said it agreed to pay the huge fine 
in part to avoid lengthy and costly legal battles over the 
governments allegations 
we continue to believe that both clairton works and fairless 
works are safe plants throughout our organization there is no 
higher priority than the safety and health of our people thomas 
w sterling vice president for employee relations at uss said in 
a statement 
clairton works near pittsburgh and fairless works near 
philadelphia were the two steel plants originally at issue in 
oshas complaint 
the united steelworkers of america the union representing about 
18000 usx workers cautioned against the significance of the 
settlement 
the agreement confirms the unions contentions that usx 
willfully allowed safety and health conditions in its facilities to 
deteriorate to such a point that workers were in serious danger 
a union statement said 
sterling said the company has already corrected several safety 
conditions at the two plants and other improvements were now being 
undertaken he said that during settlement negotiations with the 
government there had been many areas of substantial disagreement 
over the osha allegations 
the union said usx has refused to let the union review safety 
records or have an input on safety improvements 
this corporate attitude signals more battles over safety and 
health at a time when other steel companies have joined with the 
union in a variety of safetyrelated programs said andrew v 
lefty palm the unions chief negotiator in contract talks 
oshas original citation issued in november 1989 accused the 
company of failing to provide safe walking and working surfaces 
substandard cranesafety standards failure to properly guard 
machines and power transmission equipment noise violations 
failure to keep accurate records of injuries and illnesses 
structural flaws and violations of electricalsafety standards 
the citations stemmed from osha inspections that began earlier 
in 1989 following complaints from both the union and employees 
osha said three workers had died at the two plants in the two years 
leading up to the inspections there had been 17 such deaths since 
1972 
acting labor secretary roderick a dearment said all of usxs 
19000 workers would benefit from thursdays settlement because it 
calls for the company to take corporatewide action to strengthen 
safety and health protection 
gerard scannell an assistant secretary of labor who heads osha 
said the corporatewide safety programs will involve hearing 
conservation record keeping crane safety and hazard 
communications which involves employee training 
those programs will be implement at the two plants involved in 
the original complaint along with uss facilities in fairfield 
ala braddock pa dravosburg pa and chicago 
uss has also promised to meet with the state of indiana which 
operates its own oshaapproved occupational safety and health 
program to seek a similar agreement covering its gary ind 
works

a federal finance agency is holding up the 
reappointment of its regional board members pending an examination 
of conflictofinterest charges leveled by a member of congress 
steve britt executive director of the federal housing finance 
board said thursday that the agency is requiring additional 
financial disclosure documents from members of the 12 regional home 
loan banks which help finance the savings and loan industry 
in the meantime a hold has been put on routine reappointments 
to the regional boards he said 
the agencys action was disclosed on the same day that rep 
charles schumer dny complained about what he said were 
conflicts of interest of a member of the federal home loan bank of 
topeka 
richard h hughes did not fully repay loans from thrifts under 
his purview schumer said a dallas business executive hughes 
served on the board of the topeka bank from 1979 until he was 
replaced dec 13 because he had moved from the banks district 
during his tenure he received multiple loans totaling 6 
million from five different thrift institutions within the topeka 
region schumer said in a letter to daniel f evans chairman of 
the federal agency overseeing the topeka bank and 11 other similar 
institutions 
mr hughes case is a perfect example of what happens when the 
fox is assigned to guard the chicken coop and epitomizes the 
inherent potential for conflict of interest that fueled the ongoing 
thrift crisis schumer said in a statement 
schumer chairman of the house budget task force on urgent 
fiscal issues and a member of the house banking committee released 
a statement on hughes along with the letter to evans and a report 
by his staff on the alleged conflicts 
hughes didnt immediately return telephone messages left at his 
dallasbased business hinderliter corp his home telephone number 
is unlisted 
the 12 regional home loan banks raise money by issuing 
quasigovernment bonds and uses it to provide lowcost loans to 
sampls the topeka bank covers institutions in colorado kansas 
nebraska and oklahoma 
until august 1989 government regulators responsible for 
examining and supervising sampls worked for the regional banks with 
the passage of the sampl bailout law those regulators were 
reassigned to the office of thrift supervision an arm of the 
treasury department 
britt said the finance board was still examining whether to take 
action against hughes or whether the matter was under the 
jurisdiction of the thrift office 
schumer wrote to evans that the congressional staff report on 
hughes is simply shocking 
he said he will push for the adoption of stringent 
conflictofinterest regulations not just for all directors and 
officials of the federal home loan banks but for officials and 
directors of banks and sampls as well 
the staff report said throughout 1987 and 1988 mr hughes had 
delinquent loans outstanding at five thrift institutions in the 
topeka district which totaled in excess of 6 million 
the current status of these loans is not available but an 
estimated loss to the fslic federal savings and loan insurance 
corp in the amount of 28 million existed with respect to three 
loans at midamerica savings and loan association in tulsa 
okla the report said 
it also cited what it called potential conflicts of interest 
involving hughes attempts to acquire two sampls while serving on the 
regional board they are fidelity federal savings and loan 
association of claremore okla and valley federal savings and 
loan association of hutchinson kan 
and the report said in august 1986 hughes obtained employment 
for a business associate thomas sherman as tulsa branch manager 
at american federal savings and loan association of andarko okla 
sherman quit after board members of the sampl then under 
government management found him doing unrelated work for hughes 
schumer also criticized hughes for moving last year to dallas 
which is outside the topeka district without informing the topeka 
board

theyll still need their parents permission for 
field trips but teenagers in the nations largest school system 
could get condoms next year simply by asking 
schools chancellor joseph fernandez believes its a matter of 
life or death from aids new york city is home to about 3 percent 
of the nations 13 to 21yearolds but it has 20 percent of all 
aids cases in that age group 
we are sitting on a time bomb fernandez said 
if the board of education approves fernandezs proposal next 
month condoms would be available on request as early as next 
spring at 120 schools that enroll 261000 students 
it would be the nations most liberal public school aids policy 
said robin lewis spokeswoman for the center for population 
options a teen education and advocacy group based in washington 
a public hearing will be held jan 16 since october outspoken 
opponents and supporters lined up at board meetings to establish 
battle lines 
chancellor fernandez is showing an enormous amount of courage 
and leadership in tackling this issue said trish moylan 
torruella education director of the planned parenthood federation 
of america there are alarmingly high rates of hiv among 
adolescents in new york city particularly among african americans 
and hispanics 
opponents like monsignor john woolsey a roman catholic leader 
of the 75member coalition of concerned clergy say doling out 
condoms at schools would endorse promiscuity 
eleanor kelly a mother of three teenagers and past president 
of the conservative group parent roundtable agrees a 
contraceptive approach sends the wrong message and promotes a 
false sense of security thereby encouraging more of our young 
people to engage in highrisk behavior 
fernandez said hes sensitive to the moral dilemma but the 
issue goes beyond sex 
i dont disregard offhand their point of view as it being a 
moral issue said fernandez im saying that from my 
perspective with my chancellors hat on im looking at some very 
horrendous and frightening data that deals with kids living or not 
living 
the plan calls for trained volunteers to give away condoms at 
each public high school counseling or parental permission would 
not be required fernandez says that would scare kids away 
fernandez said new aids and sex education programs will continue 
to stress that abstinence is the only guaranteed method of avoiding 
the sexual transmission of aids 
but he says adults must be realistic the city health department 
estimates 80 percent of the new yorks young people have had sex by 
age 19 
i wish i could stand up in front of my students and tell them 
abstain and have the assurances that by teaching that that would 
happen he said but its not happening 
the city health department says that as of september 28 percent 
of the aids patients in the city or about 4200 people were ages 
20 to 29 many contracted it as teenagers 
a gallup poll for new york newsday showed 60 percent of new york 
adults approved of the condom plan among parents of children in 
public schools 54 percent approved and 39 percent disapproved 
elsewhere students can get condoms at high school health 
clinics in chicago baltimore and at the cambridge rindge and latin 
school clinic in massachusetts 
in mill valley calif a lawsuit from opponents stalled efforts 
to distribute condoms in october a school board in easton md 
rejected a plan for nurses to distribute condoms at two high 
schools 
the us centers for disease control in atlanta says 56 percent 
of high school students nationwide have had sex and about 20 
percent had four or more partners it estimates that 1 in every 200 
people ages 15 to 24 has the aids virus 
other sexually transmitted diseases are rampant in that age 
group and 1 million pregnancies a year result from the very same 
behavior said dr lloyd kolbe head of the aids school health 
education branch of the cdc 
each community needs to address its unique nature and concerns 
and make decisions based on epidemiology as well as values 
said kolbe on both sides of the argument people really are 
looking to do the best thing

the federal government in one of the largest 
efforts of its kind is developing a threepronged effort to wipe 
out lead poisoning among children 
the initiative will involve removing leadbased paint from 
millions of homes with a focus on lowerincome families 
monitoring lead hazards in homes where children have high levels of 
lead in their blood and offering nutritional guidance as well as 
treatment are proposed and tighter drinking water standards and a 
ban on lead plumbing fixtures may be adopted 
this is saying we can eliminate this disease we dont need 
children being poisoned by lead in the united states said dr 
sue binder chief of the lead poisoning prevention branch in the 
centers for disease control 
the initiative will require close cooperation among all levels 
of government and the private sector 
it will require societywide effort binder said in an 
interview thursday 
the plans may be the largest effort designed to eliminate an 
environmental disease she said but so far the cdcs 
recommendations represent only a strategic plan we still need to 
think through the things we need to do and the details of how to do 
them she said 
cdcs plans are being circulated among top officials at the 
department of health and human services the environmental 
protection agency also has not announced its plans but the 
department of housing and urban development laid out its plans last 
week 
lead poisoning can damage the nervous system and lead to mental 
retardation and other mental disorders it also can damage the 
liver lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and cause 
convulsions the effects cannot be reversed 
children are most susceptible because their nervous systems are 
still developing and are sensitive to lead binder said their 
bodes also absorb more lead than adults do and they are exposed 
to higher levels of lead because they so often put things 
including dirty hands in their mouths she said 
the hud plan focuses on removing leadbased paint from homes or 
covering it over so it is no longer a health threat the plan 
includes a financial assistance program and is designed to help 
lowerincome families with children 
a hud study found that young children are living in about 38 
million us homes that have peeling leadbased paint or lead in 
household dust 
financial details of the plan will be disclosed as part of the 
federal budget for next fiscal year which begins oct 1 1991 
the health and human services plan is expected to be out in a 
few months binder said 
not all of the details of the plan have been worked out she 
said but it is based on an advisory committees recommendation for 
more aggressive monitoring testing and treatment 
current guidelines say steps ranging from nutritional 
education to medical treatment should be taken when lead in the 
blood reaches 25 micrograms per deciliter 
the advisory committee said intervention should begin when 
levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter are reached different levels 
of monitoring and testing were recommended for levels up to 25 
micrograms at which point medical treatment should be considered 
according to the committees guidance 
the committee is saying that environmental intervention 
nutritional information and education about lead poisoning need 
to start at lower levels of lead in the blood binder said 
an estimated 250000 children had lead levels above 25 
micrograms in 1984 she said 
the epa is considering tightening federal standards for lead in 
drinking water and prohibiting the use of lead in plumbing fixtures 
like brass faucets agency sources said a decision would be made 
early next year 
the epa also is considering banning the disposal of lead 
batteries in conventional garbage dumps

mizraa looks like the ultimate 
kibbutz success story until you read the small print on the 
sausages liverwurst and frankfurters 
not of kosher type say the wrappers on many of the products 
that come out of mizraas meatprocessing plant its the 
kibbutzniks way of telling customers that the food contains pork 
now a law is before parliament that would outlaw the marketing 
of pork to the jewish public the result is an escalation of the 
long rancorous war between the secular public and the orthodox 
jewish parties which can make and break israeli governments 
orthodox jews revile pork as the most flagrantly nonkosher item 
on the list of edibles banned by biblical edict 
nonetheless it is widely available from butchers and 
restaurants which cater to the secular public but its a dish that 
dares not speak its name appearing instead under such euphemisms 
as special meat or white meat 
so why wait until now to take action we werent conscious 
until now of how much it was spreading says rabbi menachem 
porush whose agudat israel party is sponsoring the antipork law 
the truth is i dont even know what the thing looks like 
the ultramodern meat plant at mizraa in the jezreel valley in 
southern galilee earns 15 million a year 70 percent of the 
kibbutzs income 
mizraa doesnt breed pigs but it is israels largest source of 
nonkosher meat accounting for onefifth of the industry and 
exporting its delicacies all over the world 
it provides a living for thousands of people at the factory in 
the jezreel valley the pig farms owned by both jews and christians 
and mizraas nationwide chain of more than 300 delis 
moshe lapidot mizraas chief accountant says that beyond the 
money a principle is at stake 
we as secular free people living in a democratic country 
cant accept a small ultraorthodox minority trying to dictate 
fanatical religious laws whose time has passed he said over 
coffee in mizraas vast abundantly stocked deli 
the pig law is part of the religious legislation which prime 
minister yitzhak shamir promised as the price of adding agudat 
israels four parliamentary seats to his coalition 
but it has become a test case of how far the rabbis can enforce 
religious law 
already compromises are in the air agudat israel is now 
prepared to allow pork to be marketed in municipal districts with a 
christian population of more than 500 or 1000 
at first the religious camp refused to consider compensating 
those who stand to lose income rabbi avraham ravitz of the 
ultraorthodox torah flag party likens it to compensating pimps for 
income they would lose if prostitution were outlawed 
but this week the parliamentary committee was stopped in its 
tracks by a message from agriculture minister raphael eitan who 
insisted on discussing compensation 
shamir faces a tough choice the compensation bill could top 
500 million a fortune israel cannot afford but if the law is 
stalled he could lose agudat israels vital support 
the kibbutzniks are fighting back with demonstrations and bumper 
stickers 
three mizraa men were arrested recently on suspicion of burning 
tires in the orthodox town of bnei brak a protest tactic copied 
from palestinian activists in the occupied territories 
such incidents illustrate a widening rift between the 
kibbutzniks who regard themselves as the vanguard of secular 
zionism and the orthodox who regard themselves as defenders of 
the jewish heritage 
last march a prominent orthodox sage rabbi eliezer schach 
outraged the secular public by declaring there are kibbutzim 
that dont know what yom kippur is or the sabbath and they 
raise rabbits and pigs do they have any links with their 
forefathers 
yom kippur is the jewish day of atonement 
mizraa kibbutznik hadas sandorowicz says her own forefathers 
who helped build mizraa on jezreels swamps would be horrified to 
find the law being dictated by four nonzionist fanatics who 
didnt raise a finger to build this country

an army neurosurgeon is pleading for 
permission to resume laboratory tests that involve shooting cats in 
the head but animal rights activists say the research is useless 
and cruel 
the activists are delaying important work that could reduce us 
combat deaths in the event of war dr michael carey said thursday 
he conducted the catshooting research starting in 1983 but a 
congressional suspension prompted by activists was imposed 13 
months ago 
an anesthetized cat that will feel no pain appears more 
important to a small number of americans than does a soldier 
risking his life for his country said carey a reservist now on 
active duty and heading for the middle east in two weeks 
during the vietnam war carey was with an army medical unit that 
performed surgery on 100 soldiers with brain wounds death rates of 
us troops suffering from head wounds were the same in vietnam as 
they were in world war ii medical experts say 
tourists see names of the dead when they look at the wall of the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington but when i look i 
still hear a voice saying help me doc carey said at a news 
conference 
he said his research can help critics say it cant 
how many years is it going to take for him to understand that 
he hasnt been helping us said dr neal bernard president of 
the physicians committee for responsible medicine 
careys research is useless and cruel barnard said in an 
interview 
carey is using an old research ploy saying im the only 
person with the answer said barnard his work has been a

the president of quincy college says hell 
use a 201yearold state morals law to try to keep students from 
buying condoms on his campus 
theres a legal question in my mind as to whether condoms are 
permitted on campus or not given the responsibility of teachers 
and administrators to teach chastity president o clayton 
johnson said 
a local schools committee of nurses teachers and parents has 
recommended that condoms be distributed on the junior college 
campus part of the quincy school system 
johnson who says he is morally opposed to providing condoms on 
campus added that a law adopted in 1789 also may make distribution 
illegal the law orders college presidents to teach such virtues as 
universal benevolence sobriety industry and frugality 
i would reject selling them at the college and then i would 
ask for a legal opinion whether i have the right to do so he 
said tuesday 
peter chisholm a spokesman for the state regents of higher 
education said the law is out of date 
philip johnston the state human services secretary has 
recommended that massachussets high schools distribute condoms to 
students to fight the spread of aids 
this is a life and death issue and its something that must be 
taken seriously by educators and health care professionals he

two counts of voluntary manslaughter and one count of reckless 
endangerment in the june 16 deaths of donald shelton 33 and steve

a relative of the aids virus that can cause 
leukemia remains rare in the united states federal officials say 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
just 902 of 64 million american red cross blood donations in 1989 
0014 percent tested positive for htlvi virus 
the council of community blood centers another blooddonation 
organization reported a similar rate 0018 percent among its 
28 million donations from december 1988 through the end of 1989 
the cdc said in its weekly research report 
the food and drug administration recommended in november 1988 
that blood centers test all donated blood for htlvi which causes 
a vicious form of adult leukemia 
htlv viruses are retroviruses in the same family as hiv like 
hiv htlv can be passed through contaminated drug needles or sexual 
contact 
tests for htlvi also turn positive in the presence of a closely 
related virus htlvii the second virus hasnt been positively 
linked to a specific disease but since doctors usually cant be 
sure which htlv virus a person has blood donors and others testing 
positive should be counseled as if they had the leukemia virus the 
cdc said 
researchers believe htlvi and ii are equally common the cdc 
noted 
htlvi is common is southwestern japan the caribbean parts of 
subsaharan africa and central and south america 
american red cross data indicate that htlv infections in this 
country are most common among women blacks hispanics and asians 
risk factors also include intravenous drug use sexual contact with 
an iv drug user japanese or caribbean ancestry or sexual contact 
with japanese or caribbean people the cdc said 
twenty percent of male blood donors infected with htlv had a 
history of iv drug use while 23 percent were born in or had 
sexual contact with someone from the caribbean 
among female blood donors who were infected 29 percent had 
sexual contact with an iv drug user and 17 percent were from the 
caribbean or having sex with someone from there

a federal judge has refused to delay 
implementation of a new ethics law that prohibits government 
workers from being paid for writing articles or making speeches 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson rejected the request 
for a temporary restraining order saying none of the employees had 
shown they would be irreparably harmed if they had to wait for 
the matter to be heard in court 
two public employees unions and the american civil liberties 
union representing 10 government workers filed suits to prevent 
enforcement of the ban on honoraria which takes effect jan 1 
jacksons refusal to delay implementation of the provision set 
the stage for the employees to file emergency appeals 
attorneys for the workers who earn outside income by lecturing 
writing freelance articles or performing religious ceremonies as 
ordaied clergy argued that the law unconstitutionally restricts 
freedom of speech 
justice department attorney jeffrey s gutman argued that the 
statute does not violate the first amendment because its only 
payment for speech that is prohibited by the statute not the 
speech itself 
gutman told jackson that the law may even apply to federal 
employees who are paid 50 a month to sing in their church choir 
he said however that the workers are free to continue their 
outside activities if the receive no compensation 
he noted that a 1974 law that has never been challenged in the 
courts prohibits federal employees from earning more than 2000 a 
year for articles speeches and appearances 
i find it startling this issue has not been litigated at 
all said jackson who did not rule on the merits of the issue 
lawyers for the national treasury employees union immediately 
filed a motion for a temporary emergency stay with the us court 
of appeals for the district of columbia 
attorneys for the american federation of government employees 
and the aclu which filed the companion cases said they would do 
the same as soon as possible 
the law was enacted in november 1989 as part of legislation that 
prohibited members of the house from receiving honoraria for 
speeches appearances and articles 
the ban does not apply to the senate but the office of 
government ethics says it is enforceable on virtually all federal 
employees with a possible civil fine of up to 10000

the shortage of xray technicians physical 
therapists and 12 other types of hospital workers worsened last 
year prompting many institutions to offer higher salaries 
according to a new survey 
hospitals have a growing concern about their ability to 
maintain adequate services in light of these persistent 
shortages barbara bloom kreml human resources director of the 
chicagobased american hospital association said thursday 
many hospitals reported they are boosting salaries to attract 
and keep workers some reported they are cutting patient services 
kreml said 
one of the areas most affected is rehabilitation services 
because of shortages of physical therapists occupational 
therapists and speech pathologists she said in a statement 
increasing compensation costs salaries make it difficult for 
hospitals to keep costs in line 
the associations survey of 3706 hospitals found that vacancies 
were highest for physical therapists with 164 percent of 
fulltime positions unfilled in 1989 up from 158 percent the year 
before 
thirteen other occupations faced growing shortages in 1989 
including certified nurse anesthetists a field in which 108 
percent of jobs went unfilled last year compared with 102 percent 
the previous year the aha said 
were facing an incredible shortage said betty colitti 
spokeswoman for the american association of nurse anesthetists 
based in suburban park ridge 
she said job advertisements in the groups newsletter have 
quadrupled over the past four years to 16 magazinesize pages from 
four and that the average annual salary is 58000 with nurse 
anesthetists in some areas of the country making starting salaries 
of 98000 
getting certification for the specialty takes a registered nurse 
two extra years of school and training colitti said adding that 
more schools and programs are needed to alleviate the shortage she 
said 65 percent of the anesthesia in the united states is 
administered by nurse anesthetists 
other occupations in which shortages worsened from 1988 to 1989 
according to the survey 
clinical perfusionists 115 percent of jobs unfilled in 1989 
up from 10 percent the previous year perfusionists direct and 
supervise the operation of heart and lung machines physiologic 
monitoring instruments and related equipment used in cardiac 
surgical procedures 
speech pathologists 99 percent of jobs unfilled up from 9

no matter what the outcome of the 
persian gulf crisis a longterm foreign military presence will be 
needed to ensure stability in the region saudi and foreign 
military experts say 
there are varying views about the shape of the foreign presence 
and how long it will have to stay but the experts agree it will 
take years until the saudi military and armies of other gulf states 
are able to protect their territory 
much depends on the time saudi arabia will need to overcome its 
manpower shortages and build an army large enough to eliminate the 
need for foreign protection 
regional security is expected to be the major issue tackled by 
the gulf cooperation council summit that opens in qatar saturday 
it has to be a robust gcc were going to have to cooperate on 
security definitely secretarygeneral abdullah bishara of 
kuwait said in a recent interview 
the envisioned security arrangements will undoubtedly involve 
the united states in some form or other given the need to 
guarantee oil supplies 
us secretary of states james a baker iii has talked of the 
need for a new security structure in the region once the kuwait 
crisis has been settled 
no one has disclosed any details yet but the general outline 
appears to be for a large force preferably americans working under 
a united nations flag stationed around kuwaits border 
the smaller emirates will likely provide shore facilities for a 
large armada much as they did during the 198088 iraniraq war 
saudi arabia plans to more than double the size of their armed 
forces over the next few years and buy up to 20 billion worth of 
us weaponry 
well build up our armed forces to the point of adequate and 
absolute deterrent to any aggression said prince fahd bin 
abdallah the deputy defense minister 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and saudi arabias quick 
request for outside help showed how unprepared the saudis and 
their neighbors were to defend themselves despite massive spending 
on advanced weapon systems over the last decade 
the invasion also woke the ulf states to the harsh reality that 
they could no longer afford the squabbling and minimal security 
cooperation that had characterized their relations in the past 
the ruling alsaud family had avoided creating a large army 
fearing a competing center of power the 67000man regular forces 
and the 55000strong paramilitary national guard were formed to 
balance each other 
military experts say the saudis will need external military 
support for four to 20 years until they can properly defend their 
territory iraq boasts a military force of 1 million 
although saudi arabia has promised domestic islamic 
conservatives that us troops will leave as soon as the gulf 
crisis is over future security arrangements in the gulf will 
undoubtedly involve the united states 
thousands of american military personnel are expected to remain 
in the region on training missions to help the saudis absorb 
the new weapons including about 700 m1a1 tanks and dozens of f15 
fighter planes 
more than 250000 us troops are now based in saudi arabia as 
part of the multinational force sent to the kingdom to deter iraq 
the gulf states also face a major dilemma in deciding how to 
curb the regional ambitions of iraqi president saddam hussein if he 
agrees to withdraw from kuwait 
if saddam pulls out with his military intact iraq will remain a 
major threat to saudi arabia and the vulnerable gulf monarchies 
and unless saddams drive for nuclear weapons is checked and his 
growing arsenal of weapons eliminated his threat will only 
increase 
yet if his army is destroyed the resulting vacuum could lead to 
a scramble for power among other regional leaders and leave 
militarily weak gulf states vulnerable 
the region can never find the same tranquility as before 
theres been so much rancor so much movement of people said a 
western military official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the saudis also see other potential threats 
to the south last mays merger of north and south yemen has 
created a new regional force the new yemen republics 10 million 
people outnumber saudi arabias 8 million indigenous people 
yemens backing for saddam prompted the kingdom to expel 
hundreds of thousands of yemenis who had been working in saudi 
arabia 
traditional enmity has long prevented them from marking their 
common border and the saudis plan to build new military bases 
there 
to the north jordan has expressed sympathy for saddam despite 
its adherence to un sanctions imposed after the invasion of 
kuwait 
while saudi arabias support for the palestinian cause has 
always been more financial than military the arabisraeli conflict 
is also a major source of regional instability 
they see themselves surrounded by enemies said a western 
diplomat 
 
editors note neil macfarquhar has covered the middle east for 
the associated press from cyprus since 1987 and is currently on 
assignment in saudi arabia

a state agency wants to end the saga of the 
shoreham nuclear power plant by tearing down the idle reactor 
rather than mothballing or entombing it 
the long island power authority has asked its board of trustees 
to approve a plan to dismantle and decontaminate the reactor at a 
cost of 186 million the authority hopes to ship the reactors 
radioactive parts out of state to a certified nuclear waste dump 
the authority rejected two more costly options mothballing in 
which the plant would be shut down for 20 or 30 years but could be 
started up again and entombment burying the plant inside a wall 
the authoritys trustees were to vote on the plan today if 
approved it will be submitted to the federal nuclear regulatory 
commission before the end of the year authority chairman richard 
kessel said at a news conference thursday 
the 55 billion shoreham plant on the north shore of long 
island about 60 miles east of new york city was completed in 1984 
after 11 years of construction it received a full operating 
license from the nrc but only was tested at 5 percent of capacity 
and never generated electricity 
gov mario cuomo and suffolk county officials opposed the plant 
arguing that long island could not be safely evacuated if a nuclear 
accident occurred 
in 1987 shoreham owner long island lighting co agreed to sell 
the plant to the state for 1 in return for annual rate increases 
for 10 years the power authority is overseeing the shutdown 
kessel also executive director of the state consumer protection 
board said that if the nrc accepts the decommissioning plan within 
the next nine months the power authority could start dismantling 
the reactor in october and finish in late 1993 
the nrc has not yet ruled on an application filed last june to 
transfer shorehams operating license from long island lighting to 
the power authority the commission is waiting for the authority to 
decide which decommissioning plan to pursue

the kremlins palace of congresses resembles a 
grand opera house and eduard shevardnadzes surprise resignation 
as foreign minister was the latest drama of perestroika to play the 
palace 
the modernistic parliament building built in the early 1960s 
for years echoed with the sonorous drone of endless colorless 
speeches and monotonous debate that characterized the brezhnev era 
from 1964 to 1982 
but in recent years some lively things have taken place at the 
palace 
a little over a year ago nobel laureate andrei sakharov near 
his death urged the communist party to give up its absolute grip 
on power this year the party surrendered its leading role during a 
party congress here 
in july boris yeltsin president of the russian republic 
hushed the congress with the announcement he was quitting the 
party 
on thursday shevardnadze took his bow startling the congress 
of peoples deputies by resigning as foreign minister warning in 
an emotionchoked voice that dictatorship is coming 
shevardnadze began his address theatrically waving a prepared 
text in the air and then discarding it for what he called the 
briefest and most difficult speach of my life a rambling 
15minute discourse that ended with him storming from the podium 
stage left 
as if it were intermission the deputies then bounded out of 
their plush red seats and flooded the white marble foyer of the 
palace to offer their reviews of the performance and its meaning 
latvian deputy nikolai neyland said shevardnadze had bowed to 
incessant criticism from hardline deputies and others who alleged 
that the foreign minister was risking a repeat of afghanistan by 
involving the soviet union in the persian gulf but he said the 
real opposition went deeper 
they werent attacking shevardnadze so much as our foreign 
policy he said they have been using the persian gulf as a 
pretext to express dissatisfaction that the soviet union has lost 
its superpower image the soviet union has lost allies in eastern 
europe and we supposedly have made too many concessions on arms 
control 
roy medvedev a deputy and historian said shevardnadze had 
shown weakness by caving in to criticism that soviet leaders 
such as president mikhail s gorbachev and embattled prime minister 
nikolai i ryzhkov have endured for months 
if all our leaders reacted to criticism this way ryzhkov 
would long ago have hung himself yeltsin would have shot himself 
and i dont know what fate gorbachev would have chosen medvedev 
said 
its a step in the right direction said an almost gleeful 
col viktor alksnis he is the leader of the hardline soyuz 
faction in parliament and one of the two conservatives shevardnadze 
had identified in the speech as the lawmakers with colonels 
stripes who were persecuting him 
its a maneuver offered the other col nikolai 
petrushenko 
before too long gorbachev aides began to circulate in 
washington it would be called spin control speaking to 
deputies and journalists to try to limit the damage that 
shevardnadze had caused 
the next act featured gorbachev who told the deputies he would 
not overdramatize and then played the betrayed friend though 
his shock at shevardnadzes announcement seemed genuine enough 
rizoali odzhiev a hulking deputy from tadzhikistan who lost a 
leg in afghanistan savored the high drama as a welcome change from 
earlier years 
i dont need to remind you what the scene was like in this 
hall 10 years ago said odzhiev

fewer americans are getting to own their homes 
these days as households resemble less and less the traditional 
family image the census bureau said 
in a report issued thursday the bureau said 639 percent of 
households across the nation owned their homes in 1989 down from 
656 percent in 1980 
the report homeownership trends in the 1980s said a major 
factor in the decline was a drop in ownership rates for nonmarried 
couple families during the decade 
home ownership by families headed by an adult without a spouse 
present fell from 496 percent in 1982 to 465 percent in 1989 
and that drop occurred for both sexes home ownership by 
families headed by men without a wife present fell from 593 
percent to 557 percent home ownership by families headed by a 
woman with no husband dropped from 471 percent to 441 percent 
a second important change was the rapid growth of nonfamily 
households during the 1980s compared with families reported 
census demographer robert r callis 
between 1980 and 1989 nonfamily households increased 272 
percent nationwide to 27 million while family households climbed 
just 106 percent to 66 million 
families are much more likely to own their own home than are 
nonfamily households which often consist of only a single person 
thus even though families still are the larger group the faster 
growth of nonfamily households reduces the overall share of home 
owners 
callis said other reasons also were factors in the decline 
including the decision by many young people to stay single longer

the postal service was unable to convince 
saudi arabias national airline to waive international mail rates 
in favor of the lower fees observed by us carrier for carrying 
mail to american troops in the saudi desert a postal official 
said 
james e orlando head of international services for the postal 
service confirmed that saudi arabian airlines had charged the 
service nearly 19 million to deliver about 105 million pounds of 
mail addressed to desert shield troops from sept 1 to oct 17 
rep benjamin gilman rny had cited those figures in a 
letter of protest to the saudi ambassador and the postmaster 
general saying that was too much to pay 
orlando said the was reasonable in that it complied with the 
rates set by the universal postal union an international 
organization of postal administrators 
but he noted the saudis had declined a postal service request 
that the airline instead observe the mailrate schedule set by the 
department of transportation for usflagged carriers the upu 
rates are about 2 12 times higher than the us rates 
gilman ranking republican on the house post office and civil 
service committee recommended in his letter that the postal 
service work with the department of defense and the state 
department to ensure that saudi airlines absorb these mail 
expenses 
orlando said that the whole issue that congressman gilman had 
which is whether we should be paying that rate level to the saudi 
government in view of the fact that were over there defending 
them as far as im concerned is a legitimate issue for the 
congress and the administration but not for the postal service

the mauss triplets were so tiny at 
birth 90 years ago that they spent their first few hours in a 
makeshift incubator their fathers shoebox placed in the warming 
oven of a coal stove 
maybe it was that odd start in murray utah on oct 16 1900 
that instilled in vinal velma and vilda mauss the sense of humor 
they believe is a key to their nearrecord longevity 
vinal sounds the same as vinyl but i came first vinal said 
thursday 
my sisters always had a lot of fun together he said they 
liked to confuse their teachers by switching seats i had no 
trouble telling them apart but my father sometimes got them mixed 
up 
mauss soninlaw legrande eli eliason said when the 
triplets get together its like a circus 
they love to laugh and tell jokes he said 
the trio is still going strong says vinal mauss as they 
approach the guinness book of records mark for oldest triplets 
the massachusettsborn caughlin triplets faith hope and charity 
were 93 in 1962 when the first died 
we are trying to beat that if we can said vinal a hardy 
dapper man who looks 20 years younger than he is and still works 
several hours a day as owner of a newspaper distribution business 
in walnut creek 25 miles east of san francisco 
vinal the oldest of the triplets by 10 minutes weighed only 3 
pounds at birth his kid sisters were 2 pounds each but there 
werent any real incubators in murray utah then so vinal said 
their doctor put them in their fathers padded shoebox and placed 
it in the coal stoves warming oven 
the three arent quite sure how they got their unusual names 
family legend has it a friend of their mother heard the names 
somewhere and in the excitement or exhaustion of having triplets 
their parents agreed to them 
believed to be the first surviving triplets in the western 
united states they were curiosities who drew crowds when they were 
displayed in a booth behind ropes at a utah state fair in 1907 
they sold pictures of us for 25 cents each mauss said 
they stayed close over the years and wrote each other often 
when mauss served as a mormon missionary in japan from 1922 to 1924 
and head of the mission there from 1949 to 1953 
the sisters who live near each other in midvale utah near 
salt lake city stay in close touch with their brother 
mauss a former bishop of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints worked at one time or another as a real estate 
broker insurance salesman and funeral director before getting into 
newspaper distribution he also played semipro baseball in salt 
lake city and basketball on a mormon missionary team 
he claims to be a man of no vices but not for lack of trying 
he sampled coffee once but couldnt stand the taste a cigar made 
him sick a glass of whiskey made him throw up 
but he doesnt sound at all like a man who has missed anything 
my only regret is that i didnt get a higher education he 
said i hoped at one time to be a doctor i finished high school 
and had one year of college night school at berkeley 
but ive enjoyed my life im still enjoying it

the two amtrak engineers involved in the dec 
12 train crash in boston have been suspended without pay pending an 
investigation and a signal near the crash site has been changed 
an all clear track signal near bostons back bay station has 
been changed to require inbound trains to brake to 30 mph amtrak 
spokeswoman sue martin said thursday 
a control system will automatically stop trains that are not 
slowed she said 
amtrak said in a statement that engineer trainee richard 
abramson 41 of trumbull conn and chief engineer willis 
copeland 53 of bethany conn would be removed from engine 
service 
but martin said the suspension was from all duties without pay 
until the investigation is completed 
this is a pretty routine procedure martin said any time 
that we suspect that an employee or employees may have contributed 
to an accident then theyre routinely suspended pending an 
investigation this does not mean that theyre guilty 
the new yellow and green signal was installed just west of 
ruggles station about a mile and a quarter from back bay station 
martin said 
the signal was previously greenonly permitting the engineer to 
reach the maximum legal speed of 100 mph 
weve basically taken a step that will add an extra layer of 
protection martin said 
if the engineer does not apply enough brake pressure to slow 
down after passing the signal an automatic control system will 
brake the train and bring it to a complete stop martin said 
amtrak also said it was telling its employees that only federal 
authorities can remove train recorders that monitor speed and 
braking 
amtrak officials inadvertently prevented a clear reading of the 
tape by recording on it an electronic tone to mark the last five 
miles of the trip federal investigators have said 
the night owl traveling at more than twice the speed limit 
derailed and slammed into a crowded commuter train injuring 267 
people 
the probe amtrak said is focusing on what if any 
responsibility they the engineers may have had in the cause of 
the derailment 
the national transportation safety board also is investigating 
the ntsb is focusing on whether the engineers were negligent in 
their operation of the train or whether as the engineers maintain 
the locomotive brakes were malfunctioning 
the night owl was traveling at 110 mph at some point in the 
mileandonefifth stretch of track before back bay station 
according to black box data retrieved from a tape in the 
locomotives cab 
the maximum speed up to a point about a half mile from the 
station was 100 mph near the station the speed limit was 30 mph 
when the 10car train derailed along a curve it was traveling 
77 mph more than twice the speed limit 
a review of the information taken from the data recorder showed 
that the engineers applied the brakes at least once before the 
crash the ntsb said 
if the investigation finds that copeland and abramson were not 
responsible for the accident they will return to work and their 
back pay will be restored martin said 
both engineers were hospitalized as a result of the accident 
copeland was released from boston city hospital on dec 17 
according to martin he was transferred to a hospital in new haven 
boston city would not confirm the transfer abramson was released 
from st elizabeths hospital in boston wednesday

more than 1 million iraqis fled their homes 
in the capital today in a major evacuation drill to test the 
populations readiness in the event of war in the persian gulf 
the civil defense exercise got under way on schedule at 7 am 
with air raid sirens blaring across the eastern part of baghdad 
which is divided by the tigris river 
the drill was expected to involve nearly 2 million people but 
residents said nearly half stayed home 
iraqi preparations for war have increased since the un 
security council late last month authorized military force to drive 
the iraqi army from kuwait if it does not leave the conquered 
emirate by jan 15 
with the first siren today families began pouring into the 
streets some ran to civil defense centers set up by the government 
and others jumped into their cars and sped away 
hundreds of buses waiting at the civil defense centers took 
evacuees to points about 10 miles to the north east and south of 
the city 
the evacuees carried blankets food and personal documents 
the drill was expected to last all day 
on thursday basra iraqs secondlargest city and the closest 
to the border with occupied kuwait was evacuated in a similar 
exercise residents there said almost the entire population of 1 
million people participated in that drill 
among other war preparations in the past couple of weeks there 
have been instructions to build bomb shelters throughout the 
capital and courses in civil defense and firstaid are being 
pushed by the government 
government officials have been instructing the population in 
public announcements to leave their houses carefully locked during 
the evacuation drills police cars were to patrol the city to 
protect private property 
businesses and all government offices were closed today the 
moslem sabbath so the exercise did not affect commerce 
on saturday the western part of the city is to be evacuated in 
similar drills the population also about 2 million will be moved 
north west and south of the city

an iraqi test firing of three mediumrange 
missiles took us military officials by surprise a newspaper 
reported today 
preparations and the first launch of the dec 2 test were 
complete before american satellites and sensors monitoring the 
tense persian gulf region noticed it even though us officials 
had thought they could detect any iraqi fueling and prelaunch 
programs the los angeles times reported 
we had no advance warning said an unidentified 
administration official quoted by the times 
iraq had warned commercial airliners to keep out of its airspace 
before the test but gave no reason 
the warning prompted israel and us officials to prepare their 
air forces to respond to an attack the newspaper said 
a lot of people were in their cockpits ready to go the 
times quoted one official as saying 
the official said joseph c wilson iv the chief us diplomat 
in baghdad received a telephone cll from the state department in 
washington after the first missile was fired 
the call reportedly informed him that the balloon is going up 
this is no drill later officials reported the launch was a 
test 
the times said the missiles were launched from a site near 
basra in southeastern iraq and traveled more than 400 miles west 
toward israel landing in a remote part of the iraqi desert 
if they had been fired southward they could have hit us 
troops in saudi arabia and if launched from western iraq they 
could have hit jerusalem and tel aviv the newspaper said 
us officials said the missiles were fired from an area that 
was not being monitored but seth carus of the washington institute 
for near east policy said it was odd that basra wouldnt be under 
surveillance because shortrange missiles could be launched at us 
troops from there 
hundreds of thousands of us troops have been sent to the 
persian gulf since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2

the closer their countries to the soviet 
union the more worried leaders seemed to be by soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadzes resignation 
one exception was the hardline communist government of china 
whose foreign ministry would say only that shevardnadzes dramatic 
announcement thursday was an internal affair of the soviet union 
we will continue to develop friendly neighbor relations with the 
soviet union 
elsewhere the announced resignation of the man who helped 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev end the cold war provoked 
apprehensions about the future of the soviet union and its leader 
gorbachev said shevardnadze agreed to stay on until a successor is 
chosen 
germany fearing that failure of the soviet presidents reforms 
could endanger east european stability was especially nervous 
about shevardnadzes resignation announcement 
we can only hope that the reforms are carried out they are 
good for the soviet union and they are good for the relationship 
between our people and for developments in europe said german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
germans credit the soviets in particular gorbachev and his 
foreign minister with clearing the way for eastern europes 
sweeping reforms and german unification 
hansdietrich genscher the german foreign minister said he is 
confident of final soviet approval of the treaty guaranteeing 
german sovereignty despite the resignation of one of moscows 
leading reformers 
genscher and roland dumas the french foreign minister urgently 
appealed for an international effort to bolster gorbachevs reform 
program with financial aid 
dumas said he hoped shevardnadzes cry of alarm would be 
heard 
it will serve as a warning to western countries and others who 
are dragging their feet over aid which must be given he said 
dumas said shevardnadze had privately shared with him his concerns 
about the future of the soviet union but noted this is the first 
time that he says it publicly 
the foreign ministers of the 12nation european community which 
recently pledged 28 billion in aid to the soviets received 
shevardnadzes with regret 
a statement said the ec nations express their firmest hope 
that the resignation will not entail changes in soviet policy 
which might call into question the significant results thus far 
achieved in international relations in the direction of 
disarmament and peace 
in poland which has a 700mile border with the soviet union 
foreign minister krzysztof subiszewski said the internal situation 
there can in many respects cause anxiety 
the decision of eduard shevardnadze can be treated as a 
warning internal policy especially that of a superpower finds 
reflection in foreign policy he said 
the prime minister of soviet lithuania kazimiera prunskiene 
told a news conference in tokyo today that her independenceminded 
republic is alarmed by shevardnadzes resignation 
she said it may mean that progress achieved by the 
properestroika forces is being turned back by conservative forces 
including sections of the communist party and the military 
his resignation may lead to a situation that is unfavorable 
for lithuanian independence she said 
there was a worldwide outpouring of praise for shevardnadze a 
welcome guest in many capitals 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters 
on a personal basis i regret this he is a personal friend and 
he was very supportive of the united nations 
vatican radio hailed shevardnadze as the great architect of 
the soviet diplomacy that contributed to ending the cold war 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama said he was really 
surprised by the sudden announcement i would like to watch the 
situation calmly 
australian foreign minister gareth evans said today that 
shevardnadzes resignation raises matters of immediate worry 
for gorbachevs leadership 
the optimistic view is that it could act as a warning shot to 
galvanize the reformers there does seem to be at least an attempt 
by mr shevardnadze to do just that by the style and the 
forecefulness of his resignation speech evans said 
secretary of state james a baker iii called the outgoing 
minister his friend but said gorbachev had assured him that soviet 
foreign policy would continue on course 
american gen john r galvin natos military commander in 
europe said bluntly the soviets certainly face a bleak winter 
i hope what were hearing now doesnt make it any worse 
all of us in the west want to see the soviet people continue 
on a track that will lead to full democracy free enterprise and 
respect for human rights galvin said but this has to be done 
in a way that maintains order without sacrificing democratic 
principles

a giant ash plume belched from mount st helens 
but scientists said it didnt appear to portend a new eruption of 
molten rock 
wind carred the ash toward portland ore 53 miles to the 
southwest prompting united airlines to cancel 21 flights in and 
out of that city thursday night normal service was to resume this 
morning united customer service supervisor fred von pegert said 
port of portland spokesman darrel buttice said the airport 
remained open thursday night and the 11 other airlines were flying 
the 8366foot mountain blew a column of light gray ash and 
steam 23000 feet into the air thursday afternoon about 30 minutes 
after a small explosion occurred on the lava dome in the volcanos 
crater said michael doukas a us geological survey geologist at 
its cascade volcano observatory in vancouver 
doukas said it was similar to the latest volcanic burp on 
nov 5 when a plume of steam and ash rose 30000 feet into the 
sky similar bursts occurred last december and january 
doukas said those bursts are significant only in underscoring 
that mount st helens remains an active volcano 
scientists have theorized such bursts come from either gases 
bubbling out of solution in molten rock beneath the mountain or 
from rain and snowmelt percolating down to hot areas and bursting 
into steam 
the volcanos last significant eruption was on march 19 1982 
when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork of the 
toutle river since then the mountain has had a series of 
domebuilding eruptions in which the mountain quietly adds lava 
to the heap in its crater the last of those was in october 1986 
the mountains cataclysmic may 18 1980 eruption killed 57 
people and blew off the top 1300 feet of the oncesymmetrical 
peak a lava dome dating to about the 16th century

a southeast asian boy shouldnt be forced 
to have surgery because his familys fear of arousing angry spirits 
would do him more harm than skipping operations to fix his 
clubfeet a judge ruled 
superior court judge lawrence j oneill ruled thursday the 
potential psychological and physical harm to kou xiong a 
7yearold hmong refugee outweighs efforts to correct the clubfoot 
condition that doctors say could leave him unable to walk 
oneill who had ordered the surgery 10 months ago said he 
reversed himself thursday because psychiatrist david a fox said 
the trauma of going against traditional hmong religious beliefs 
could kill kou and others in his family 
fox a psychiatrist at valley childrens hospital in this 
central california city of 350000 spoke with a hmong shaman in 
studying kous case 
the system clearly has done the best it can for this child and 
family oneill said the childs family must now do what is 
best for themselves 
kous parents ger and houa vue xiong oppose surgery because 
they believe spirits gave their son clubfeet as punishment for a 
wrong committed by an ancestor they believe kous younger brothers 
were born with cleft palates because he received care for his feet 
at a thailand refugee camp after the family fled the mountains of 
laos 
kou who was carried into court by his father thursday walked 
with a halting gait during a previous court appearance 
i think the judge or everybody has to know more about people 
before making a judgment ger xiong said through an interpreter 
after oneill announced his ruling they have to respect 
respect the people we are different 
a reclusive hill people from northern laos many hmongs had 
little contact with the outside world before joining a 
ussupported campaign against communist insurgents in the early 
1970s when laos prous government fell thousands of hmongs 
fled to the united states 
this operation was seen by the family as having longterm 
effects which could cause them disease and financial disaster 
said the familys lawyer joe reich 
if the surgery had been forced on kou reich said the family 
would have rejected him and welfare officials could not have placed 
him with another hmong family 
all 18 hmong clans in the united states had supported the 
familys opposition to surgery

which has turned into a tool manipulated by the united states 
iraq has proposed a settlement of its 4monthold invasion and 
occupation of kuwait linked to an israeli withdrawal from occupied 
arab territories washington and its allies in the persian gulf 
standoff rejected the linkage 
in his statement monitored in nicosia aziz said after weeks 
of shameful maneuvering the council adopted a meager resolution on 
one of the most dangerous issues from which the region and the 
entire world has suffered for many years 
a more meager statement was issued by that council binding 
the zionist entity israel to absolutely nothing all that 
compared to 12 arbitrary resolutions adopted in the past four 
months by the same council against iraq he said 
president bushs policy aziz said is designed to protect only 
bushs partners and his agents among the corrupt oil sheiks for 
whom he sheds crocodile tears 
the security council vote on the resolution had been postponed 
several times in recent weeks as washington sought a text that 
would not be interpreted as a concession to iraq 
while us approval of the resolution thursday was a break from 
traditional american support of israel a veto would have 
jeopardized the international coalition arrayed against iraq 
washington agreed to the text only after a paragraph endorsing 
an international mideast conference to resolve the arabisraeli 
conflict was removed 
a call for a properly timed and structured international 
conference on the 42yearold conflict was contained in a 
nonbinding council statement

the national assembly early today 
sustained president violeta chamorros veto of a bill that would 
have drastically cut the already slashed budget of the 
sandinistacontrolled military 
mrs chamorro has said deeper cuts in spending for the military 
a stronghold of the leftist sandinistas she succeeded in april 
could push the country into chaos and a bloodbath 
the sandinistas have staged crippling strikes against the 
conservative governments moves to dismantle the socialist economy 
and institute marketoriented reform 
the vote today followed weeks of bickering that had placed mrs 
chamorro in the position of fending off the conservative deputies 
she is technically allied with while defending her adversaries 
the sandinistas 
after debate that lasted until 3 am today legislators voted 
6921 to sustain mrs chamorros veto 
the 51 deputies of mrs chamorros national opposition union or 
uno had voted unanimously last week to shave 196 million from 
her proposed 786 million budget for the army less than half the 
budget the military had requested 
but 29 members of the coalition plus one independent deputy 
today joined the 39 sandinista deputies in the 92member assembly 
in sustaining the veto after mrs chamorro agreed to cut only 85 
million from her earlier defense budget proposal one deputy did 
not vote 
she also agreed to name a civilian defense minister by 1993 the 
defense job has been held by gen humberto ortega brother of 
former president daniel ortega who mrs chamorro succeeded in 
april 
uno leaders want mrs chamorro to sack gen ortega and the issue 
was one of the grievances listed by former contra rebels who have 
rioted attacked police stations and blocked roads in recent 
months 
mrs chamorro has decided to keep gen ortega as defense 
minister said deputy luis humberto guzman head of the budget 
committee that considered the defense vote 
she said humberto ortega is the only man who has the moral 
authority and the capability to effect the reductions in the army 
without creating a backlash from angry sandinistas guzman said 
the sandinistas who ruled the country from 1979 until their 
defeat in last februarys elections still command a mass movement 
capable of bringing the country to its knees with strikes they 
also have most of the guns and bullets 
but mrs chamorro also agreed to reduce the armed forces now 
numbering 28434 troops to about 16000 over the coming years 
guzman said 
the military had 100000 men and women under arms when she came 
to power april 25 once the largest force in central america the 
sandinista peoples army is now the fourth biggest after those of 
el salvador honduras and guatemala 
the armys budget was 190 million this year the last budget 
the sandinista government approved and military officials 
presented a 1991 budget proposal of 160 million 
mrs chamorro chopped it to 786 million and it fell to 70 
million under her agreement with conservative deputies

about 5000 people including backers 
of ousted gen manuel noriega and relatives of people killed by 
american bombs marched through the capital dressed in black to 
mark one year since the us invasion 
the marchers shouted antigovernment slogans and burned a us 
flag during the fourhour fivemile march that began thursday in 
the downtown business district and ended in chorrillo the 
neighborhood where noriegas headquarters were located 
heavy us bombing of the area caused most of the civilian 
deaths and left more than a thousand homeless 
the government which was installed after the invasion said 
dec 20 could be neither a holiday nor a day of mourning 
it was an invasion and no panamanian likes to see his country 
invaded with the consequences of deaths and injuries said 
foreign minister julio linares 
neither can we say it is a day of national mourning because it 
liberated us from dictatorship he said 
he called the date one of national reflection 
those who should reflect are the accomplices of the 
intervention responded isabel corro spokeswoman for the 
association of families of martyrs of the north american invasion 
of panama 
they took power at the cost of thousands of disappeared and 
fallen she said 
president guillermo endara who won may 1989 elections only to 
have the results nullified by noriega was sworn in shortly after 
the invasion began 
the panamanian human rights committee has increased its casualty 
figures from the invasion over the past week even as the us army 
southern command revised its death toll downward 
the rights group which had said 385 died in the invasion now 
claims 403 people were killed or disappeared it gave no reason for 
the change 
the army which had recorded 314 military and 202 civilian 
deaths now says 345 died including us and panamanian soldiers 
and civilian 
the invasion left 1243 families homeless of those 596 remain 
at a refugee shelter awaiting housing 
as the march passed a prison in chorrillo guards fired guns 
into the air to quiet a disturbance by inmates authorities said 
marchers dispersed then regrouped to burn a us flag 
we burned it because they burned our relatives that way the 
day of the invasion said a chorillo resident who asked not to be 
identified 
most panamanians initially were exhuberant over the end of 21 
years of military rule and the overthrow of noriega who is jailed 
in miami awaiting trial on drug charges 
but endaras support has been weakening and the us militarys 
continued role irritates nationalists 
about 10000 us soldiers are based in panama to provide 
security for the panama canal at endaras request american troops 
put down a dec 5 police revolt that endara described as a coup 
attempt

israels foreign minister said today the united 
states showed weakness by catering to arab desires for a un 
security council resolution condemning israel but iraq dismissed 
the measure as meager 
the resolution approved by a 150 vote in the council thursday 
urges israel to halt deportation of palestinians from the west bank 
and gaza and calls on the united nations to monitor the safety of 
palestinians there 
us backing for the resolution was seen as an effort to 
preserve the arab coalition against iraqi president saddam hussein 
it was the third time in two months that washington has failed to 
exercise its veto powers to shield israel 
although the resoultion referred to land occupied by israel 
since 1967 as palestinian territories us ambassador thomas 
r pickering kept out language linking the palestinian issue to 
efforts to resolve the gulf crisis saddam has consistently tried 
to link efforts to resolve both issues 
israeli foreign minister david levy said today that the united 
states had succumbed to arab pressure 
there is a weakness among the americans that is brought about 
by americas dependency on the antisaddam coalition and by the 
american obsession that if it is objective and stands by israel 
the coalition is liable to be weakened levy told israel army 
radio 
but he praised the americans for keeping out of the resolution 
any mention of an international peace conference that would deal 
with all disputes in the middle east including the arabisraeli 
conflict 
such a conference opposed by israel as biased toward the jewish 
state is only cited in a nonbinding addendum to the resolution 
for their part palestinian and iraqi officials claimed that the 
resolution was too weak 
the vote highlighted the double standards applied by the 
united states and imposed on the security council which has turned 
into a tool manipulated by the united states said iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz 
after weeks of shameful maneuvering the council adopted a 
meager resolution on one of the most dangerous issues from which 
the region and the entire world has suffered for many years he 
said 
his statement was monitored in nicosia 
palestinian officials also complained that the measure did not 
do enough to protect residents of the israeliheld territories 
because it did not mention the international conference and failed 
to provide specific steps for protecting palestinians 
but the resolution was the first step in a linkage between 
iraqs occupation of kuwait and israeli rule in the territories 
they claimed 
the linkage between the two problems is that all the un 
resolutions must be respected said jamal tarifi a proplo 
lawyer from gaza 
israel deported four leaders of a fundamentalist palestinian 
group last week the latest of 60 deportations during the 
threeyear palestinian uprising 
israeli officials had halted the practice for more than a year 
however partly because of strong us complaints 
the resolution urges un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to use existing personnel in the region to monitor the 
safety of palestinians 
two un organizations operate in the region one is the truce 
supervision organization which oversees the truce between israel 
and arab states the second is the relief and works agency which 
provides medical care education and other relief to 900000 
palestinian refugees in the west bank and gaza 
pickering told the council the two un agencies have separate 
and welldefined mandates no activity should be undertaken that 
would alter these mandates and we would oppose any attempt to 
alter them 
since the united states holds a veto in the security council it 
would be impossible for either the relief or truce agency to begin 
officially monitoring the palestinians 
nevertheless some staffers from the relief agency already act 
as unofficial monitors in the occupied lands rushing to trouble 
spots to prevent or report on human rights abuses by israeli 
soldiers 
the un relief agency has complained about frequent harassment 
arrests and beatings of employees most of whom are palestinians 
israel claims the un teams monitoring is politically 
motivated to weaken israeli control and increase international 
control

a jury has ruled that both the city and former 
new york yankee infielder andre robertson were responsible for a 
1983 car crash in which a former ballerina was paralyzed 
after the thursday verdict state supreme court justice ira 
gammerman instructed the jurors to return today to determine how 
much money shanikwa dawn nowlin should get for her injuries and

upcoming curve on the west side highway the panel found that

speed limit as he entered the curve 
the accident broke nowlins back and left her paralyzed from the 
waist down 
nowlin now 31 and a dallas lawyer testified that robertson was 
traveling about 65 mph but taxicab driver charles stone testified 
that he witnessed the former shortstops 1983 buick riviera swaying

sudden i heard andre scream he pushed on the brakes real hard and 
the car crashed to the left then it jerked to the right we hit 
the wall on the other side and my back just snapped

a rash of seven shotgun killings is scaring 
people into carrying guns or staying indoors at night as police try 
to nab the killer before another attack 
gun sales are skyrocketing in the largely bluecollar area of 
northwest indiana after the slayings within a 20mile radius since 
late october 
at jacks gun shop in burns harbor sales of firearms and 
ammunition have jumped fivefold since last week owner jack batz 
said thursday 
we saw a big increase because people realize these are 
senseless killings batz said 
the latest victims were brothers ilija eli balovski and 
george baloski who were killed with shotgun blasts to the head in 
their gary tailor shop tuesday the store is just down the street 
from a pawn shop where owner robert ribicki has armed himself 
lifes too damn precious for this kind of junk said 
ribicki who carried a 38 colt revolver strapped at his waist just 
under his jacket i just hope they catch this guy i dont care 
if they blow him away 
police believe the killings were carried out by the same gunman 
they were looking for a man described as white and between 20 and 
35 years old portage police sgt warren e lewis said 
we have evidence to tie all the shootings together we have 
several suspects at this time lewis said i cant say that we 
are close to an arrest 
he declined to discuss the evidence but sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said shell casings from the latest killings 
match those from earlier slayings a special police unit was formed 
to investigate the shootings that occurred in a parking lot at gas 
stations a garage a motel a bank and on the street 
ribicki who sells a variety of merchandise including shotguns 
says all five people working there now carry guns 
ive had customers come in and when they see my gun they say 
you guys finally got smart he said adding that his gun sales 
have tripled since the shootings began 
some people dont welcome the increase in people carrying guns 
i can see some poor sucker getting his head blown off 
approaching a car to ask for directions to burger king said 
willy carbins 40 who was waiting for his teenage son to get off 
work at a gas station less than a block from the site of the latest 
shootings 
the gary police department also doubts the wisdom of fearful 
citizens carrying guns 
people are always going to panic a little when something like 
this occurs department spokesman william burns said 
in the hands of the inexperienced guns lead to accidental 
injuries or thefts that put more weapons in the hands of criminals 
he said 
the shotgun killings began oct 30 when a man and a woman were 
gunned down and at least three other people were fired at in 
separate incidents in the nearby towns of griffith st john and 
cedar lake 
then there was a lull broken with the dec 13 death of a man 
working at a gas station in portage 
that was followed by the slayings saturday of a man and a woman 
in separate attacks in portage and gary and the shooting of an 
indiana toll road collector the same day 
some in this steel mill city on the southern shore of lake 
michigan were blase about the string of killings 
thats not uncommon in gary people go around killing each 
other for no reason said local resident denise moss 23 
but as news and rumors about the attacks spread people began to 
take precautions 
people are just nervous just scared and people have a reason 
to be said louis ruffin 44 who did electrical work for the 
slain brothers 
he said he wont go outside after 10 pm and rarely ventures 
out alone after dark 
im not afraid of nobody but i know i cant do nothing with a 
shotgun except get killed ruffin said this has put a damper 
on a lot of christmases

the postal service was unable to convince 
saudi arabias national airline to waive international mail rates 
in favor of the lower fees charged by us carriers for carrying 
mail to us troops in the persian gulf a postal official said 
james e orlando head of international services for the postal 
service said saudi arabian airlines charged nearly 19 million to 
deliver about 105 million pounds of mail to desert shield troops 
from sept 1 to oct 17 
rep benjamin gilman rny sent a letter of protest to the 
saudi ambassador and the postmaster general saying that was too 
much to pay 
orlando said the charge was reasonable in that it complied with 
the rates set by the universal postal nion an international 
organization of postal administrators 
but he noted the saudis had declined a postal service request 
that the airline instead charge the rates set by the department of 
transportation for us carriers the upu rates are about 2 12 
times higher than the us rates 
gilman recommended that the postal service work with the defense 
and state departments to ensure that saudi airlines absorb these 
mail expenses the congressman is the ranking republican on the 
house post office and civil service committee 
orlando said the question of whether the rates were fair given 
that the us troops are defending saudi arabia was a legitimate 
issue for the congress and the administration but not for the 
postal service

volatile political career that has declined rapidly since his 
failed bid for the presidency 
despite two years of political troubles since he won the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1988 dukakis sounded upbeat 
as he said goodbye 
i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth 
the governor said thursday repeating the phrase the ailing 
baseball legend lou gehrig used to bid farewell to fans in yankee 
stadium 
dukakis 57 received a standing ovation from supporters and 
administration officials in the massachusetts house where he 
launched his political career his wife kitty his children and 
his mother joined him in the packed chamber 
the threeterm governor was relaxed and unsentimental taking 
indirect swipes at president bush 
we should feel terrific as a nation and as a people we 
should be leading both at home and abroad dukakis said but 
we dont feel terrific do we on the contrary we seem to be 
having a collective political nervous breakdown in this country 
repeating some of his campaign themes dukakis called for a 
national health care program and warned that something must be 
done to pay off the national deficit 
i made a lot of mistakes in the 1988 campaign but few were as 
bad as my failure to make the case for the kind of fundamental 
change that we as a nation must seek dukakis said 
the governor conceded that massachusetts has had its share of 
fiscal problems 
that doesnt mean that we here in massachusetts can smugly 
point the finger at our brethren in washington dukakis said 
weve had more than our share of troubles over the past two 
years 
the state has been plagued by financial woes since dukakis 
returned from the national campaign trail and the governors 
administration has said that it will leave a deficit up to 100 
million 
but dukakis said massachusetts has tried to deal with its budget 
deficit 
weve made the cuts he said weve done what wasnt 
popular it hasnt been fun and it hasnt been easy but weve 
done it and so must the nation if we are to provide the kind of 
leadership for the world and the kind of future for our people that 
we want for ourselves and for all mankind 
dukakis was first elected governor in 1975 but was defeated by 
edward j king after his first term he came back to defeat king in 
1983 and won the democratic nomination for president in 1988 
shortly after losing the presidential race dukakis said he would 
not run for governor again 
he leaves office jan 3 and will be replaced by govelect 
william weld the first republican governor the state has had since 
the early 1970s 
while his longrange plans are unclear in january he leaves for 
hawaii where in the spring semester he will teach at the 
university of hawaii

the number of soviet jews immigrating to israel 
has nearly doubled in recent days reflecting new fears of 
political turmoil in the soviet union officials said today 
israel is using every available plane to bring in soviet 
immigrants from european transit points and expects as many as 
6000 to arrive between thursday and sunday the officials said 
in the past three days more than 1500 soviet jews have landed 
in israel daily compared to the previous daily average of about 
800 said gad benari a spokesman for the jewish agency a 
quasigovernmental group that handles immigration 
no doubt the growing wave is in part a response to the 
worsening situation in the soviet union and the debilitation of the 
government said jewish agency chairman simcha dinitz 
apprehensions grew after soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze resigned thursday and said in his farewell speech that 
the soviet union was moving toward a dictatorship 
alexander bronstein 55 a chemistry professor from moscow said 
many soviet jews feared the liberal emigration policies of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would soon end 
the resignation of shevardnadze is bad for gorbachev bad for 
democracy and bad for ussoviet union relations bronstein told 
reporters at ben gurion international airport today it is 
certainly possible that the gates may close 
yurevich gertsovich 50 a librarian from minsk said she came 
as soon as she could because she feared emigration would be halted 
nothing good has ever come out of waiting the more you wait 
the worse things become so we got out all of us said mrs 
gertsovich who arrived with 15 relatives 
dinitz said he hoped shevardnadzes resignation would not affect 
immigration prime minister yitzhak shamir has said he did not 
think there was reason for special concern 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu predicted that the 
increased pace of soviet immigration would continue because of the 
political upheaval in the soviet union 
if we planned for 500000 jews arriving next year it is 
quite possible that with a radical change in the situation in the 
soviet union we will have to absorb twice as many in a short 
time netanyahu told israel radio 
already the pace of immigration is causing problems in israel 
including housing shortages and unemployment among the immigrants 
officials are fearful the thousands arriving also will overwhelm 
schools and social services 
at least 160000 soviet jews have arrived in israel in 1990 
they reach transit stations in warsaw budapest and bucharest by 
air or overland from the transit stations israeli planes most of 
them from the national carrier el al take them to tel aviv 
el al spokesman nachman kleinman said the airline has been 
sending extra planes since midweek because of the great increase in 
the number of soviet jews reaching the transit points 
they are leaving with any means they can kleinman said 
for security reasons israel tries to get immigrants out of the 
transit stations and to tel aviv the same day 
transport minister moshe katzav has issued a special permission 
this week to allow el al flights to land during the jewish sabbath 
which lasts from sundown today to sundown saturday 
el al nornally doesnt operate during that period because jewish 
law forbids work on the sabbath

a retired air force official said cargo jets 
used extensively in operation desert shield in saudi arabia have 
not been thoroughly inspected a newspaper reported today 
retired lt col lawrence b welborn told the los angeles times 
that the air force only looked at a fraction of the lockheed c5b 
aircraft frames they later told congress they tested for defects 
a lockheed spokesman said the plane does not have structural 
flaws but said he was unfamiliar with the details of the air 
forces inspections 
the tests previously performed by lockheed and validated by 
the air force metallurgists established the metallurgical soundness 
of the c5bs the spokesman said 
welborn said he was in charge of the inspections in 1986 at 
altus air force base in oklahoma in a sworn affidavit and in an 
interview with the newspaper welborn said that only one area of 
one c5bs frame was exposed for testing on dec 6 1986 three 
c5bs were supposed to be tested 
the test he said only took a few hours to fully test the 
entire structure of the three planes would have taken several days 
he said 
welborns affidavit taken by claremont calif attorney 
herbert hafif was received by rep john d dingell dmich who 
was on the oversight and investigations subcommittee that requested 
the 1986 inspections 
dingell demanded thursday that the defense department 
investigate whether the air force misled congress 
possible structural flaws were brought to the attention of 
congress in 1986 by three former lockheed employees represented by 
hafif 
those employees claimed that because of a defective oven the 
jets mainframes were overheated causing cracks and voids in the 
metal 
after congress request for the inspection in 1986 gen 
lawrence skantze then the air forces procurement chief reported 
to the committee that the structural integrity of the 24 
suspected forgings was confirmed diagrams of the test points 
were presented to the committee 
but on thursday skantze said he had no firsthand knowledge of 
the inspections but was assured at the time that the inspection had 
been completed 
given the gravity of the issue i am appalled that our people 
would have assured me the job was done correctly if indeed it was 
not done he told the times 
last month a los angeles jury awarded the employees a 453 
million award in a civil case claiming they were fired after trying 
to tell lockheed management about the flaws lockheed has asked for 
a new trial

suez canal authorities have stepped up 
security against a possible iraqi attempt to scuttle a vessel in 
the waterway to block it canal officials said today 
the measures include assigning cement carriers to the rear of 
canal convoys so that if they are sunk other vessels would not be 
blocked once sunk cement carriers are extremely difficult to 
clear because of the wet cement 
the canal is important for oil shipping as well as for the 
united states and other countries massing warships in the persian 
gulf region 
because the canal carries much of western europes oil an 
extended blockage would hit that regions economy hard and could be 
almost ruinous to egypts the canal annually earns more than 15 
billion in foreign exchange for egypt 
canal security has been tighter since egypt condemned iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and sent troops to join the usled 
multinational force deployed in the gulf region to defend against 
further iraqi advances 
intelligence sources in cairo said today the new canal measures 
were in line with a security upgrade ordered nationwide on 
strategic installations like the canal the aswan high dam in 
southern egypt and vital industries 
canal officials said authorities recently began careful checks 
of the itineraries and ownership of cementcarrying ships 
particularly those coming from the far east or the gulf region 
today a romanian ship carrying cement the 38000ton beius 
was the last of 30 ships to transit the 101mile long canal it 
origin and destination were unclear 
the canal officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the suez canal authority took the additional safeguard of 
dispatching two tugboats to follow the romanian ship through the 
waterway 
they said more egyptian harbor workers and stevedores than usual 
have been boarding all cementcarrying ships such workers provide 
dockside and harbor services at the southern and northern ends of 
the canal suez and port said 
in addition they report to egyptian intelligence on anything 
unusual found aboard ships 
as a rule suez canal authority pilots steer ships through the 
waterway 
despite its value to egypt president gamal abdel nasser in 1956 
scuttled two ships carrying concrete and stones in the waterway to 
block it he aimed to hurt western economies in reprisal for a 
concerted military attack on egypt by britain france and israel 
iraqi president saddam hussein threatened in august to punish 
arab states that sided with kuwait in the crisis recently 
proiraqi palestinian hardliner mohammed abbas extended the threat 
to the united states and kuwaits other western allies 
abbas also known as abul abbas leads the baghdadbased 
palestine liberation front which hijacked the italian cruise liner 
achille lauro in 1985 and killed a wheelchairbound american 
passenger leon klinghoffer

new yorks highest court has granted 
workers compensation benefits to a school bus driver who suffered 
severe psychological problems after seeing the wreckage of a fatal 
car crash 
the state court of appeals awarded the benefits thursday to rose 
wood who was driving a busload of kindergartners to school on 
april 29 1986 when she came upon a car accident in which two 
teenagers she knew were killed 
in its 70 decision the court said psychological pain brought 
on by witnessing a tragedy can be considered an accidental injury 
and can be subject to the same compensation as a physical injury 
the court said however that compensation isnt necessarily due 
all employees who suffer mental pain after seeing an injury to 
someone else at work 
what the court seems to be saying is that the closer you are 
to being an active participant the more likelihood you have of 
winning the case said thomas dunne lawyer for the workers 
compensation board 
wood then 50 was the first person on the accident scene and 
saw the mangled body of one of the victims the court said wood 
remained at the scene until emergency help arrived and then 
continued on her route the court said 
within weeks of the accident wood began suffering from 
insomnia nightmares anorexia depression and chest pains the 
court said less than two months after the accident wood was 
involved in a nearcollision between her school bus again filled 
with kindergarten children and an automobile 
wood then was hospitalized and treated for stress the court 
said wood of coxsackie about 25 miles south of albany couldnt 
return to the job shed held for 12 years she has been out of work 
since and remains under treatment said her lawyer brendan quinn 
wood then sought workers compensation benefits from her 
employer laidlaw transit an administrative law judge for new 
yorks workers compensation board rejected woods claim to 
compensation for lost wages but the full compensation board 
overturned that decision and awarded benefits 
the bus company took the case to the appellate division of state 
supreme court which dismissed the award that court said that 
while woods disability arose in the course of her job she 
technically was not involved in an accident 
the court of appeals however said there was no question that 
woods psychological and emotional problems were a direct result of 
her job judge judith kaye said that wood as a school bus driver 
had job responsibilities that distinguished her from others who 
might have passed on the road 
rose wood was by virtue of her employment an active 
participant more than a third party merely witnessing anothers 
injury kaye said the feeling on woods part that she should 
have been able to help but couldnt precipitated her 
psychological injuries 
its now up to the compensation board to determine how much wood 
can receive in benefits quinn said if shes granted full 
disability she can be compensated at twothirds of her salary for 
the 4 years since the accident about 45000 quinn said 
the lawyer for laidlaw transit leo hacker did not return 
telephone calls to his office thursday or early today

the catholic archdiocese of atlanta said it wont 
seek to recover more than 20000 in church funds that went to a 
woman whose affair with the nations highestranking black catholic 
led to his resignation 
an audit of the archdiocese and two parishes conducted by a 
public accounting firm revealed thursday that about 5835 from 
the individual churches went directly to vicki long or to her 
creditors to pay her rent utilities or charge cards 
the archdiocese paid 14556 in medical expenses for ms long 
through the summer of 1990 but the audit said no archdiocese funds 
went directly to her 
the archdiocese initiated the audit after the resignations last 
summer of archbishop eugene marino and the rev michael woods a 
sandy springs priest who said he had a sexual relationship with ms 
long 
ms long denied the relationship with woods but claimed she was 
married to marino and filed a paternity suit in 1987 against 
another priest the rev donal keohane of columbus a blood test 
later showed keohane did not father her daughter 
ms long said she was sexually exploited by keohane and marino 
and also claimed to have been molested by a nun in columbus 
marino once the nations highestranking black catholic has 
undergone therapy at an undisclosed location since his resignation 
the audit report said money from two churches st pius x 
parish in conyers and st john the evangelist parish in hapeville 
went both to pay medical bills and directly to ms long or her 
creditors the audits began with may 1986 records and went through 
june 1989 for st john and august 1990 for st pius x 
the rev john walsh of st pius told the archdiocese last fall 
that he had paid ms long with funds set aside for the poor there 
was no indication of a relationship between walsh and ms long 
woods was pastor at st john the evangelist where ms long was 
a lay minister for 10 years before moving to st judes parish in 
sandy springs two years ago a review of st judes records showed 
no money had gone to ms long 
an archdiocese spokesman the rev peter dora said the church 
would not discipline woods or walsh for disbursing the money nor 
would it try to recover the funds from ms long 
but he said she will not receive any more money directly or 
indirectly from the archdiocese of atlanta or any of its 
components 
the audit did not review the personal finances of marino who is 
believed to have contributed more money to ms long over a twoyear 
period 
archbishop marino pretty well lost his life savings dora 
said likewise father woods is destitute 
dora said the audit uncovered only one previously unrevealed 
archdiocese expense for ms long 47 that he said was for flowers 
sent to her during an illness 
the financial review was published thursday in the archdiocese 
newspaper the georgia bulletin it was headed by cocacola co 
president donald keough and conducted by coopers amp lybrand public 
accountants

the government today gave permission for 
the first legal oppostion rally in albania and said all statues and 
symbols bearing the name of soviet dictator josef stalin should be 
removed 
authorities also said enterprises and institutions bearing 
stalins name should receive new ones the state ata news agency 
reported it said this was decided taking into consideration that 
historic circumstances have changed 
workers on agricultural cooperatives and residents in housing 
blocks named after stalin should similarly decide on new names the 
report said 
clusters of tirana residents watched all morning as workers 
toiled to dismantle the marblecovered pedestal in a central park 
on which a statue of stalin had stood for decades the statue 
itself came down at midnight 
a second stalin statue at the stalin textile combine in tirana 
was also taken down overnight 
stalin who was born this day in 1879 was the fatherfigure of 
the harsh brand of communism that albanias founder enver hoxha 
imposed on his country for 41 years 
now lets take down the statue of the dictator who ruled here 
for 50 years said one youth referring to a giant bronze statue 
of hoxha that towers nearby over tiranas showcase skanderbeg 
square 
demonstrators in northern shkodra last week reportedly blew up 
that citys giant statu of hoxha authorities there took down a 
stalin memorial in august flowers have been planted on the spot 
where the statue of hoxha once stood 
in shkodra hundreds of windows smashed in the violence were 
boarded over and soldiers stood guard today around the vandalized 
communist party headquarters 
the decisions to permit a rally saturday by the new opposition 
democratic party and to remove stalin statues indicated proreform 
forces were gaining the upper hand in the ruling albanian labor 
or communist party 
the rally would be the first officially sanctioned protest not 
sponsored by the communists who for decades suppressed any 
opposition several thousand students rallied in tirana last week 
to demand democratic change and hail the founding of the first 
noncommunist party and police did not itervene 
sali berisha a founder of the democratic party said saturdays 
rally would press opposition demands for the release of all 
political prisoners as well as for the postponement of free 
elctions scheduled for february 
the democratic party says it does not have time to organize by 
polling day set for feb 10 and wants the elections delayed until 
april or may 
to date the communists have used their power over official 
media to keep public silence about the new party meaning it must 
rely on word of mouth to propogate its cause in a backward nation 
with poor communications 
on thursday there was another indication of the swift change 
under way in europes last stalinist state 
hoxhas 71yearold widow nexhmije lost her last political post 
quitting her chairmanship of the communistled democratic front for 
what were termed reasons of age 
she was replaced by premier adil carcani touching off 
speculation that he might resign as head of government the ruling 
communist party promised a government reorganization when 
protesting students forced democratic reforms earlier this month 
but so far no changes have been announced 
the communists policies however remain secretive and opaque 
and they also have indicated they are prepared to use tough tactics 
to maintain power 
demonstrators arrested after last weeks violent riots in four 
cities including shkodra have received tough jail sentences of up 
to 20 years 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp today a 
justice ministry official denied democratic party allegations that 
the accused were not receiving adequate defense from lawyers 
the concept of rule by law is new to albania which only decided 
earlier this year to reconstitute the justice ministry abolished 
under hoxha

four leading western economic institutions 
said today that soviet president mikhail gorbachev must accelerate 
the pace of reform in his country or run the risk that the effort 
could fail 
the longawaited study the most comprehensive look yet by the 
west at the crumbling soviet economy called for economic pain in 
the form of wage controls imposed on workers at the same time price 
controls are removed from a variety of goods 
it said such bitter medicine was the only way to stabilize the 
chaotic situation in the soviet union where consumers in major 
cities are faced with massive shortages of food and other essential 
products 
the authorities face an enormous task involving reforms of 
the legal financial and trade systems and also of vital sectors of 
the economy especially agriculture distribution energy and 
manufacturing said the report it was prepared by the 
international monetary fund with help from three other 
organizations 
these changes cannot be made in a matter of weeks the study 
concluded but the imperative is to make sufficient progress at 
the beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with 
the past and the process gains an unstoppable momentum 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the western experts conceded that the plan they were putting 
forward could not be implemented without economic pain but said 
they knew of no other way to transform the soviet system 
ideally a path of gradual reform could be laid out which 
would minimize economic disturbance and lead to an early harvesting 
of the fruits of increased economic efficiency the study said 
but we know of no such path the more particularly given the 
difficult starting conditions 
but the study said that gorbachev had passed the point of no 
return in his efforts saying it would probably be impossible to 
reinstitute a centrally planned economy even if he wanted to 
therefore the experts urged the soviet leaders to move 
rapidly to give substance to their commitment to a market 
economy 
while calling for technical assistance to help the soviets in 
their efforts to discard seven decades of a planned economy the 
study said that massive amounts of western aid would not be useful 
right now 
it said that without the implementation of a major and 
farreaching reform program direct western aid would be of 
little or no lasting value 
the 50page report represented a victory for the bush 
administration which has argued for months that massive amounts of 
western aid would be wasted until gorbachev made more extensive 
moves to reform his economy 
however it cited certain specific areas where western technical 
expertise and investment could be of value 
immediate new investment could have a quick payoff for the 
ussr and the rest of the world in the energy and environment 
sectors the report said 
it cited modernization of nuclear plants improvement of oil 
drilling technologies and updating the soviets gas pipeline 
systems as projects where foreign investment would be most useful 
in the short term 
foreign assistance also could be particularly useful in 
retailing and distribution two areas that will be critical in the 
transition to a market economy the report said 
the united states and other countries already have dispatched 
experts to help the soviets remove the bottlenecks in their 
crumbling distribution system 
in addition to the imf other groups participating in the study 
were the world bank and two europeanbased economic agencies the 
organization for economic cooperation and development and the 
european bank for reconstruction and development 
president bush met with imf director michel camdessus and world 
bank president barber conable on thursday to discuss the report 
which was ordered up by bush and other leaders at the sevennation 
economic summit last july in houston 
the study represented a compromise last summer between demands 
by the french and germans for an immediate 15 billion western aid 
package and resistance to direct economic aid by bush and the other 
summit leaders 
todays report however indicated that no large sums of public 
money were called for in the current period instead it said a 
large part of this technical assistance should be provided by the 
private sectors of western countries with the role of public 
sectors being limited to filling any important gaps 
due to the breakdown of the distribution system food shortages 
are appearing in moscow leningrad and other major soviet cities 
particularly those farthest from agricultural regions germany and 
a number of other european countries have embarked on food relief 
programs for the soviet union 
the united states has offered the soviets 1 billion in bank 
guarantees to help them buy us grain and is coordinating a 
program to encourage the private sector to supply medical supplies 
and drugs to relieve shortages 
food aid if targeted and successfully delivered to the 
regions most affected could alleviate present distress the 
study said but it added an early implementation of economic 
reform would make the single largest contribution to alleviation of 
shortages 
the report which took five months to prepare portrayed a 
system that was even more backward than expected and practically 
paralyzed in its stumbling efforts to implement gorbachevs 
restructuring program 
inflation is accelerating at a pace that is difficult to 
measure with the old centralized order being replaced by a chaotic 
system of bartering and black marketeering it said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
did not believe the surprise resignation thursday of soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze would derail the efforts to get 
western technical assistance to the soviet economy 
he said the united states would discuss the report with other 
summit countries germany japan britain france italy and 
canada in order to coordinate efforts finance ministers and 
central bank presidents of the seven nations are expected to meet 
in washington in late january 
in addition to the 1 billion in food credits the 
administration also announced last week that it supports a move to 
make the soviet union a special associate of the imf and the 
world bank that would qualify the country for technical help but 
no direct loans from the two lending organizations

poisoned by homebrewed alcohol and hospitalized since sunday one

soldiers who were not identified suffered from methanol 
poisoning which is a problem associated with faulty homebrewed 
alcoholic beverages

transportation battalion 101st combat support group are all 
recovering the command said

a salvage crew dragged the bottom of the 
allegheny river today in search of a sunken barge that paralyzed 
part of the nations busiest inland port for a third day 
a fourmile stretch of the rainswollen river was closed 
wednesday and thursday from point state park in downtown pittsburgh 
northeast to the highland park bridge coast guard lt cmdr rhea 
giacoma said 
one little barge like this is more of a nuisance than anything 
else said john reed spokesman for the us army corps of 
engineers but if you dont know where it is it could create a 
much bigger problem 
someone comes tooling along and hits that barge and then 
youve got a few more of them sunk 
a tugboat crew used a 15foot pole to probe the river for the 
barge but the search was suspended thursday afternoon because it 
was inadequate to search the river that has swollen to 40 feet deep 
with recent rains the coast guard asked the barges owner azcon 
scrap corp to resume the search today with better equipment 
ms giacoma said the salvage crew today is using a bucket able 
to reach the river bottom and theres a diver on board wholl go 
down if they hit anything 
the barges owner azcon scrap corp was paying for the search 
the barge broke loose from its moorings at azcons scrap yard 
last friday and floated about 400 yards downstream two barge 
workers jumped to safety before the steel barge sailed over a dam 
got stuck in the river mud and bent at a 45degree angle 
ms giacoma said the barge broke free from the dam tuesday 
during more than 2 inches of rain and sank somewhere 
most barges that ply the allegheny river remained at their 
moorings thursday and there was little activity at us army corps 
of engineers locks at pittsburgh oakmont natrona heights and 
freeport corps civil engineer dave turcsanyi said 
the locks transport an average of 5500 tons of coal steel 
sand gravel petroleum and other goods each day reed said 
if the barge isnt found today companies that depend on the 
allegheny river to ship their goods will begin to feel the pinch as 
customers such as electric utilities switch to other suppliers 
reed said

foreign minister roland dumas implored cambodias 
supreme national council today to accept a united nations peace 
proposal and said that time is running out to find a solution to 
the conflict 
opening a meeting of the 12member council dumas said the 
proposal adopted nov 26 by the five permanent un security 
council members was a compromise text it can be improved but 
it cannot be put into question he said we are proud of it 
cambodian prime minister hun sen fainted during the meeting and 
was rushed to hospital dumas said later he was in satisfactory 
condition apparently suffering from fatigue it was not known how 
long hun sen would remain at the val de grace military hospital 
the cambodians were meeting with france and indonesia which 
cochair the international conference for peace in cambodia the 
framework for signing a peace accord a un representative was 
also present at the meeting 
dumas tried to counter criticism that the security council plan 
would give the united nations too great a role in running the 
country 
the plan calls for the united nations to administer cambodia 
during an interim period before free elections and for the supreme 
national council to act as titular head 
hun sen has already said the plan gives the united nations 
which would head key ministries too much power 
while acknowledging the un representative would have strong 
powers dumas stressed that it is in no case a real tutelage as 
long as the supreme national council embodies the sovereignty of 
cambodia 
he said however that unresolved quarrels among the four 
cambodian factions made it indispensible to give the un 
representative final decisionmaking power to avoid paralysis 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas presided over the meeting 
with dumas representing the three cambodian factions were 
communist khmer rouge leader khieu samphan the noncommunist 
leader of the khmer peoples national front son sann and prince 
norodom ranariddh son of prince norodom sihanouk 
if the four cambodian parties accept the proposal the paris 
conference would be reconvened to sign a final peace accord 
but french officials have expressed skepticism that todays 
meeting expected to last one day could win consent of the rival 
factions 
the vietnambacked phnom penh government which has six of the 
councils 12 seats has already objected to key aspects of the 
accord including the designation of the united nations as 
administrator of cambodia the proposal was adopted by the united 
states britain the soviet union china and france 
at its only other meeting in september in bangkok the council 
broke up in a dispute over its composition 
hun sen objected to efforts by sihanouk to be president of the 
council saying that would alter the balance in favor of the 
resistance 
dumas said time is running out the international community 
cannot indefinitely work out the fate of cambodia if cambodians 
themselves do not have the political will to do so he said

three indigent people have sued los angeles 
county saying the countys relief payments are insufficient to 
ward off hunger and homelessness 
the lawsuit against the county board of supervisors claims that 
the maximum payment of 312 a month established after another 
lawsuit is grossly inadequate to feed clothe and shelter the 
indigent 
the allotment allows 200 a month for housing 95 for food and 
17 for transportation personal needs and clothing according to 
the lawsuit filed thursday in los angeles county superior court 
the suit asks that the board be ordered to immediately raise 
the monthly grant amounts by amounts sufficient to enable indigent 
recipients to meet their basic subsistence needs 
it does not specify how much money that is 
the general relief program is the final safety net for aid and 
assistance to many destitute people said the plaintiffs lawyer 
john brinsley this monthly allocation has not been increased 
since mid1988 and is significantly below the federal poverty 
line 
the county continues to be the provider of last resort said 
deputy county counsel patrick wu wu said he had not seen the 
lawsuit and could not comment further on it 
brinsley said the supervisors ignored an increase recommended by 
their own elfare director and chief administrative officer voting 
to keep payments the same 
those representing the plaintiffs in the classaction suit 
include the legal aid foundation of los angeles the inner city law 
center and western center on law and poverty inc 
three relief recipients elizabeth mendly rudy johnson and 
john butts jr are named as plaintiffs but the suit specifies 
that plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all 
those similarly situated 
some 50000 poor people receive relief payments each year in los 
angeles county according to the suit

police today blamed group rivalry among 
teenagers for the shooting of four adolescents and a 6yearold 
who were wounded on their way home from school by gunshots from a 
passing car 
a 16yearold and two 14yearolds were arrested today in 
connection with thursdays shootings police said they were looking 
for two other teenagers as well 
police chief isaac fulwood blamed easy access to firearms and a 
breakdown in values for the shooting i dont know whether it was 
drugrelated or not but i doubt it he said dont make 
everything drugrelated it cheapens the violence 
fulwood declined to say what the altercation was about but said 
it was the kind of argument that at one time would have been 
settled by a fist fight the availability of firearms has given 
young people other options he said 
the altercation he said occurred 112 to 2 weeks ago and 
police were alerted that there might be trouble on thursday 
we did get a call earlier in the day and we took some steps 
fulwood said adding that policemen were sent to the area 
lt reginald smith a police spokesman said police had been 
dispatched to the junior high school attended by the four victims 
when they heard something was going down 
the injured youngsters the oldest of whom was 15 were in a 
group of children standing near a picket fence in a residential 
area of northwest washington when the driveby shooting occurred 
police said 
their conditions this morning ranged from fair to serious all 
were expected to survive 
residents of the city were shocked by the shootings despite the 
skyrocketing violence washington has experienced in recent years 
most of the 471 homicides this year have been at night and related 
to drugs and family violence 
the city has never had a serious problem with gang warfare or 
daylight killings 
when it comes to innocent babies its going too far said 
one woman who rushed to the scene from work after her daughter 
called and described the incident 
john olden 13 clarence richmond 14 and brian lewis 12 were 
admitted to childrens national medical center in critical 
condition hospital spokeswoman barbara cire said but their 
conditions were upgraded to serious 
troy gray 15 and xaziver paul 6 were admitted in serious 
condition but later were listed in fair condition 
i ran up and saw them there and they were all shot said a 
sixth grader who was nearby when the shootings occurred they 
leaned against the cars and checked to see where they had been 
hit 
two children were shot in the chest two were shot in the 
abdomen and one was shot in the arm said dr marty eichelberger 
director of emergency trauma services at the hospital 
there are five kids and there are a lot of holes 
eichelberger said when they all came in it was a challenge to 
even learn which of the youngsters were in the most serious 
condition 
he said the two younger childrens injuries were more 
superficial than those sustained by the others 
witnesses said the children either collapsed after being shot or 
staggered toward cars 
officials said the four older youngsters attended a junior high 
school near the site of the shooting

defense secretary dick cheney told 
us troops today it is increasingly likely war will be needed to 
oust saddam husseins army from kuwait and that absolute total 
victory is the only option if war breaks out 
it increasingly looks like hes not getting the message and 
well have to use force cheney said in a pep talk to troops in 
the northeast saudi desert 
the only acceptable outcome if hostilities begin is 
absolute total victory cheney continued 
gen colin powell who was visiting the troops with cheney said 
he still hoped for a peaceful resolution of the persian gulf 
crisis but he drew roars of applause when he vowed 
when we launch it we will launch it violently we will launch 
it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over as 
quickly as possible and theres no question who won 
cheney and powell fresh from three days of strategy sessions 
with field commanders in saudi arabia were somewhat evasive when 
asked by troops whether american ground forces would be ready to 
fight by the jan 15 deadline for saddam to withdraw from kuwait 
those questions were raised this week by the deputy commander of 
operation desert shield who said wednesday stillarriving ground 
troops might not be combat ready until well into february 
asked by an airman how long the united states would wait to 
attack if the deadline passed without an iraqi withdrawal cheney 
said 
while i cant tell you a specific date for obvious reasons 
when that would happen i can say that we are eager to get this 
wrapped up as quickly as possible 
cheney added that us military officials do not think waiting 
indefinitely is going to solve the problem 
this week military analysts said that if united states attacks 
iraq the assault could begin with a massive air strike followed 
by a short pause to give saddam a chance to surrender 
that scenario gained credence wednesday when us military 
officials conceded that some vital american ground forces might not 
be ready by the jan 15 deadline 
the likelihood of starting with air strikes has been discussed 
for some time by military officials and others who believe the 
united states because of its longterm political interests in the 
region must keep damage to iraq to a minimum 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 there was considerable talk 
that a us attack would start with massive air strikes but bush 
administration officials later told congress that any us assault 
would include a massive air land and sea campaign 
powell said this week were looking at an air land and sea 
campaign but it doesnt mean were going to do it all at 
once 
a pause after an initial air strike makes sense for several 
reasons according to military and private analysts who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
first it would save thousands of lives and damage on both sides 
if saddam decided he could not win a war and surrendered after an 
air assault averting a bloody ground war these analysts say 
were going to have a country called iraq in the region when 
this is over no matter how it ends one senior army official 
said doesnt it make sense that we would not want to totally 
destroy their country which in effect would totally destroy any 
chances of relations with the government 
also since more than half of the 510000 iraqi troops are in 
southern iraq and kuwait a protracted war likely would leave much 
of kuwait in ruins 
we could very well end up destroying the country were there 
to save the army official said 
those who predict the air strike scenario if war erupts got 
unexpected support wednesday from the deputy commander of us 
forces in the persian gulf 
lt gen calvin ah waller said ground forces that are still 
arriving in the gulf area to join the 280000 already here might 
not be combatready until well into february 
the pentagon reacted thursday to wallers comments about 
readiness by saying us air power in the region would be ready by 
jan 15 
a senior pentagon official who often discourages speculating 
about possible combat scenarios even reminded reporters that 
military leaders have raised the possibility of opening any 
hostilities with a phase of air attacks 
waller however said his advice would be to delay any 
hostilities until all us forces were ready 
the commander of the army component of the american deployment 
lt gen john yeosock said thursday he envisioned a war with iraq 
to be the highest operational tempo battle ever recorded 
but he also said any combat plan was subject to continuous 
change that philosophy would leave room for endorsing a powerful 
air strike followed by a pause provided bush was ready to follow 
up with an allout campaign if saddam did not give in 
clearly my intention is not to have a protracted war 
yeosock said

the dispute over whether a nativity 
scene should remain in front of city hall this holiday season may 
be moot by the time a judge gets around to hearing arguments one 
day after christmas 
a federal judge in san jose has agreed to hear arguments dec 26 
to decide whether the woodcarved manger scene implies governmental 
endorsement of christianity over other faiths 
in similar cases the us supreme court has allowed nativity 
scenes or other religious displays when they were surrounded by 
other secular holiday decorations 
the monterey display depicting the birth of jesus had been a 
traditional holiday decoration outside city hall for nearly 30 
years until 1989 when it was moved to a roman catholic church to 
avoid a legal dispute 
but this year the nativity scene went back up outside city hall 
prompting the american civil liberties union and victor ringel a 
13yearold jewish boy to sue

aftershocks followed the main quake the largest measuring 35 on 
the openended richter scale 
the quake occurred in the serbomacedonian zone which begins in 
southern bulgaria and winds into northern greece a seismologically 
active region the zone includes the cressna fault

soldiers be removed 
the klaipeda garrison commander notified lithuanian authorities 
on wednesday that armed units would begin patrolling the streets 
and have the authority to check peoples documents the tass agency

of citizens of the republic of lithuania as well as a political 
provocation with the intent to heighten tensions and to create

the bush administration said today that the 
jan 15 deadline for iraqs withdrawal from kuwait is not an 
attack day for american forces in the persian gulf 
instead said brent scowcroft the national security adviser to 
president bush what it tells saddam hussein is that after the 
15th hed better get moving now after the 15th of january he 
is at risk 
it doesnt say he is going to be attacked this date or that 
date or whatever scowcroft said what it says is he is at 
risk of the mandate of the security council after the 15th of 
january 
scowcrofts comments came a day after bush warned that iraq 
would be trounced in any war with the united states 
if we get into an armed situation hes going to get his ass 
kicked bush was quoted as telling lawmakers thursday 
jan 15 is the date set in a united nations security council 
resolution authorizing all means necessary to expel iraq from 
kuwait if it hasnt withdrawn voluntarily bush said earlier this 
week that the un mandate must be implemented on schedule 
scowcroft made his comments in an interview with the associated 
press and reporters from other news agencies he said he was not 
trying to raise or dampen expectations of military action on jan 
15 
all im saying is the 15th is an authorization date thats 
the way to describe it what im saying is the 15th doesnt mean 
the troops and aircraft start to move on the 15th scowcroft 
said 
on thursday bush told lawmakers that saddam does not understand 
the military threat he faces 
however some congressional leaders expressed concern about the 
fallout from fighting 
senate majority leader george mitchell just back from the 
middle east said he and members of his group detected 
considerable support among the masses in arab countries for 
saddam 
and that is a reality with which we must deal even though the 
governments of some of those countries are allied with us at this 
time the maine democrat said 
furthermore he said he told the president that allies in the 
region particularly egypt and saudi arabia were fearful of a 
broader conflict that would bring israel into the battle thereby 
complicating the scenario with arabs pitted against israelis 
sen paul simon dill said it was an open question whether 
soldiers from arab countries would fight those from another 
bush met with two delegations of lawmakers who visited the 
persian gulf 
he was meeting later today with john major britains new prime 
minister major opened the day with a series of television 
interviews in which he stressed that the question of war was in 
saddam husseins hands 
a complete withdrawal is necessary a partial withdrawal wont 
do major said in an interview on nbctvs today show 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president 
would welcome a strong endorsement from congress along the lines of 
the united nations resolution that authorizes military force 
against iraq unless it withdraws from kuwait by jan 15 
on the other hand he said bush told lawmakers if youre 
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and 
argue about it then that may not be that helpful or if youre 
going to water it down 
fitzwater added im sure that every committee up there has 
got 40 brilliant little staff guys running around drafting 
resolutions 
rep anthony c beilenson dcalif said he believed there 
should be a declaration of war before the use of force 
however beilenson said its not clear necessarily what the 
response of the congress would be the president feels that 
its his decision to make 
rep george w darden dga said bush told the lawmakers in 
direct terms that he was willing to use force he told us i am 
determined to do whatever is necessary to accomplish the purpose of 
getting saddam hussein out of kuwait 
rep elton gallegly rcalif said bush talked bluntly about 
the consequences facing saddam 
the greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed 
confrontation is to make sure that saddam hussein be made really 
aware that to quote him bush that if we get into an armed 
situation hes going to get his ass kicked gallegly said 
another person at the meeting confirmed that bush made the 
remark

a federal judge today closed a bail hearing for 
john gotti ruling that the alleged mob bosss rights to a fair 
trial override the right of the press and the public to attend the 
proceeding 
the central aim of a criminal proceeding must be to try the 
defendant fairly us district judge i leo glasser said 
glasser ordered the bail hearing to proceed and said he would 
reopen his courtroom later today to announce whether gotti and his 
two codefendants would be freed on bail or detained 
it is better to err if err we must on the side of generosity 
to the defendants rights glasser said in closing his courtroom 
the news organizations that had sought to keep the hearing open 
awaited the judges written decision before deciding whether an 
appeal would be filed 
defense lawyers maintained gottis right to a fair trial would 
be compromised if the hearing were held in open court and the 
public allowed to listen to secretly recorded tapes of some of the 
accused mobsters conversations 
while it is true that the first amendment guarantees to the 
public and the press a qualified right to attend criminal trials 
that right is secondary to defendants superior sixth amendment 
right to a fair trial gotti defense lawyer john l pollok said 
in a written motion to keep the hearing closed 
pollok also maintained that if reporters have access to the 
tapes the pretrial media disclosure of evidence not yet even 
determined to be admissible at trial will so poison the atmosphere 
already surrounding this case as to make selecting a fair and 
impartial jury and conducting a fair trial in new york virtually 
impossible 
nancy richman an attorney representing the citys major news 
organizations argued there have probably been more words written 
about gotti in recent years than about any other criminal 
defendant 
nevertheless gotti has been acquitted three times in the past 
five years earning him the nickname the teflon don ms 
richman wrote 
gotti 50 and his codefendants alleged underboss frank 
locascio 58 and reputed mob counselor salvatore gravano 45 
have been behind bars since their dec 11 arrest on racketeering 
and conspiracy charges 
law enforcers said they have a halfdozen tapes in which gotti 
and the other two men are heard discussing obstruction of justice 
and violence 
prosecutors maintained the defendants the alleged three top 
members of the gambino crime family are responsible for a number 
of murders are a threat to potential witnesses and the public and 
should remain in jail without bail 
a fourth defendant 61yearold thomas gambino an alleged 
captain in the crime family is free on 500000 bail he was 
accused of illegal gambling and loansharking

democratic house leaders no longer plan to 
present a surtax on millionaires as the first order of business 
when congress convenes next month but the proposal may resurface 
later aides said friday 
instead democrats are focusing on piecing together a package 
aimed at promoting economic growth and tax fairness said one 
aide to a top democrat they hope to have the legislation ready by 
the time president bush presents his state of the union address on 
jan 29 the aide said 
dont focus too much on whether its hr 1 or not said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hr 1 is the number assigned to the first bill introduced in 
the house at the beginning of a session of congress the 102nd 
congress convenes jan 3 when lawmakers are likely to introduce 
their first bills 
the official said democratic leaders still had not decided what 
would be in the economic growth package but would not rule out a 
surtax on millionaires 
until now democratic leaders had spoken of making the sessions 
first bill a tax hike on the rich the issue was a big political 
winner for democrats during this years budget battle with the 
white house they used the proposal and republican opposition to 
it to characterize the gop as the party of the wealthy 
but rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the taxwriting house 
ways and means committee told bush this week that he would not 
immediately pursue the surtax an aide to the illinois democrat 
said friday 
bush told rostenkowski on tuesday that he would not include his 
plan to cut capital gains tax rates in the fiscal 1992 budget he 
will send congress on feb 4 the aide said democrats have fought 
the capital gains tax reduction arguing it would mainly help the 
rich and that it would diminish government revenues 
bush who has twice waged losing battles to reduce the tax 
levied on sales of property said publicly tuesday that he would 
abandon the idea because he could not find savings elsewhere to pay 
for it as required under new budget procedures 
if republicans want to make a big fight over capital gains or 
other proposals that disproportionately benefit upperincome 
people wed start talking about countermeasures the 
rostenkowski aide said if not it might be better for everyone 
to focus on recession and war 
the millionaire surtax proved so popular this year however 
that rankandfile democrats say they will push for it anyway 
it will be spent a dozen times over in the first week of 
congress said rep thomas downey dny everybody who has a 
plan to expand labor programs education unemployment insurance 
whatever will pay for it with the millionaire surtax

the world bank said friday it no longer was 
counting on payments from iraq and was starting to put aside 
reserves to cover 514 million owed by iraq 
the bank owned by 154 countries including iraq lends about 21 
billion a year and is the biggest single source of aid to the third 
world the united states holds the largest block of shares 
iraqs foreign debt totalled 237 billion last year according 
to the central intelligence agency despite its wealth from oil 
iraq borrowed heavily because of its long war with iran 
the banks decision effective last monday was announced 
friday it put iraq on nonaccrual status normal practice when 
a country is six months behind on its payments it means that 
payments from the debtor country are no longer listed on the banks 
books since payments have not actually arrived 
there are 102 million in payments overdue from iraq 71 
million principal and 31 million interest 
the bank also will put aside 1 percent of the debt each month as 
a reserve in case it is never repaid 
other countries froze iraqs assets following its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait as a result president saddam husseins 
government has been unable to make payments the bank said in a 
statement after 75 days of not paying iraq lost the right to new 
loans from the bank 
eight other countries are also on nonaccrual status because 
they have been unwilling or unable to pay syria liberia zambia 
somalia peru panama nicaragua and guatemala two others guyana 
and honduras have paid up and returned to normal status so that 
they are once again entitled to borrow from the bank

security has been increased in the suez canal 
to thwart a possible iraqi attempt to sink a vessel and block the 
strategic waterway canal officials said friday 
the canal is important for oil shipping as well as for the 
united states and other countries who are massing warships in the 
persian gulf region 
the new security measures include putting any cement carriers at 
the rear of canal convoys so that if they are sunk they would not 
block other vessels once sunk cement carriers are extremely 
difficult to clear because of the wet cement 
the canal carries much of western europes oil and an extended 
blockage would hit that regions economy hard it could be almost 
ruinous to egypt which is dependent on the more than 15 billion 
in foreign exchange earned annually by the canal 
intelligence sources in cairo said friday the new canal measures 
were in line with a security upgrade ordered nationwide on 
strategic installations like the canal the aswan high dam in 
southern egypt and vital industries 
the measures have been in effect since soon after egypt 
condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and sent troops to join 
the usled multinational force deployed in the gulf region 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened to punish arab 
states that sided with kuwait in the crisis 
canal officials said authorities recently began careful checks 
of the itineraries and ownership of cementcarrying ships 
particularly those coming from the far east or the gulf region 
on friday a romanian ship carrying cement the 38000ton 
beius was the last of 30 vessels to transit the 101mile long 
canal its origin and destination were unclear 
the canal officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the suez canal authority took the additional safeguard of 
dispatching two tugboats to follow the romanian ship through the 
waterway 
they said more egyptian harbor workers than usual have been 
boarding cementcarrying ships such workers provide dockside and 
harbor services at the southern and northern ends of the canal 
suez and port said 
in addition they report to egyptian intelligence on anything 
unusual found aboard ships 
despite the canals value to egypt president gamal abdel nasser 
in 1956 scuttled two ships carrying concrete and stones to block 
the waterway he aimed to hurt western economies in reprisal for a 
concerted military attack on egypt by britain france and israel

the food and drug administration on friday 
approved a new genetically engineered drug to treat a rare 
lifethreatening immune disorder that strikes mostly boys 
people with chronic granulomatous disease or cgd are missing a 
key element of the immune system leaving them susceptible to 
bacterial and fungal infections and reliant on high doses of 
antibiotics 
the fda said the new therapy is the first approved genetically 
engineered form of gamma interferon a naturally occurring 
infectionfighting protein produced by certain types of white blood 
cells 
genentech inc of south san francisco calif will market the 
drug under the brand name actimmune 
the drug needs to be injected only three times a week in most 
cases which means we can now expect patients to have a more 
normal daytoday life said dr louis sullivan secretary of the 
department of health and human services which includes the fda 
fewer than 400 americans have cgd federal health officials 
said because it is so rare the drug was developed under the fdas 
orphan drug program designed to encourage development of drugs 
to treat rare diseases 
about 80 percent of children with the disorder suffer unusually 
frequent or severe infections within their first two years of life 
sometimes these infections can retard normal growth or lead to 
death the fda said 
common side effects of the drug include headache fever rashes 
and chills but these were transient the fda said 
longterm effects of the drug are not known but will be 
evaluated in postmarketing studies the fda said 
however because the drug has been shown to cause miscarriages 
in animals the fda said it should not be used during pregnancy 
unless its benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks

a federal judge refused today to order 
state health officials to resume feeding nancy cruzan a week after 
nourishment was halted to the woman whos in a vegetative state 
earlier today the missouri supreme court and a cole county 
court turned down two separate similar requests 
us district judge dean whipple in kansas city who issued the 
ruling scolded protesters for going from court to court seeking 
such an action 
this court is mindful of the fact that this is the fifth 
petition of its kind filed this week in various missouri courts 
he said the four previous petitions all have been denied 
in light of the history of this case this court finds that 
any further action would be frivolous at best and an abuse of the 
legal process the ruling said 
the judge had set a 1 pm hearing but canceled it and issued 
the written ruling instead he declined to comment but court 
employees said the judge had been besieged with phone calls asking 
him to intervene 
the federal court petition was filed by the rev patrick 
mahoney director of the center for christian activism in boca 
raton fla he alleged ms cruzans civil rights are being 
violated 
whipple ruled that mahoney had no standing to ask for federal 
action 
food and water was removed from ms cruzan a week ago at a mount 
vernon rehabilitation center her condition remained listed as 
deteriorating today 
earlier today missouris high court denied a second request by 
antiabortion activists who oppose euthanasia the cole county 
court ruled that yvette williams a kansas city woman who also 
asked the state to restore sustenance to ms cruzan has no 
standing to file suit her request was previously denied by a 
missouri appeals court 
the 33yearold ms cruzan the central figure in the first 
righttodie case considered by the us supreme court has been in 
a persistent vegetative state since suffering massive brain damage 
in a 1983 traffic accident 
on thursday the missouri supreme court and the missouri court 
of appealssouthern district in springfield denied requests to 
reconnect the tube 
meanwhile in jefferson city about 15 protesters staged a rally 
in the office of state attorney general william webster 
andrew burnett a spokesman for the group said the protesters 
would not leave the office until webster intervenes in court with a 
motion to replace ms cruzans feeding tube 
but deputy attorney general jim deutsch said the office had no 
legal standing in the case 
the office defended missouri law to the us supreme court as it 
was required to do deutsch said once the high court ruled on the 
issue the state was no longer an appropriate party in the case he 
said 
rehabilitation center spokeswoman barbara shoun said 
demonstrators pitched tents on the lawn outside the main entrance 
and endured a night of freezing rain and temperatures in the 
midteens police did not plan to remove the tents she said 
the lawrence county sheriffs office said five of the 19 
demonstrators jailed tuesday for trespassing and unlawful assembly 
posted 1000 bond each thursday and were released the others 
remain in custody invoking the name nancy cruzan and promising to 
stay there fasting until she is fed or dies 
a week after they won approval for the the removal of their 
daughters feeding tube joe and joyce cruzan have no regrets about 
their decision to let her die their lawyer william colby said 
knowing nancy as only a family could they knew she wouldnt 
want to go on in her present condition they know theyve done the 
right thing colby said thursday 
after a probate judge ruled on dec 14 that her feeding tube 
could be disconnected doctors said she would die within two weeks 
its getting late she will be dead if we dont move 
quickly said randall terry founder of the antiabortion group 
operation rescue 
oh man terry said after the state supreme courts decision 
on thursday isnt there one judge in this state with the moral 
integrity to save this woman 
after a ruling to disconnect the tube was overturned by the 
state supreme court in 1988 ms cruzans parents appealed to the 
us supreme court 
the high court ruled that the tube could only be disconnected if 
there was clear and convincing evidence that was what ms 
cruzan would want 
at a hearing last month former coworkers testified ms cruzan 
told them she would never want to live in a vegetative state

administration officials at odds over energy 
conservation met friday with president bush trying to sway him on 
alternative car fuels and other possible ingredients of his 
national energy strategy 
energy secretary james watkins who made a presentation friday 
at the meeting of bushs economic policy council is recommending 
that the strategy include both increased fuel efficiency standards 
and a requirement for greater use of nongasoline fuels 
those proposals are supported by the agriculture department and 
by environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
but other advisers including white house chief of staff john 
sununu and chief white house economist michael boskin are fighting 
the proposals on grounds that they would be costly and involve 
excessive government regulation others siding with sununu 
according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity include 
bushs domestic policy adviser roger porter and budget director 
richard darman 
after watkins spoke friday porter and boskin pounded away 
at what they consider the unreasonable options one participant 
said 
many planks of the proposed strategy have received consensus 
approval from the various government agencies involved in the 
talks members of the cabinetlevel council agreed to meet again 
with bush on the sticky issues remaining after he returns jan 1 
from his holiday stay at camp david md officials said 
considerable discussion friday centered on whether auto 
manufacturers should be required to increase production of cars 
that can use alternative fuels said one official he characterized 
the debate with bush present as a healthy discussion that did 
not reach the acrimonious levels of a council meeting on the 
subject last week 
the strategy contains 45 different measures dealing with the 
nations future energy needs and how to avoid reliance on foreign 
oil 
the document expected to be finished early next year comes at 
a sensitive time on the international front in light of the crisis 
in the oilrich persian gulf 
among the options that have not produced argument within the 
administration is a proposal to open the arctic national wildlife 
refuge to oil exploration and development 
bush has long supported such a move but it is expected to run 
into heavy opposition in congress and from environmentalists

a shipment of magazines for us troops in 
saudi arabia is being held up for about a week because they are 
wrapped in a cover bearing cigarette advertising unaccompanied by a 
required disclaimer the pentagon said friday 
the approximately 101000 magazines were the first shipment to 
be collected by operation desert news a charleston sc 
organization that distributes reading matter to us troops in the 
persian gulf 
the shipment was held up however when the organization decided 
to have the magazines wrapped in special covers with the name of 
the rj reynolds tobacco co on the front and the trademark of the 
companys camel cigarettes on the back 
the wrappers should have had a disclaimer stating that the 
federal government was not endorsing the sponsor or its products or 
paying for the covers said maj maureen deciantis a spokeswoman 
for the us central command at macdill air force base fla 
in this case it was not done because desert news didnt know 
they had to do it and we didnt know they had a tobacco company as 
a backer deciantis said 
pentagon officials found a solution to the problem friday 
were going to print the declaration on the front and take the 
camel off the back said lt col henry wyatt a spokesman for 
the defense logistics agency which oversees the shipments he said 
it was expected to take about a week 
the magazine publisher who organized the shipment said he was 
vexed by the delay 
its magazines that were sending were not sending 
cigarettes said tim karnes publisher of auction guide and the 
organizer of operation desert news 
karnes said the magazines which include life fine woodworking 
and modern drummer were donated to the organization by the 
publishers 
everybody involved knew that rj reynolds was the sponsor 
karnes added 
all the magazines some of which contain cigarette advertising 
were approved by the defense department he said the covers were 
printed wednesday at quebecor printing usa in st cloud minn 
i dont think the advertisement about cigarettes should 
jeopardize the ability to provide this reading material which is 
just desperately needed for morale karnes said in a telephone 
interview from acapulco mexico where he was vacationing 
reynolds is the organizations only corporate sponsor so far 
although karnes said the group was seeking others 
karnes said the organization submitted a rough draft of the 
first page of the cover which may not have contained the rj 
reynolds identification and did not submit the back page 
he said the organization did not realize any disclaimer would be 
needed

three years after joe and joyce cruzan 
asked the courts to let their severely braininjured daughter die 
with dignity her impending death has become a focus of protests 
and legal maneuvers by strangers 
nineteen people were arrested tuesday after they burst into the 
missouri rehabilitation center and tried to reach nancy cruzans 
room to reconnect her feeding tube which was removed dec 14 
antieuthanasia activists had no success in asking various 
courts to force the state to resume feeding ms cruzan their 
appeals were rejected friday by the state supreme court cole 
county court and the us district court missouris highest courts 
rejected other appeals thursday 
about 15 demonstrators continued a roundtheclock vigil on the 
hospital steps friday praying singing and holding signs that read 
please feed nancy cruzan 
from their daughters heavily tinted window on the second floor 
joe and joyce cruzan can see the demonstrators but avoid contact 
with them 
i would have thought the protests would have bothered them but 
they are in so much pain from what would cause us all pain having 
a child die really that is their focus said the couples 
attorney william colby 
ms cruzan 33 has been in a persistent vegetative state since 
a car accident on jan 11 1983 doctors said her condition is 
irreversible and her parents won court approval last month to 
remove the feeding tube 
doctors expected ms cruzan to die within two weeks of the 
tubes removal her condition was listed as deteriorating friday a 
week after the tube was removed 
colby said the cruzans have received a massive outpouring of 
support from people across the country the mail and calls that 
weve received have been 40 or 50to1 in strong support of the 
family he said 
at the same time antieuthanasia activists have converged on 
the redbrick rehabilitation center in this southwestern missouri 
community of 3400 and claimed the cruzan case as an extension of 
their cause 
fourteen demonstrators remained jailed friday giving their name 
as nancy cruzan and vowing to stay there and fast until she is fed 
or dies 
this may be the most important story in the prolife 
history said bob jewitt a spokesman for operation rescue a 
group best known for its antiabortion protests 
ms cruzans courtappointed guardian who told a probate judge 
that letting her die was in her best interest called operation 
rescue founder randall terry and the other demonstrators 
publicityseeking scofflaws 
they are acting through ignorance they have no idea of the 
facts of her situation said thad mccanse a carthage attorney 
doctors say ms cruzan is oblivious to her surroundings cannot 
speak and does not feel emotions or pain she suffers from a 
variety of ailments including severely contorted limbs vomiting 
bleeding gums and diarrhea 
dr ronald cranford a minneapolis neurologist who has examined 
ms cruzan called her a prisoner of medical technology who has 
no hope for recovery 
the question is will the withdrawal of feeding tubes become 
more widespread in letting people like nancy cruzan die 
absolutely said cranford chairman of the american academy of 
neurologys ethics committee 
demonstrators such as yvette williams a parttime caretaker of 
severely disabled children who was a plaintiff in one of the 
lawsuits have expressed concern over such prospects 
our laws protect life miss williams said in a statement 
what is happening here offends me i cannot in conscience be a 
party to the killing of nancy cruzan 
mccanse disagreed 
whats inhumane is maintaining her feeding tube so she can 
live another 30 or 40 years with extensive irreversible brain 
damage if there are any barbarians involved in this its the 
people making a circus out of this mccanse said 
as the ethical debate rages on around them the cruzans have 
been at nancys side virtually since the tube was removed 
the couple who have two other daughters do not regret their 
decision colby said 
knowing nancy as only a family could they knew she wouldnt 
want to go on in her present condition they know theyve done the 
right thing colby said

president mikhail s gorbachev met with eduard 
shevardnadze friday reportedly to discuss some way of keeping his 
longtime ally in the government following his sudden resignation as 
foreign minister 
in parliament reformers turned shevardnadzes unexpected 
resignation into a rallying cry a parade of speakers echoed the 
62yearold diplomats warning that hardliners were pushing the 
country toward dictatorship 
gorbachev talked privately with shevardnadze for two hours about 
the persian gulf crisis and conventional arms reductions in europe 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko told reporters 
ignatenko called the session an ordinary meeting between the 
president and his foreign minister the independent interfax news 
agency said 
presidential aide georgi shakhnazarov said gorbachev also had 
planned to ask shevardnadze why he resigned was it political 
motives or personal motives and depending on the answers it 
would be possible to decide whether to ask him to continue working 
in that role or in another role or to agree on something else 
it was not clear whether gorbachev intended to ask shevardnadze 
to continue as foriegn minister or to take another post a 
shevardnadze aide said thursday the resignation was 
irreversible 
earlier friday tass quoted shakhnazarov as saying shevardnadze 
would stay on gorbachevs team but offered no other details 
there was no further word late friday about the meeting or 
whether gorbachev had reached any decision about the foreign 
ministers job shevardnadze made no public comment 
it also was not known whether shevardnadze would take part in a 
moscow arms control summit feb 1113 between gorbachev and 
president bush 
on thursday shevardnadze stunned gorbachev the parliament and 
the world community by resigning 
in what he called the briefest and most difficult speech of my 
life shevardnadze said reformers had gone and hidden in the 
bushes and dictatorship is coming 
no one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be what kind 
of dictator will come and what order things will take 
shevardnadze said 
his resignation prompted worldwide concern over the future of 
reform in the soviet union 
hardliners have urged gorbachev to impose a state of emergency 
in republics ridden by ethnic conflict and separatist movements 
gorbachev has asked the congress to consider constitutional 
amendments to strengthen his power to deal with such trouble spots 
the hardliners also had criticized soviet endorsement of a un 
resolution on the use of force in the gulf but their main 
criticism was over domestic issues 
a ukrainian lawmaker shook up the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies on friday afternoon by saying a rightwing 
reactionary coup was brewing 
reactionaries centralists and imperialists have united and 
are on the attack lawmaker vladimir chernyak said at the head 
of the coup stands gorbachev its possible he himself doesnt know 
it by demanding for himself more and more powers he is creating 
the legal basis for a dictatorship maybe not for himself 
personally 
chernyak an economist elected from kiev said hardliners 
already have succeeded in forcing shevardnadze and former interior 
minister vadim bakatin from their jobs 
why does gorbachev respond to the right and not the left 
theres no mystery the whole thing is that gorbachev is the son of 
his party and a defender of its interests chernyak said 
gorbachev sat forward in his chair listening intently to the 
ukrainian 
chernyak also called for direct elections for a new president 
and parliament 
a representative of the interregional group a reform faction 
of lawmakers whose members included the late human rights 
campaigner andrei sakharov called on gorbachev to reject pressure 
from hardliners 
we share the alarm of foreign minister shevardnadze about the 
possibility of the breakup of democratic processes in the country 
and the danger of the establishment of a reactionary 
dictatorship said vitaly a chelyshev 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak a prominent reformer took the 
podium to say shevardnadzes warning was more than serious 
he said people were losing faith in the ability to solve 
problems democratically if that is so then only dictatorship is 
left 
however army chief of staff mikhail moiseyev disputed 
shevardnadzes warning of a coming dictatorship and said there 
was no reason to impose a state of emergency as is feared by some 
it is most regrettable that he did this as such an unsuitable 
moment when the congress has to discuss more important tasks and 
find mutually acceptable decisions to consolidate all forces and 
extricate the country from grave crisis moiseyev said according 
to tass 
in their meeting gorbachev also planned to ask why shevardnadze 
never consulted him before resigning the presidents aide said 
shevardnadze was his companion a person he worked with 
placed trust in so if he was leaving he should have said 
something shakhnazarov said 
shevardnadze has won international praise since being appointed 
in 1985 by gorbachev who won this years nobel peace prize for 
foreign policy successes 
under shevardnadzes stewardship the soviet union pulled its 
troops out of afghanistan negotiated cuts in nuclear arsenals 
allowed east european countries to oust communist regimes and ended 
antagonistic relations with cold war foes

in parts of the nations capital violence 
doesnt seem to rattle the kids anymore not even the classmates of 
four junior high school students shot after class along with a 
6yearold girl by rivals firing from a passing car 
they look at it like its just the neighborhood said a 
teacher friday at the imposing cinderblock shaw junior high 
school its another day at the office no big deal he said 
requesting anonymity 
in many communities the day after a multiple shooting of 
children the youngest 6 and the eldest 15 would have meant a 
rush of counselors into the local schools to calm the fears of 
students who must walk the same tough streets 
but not here 
here the students generally did not mention the shootings and 
teachers made no special effort to draw them out the one teacher 
said as students chatted animatedly during lunch period 
three arrests had been made two of the students were released 
from the hospital three remained all improving 
this is the city that has had a record 471 homicides this year 
30 of them juveniles according to the police count this is the 
city that has seen an additional 1163 people shot 204 of them 
juveniles 
thursdays shootings resulted from an altercation a week or two 
ago between two loosely organized groups of young people said 
police chief isaac fulwood but he declined to say what it was 
about 
when asked if the dispute involved drugs as 40 percent of the 
homicides this year have fulwood lashed out 
i dont know whether it was drugrelated or not but i doubt 
it dont make everything drugrelated it cheapens the violence 
he blamed easy access to guns pervasive violence on television 
and a breakdown in values saying the altercation between the 
groups would have been settled in the old days by a simple fist 
fight 
family breakups and the lack of parents inculcating values in 
their children have led to a society that believes anything goes 
in order to get what i want fulwood said 
the chief said he has spoken to young people about shootings and 
he has found they show no remorse not the first tear theres no 
sense that theres anything wrong 
the attack about 3 pm thursday involved multiple gunshots by 
shooters in a car passing by the victims 
police arrested three juveniles one 16 and the other two 14 
before dawn friday two other 14yearold suspects were still at 
large fulwood said 
no names were released because of their ages and the chief said 
no decision had yet been made on whether to try any as adults 
three were arraigned friday in juvenile court 
all five victims were treated at childrens national medical 
center xaziver paul 6 and troy gray 15 were discharged friday 
spokeswoman barbara cire said 
brian lewis 12 was listed in good condition john olden 13 
and clarence richmond 14 were in fair condition all improved 
after first being termed in serious condition 
two children were shot in the chest two in the abdomen and one 
in the arm said dr marty eichelberger director of emergency 
trauma services at the hospital 
there are five kids and there are a lot of holes 
eichelberger said 
fulwood praised the principal of the junior high school dr 
percy ellis and the school staff saying they were pivotal in 
tracking down the alleged assailants 
ellis declined reporters requests for interviews 
the shootings didnt come as a complete surprise to police 
officers went to the junior high school earlier thursday when 
officials heard something was going down said lt reginald 
smith a police spokesman instead it happened about eight blocks 
away as the victims stood near a picket fence in the shaw 
residential area of northwest washington 
shaw is one of the citys poorest neighborhoods but it is 
expected to experience an economic upturn next year when a subway 
station opens 
already its a mixture of lowrise singlefamily townhouses 
some of them with small but carefully manicured yards and christmas 
decorations draping the front doors houses subdivided into 
apartments and boarded up buildings a baseball field is near the 
intersection where the shootings occurred theres a large

gov michael s dukakis couldnt stop clouds from 
blocking the sun over historic boston common friday but he signed 
into law a bill to prevent new buildings from shadowing the common 
for more than one hour a day 
the good lord is casting a shadow over us all here even as i 
speak dukakis said before he signed the bill standing at the 
edge of the park 
commons are found in many new england towns boston common was 
established in 1634 when the citys first settler a hermit named 
william blackstone agreed to sell 45 acres to the town of boston 
boston common was first used as a pasture for citizens animals 
later it was a training site for the militia and the site of 
public hangings 
today the common is a popular tourist attraction its located 
on beacon hill just below the golddomed massachusetts statehouse 
senate president william bulger who represents parts of boston 
sponsored the bill which he said will give a greater protection 
for this particular important part of our lives 
the new law also applies to the common in the nearby town of 
lynn the bills sponsors added lynn to the measure to bypass a 
requirement that the city first approve the measure boston mayor 
raymond flynn had opposed the bill but went along with it after it 
was amended slightly 
the lameduck governor said one thing he will miss in leaving 
office next month is looking out on the common from his office 
window 
dukakis the 1988 democratic presidential candidate did not 
seek reelection as governor this year republican william weld was 
elected and will be inaugurated on jan 3 
i can tell you that there have been many occasions where for a 
variety of reasons i have needed a certain amount spiritual 
uplifting dukakis said and theres nothing like walking over 
to that window and looking down

the federal government ran up a 481 billion 
deficit in november a 62 percent increase over a year ago due in 
part to the persian gulf buildup and a failing economy the 
treasury department reported friday 
combined with the october deficit the imbalance for the first 
two months of fiscal 1991 totaled 795 billion up 425 percent 
from the comparable period of fiscal 1990 
economist michael k evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm said the weakening economy is resulting in declining tax 
revenues 
its really getting to the point where the deficit is starting 
to balloon because both personal and corporate taxes are starting 
to fall off he said receipts in november were 6 billion less 
than they should have been in a normal economy 
the government collected 272 billion in individual income 
taxes last month a 21 percent decline from november 1989 at the 
same time corporate income taxes were down 46 percent to 13 
billion 
at the same time defense spending increased 18 percent from a 
year ago to 29 billion reflecting the military buildup in the 
middle east and spending on the savings and loan bailout jumped to 
28 billion up 220 percent from the 879 million outlay in 
november 1989 
overall receipts totaled 728 billion in november up 23 
percent from the same month last year spending however jumped 20 
percent from 1009 billion in 1989 to 1209 billion last month 
the deficit is the difference between the two 
the bush administration already has conceded the fiscal 1991 
deficit will set a new record budget director richard darman has 
projected the imbalance at between 250 billion and 300 billion 
the congressional budget office on the other hand forecasts a 
320 billion gap this year 
the deficit in fiscal 1990 was 2204 billion just shy of the 
2212 billion record set in 1986 
as usual the biggest spending categories were the military 
social security and other programs of the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 51 billion so far this year it is 
projected to total 2922 billion for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 215 billion for the month 
and 410 billion for the year they are projected to total 2622 
billion for the year 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
178 billion in august and 351 billion for 1990 so far they are 
projected to total 2104 billion in fiscal 1990 
interest on the national debt amounted to 219 billion for the 
month and 400 billion so far this year it is projected to total 
2870 billion for the entire year

romanians rallied on the first 
anniversary of the revolution that toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu but the marches were tinged by frustrations over 
increasing economic hardships 
rallies in bucharest and timisoara the cradle of last years 
revolution capped a week of protests against ceausescus 
successors romanians are frustrated with the lack of improved 
living standards since 1989 
about 15000 people gathered in bucharests university square 
chanting slogans against president ion iliescu another 15000 
workers rallied in timisoara 300 miles northwest of the capital 
the two weeks prior to the revolutions anniversary have been 
marked by strikes and protests against the national salvation front 
government 
the front which took power during the revolution and won 
subsequent may elections faces sliding popularity over its plans 
to reform the economy that include raising prices on basic goods 
illiescu is a liar and he will fall down down down 
the bucharest crowd chanted 
in an address friday to parliament iliescu said the government 
must press ahead with reforms despite growing popular opposition 
we must prove we are ready for democracy iliescu said 
adding that 1991 would be a decisive year for all our reforms 
on university square where police shot and killed demonstrators 
last dec 21 crowds knelt and lighted candles in memory of the 
uprisings 1039 dead 
after a minute of silence the antigovernment chants continued 
in timisoara protesters also chanted down with iliescu and 
down with communism 
about 75000 industrial workers in timisoara where the uprising 
began dec 16 1989 have been on strike for a week they rally 
daily in the city 
other strikes have included more than 100000 students and 
hundreds of professors a protest by navigators at the tarom state 
airline has paralyzed internal flights and stranded many 
international travelers 
many romanians are disillusioned with the results of the 
revolution feeling little has changed in a country plagued by 
shortages critics also charge that front leaders many of them 
former communists still harbor authoritarian tendencies 
echoing the battle cry directed at ceausescu one year ago the 
crowd in bucharest chanted timisoara timisoara the bloody 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators began the popular unrest 
in bucharest last year 
a year ago the army police and securitate secret police 
made a pact with the devil to bring iliescu to power said one 
speaker at the bucharest rally 
the square was ringed with blue police vans but no incidents 
were reported 
the large open area between bucharest university and the 
national theater was where last years revolution took hold of the 
capital and protesters died challenging police and the army 
the next day hundreds of thousands rallied in the streets of 
bucharest forcing ceausescu and his wife elena to flee the couple 
was captured by the army and summarily tried and executed dec 25 
the square which is also the capitals central intersection 
has since been the site of repeated antigovernment protests some 
ending in violent clashes with police 
rally organizers said the demonstration would continue through 
the night until saturday morning but many were disappointed by 
fridays turnout 
we are so few because the government lies to people through 
television said one woman others blamed the cold snowy weather 
a sharp contrast to springlike days that preceded last years 
events 
at one point the crowd began chanting long live king 
michael referring to the hohenzollern monarch forced to 
abdicate by the communists in 1946 he lives in exile in 
switzerland 
his daughter princess margarita who watched fridays rally 
from a balcony of a luxury hotel overlooking the square said she 
thought a restoration of constitutional monarchy in romania was 
possible 
the people need a father they need a figure a symbol of 
unity said margarita 40 in romania on a threeweek aid mission 
to orphanages and other charities

the white house raised doubts friday that the united states 
would attack ira immediately if it fails to meet next months 
deadline for withdrawing from kuwait january 15 is not an attack 
day at all said brent scowcroft president bushs national 
security adviser 
 
in saudi arabia us defense secretary dick cheney told troops 
that war was closer it increasingly looks like saddams not 
getting the message and well have to use force cheney said 
the only acceptable outcome if hostilities begin is absolute 
total victory 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told 
the troops that in the event of an attack we will launch it 
violently we will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so 
we can get it over as quickly as possible and theres no question 
who won 
 
iraqi president saddam hussein predicted victory in any war he 
also stood by his refusal to pull out of kuwait by the jan 15 
deadline 
in the event of war there will be great losses not just in 
terms of human life those who now say yes to war will be 
responsible allah is on our side so we will defeat the 
aggressors saddam told germanys zdf television network 
 
british prime minister john major said in washington that iraqi 
troops will have to be forcibly removed from kuwait if saddam 
does not agree to withdraw them peacefully major said a partial 
iraqi pullback would not be acceptable 
 
a million iraqis heeded air raid sirens and jammed roads out of 
baghdad in an evacuation drill to test readiness for war 
residents clutching blankets and food jumped into cars or rushed 
to special centers where they caught buses to evacuation camps set 
up outside the capital

the federal election commission voted 
unanimously to dismiss allegations that proisrael lobbying groups 
broke election laws by illegally coordinating their activities 
according to documents released friday 
the commission said its six members find no reason to 
believe the american israel public affairs committee aipac 
violated lobbying rules in connection with 27 political action 
committees around the country 
the vote was taken last year but was kept secret because an 
unrelated complaint involving aipac and other organizations is 
still pending said commission spokesman fred eiland 
the agency disclosed its findings only after lengthy arguments 
with the complainants who requested publication of the material 
under the freedom of information act 
the complaint filed jan 12 1989 was brought by several 
former us officials who have long argued that aipac exercises 
undue influence on congress and skews us foreign policy in 
israels favor 
they accused aipac of failing to disclose what they said was its 
coordination of the 27 other pacs 
in the undecided case the same plaintiffs contended aipac 
should have registered as a political action committee because 
they said it targeted political candidates for election or defeat 
based on their position toward israel this case involves the 
alleged use of a black book containing vital information on 
every senate and house race 
aipac responded that such activities were internal 
communications with its 55000 members and protected by supreme 
court rulings 
in the case that it decided the fec said there was not enough 
evidence to show that aipac and the other proisrael committees 
were affiliated 
although the 27 pacs received information regarding 
congressional races it appears that each respondent pac makes 
independent decisions regarding which candidates to support the 
commission said 
the plaintiffs demanded that aipac be forced to register as a 
public action committee and disclose its activities a move that 
would have hampered behindthescenes lobbying with congress and 
the administration 
among the plaintiffs were onetime ambassador to saudi arabia 
james e akins paul findley who says he lost his seat in congress 
in 1982 because of an aipac campaign and george ball who served 
as undersecretary of state in the kennedy and johnson 
administrations 
the complaint relied on large measure on news reports about the 
activities of the lobbying group in addition to two internal aipac 
memoranda 
aipacs 125page response accompanied by hundreds of pages of 
exhibits said no one directs american jews to become active in 
liberal organizations or conservative organizations or in 
political campaigns or to give to candidates or to form political 
organizations of their own 
the fec found that the similar pattern of political 
contributions by the 27 pacs resulted from their focus on 
candidates who support israel and did not reflect collusion between 
them and aipac

saddam hussein said in an interview broadcast 
friday that us forces would not be able to sustain a prolonged 
war with iraq and president bush would be forced to order a retreat 
after american casualties mounted to 5000 
saddam in the interview on germanys zdf television network 
refused again to pull out of kuwait by the jan 15 deadline set by 
the united nations for avoiding force 
but the iraqi leader also claimed to be interested in holding 
talks with the us government 
from our side the door for a dialogue still remains open 
said the iraqi president we are for a dialogue without it 
there is no understanding 
zdf broadcast the interview friday evening saying it had been 
conducted in baghdad the day before 
in the event of war there will be great losses not just in 
terms of human life those who now say yes to war will be 
responsible saddam said allah is on our side so we will 
defeat the aggressors 
the iraqi leader made his comments in arabic and they were 
translated into german by the television network the associated 
press in turn translated the remarks into english 
when 5000 americans have fallen president bush will have 
to end such a war not because they the troops are bad but 
because he is a bad leader said saddam he is sending the 
soldiers to their death without reason 
asked whether he would pull his troops out of kuwait by the jan 
15 deadline set by the united nations the iraqi chief answered 
no 
we are certain that even when bush pushes his country into 
war which he plans he cant keep it going saddam said 
he accused the us government of aiming to conquer the holy 
places of islam by sending troops to the desert of saudi arabia 
and said bush was failing to try to solve the true problems of the 
region 
so we say to bush leave our country saddam said if 
there are problems among the arabs they can solve them the best by 
themselves 
asked whether a war with the united states and the rest of the 
multinational force would mean suicide for his country saddam 
responded we are moslems and dont believe in suicide 
defense secretary dick cheney said friday in saudi arabia that 
war with iraq was increasingly likely absolute total victory 
is the only option if war breaks out he said

in a rare mood southern californians 
praised a freeway instead of cursing it as the granddaddy of 
freeways celebrated its 50th birthday friday 
though the 82mile pasadena freeway the first in the west 
looks like a museum piece the sunken sixlane freeway is among the 
states safest despite thrillride curves and floorit 
suddenstop ramps 
the first fivemile section of the freeway opened dec 30 1940 
in a small park beside one especially harrowing curve the 
california department of transportation celebrated the anniversary 
with a sign denoting the spans significance 
almost predictably the celebrations marching band caused some 
passing motorists to swerve in the narrowgauge lanes 
joining the festivities were descendants of construction crew 
members and the gabrielino indians who transferred the land to the 
state in a 1940 ceremony public officials and the university of 
southern california marching band 
sally stanton rubsamen the 1940 rose queen who dedicated the 
ribbon of concrete a halfcentury ago recalled trips to school 
using successively longer parts of the newly completed surface 
it was a freeway then she said 
adding that she now commutes daily from pasadena to los angeles 
rubsamen said the lanes are a bit narrow its a little curvy 
its beautiful but some of the on ramps and off ramps are 
atrocious 
nearly 130000 cars a day roll over the pasadena freeway which 
meanders from downtown los angeles to pasadena through the arroyo 
seco the dry gulch was surveyed but not used for a road in 1895 
when first proposed the freeways promise was pasadena to downtown 
in 10 minutes some trips now take more than an hour 
although roads called parkways were already built in the east 
and the autobahn was about to cross germany no one new what to 
call what was then billed as the cutting edge of transportation 
development 
stopless motorway was one suggestion 
it was built in 33 months at a cost of 1 millionplus a mile 
freeways today cost 100 million per mile it was originally 
designed for travel at 45 mph without traffic some commuters whip 
around its curves at 70 
it was the new thing in transportation engineering said 
alfred himelhoch an engineer on the project we didnt know too 
much about it because we were on the cutting edge 
himelhoch who has since worked on nearly every freeway in the 
los angeles area recalled the trepidation of starting work on the 
new project 
its scary to work on any freeway he said 
public reaction to the project was not divided by the protests 
surrounding modern freeway construction he added it was a new 
venture and people didnt know as much about a freeway the 
discussion as to merit and impact on the community came later 
himelhoch said each lane is 10 or 11 feet wide falling short of 
todays 12foot standard motorists sometimes have 10 feet to 
accelerate to 55 miles per hour and some exits require cars to 
slow to 5 mph while still in the slow lane 
but himelhoch said safety was the main goal of any freeway more 
important than moving people 
freeways are three times as safe as surface roads because of 
the divider between directions and the ramps which bring cars 
smoothly onto them he said 
the pasadena freeways safety rate is 184 reportable accidents 
for every million vehicle miles traveled one of californias best 
state officials said 
the los angeles freeway system contains 4 percent of the surface 
area of californias roads but carries more than 40 percent of the 
states traffic 
though celebrating the route that paved the way for 4047 miles 
of future freeways officials friday hinted at the end of the 
freeway age 
fifty years ago this magnificent and ambitious project was the 
answer to the transit needs of a growing and increasingly mobile 
population said state sen art torres but today our needs are 
drastically increased and the demands of the environment must 
force us to look beyond 
torres advocated a light rail system and a proposed monorail 
that would run 58 miles along the los angeles river to long beach 
perhaps more freeways are not the answer torres said

the securities and exchange commission filed 
civil fraud charges friday against the bankrupt latin investment 
corp an uninsured storefront bank whose collapse threw more 
than 68 million in deposits into jeopardy 
the sec lawsuit filed in federal court in washington also 
sought a court order freezing the assets of three top officers of 
latin investment corp which catered primarily to latin american 
immigrants 
the washingtonbased corporations assets were frozen dec 15 
when it was forced into involuntary bankruptcy 
the sec said it had contacted the government of el salvador to 
locate any assets there that would be subject to a freeze order 
also named in the lawsuit were lic founder fernando leonzo of 
vienna va the corporations secretary leonel salinas of falls 
church va and vice president jose a cortes of arlington va 
the three men also sit on the board of el latino a weekly 
hispanic newspaper and lic subsidiary 
the secs civil complaint was filed just three days after leonzo 
invoked his fifth amendment rights against self incrimination and 
refused to answer questions under oath according to documents 
filed by the agency 
many of the investors put much of their life savings in lic 
relying on materially false and misleading representations of lic 
leonzo salinas and cortes the complaint charged 
according to the complaint lic founded in 1982 had about 
3500 investors who had placed about 68 million with the 
investment company as of august 1990 
but the wilson international center a private community group 
that is helping victims of lics collapse said the amount in 
jeopardy was more like 13 million in deposits an average of more 
than 3700 apiece 
the sec lawsuit sought a court order requiring full restitution 
to investors who were defrauded 
the lawsuit also sought a restraining order to keep the three 
officers from destroying any documents or transferring assets 
the complaint alleges that lic which operated without a bank 
charter or government banking insurance misled investors into 
thinking their funds would be safe and available on demand 
the sec also alleged that the three officers did not disclose to 
investors that they received more than 500000 in loans some of 
which was used to pay for their homes from the investment company 
as of august none of those loans had been repaid the sec said 
leonzo through his lawyer charles pearson denied the sec 
allegations 
we have a different version of events and that will certainly 
come forward in due time pearson said were not trying to 
hide anything what were trying to do is repay depositors 
last week a federal bankruptcy judge ordered without 
opposition from leonzo that the company be liquidated

defense secretary dick cheney 
said friday a us attack against iraqi forces is growing 
increasingly likely he promised cheering troops they wont sit 
indefinitely in the desert and absolute total victory is the 
only option if war begins 
joining cheney in hawkish pep rallies with troops in the 
northeast saudi desert was gen colin powell the joint chiefs of 
staff chairman who said he still hoped for resolution of the 
persian gulf crisis without war but then drew roars of applause 
when he pledged 
when we launch it we will launch it violently we will launch 
it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over as 
quickly as possible and theres no question who won 
cheney said he was not optimistic washington and iraq would hold 
toplevel talks on the crisis let alone resolve it by the jan 15 
un deadline for saddam hussein to withdraw his army from kuwait 
president bush has threatened to attack if that deadline isnt 
met and the two sides have been unable to agree on dates for talks 
in baghdad and washington 
it increasingly looks like hes not getting the message and 
well have to use force cheney said of saddam 
in washington meanwhile national security adviser brent 
scowcroft said that jan 15 is not an attack day at all but a 
warning to saddam that after that date he is at risk 
one of the important points were trying to get across to him 
is that we havent blinked so far were not blinking now and we 
will not blink scowcroft said in an interview with the 
associated press and reporters from other news agencies 
cheney and powell fresh from three days of strategy sessions 
with field commanders in saudi arabia were asked by troops whether 
american ground forces would be ready to fight by the jan 15 un 
deadline for saddam to withdraw from kuwait 
the troops apparently were well aware of the controversy stirred 
by the deputy commander of operation desert shield lt gen calvin 
ah waller who said wednesday that stillarriving ground troops 
might not be combat ready until well into february 
asked by an airman how long the united states would wait to 
attack if the deadline passed without an iraqi withdrawal cheney 
said 
while i cant tell you a specific date for obvious reasons 
when that would happen i can say that we are eager to get this 
wrapped up as quickly as possible we do not think that waiting 
indefinitely is going to solve the problem and im confident well 
move as soon as we can to wrap it up 
but he did not say when he believed american forces would be 
ready for such an attack 
powell said at one point i think were ready now only to 
say seconds later that some forces were still arriving and would 
not be combat ready for some time 
at their first two stops at a sprawling installation that 
includes huge air force and army camps cheney promised the troops 
that if fighting begins there will be the freedom and 
flexibility to run a firstclass military operation all the way 
in an apparent reference to vietnam he said us forces wont 
have their hands tied behind their backs there wont be 
sanctuaries where the enemy can take cover 
the troops applauded 
cheney and powell also offered christmas greetings and promised 
the troops they had the support of bush and the american public 
but they spent most of their time talking tough 
the only acceptable outcome if hostilities begin is 
absolute total victory cheney said 
powell added when we go in we go in to win not fool 
around 
asked how the united states would respond if saddam used 
chemical weapons cheney said bush would have at his disposal a 
full spectrum of capabilities the response of the united 
states will be overwhelming and devastating 
virtually all of the troops at the appearances even some out 
of uniform in shorts and tshirts had gas masks strapped to their 
waists 
cheney and powell had been scheduled to split up and fly by 
helicopter to army and marine camps respectively but strong 
swirling winds grounded the helicopters so the plans were altered 
most of the troops seemed happy to see their bosses although 
cheney and powell faced complaints about the uncertainty of the 
deployment length and the loss of extra food allowances paid to 
troops who live off base in the united states 
at the first stop airman r l miller said he wanted the crisis 
resolved immediately 
there are two ways to go north or home he said

the government said friday it is 
investigating us suspicions that german companies have broken 
un sanctions against iraq over its invasion of kuwait one german 
firm denied the allegations 
washington has given bonn a list of 50 german companies 
suspected of violating the embargo against iraq the news magazine 
der spiegel said 
the magazine said the information came from us wiretaps of 
iraqs overall telephone traffic and intercepting telefax 
messages it did not identify its sources 
the bonn government confirmed it received a list of suspected 
embargo violators and that the allegations were being examined 
but government spokesman dieter vogel said so far no proof had 
emerged that any of the companies made deliveries in violation of 
un sanctions 
its turned out the list at least partially concerns mistaken 
information said vogel who did not elaborate 
the economics ministry spokesman dieter franzen said the 
government was in closest contact with the us embassy and are 
trying to pursue even the slightest suspicion 
der spiegel reported that us officials suspect one german 
firm interatom of supplying iraq with highly sensitive 
nuclear training and equipment 
the magazine said two other german firms which it did not 
identify are believed to have helped iraq with nerve gas 
production 
interatom and its owner the giant electronics conglomerate 
siemens angrily denied the magazines report 
der spiegels claims are simply false said interatom 
spokesman herbert mayer from the companys office in bergisch 
gladbach near cologne 
siemens said in a news release that interatom had signed a 
contract to help iraq build a processing plant for industrial 
piping but the business had nothing to do with nuclear technology 
the contract involved only generally accessible engineering 
knowledge the release said 
were not crazy we dont deliver things that dont correspond 
with the political interests of the west said mayer 
he said the program later was suspended after interatom 
received an indication from the german government which urged 
extreme caution because iraq was looking for military technology 
interatom specializes in atomic energy plan construction and 
uranium enrichment but is also involved in nonnuclear 
engineering 
mayer also said interatom had workers in iraq when saddam 
husseins forces took over kuwait on aug 2 he said the interatom 
workers were trapped in iraq and the last one returned on dec 15

clarence l kelly johnson creator of 
lockheed corps secret skunk works that created americas 
first production jet fighter and a generation of spyplanes died 
friday he was 80 
johnson who led the design of the u2 the sr71 blackbird and 
more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft died at st joseph 
medical center in burbank after a long illness lockheed said the 
illness was not disclosed 
using titanium and sleek shapes johnsons designs broke the 
thermal thicket the highheat problem of supersonic flight 
said donald lopez a senior advisor at the national air and space 
museum in washington dc 
use of titanium alloy on the sr71 rather than standard aluminum 
made flight at high speed possible despite 800degree fahrenheit 
temperatures the blackbird flies at more than 2000 mph and above 
85000 feet 
the skin would glow sometimes lopez said of the blackbirds 
recently retired by the air force pilots could feel the heat 
coming in 
johnson organized the skunk works in burbank in 1943 to build 
the xp80 shooting star the united states first production jet 
fighter 
many designs bore his mark the p38 lightning in world war ii 
the constellation transports the hercules cargo planes the p2v 
antisubmarine patrol aircraft the agena spacecraft and the f104 
starfighter the first production aircraft to fly at twice the 
speed of sound 
the u2 was the first plane able to make a sustained flight 
above 60000 feet and the yf12 and sr71 blackbird remain the 
fastest and highestflying planes in the world the blackbirds 
maximum speed and altitude remain classified 
the air and space museum saluted johnson in its gallery of 
pioneers 
born in ishpeming mich on feb 27 1910 johnson was the 
seventh of nine children of swedish immigrant parents from his 
father a carpenter and bricklayer johnson developed a respect for 
tools according to lockheed he knew by the time he was 12 that he 
wanted to build airplanes 
he studied aeronautical engineering at the university of 
michigan and worked as a consultant on the aerodynamic design of 
cars that were to run in the indianapolis 500 
he went to work for lockheed the same year he received his 
masters degree 1933 he went on to head the skunk works for 30 
years 
the secrecy of the skunk works is so great that even the origin 
of the name is shrouded in mystery although it apparently was 
derived from al capps cartoon strip lil abner which 
featured a moonshine distillery called the skonk works 
johnson retired as a senior vice president in 1975 and retired 
from lockheeds board of directors in 1980 
tony levier the skunk works former chief test pilot described 
johnson as a stern father figure with a direct line to the 
pentagon 
and his planes levier said flew like a dream 
my god he said they were advanced 
johnson is survived by his wife nancy a brother and a sister

the army and the navy said friday the past 
year was their safest on record private vehicle accidents remained 
the biggest killer of soldiers and sailors

accounting period 
total army accidents were down by 1348 from the previous year 
to 8647 and deaths from aviation accidents fell from 35 to 33 
col steven raho deputy director of army safety attributed the

of the budget year said it recorded 255 total deaths from

lithuanian lawmakers demanded an end to soviet 
army patrols in the baltic port of klaipeda and the citys mayor 
labeled the military action a gross interference to civilian 
life tass reported friday 
col ivan chernykh commander of the klaipeda garrison told 
lithuanian authorities that armed units would have the authority to 
check peoples documents and make arrests the official soviet news 
agency said the patrols began thursday 
they were ordered following clashes between civilians and soviet 
soldiers and sailors in klaipeda which has a large military 
presence according to an editor with the independent elta news 
agency 
tass quoted chernykh as saying soldiers with submachine guns 
were patrolling the streets in cars 
the lithuanian supreme council or parliament sent a note to 
president mikhail s gorbachev to protest the patrols and the 
lawmakers demanded their removal and that officers involved be 
punished 
this order is a flagrant violation of the laws and the rights 
of citizens of the republic of lithuania as well as a political 
provocation with the intent to heighten tensions and to create 
potential conflicts said a copy of the note distributed to 
western news agencies 
the note asked gorbachev to revoke the mentioned directives of 
the soviet army authorities and to punish them for their willful 
behavior which is accompanied by the threat of armed violence 
the parliament also asked lithuanians to remain calm and not to 
get involved in conflicts with the patrols 
vytautas cepas the mayor of the city of 200000 people told 
tass the imposition of this special regime was nothing but an 
open provocation and gross interference in the purely civilian 
life of the city 
chernykh said the patrols were justified 
hooligan actions insults to servicemen and the attempts to 
penetrate the territory around the monument to lenin guarded by 
soldiers take place every day he told tass 
lithuania said the orders issued by the soviet military were not 
valid on the territory of the republic lithuania and the other 
baltic republics of estonia and latvia have declared independence 
from the soviet union

decare a state of emergency in the interest of providing 
citizens security under presidential rule local governments 
could be disbanded

attempt to cut off power water or heat to military installations 
would result in the seizure of the facilities by the armed forces

navy officials hoping to overcome a wave of 
damaging revelations about its a12 stealth attack plane launched 
a public campaign friday to rescue the 50 billion program 
navy officials went public with arguments for continuing the 
development program which is classified secret just two weeks 
before defense secretary dick cheneys target date for deciding 
whether to cancel it 
in a move that underscored the economic stakes involved the 
companies holding a 48 billion contract to build the first a12 
prototypes general dynamics corp and mcdonnell douglas corp 
announced thursday they were notifying about 8000 workers that 
they could lose their jobs if the project is killed 
and on friday general dynamics announced a shakeup of its a12 
management it reassigned the a12 program director charles 
anderson his replacement is ted webb the former head of the 
successful f16 fighter jet program who retired last year 
the contractors were ordered by the navy last week to correct 
the projects flaws by jan 2 or face the possibility of being held 
in default of the contract terms the navy cited a failure to 
supply parts on time for final assembly of the prototypes and it 
questioned whether the a12 design was suitable 
cheney has given the navy until jan 4 to show cause why he 
shouldnt terminate the entire project whose schedule delays and 
cost overruns he called intolerable cheney nonetheless said he 
remains convinced that a new carrierbased attack plane with 
radarevading capabilities is urgently needed 
the navy calls the a12 its top priority in weapons development 
the aircraft dubbed the avenger after the world war ii fighter is 
supposed to replace the a6 intruder a carrierbased attack plane 
that the navy says is growing obsolete 
capt mike currie who is responsible for ensuring that the a12 
now on the drawing boards is produced according to the navys 
specifications told the association of naval aviation on friday 
that the plane is vital to us security interests 
its not a matter of wanting a new geewhiz airplane he 
said we just need more airplanes 
vice adm rm dunleavy the navys air warfare chief 
introduced curries presentation to the aviators group by telling 
the friendly audience the future of naval aviation is at a 
crossroads we need the a12 youve got to believe that 
neither dunleavy nor currie would comment on the economic and 
other controversies surrounding the a12 including the recent 
firing of the navy admiral in charge of the program and the 
disclosure that the program is the focus of a criminal 
investigation 
currie said in an interview on thursday that the navy was eager 
to publicly build a case for continuing the a12 project which 
already is at least 1 billion over budget and 18 months behind 
schedule there also are questions about whether the contractors 
can build the aircraft to navy specifications 
a key technical problem is limiting the weight of the aircraft 
while making it sturdy enough to withstand the pressures of 
landings on aircraft carriers 
currie said the a6 lacks the speed maneuverability and 
radarevading technologies to survive against the projected 
threat a euphemism for the pentagons secret forecast of how 
effective future soviet air defenses may be 
he said 90 a6s are deployed in the persian gulf area as part of 
operation desert shield 
computer models show that the a12 is the best though also the 
most expensive of several possible successors to the a6 currie 
said it also is the only one under active development 
of course airplanes are always better on paper he said 
adding ill believe it when i see it

a cambodian peace plan giving the united nations a 
strong role in an interim government was examined by the nations 
four warring factions friday one official warned time was running 
out to settle the conflict 
the world has changed other priorities can and will require 
our attention said french foreign minister roland dumas the 
international community cannot indefinitely work out the fate of 
cambodia if cambodians themselves do not have the political will to 
do so 
but dumas said he was encouraged that no one issued an outright 
rejection of the proposal the meeting of the 12member supreme 
national council of cambodia was expected to continue saturday 
said dumas who urged acceptance of the un plan 
cambodian prime minister hun sen collapsed during the talks 
apparently from fatigue and was hospitalized he was reported in 
satisfactory condition friday 
the council meeting for the second time since its creation 
three months ago is composed of six representatives of hun sens 
vietnamesebacked government and two from each of the three 
factions in the resistance coalition which includes the khmer 
rouge 
the other factions are those of resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk represented in paris by his son prince norodom 
ranariddh and another noncommunist grouping headed by son sann 
dumas said the peace plan agreed to nov 26 by the five 
permanent members of the un security council was a compromise 
text that could be improved but not put into question 
the international conference on peace in cambodia adjourned in 
september 1989 after a monthlong effort failed to reach a 
settlement 
the khmer rouge was toppled from power by a vietnamese invasion 
in december 1978 khmer rouge guerrillas aided by china have 
since waged a war against the government of hun sen joined by the 
smaller armies of sihanouk and son sann 
in his opening remarks dumas tried to ease criticism that the 
proposal gives the united nations too great a role in running the 
country 
the plan calls for the united nations to administer cambodia 
during an interim period leading to free elections while the 
supreme council acts as titular head 
hun sen has already said the plan exceeds the authority of the 
un charter 
he also said that serious measures must be taken to suppress 
the foundations of the communist khmer rouge the strongest 
member of the threeparty resistance coalition 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan a member of the supreme 
national council was among those seated at the negotiating table 
friday 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said the questions posed 
by the council members friday related mainly to the relationship 
between the council and the united nations during the interim 
period various aspects of a ceasefire and withdrawal and the 
elections 
the special un representative raffeudin ahmed also present 
at the meeting will add points raised at the paris meeting to the 
final un proposal dumas said 
dumas acknowledged the un representative would have strong 
powers but said it is in no case a real tutelage as long as the 
supreme national council embodies the sovereignty of cambodia 
however unresolved quarrels among the four cambodian factions 
made it indispensable to give the un final decisionmaking 
power to avoid paralysis of the process leading to elections 
he said 
it was not immediately clear whether progress had been made to 
resolve a dispute over the leadership of the council 
at its only other meeting in september in bangkok the council 
broke up in a dispute over its composition hun sen objected to the 
bid by sihanouk to be president of the council 
sihanouk who supports the khmer rouge said recently he wanted 
to be neither president nor member of the supreme council

the government on friday began 
dismantling the cult of josef stalin ordering all statues and 
symbols bearing his name removed it also reportedly gave 
permission for the first legal opposition rally 
the decision to excise stalin from public life came on what 
would have been the soviet dictators 111th birthday authorities 
also ordered the renaming of all streets institutions and even a 
city named after stalin 
albania became the last eastern european state to reject the 
symbols of stalinism the communist leadership made the decision 
taking into consideration that historic circumstances have 
changed the state news agency ata said 
before the order was issued friday workers already had removed 
the imposing bronze statue of the dictator that had stared down at 
tirana residents since before his death in 1953 
clusters of tirana residents watched all morning as workers 
finished the job dismantling the marblecovered pedestal from its 
place in a central park another giant statue was toppled at a 
textile works in tirana overnight 
fridays decison announced by ata called for the renaming of 
qyteti stalin the last city in europe named after stalin 
also friday the albanian leadership gave its permission for a 
rally by the new opposition democratic party on saturday according 
to opposition sources it would be the first legal opposiiton rally 
in albania since the communists took power in 1944 
several thousand students rallied in tirana last week to demand 
democratic change and to hail the founding of the first 
noncommunist party police did not intervene 
the significance of stalins demise was not lost on albanians 
who were repressed for decades by the ironfisted rule of enver 
hoxha the albanian communist who adored stalin 
the change should have happened a long time ago said an 
albanian journalist on condition of anonymity 
it is not clear however just how far albanian leaders are 
willing to go toward creating a true democracy 
albanias nascent opposition has encountered numerous obstacles 
most of all the ruling party opposition leaders say local 
communist officials still hinder party activists travelling to 
provincial cities 
there is also entrenched support for the communists in the 
media with few details on the newly recognized democratic party 
appearing in news reports 
and the ruling communists are playing tough cracking down on 
riots in four cities last week with a massive show of army and 
police force and handing out tough sentences of up to 20 years to 
those arrested 
tirana was the last capital in europe to boast a monument to the 
soviet dictator whose personality cult led to the murder of 
millions on the continent 
now lets take down the statue of the dictator who ruled here 
for 50 years said one bold youth watching the workers friday 
he was referring to a giant statue of hoxha that dominates the 
nearby central square 
dismantling hoxhas legacy will prove complicated although he 
has been held responsible for cruel repression in the 1950s and the 
isolationist policy that has brought albanias economy close to 
collapse hoxha achieved national unity and independence for 
virtually the first time in the balkan nations turbulent history 
his name is emblazoned on buildings streets and memorials 
throughout albania and his books and portraits adorn every 
institution 
yet president ramiz alia who took over after hoxha died in 
1985 appears to be pushing his reforms through despite the 
presence of hardliners in the secretive ruling elite 
the end of stalins cult came one day after hoxhas 71yearold 
widow nexhmije hoxha lost her last political post as head of the 
communistled democratic front officially retiring because of old 
age 
she was replaced by premier adil carcani who is in his late 
60s rumors persist that carcani will step down soon as head of 
government 
the communists promised a government change when they bowed 
earlier this month to demands for more democracy but so far no 
changes have been announced 
a party conference dec 26 is expected to give some indication 
of the partys new policies it is supposed to decide a program for 
elections scheduled for feb 10 in which the communists will face 
opposition for the first time since taking power in 1944 
the newly founded democratic party is pushing for postponement 
of the elections arguing it has insufficient time to organize 
to date the media have reported no details of the new partys 
program the party is also negotiating with the government to 
publish its own daily newspaper

here is the text of the philadelphia 
inquirers dec 12 editorial that sparked controversy within the 
newspapers staff 
two stories from yesterdays newspaper 
the us food and drug administration approves norplant a 
contraceptive that can keep a woman from getting pregnant for five 
years 
a black research organization reports that nearly half the 
nations black children are living in poverty and that the 
younger the child the more likely he or she is to be living with a 
single mother on welfare growing numbers of them will not 
succeed the studys author says 
as we read those two stories we asked ourselves dare we 
mention them in the same breath to do so might be considered 
deplorably insensitive perhaps raising the specter of eugenics 
but it would be worse to avoid drawing the logical conclusion that 
foolproof contraception could be invaluable in breaking the cycle 
of inner city poverty one of americas greatest challenges 
the main reason more black children are living in poverty is 
that the people having the most children are the ones least capable 
of supporting them the black middle class is growing but its 
birth rate is very low this trend as childrens defense fund 
president marian wright edelman has said practically guarantees 
the poverty of the next generation of black children 
now there are many ways to fight back from better prenatal 
care to better schools but its very tough to undo the damage of 
being born into a dysfunctional family so why not make a major 
effort to reduce the number of children of any race born into 
such circumstances more hites than blacks live in poverty 
though poor blacks make up a higher percentage of people who are 
more or less permanently on welfare 
no one should be compelled to use norplant which involves a 
doctor implanting matchsticksize capsules in a womans upper arm 
but there could be incentives to do so what if welfare mothers 
were offered an increased benefit for agreeing to use this new 
safe longterm contraceptive remember these women already have 
one or more children and they can change their minds at any point 
and become fertile again this is not indira ghandi offering 
portable radios to women who agree to be sterilized at the very 
minimum norplant which will probably cost 600 to 1000 should 
be made available for free to poor women 
all right the subject makes us uncomfortable too but were 
made even more uncomfortable by the impoverishment of black america 
and its effect on the nations future think about it

the white house raised doubts friday that the 
united states would attack iraq immediately if it fails to meet 
next months deadline for withdrawing from kuwait january 15 is 
not an attack day at all a senior official said 
brent scowcroft the national security adviser to president 
bush said the jan 15 date was an authorization date that 
tells iraqi president saddam hussein hed better get moving now 
after the 15th of january he is at risk 
bush meanwhile underscored his determination to expel iraq 
soon 
it cant drag on with indecision and it cant stop short of 
the un mandate that saddam completely leave kuwait bush 
said see that argues very forcefully against some of these 
scenarios that call for somebody to compromise well give him 
something for this give him something so he saves face that is 
not in the books 
bush made his comments in an interview with us news amp world 
report on deciding whether to go to war bush said on this 
question ive got it boiled down very clearly to good vs evil 
and it helps if you can be that clear in your own mind 
he said his view was reinforced by an amnesty international 
report detailing human rights abuses in kuwait it helps one come 
to a recognition that the right must prevail the president said 
the jan 15 deadline was prescribed in a united nations security 
council resolution authorizing all means necessary to expel iraq 
from kuwait unless it withdraws on its own by then 
it doesnt say he is going to be attacked this date or that 
date or whatever scowcroft said in an interview with the 
associated press and reporters rom other news agencies 
one of the important points were trying to get across to him 
is that we havent blinked so far were not blinking now and we 
will not blink he added 
scowcroft also said saddam probably was comforted by thursdays 
resignation of soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who 
has backed the tough us stand against iraq 
earlier this week bush said he wanted to see the united nations 
resolutions fulfilled right on schedule 
moreover he said i think at midnight on jan 15 if hes 
not totally out of kuwait the un sanctions must be fulfilled 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said friday there was a good prospect that war could be 
averted 
i think that the chance that saddam hussein will back out of 
this thing is strong aspin said at the center for strategic and 
international studies 
he said the administration was trying force the issue to a head 
soon what were talking about is time lines do you bring it to 
a head now meaning between now and february late winter or do 
we wait for a year to 18 months for the sanctions to work 
i dont think its a good policy to try and wait for a year to 
18 months to bring it to a head aspin said 
for the second time this week bush met with ambassadors from 
nations that have contributed money and military power to the 
persian gulf standoff with saddam the president refused to answer 
reporters questions 
bah humbug he said in his best scrooge imitation in the 
spirit of christmas were not going to have any questions 
in his interview scowcroft said his remarks were not intended 
to raise or dampen prospects for military action jan 15 
what im saying is the 15th doesnt mean that the troops and 
aircraft start to move on the 15th its an authorization date for 
the use of all measures and that obviously is the use of force 
he said 
asked if the president had a date in mind for military action 
scowcroft replied not that i know of he may have 
i hope we dont go to war scowcroft said what we are not

the white house said friday the resignation of 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was troubling 
and expressed concern that moscow might back away from its program 
of reforms 
the administrations secondday analysis of shevardnadzes 
departure reflected clear unease about what lies ahead in terms of 
internal divisions in the soviet union and ussoviet cooperation 
on the persian gulf and arms control 
president bush said there was no evidence that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev was changing his gulf policy 
ive talked to gorbachev at length about it and i would be 
very surprised if he shifted and i see no evidence of it the 
president said in an interview with us news amp world report 
bush said he was surprised by shevardnadzes resignation adding 
that we have great respect for him 
as for chances for a soviet dictatorship a fear expressed by 
shevardnadze bush said i dont know 
i know that there has been concern there about the appearance 
of anarchy and dissolution of the state 
bush said he discussed gorbachevs problems with him during a 
meeting last month in paris i think he is still committed to 
reform and openness but beyond that i cant go the president 
said 
brent scowcroft the national security adviser to president 
bush said one person who would be happy about shevardnadzes 
resignation would be iraqi president saddam hussein 
shevardnadze has been a strong supporter of the us stand in 
the persian gulf but if youre saddam hussein naturally 
anybody whos removed from the scene who has had that policy would 
be welcome to go scowcroft said 
he discussed shevardnadzes action in an interview with the 
associated press and other news agencies 
there is no doubt that its troubling in some respects 
scowcroft said he has been if not the architect the 
implementer of much of the foreign policy changes that weve seen 
over the past several years 
but scowcroft added we dont base our policy on 
personalities the basic architect soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev is still there but i think the concern is whether or 
not he thinks there is a shift in direction internally and we feel 
strongly that the reforms should continue 
specifically he said shevardnadzes warning of a dictatorship 
emerging in the soviet union was troubling 
he noted that the foreign minister in his resignation speech 
thursday pointed right at the uniformed colonels and blamed them 
for wanting to reverse some of the perestroika reform programs 
bush and gorbachev tentatively are set to meet in moscow feb 
1113 for the signing of a treaty still be negotiated to slash 
strategic nuclear weapons shevardnadze has been a key player in 
the arms talks 
asked if the summit timing might be affected by shevardnadzes 
departure scowcroft said at this point i would say no but 
we have to wait and see what the impact of the change in the soviet 
union may be in policy terms and it may not be any at all 
as far as the persian gulf is concerned scowcroft said our 
perception is that president gorbachev is strongly of the same 
view as shevardnadze in backing the united states 
i think theres no doubt that he shevardnadze was strongly 
strongly in favor of the role that the soviet union has played in 
the gulf policy scowcroft said theres no question about 
that whether it will be diminished by his departure its hard to 
tell at this point

african intervention force already in monrovia would police a 
ceasefire agreed nov 28 
fridays statement said another meeting would be held within 30 
days to discuss monitoring the ceasefire in the meantime the 
three armies said they would remain in positions they held when the 
fighting stopped

of slain president samuel does army led by brig hezekiah bowen

the croatian parliament adopted a new 
constitution friday that would give the countrys secondlargest 
republic the right to secede media reports said 
the move is likely to worsen the traditionally tense relations 
between croatians and minority serbs in the republic 
the new constitution follows an electoral victory last spring by 
the centerright government over communists who had been ruling the 
republic 
the new document provides for croatia to secede from yugoslavia 
if twothirds of the legislature votes for such a proposal the 
reports said 
they said a statewide plebiscite would then have to be held if 
a simple majority of the electorate votes in favor of secession 
the motion would be upheld 
fridays vote was preceded by an acrimonious debate over 
minority rights between ethnic serbian and croatian deputies in the 
legislature the national tanjug news agency reported 
it said that 16 deputies representing croatias 500000member 
serbian minority walked out of the parliamentary session before the 
vote to protest what they claimed was the failure of the new 
constitution to guarantee their national identity 
also on friday ethnic serbs in knin a town near the central 
adriatic coast proclaimed the autonomy of their krajina area 
saying they would remain part of croatia only if the state stays 
within yugoslavia 
this is a great day for all serbs said jovan raskovic 
political leader of the serbian minority as he raised the serbian 
flag over knin castle radio belgrade reported 
since august one policeman has been killed and several others 
wounded in interethnic violence in krajina 
the croatian authorities have vowed not to permit any part of 
the republic to break away they deny the serbs accusations of 
discrimination contending the communist government in serbia is 
manipulating local serbs to destabilize croatia 
the northern state of slovenia the most prosperous of 
yugoslavias six republics is due sunday to hold a referendum on 
secession slovenia and croatia advocate turning yugoslavia into a 
loose confederation of virtually independent states 
the slovenian ballot is strongly opposed by serbia the 
countrys largest republic which favors the continuation of 
yugoslavia as a federation with a strong central government

president violeta chamorro trying to 
keep peace with her leftist opponents convinced the legislature 
friday to accept a budget limiting cuts for the sandinistaled 
army 
but she won lawmakers support by among other things promising 
to remove the leftist sandinista army commander gen humberto 
ortega by 1993 
the legislative vote following a veto of larger cuts by mrs 
chamorro represents a major defeat for conservatives in her 
coalition they had fought for greater reductions 
however mrs chamorro had said that without the concessions to 
the military the country could be faced with disturbances 
mrs chamorros early months in office were plagued by 
sandinistasponsored general strikes forcing her to sign a 
compromise social pact with her political opponents and touching 
off a backlash in her own coalition 
on friday national legislators voted 6921 to sustain mrs 
chamorros veto of the bill they previously approved that would 
have shaved 196 million from her initial 786 million army 
budget for 1991 the budget approved friday provided 70 million 
for the military 
twentynine members of mrs chamorros coalition switched their 
vote to join one independent deputy and the 39 sandinista deputies 
in sustaining the veto one legislator in the 92member body did 
not vote 
the armys current budget the last approved by the former 
sandinista government was 190 million this year 
presidential secretary antonio lacayo called the vote a rotund 
defeat for the extremists in the 14party united national 
opposition or uno the coalition supported mrs chamorro in her 
february election win over sandinista incumbent daniel ortega the 
army commanders brother 
former sandinista party president sergio ramirez said the vote 
represents an upset for a spurious opposition five uno parties 
voted against mrs chamorros veto 
deputy humberto castilla a hardliner who voted against the 
veto and lower cuts said he rejected mrs chamorros offer because 
they are very vague 
vicepresident virgilio godoy who has opposed mrs chamorros 
concessions to the sandinistas called the veto a serious 
mistake 
uno mayors and former contra rebels launched a wave of riots 
protest blockades and building takeovers in november in eastern 
nicaragua they demanded removal of gen ortega as army chief 
in a prepared speech friday mrs chamorro promised to replace 
gen ortega by 1993 she said she will replace him with a civilian 
only when i feel that the process of military reduction has 
surpassed the stage that i consider critical and risky to the 
country 
she said the general is the only man who has the moral 
authority and the capability to effect the reductions in the size 
of the army without creating a crisis assembly budget committee 
president luis humberto guzman said 
mrs chamorro has said any drastic changes within the armed 
forces could produce sandinista discontent and shatter the 
countrys fragile internal peace mrs chamorro has promised to cut 
3000 soldiers during 1991 she has reduced troop strength from 
100000 to 28434 since she took office april 25

safety experts on friday projected between 380 
and 480 people will die in traffic accidents on us highways 
during the fourday christmas holiday 
the national safety council each year estimates the number of 
holiday traffic fatalities for the heavily traveled holiday period 
which began at 6 pm friday and ends at 1159 pm tuesday 
last year 372 people died during the threeday christmas 
holiday 
this years projection is higher because christmas falls on a 
tuesday extending the holiday period an additional day said 
council statistician terry miller 
safety officials say the death toll could be lower than in 
previous fourday christmas periods because high gasoline prices 
may deter people from making long car trips or from going to social 
events 
people may just decide to limit their driving to necessary 
errands going to the store and other things of that nature 
miller said but its hard to predict peoples behavior in such 
situations 
the council makes its projections by comparing the average 
number of traffic deaths each day of the current year with 
historical figures on traffic fatalities during past holiday 
seasons 
the council also projects that between 350 and 450 people will 
die in on the nations roads during the fourday new year holiday 
period

arab islamic armies deployed on a defensive line in front of 
american british and french troops in eastern saudi arabia 
with what we have right now i am completely satisfied 
whether its our arabmuslim forces or our friendly forces the 
saudi officer said we are ready to do what our supreme 
commanders tell us to do 
earlier this week american lt gen calvin ah waller

boost the number of egyptian troops to about 27000 the largest 
of the arab forces in saudi arabia 
the 4th division is specially trained in fighting urban battles 
which is what the recapture of kuwait city would entail however 
egyptian president hosni mubarak has said his forces would only be 
used to defend saudi arabia and would go into kuwait only in a 
peacekeeping role 
established in 1956 the division fought against israel that 
year and again in 1967 and 1973 it crossed the suez canal in the 
1973 war surprising the israelis who thought the maneuver was

the smallest city in this countrys 
smallest state is in danger of dying and needs a transfusion of 
state funds to survive a commission reviewing the communitys 
financial health said friday 
even if the state of rhode island takes financial responsibility 
for the schools of central falls this gritty mill city of 17000 
could expire members of a state review commission said 
the clock is ticking we dont have much time if you have a 
heart problem and you dont get a transplant whats the 
alternative asked james mahoney vice chairman of the central 
falls review commission 
the city named for the blackstone river falls that powered the 
birth of the modern textile industry is wedged between several 
larger communities just north of providence 
it the city is dissolved the state would assume responsibilty 
for the health welfare and safety of community residents a draft 
report by the review commission said the state is not prepared to 
assume that responsiblity 
although the smallest in the state this ethnically diverse 
milesquare community also is among the most densely populated in 
rhode island and is one of the 10 most densely populated cities in 
the country 
mahoney is fiscal adviser to the rhode island house of 
representatives he helped assemble this years state budget that 
gave central falls 500000 in aid but also mandated an examination 
of the citys fiscal health 
in its report the commission painted a stark picture of the 
citys problems a possible 7 million deficit this year in a 
budget of 21 million next years shortfall could be 11 million 
because education accounts for more than half the citys budget 
a state takeover of the schools could allow central falls to 
resolve its fiscal troubles said daniel w varin state planning 
director and chairman of the review commission 
varin said he would like to see the state have a large say in 
the schools but not total management control 
mayor thomas lazieh said he liked varins idea he also said he 
liked the commissions suggestion that central falls sell its water 
system to neighboring pawtucket and share public services such as 
police fire and libraries with neighboring municipalities 
but he rejected the idea of dissolving the city lazieh said 
maintaining an independent city was the cheapest way of getting 
services to its residents 
the commission said it too opposed dissolving the city at 
least for now 
despite the highest property tax rate in the state 5475 per 
1000 of assessed valuation the commission said central falls 
ranks 35th among the 39 cities and towns on spending per person for 
city services 
textiles long ago moved away leaving old mill buildings and 
threedecker tenements and little land to develop the crux of 
central falls problem little vacant land means little chance to 
increase the property tax base 
still there is much ethnic pride in central falls home to 
immigrants including frenchcanadians irish poles syrians and 
portuguese 
you had to speak a little french and syrian to get by where i 
grew up said bill benson the citys dog officer 
city council president albert laroche said the city got a bum 
rap beginning in the early 1980s with national attention as a 
cocaine trafficking center 
really no one here in the city wants to dissolve the city 
larouche said ive no intention of moving anywhere else its 
the furthest thing from my mind

the federal reserve set the stage for its 
recent interest rate reductions at a midnovember meeting of its 
monetary policy committee according to minutes of the meeting 
released friday 
the central bank has permitted a lowering of its federal funds 
rate four times since october and on wednesday dropped the discount 
rate from 7 percent to 65 percent the first decline in four 
years 
the 025 percentage point decline in the federal funds rate on 
oct 29 to 775 percent was in response to the federal 
budgetcutting agreement between the bush adminsitration and 
congress 
but the federal open market committee noted weakening economic 
activity at its nov 13 meeting and agreed to another slight 
reduction 
the move the minutes said was designed to provide some 
insurance against a deep and prolonged recession without incurring 
a substantial risk in current circumstances of fostering 
intensified inflationary pressures 
and the minutes said the committee agreed to give weight to 
potential developments that might require some slight further 
easing until the next meeting which was held last tuesday and was 
followed by the discount rate reduction and the lowering of the 
federal funds rate to 70 percent 
between the two meetings the federal funds rate fell to 75 
percent on nov 16 and to 725 percent on dec 7 the rate is the 
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans the discount 
rate is the interest the fed charges banks 
the minutes show that the committee members were concerned about 
the growing signs of a softening economy the related 
vulnerability of many business and financial firms to added 
financial strains and the increased reluctance of institutional 
lenders to accommodate less than prime business borrowers 
the committee vote was unanimous the feds monetary 
policysetting arm is comprised of the seven board members and five 
of the 12 presidents of the feds regional banks there currently 
is one vacancy on the board

and jammed the rads out of baghdad in an evacuation drill to test 
war readiness defense secretary dick cheney said armed conflict is 
increasingly likely 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff added 
that any attack on iraq would be swift and decisive he and cheney 
visited us troops in saudi arabia 
when we launch it we will launch it violently powell said 
we will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we can 
get it over as quickly as possible and theres no question who 
won 
however brent scowcroft the national security adviser to 
president bush said jan 15 the un deadline for iraq to leave 
kuwait is just an authorization date 
it doesnt say he is going to be attacked this date or that 
date or whatever scowcroft said in an interview in washington 
with the associated press and other news agencies 
off haifa israel at least one us sailor was killed when a 
navy vessel ferrying about 100 seamen to the uss saratoga capsized 
early saturday the sailors on shore leave were returning to the 
aircraft carrier deployed in the mideast as part of the 
multinational force against iraq cause of the accident was not 
immediately known 
saddam hussein meanwhile predicted an iraqi victory in any war 
with the multinational force arrayed against him and stood by his 
refusal to pull out of kuwait he spoke in an interview on german 
television 
in the event of war there will be great losses not just in 
terms of human life saddam said allah is on our side so we 
will defeat the aggressors 
the iraqi government is believed to have a large arsenal of 
chemical weapons and missiles along with its powerful army in 
bonn the german government said friday it was investigating us 
suspicions that german companies have continued sending supplies to 
iraq despite the un embargo 
a german magazine said one company supplied iraq with nuclear 
training and equipment while two others have helped baghdad with 
nerve gas production 
der spiegel said washington has given bonn a list of 50 german 
companies suspected of violating the un embargo the bonn 
government confirmed it received the list and said the allegations 
were being examined but that so far it had no proof 
sirens blared in baghdad friday and residents clutching 
blankets and food jumped into cars or rushed to special centers 
where they caught buses to evacuation camps set up outside the 
capital 
roads leading out of the city were jammed with thousands of 
cars trucks buses and even carriages pulled by tractors 
the evacuation drill began at 7 am and ended five hours later 
it was conducted for the half of baghdad that lies on the east bank 
of the tigris river 
but only about half the areas 2 million people participated 
said residents speaking on condition of anonymity they said 
people locked their doors and watched television rather than get 
stuck in the traffic jams 
a second exercise saturday will cover west baghdad 
basra iraqs secondlargest city with a million residents was 
evacuated in a similar exercise thursday 
it is useful if a war broke out god forbid we need to be 
out of our areas samir abdul aziz 45 a dentist said at one 
evacuation camp 
iraq has increased its preparations for war since the un 
security council authorized force to remove baghdads troops from 
kuwait if they have not left the emirate by jan 15 
iraqi media now carry instructions for building bomb shelters 
and courses in civil defense and first aid 
in saudi arabia cheney told us troops that war was drawing 
closer 
it increasingly looks like saddams not getting the message 
and well have to use force cheney said the only acceptable 
outcome if hostilities begin is absolute total victory 
cheney said us military officials dont think waiting 
indefinitely is going to solve the problem 
about 280000 us troops are stationed in saudi arabia as part 
of the nearly 400000strong multinational force they face about 
510000 iraqi troops in southern iraq and kuwait 
in the interview with germanys zdf television network saddam 
was asked if he would pull his troops out of kuwait by the jan 15 
deadline no he answered 
we are certain that even when bush pushes his country into 
war which he plans he cant keep it going said saddam he did 
not elaborate 
in other developments 
the us military command said eight american soldiers have 
been poisoned by homebrewed alcohol and hospitalized since sunday 
the soldiers from the 101st airborne division are the first known 
casualties of homebrewed liquor since us forces were deployed in 
saudi arabia a moslem country that bans all alcohol 
some us troops went on a lowlevel alert for a possible 
chemical attack friday after reports of a missile testfiring the 
pentagon later said that israel held an unannounced missile test 
hundreds of miles away it would not comment on the alert 
an nbc television crew in the radio room of a us coast guard 
patrol boat about five miles off eastern saudi arabia videotaped 
an exchange about the missile firing which appeared to indicate 
iraq had fired the missile 
but in washington a pentagon official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he had no information indicating that iraq had 
fired a scud missile

an azcon scrap salvage crew friday afternoon suspended the 
search for the barge until saturday because of rough water about 4 
miles northeast of downtown pittsburgh near the highland park dam 
the crew was confident the barge was below the dam friday 
because of an unusual current about 40 feet from the rivers north 
bank said richard spine azcons executive vice president 
an undertow prevented divers from going underwater and a strong 
surface current prevented the search tugboat from getting near 
enough to drag the river at that spot he said 
the 4mile section of the rainswollen river was closed to all 
ships wednesday and thursday commerce on the monongahela and ohio 
rivers was unaffected 
ms giacoma said the coast guard would review requests for 
passage on the allegheny river to determine if their cargo could 
damage the river in an accident 
the barge has been loose on the river since dec 14 when it 
broke free as it was towed to the azcon scrap corp yard for 
dismantling as scrap steel 
two employees jumped to safety before the steel barge sailed 
over a dam dug into the river mud and bent at a 45degree angle 
record rainfall on tuesday washed it further downstream 
when the barges location is confirmed warning buoys will be 
placed in the river and the waterway will reopen to all traffic 
ms giacoma said spine said the spot where the barge apparently 
sank is away from the rivers main shipping channel 
if there is such a thing as a convenient place for a barge to 
sink this is it he said 
if the barge can be lifted from the river bottom it will be 
chopped up as scrap steel spine said 
four us army corps of engineers locks above the sunken barge 
reported little activity friday because most barges remained at 
their landings waiting for the river to open said corps civil 
engineer jim mershimer

a jury awarded 143 million friday to a former 
ballerina who was paralyzed from the waist down after a 1983 crash 
in a car driven by former new york yankee infielder andre 
robertson 
the state supreme court jury decided thursday that robertson and 
the city were responsible for shenikwa dawn nowlins injuries 
nowlin 31 was the dance theater of harlems youngest member when 
she was 14 she is now a dallas attorney 
the jury found the city liable for 67 percent of the award 
because a sign warning of a curve on manhattans west side highway 
was too near the bend for a driver to react in time the jury also 
found robertson 33 percent liable because he exceeded the speed 
limit 
nobody can be compensated for the kinds of injuries i 
received nowlin said later outside the courtroom if i had it 
to do over again id be walking and not sitting here no money can 
pay for what has happened to me 
nowlins spine was broken when robertson smashed his car into a 
highway embankment around 5 am on aug 18 1983 
the two friends since they were students at the university of 
texas had been to a nightclub and were on their way to take 
pictures of the statue of liberty 
robertson 33 is out of baseball and now works in a steam 
generating plant at duponts sabine river works in orange texas 
 
robertsons attorney daniel mcnamara said his clients 
insurance will cover about 25000 of the award he said robertson 
cant afford the balance so the city by law will be liable for 
almost the entire award 
it wasnt immediately known if the city would appeal the award

the securities and exchange commission filed 
civil fraud charges friday against an uninsured storefront bank 
whose collapse threw more than 68 million in deposits of recent 
salvadoran immigrants into jeopardy 
the commission also obtained a temporary order from us 
district court freezing the assets of three top officers of latin 
investment corp of washington 
the corporations assets were frozen dec 15 when it was forced 
into seeking bankruptcy court protection from creditors a 
bankruptcy judge as ordered the company liquidated 
the commission said it had contacted the government of el 
salvador to locate any assets there that would be subject to a 
freeze order although the countries have no formal cooperation 
agreement 
a hearing on the commissions request for an injunction against 
the defendants was scheduled for jan 14 
there is evidence to suggest that individuals who were 
nominally drawing salaries of slightly in excess of 20000 a year 
have acquired very expensive real estate in the washington area we 
intend to go after that real estate if we establish liability and 
try for the recovery of assets that may have been improperly 
diverted said commission chairman richard c breeden 
commission officials said they had referred the latin investment 
matter to washington dc local officials when it first came to 
light in 1987 
breeden said if latin had been chartered as a bank supervised 
by local bank regulators and under federal deposit insurance there 
would have been little for the commission to do 
william mclucas head of the commissions enforcement division 
said district of columbia officials assured the commission on 
several occasions in 1988 that they were taking steps to ensure 
that latin would get a bank charter 
the citys office of banking and financial institutions was 
closed when called late friday for comment 
according to the complaint latin investment founded in 1982 
had about 3500 investors who had placed about 68 million with 
the investment company as of august this year investors have said 
they deposited money with latin because it had tellers who spoke 
spanish 
the wilson international center a private community group that 
is helping investors said the amount in jeopardy was more like 13 
million in deposits an average of more than 3700 apiece 
the complaint alleges that latin which operated without a bank 
charter or government banking insurance misled investors into 
thinking their funds would be safe and available on demand 
also named as defendants and as the target of various requested 
court orders were founder fernando leonzo of vienna va the 
corporations secretary leonel salinas of falls church va and 
vice president jose a cortes of arlington va 
leonzo through his lawyer charles pearson denied the 
commission allegations 
we have a different version of events and that will certainly 
come forward in due time pearson said were not trying to 
hide anything what were trying to do is repay depositors

a woman has become the 13th person to die 
from injuries apparently suffered when a butane lantern filled a 
small house with carbon monoxide fumes during an allnight 
religious ceremony authorities said 
the woman consuelo ponce 40 died thursday at the social 
security hospital said state coroners office and state public 
ministry officials 
ms ponce was taken to the hospital in a coma on dec 13 after 
attending a religious ceremony in a shantytown neighborhood in this 
border city south of san diego 
after the deaths there was speculation victims had been poisoned 
by food and fruit punch consumed during the ceremony that began 
dec 12 the feast day of the virgin of guadalupe patron saint of 
mexico 
but tissue and blood tests on the 12 who died earlier indicated 
they had not consumed alcohol or another toxic substance 
authorities said 
the victims had gathered at the home of federico padres mexia a 
selfstyled spiritual leader who claimed he could perform miracles 
and had communicated with god 
padres 61 and another survivor remain hospitalized in a coma 
thursday said leonardo cortes a state public ministry spokesman 
an autopsy was to be held to determine ms ponces cause of 
death 
authorities earlier determined the other 12 died of asphyxiation 
from carbon monoxide emitted by the leaky butane gas lamp used to 
light the unventilated house 
authorities also believe the fatal level of carbon monoxide may 
have been aggravated by the burning of epsom salts during the 
ritual which the victims survivors said was intended to cleanse 
their souls or change their luck

gov richard celeste on friday granted 
clemency to 25 women prisoners who he said committed crimes because 
they were victims of battering or other forms of physical or 
emotional abuse 
the lameduck governor said he reviewed 105 cases in which 
battered woman syndrome was suspected the ohio supreme court 
and the state legislature in march established the syndrome as a 
defense against murder and other crimes 
most of the inmates were serving time for such crimes as murder 
manslaughter and assault 
paperwork and other procedures probably will mean the women 
wont be released until after christmas celeste said at a news 
conference 
the governor included a stipulation that all of those freed must 
perform 200 hours of community service in domestic violence 
programs he also said each woman must serve at least two years 
before being released four of the 25 women have spent fewer than 
two years in prison 
of the cases the governor reviewed 32 were sent back to the 
state parole board for further review and 48 were rejected he 
said he said he was still reviewing about 15 other cases and would 
announce his decisions next month 
celeste said ohio was the last state to recognize the plight of 
battered women when the ohio supreme court in march ruled that 
evidence of battered women syndrome is permissible at trials 
all the cases reviewed involved women convicted of killing or 
assaulting their mates before the march 7 decision 
the new state law permits testimony on the syndrome a 
psychological state brought on by longterm abusive relationships 
and which often leads to severe stress and low selfesteem among 
other conditions 
some of celestes decisions ran counter to recommendations of 
the parole board but he said he read each case at least twice and 
consulted with court and other officials before he was convinced 
they were victims 
celeste said the parole board does not cite the criteria it uses 
in its decisions

separates a rail you cant operate a train you have to wait to 
get a repair crew there

moscow president mikhail gorbachev forged ahead with efforts 
to revamp the government and increase his powers after foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze resigned warning of a slide toward 
dictatorship 
the fourth congress of peoples deputies was scheduled to resume 
discussion today on a union treaty that grants limited autonomy to 
the governments of the 15 soviet republics 
but most of the republic leaders want even greater independence 
from moscow the growing chaos in some areas has led a hardline 
faction of the communist party including military leaders to call 
for a crackdown 
shevardnadze 62 in his shocking resignation speech thursday 
lamented the growing influence of lawmakers with colonels 
stripes and said the government was moving toward a dictatorship 
equals 
washington us officials are worried that the departure of 
eduard a shevardnadze as soviet foreign minister will slow 
progress in ussoviet relations and perhaps trigger further 
disintegration of the central government in moscow 
this is not a very nice christmas present from moscow said 
one senior us official who emerged thursday from meetings at the 
state department to discuss shevardnadzes resignation which sent 
shock waves through moscow and western capitals alike 
despite public reassurances that the resignation wont change 
the course of superpower relations there is private consternation

experts outside the government

washington while urging the soviet union to accelerate its 
economic reform efforts a study of the soviet economy concludes 
that massive amounts of western aid would be wasted if offered now 
the study the most comprehensive look by the west at the 
economic difficulties facing the soviets was being released 
simultaneously today in washington london and paris by the 
agencies that undertook the fivemonth review 
officials in the bush administration and international lending 
institutions said the report recommends an infusion of technical 
assistance to help the soviets move to a market economy at the 
same time they said the study warns against massive amounts of 
immediate western aid on grounds the money would be wasted because 
the soviet economy is in so much disarray

report portrays a system that was even more backward than expected

officials conceded that some vital american ground forces will not 
be ready for combat by the jan 15 united nations deadline for the 
iraqi leader to withdraw his troops from kuwait or face attack 
the likelihood of starting with air strikes has been discussed 
for some time by military officials and others who believe the

soviet army units enforcing the

soviet invaders may be civilians trying to escape it 
a possible mass influx of soviet citizens fleeing economic chaos 
and ethnic strife at home has eastern europe which has its own 
economic problems balancing empty pockets against humanitarian 
ideals 
a poverty wall must not take the place of the iron 
curtain prime minister jozsef antall of hungary said recently 
six months ago the soviet government promised to ease travel 
restrictions but an emigration law is hung up in the supreme 
soviet legislature no one can say when the reforms will come 
similarly no one knows how many people will leave when new 
legislation takes effect estimates range from the 1990 total of 
400000 refugees to 5 million 
lev lyubimov of the soviet institute of the world economy and 
international relations said currency restrictions and technical 
limitations on printing passports and visas probably would keep the 
number of emigres at about the current level 
economic and social reforms also might keep soviets at home he 
said 
soviet troops went into hungary to stop a popular uprising in 
1956 and czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the prague spring 
liberalization they began leaving only only after peaceful 
revolutions a year ago 
the possible invasion of refugees coincides with eastern 
europes struggle to transform itself from communism to capitalism 
soviet emigration was discussed at a 34nation summit in paris 
in november recent food aid to the soviet union from western 
nations is at least partially aimed at encourging its people to 
stay home 
east european officials question whether the west is willing to 
accept its share of soviet refugees they fear most of the soviets 
determined to emigrate will land in their countries 
poland cannot afford to take soviet emigres but will not turn 
them away said barbara rozycka a polish official who attended a 
conference near prague recently on prospects for soviet emigration 
we dont have enough for our own people but its not a 
question because it doesnt depend on economics but humanitarian 
concerns she said the question for poland is how will the 
soviet union disintegrate because were sure it will happen 
poland wants to see a peaceful disintegration 
within the soviet union at least 600000 people in the 15 
soviet republics already are thought to be refugees from ethnic 
violence many may want to leave if a new emigration law allows it 
soviet citizens have not needed visas to travel to eastern 
europe because of the close ties built during the communist years 
and because the soviet union restricted the right to travel 
former sovietbloc nations are loathe to impose visa 
requirements but also worry about laying themselves open to 
greater economic strain 
hungary and czechoslovakia for instance are considering 
whether they should require soviets to have a minimum amount of 
foreign currency when they arrive and also may strengthen border 
patrols 
currency regulations could stop many soviets because the ruble 
nearly worthless in its own country cannot be converted abroad in 
march soviet authorities forbade citizens to export items that 
might be used for trading ranging from honey and canned fish to 
electric wire 
we think the presence of police and soldiers at the border 
would deter many soviets from trying to cross illegally into 
eastern europe said martin friedman of the czechoslovak interior 
ministry 
czechoslovakia expects to accept about 12000 refugees annually 
under a new law offering asylum to those facing political racial 
or religious persecution 
poland also can expect a large influx two million people of 
polish origin live in the soviet union mostly in neighboring 
ukraine byelorussia and lithuania ms rozycka said 
hungary is concerned about 200000 ethnic hungarians who live on 
the soviet side of the 100mile border and has committed itself to 
keeping the frontier open 
for romania the situation is more confused nationalists on 
both sides of the prut river border want the soviet republic of 
moldavia annexed 50 years ago to rejoin romania 
more than 100 ethnic groups are included in the soviet 
population of 300 million 
some soviets already are emigrating to eastern europe 
judit toth head of the hungarian interior ministrys refugee 
affairs department said 55 applied for refugee status in september 
and 37 in october officials are trying to decide whether to return 
a man who swam the tisza river border to hungary 
interior minister krzysztof kozlowski of poland said in november 
that tens of thousands of soviets had overstayed their tourist 
visits

it is sort of a tradition for christmas eve 
columns to start with phrases like twas the night before 
christmas but this one concerns the first hollywood christmas 
of martin mull 
mull actor guitarist and an artist whose heart belongs to 
dada was raised in north ridgeville ohio there an oldfashioned 
christmas meant lots of snow and frozen car radiators and guys full 
of goodwill shots and beer 
his first oldfashioned hollywood christmas in 1975 was 
somewhat different 
the hardest adjustment was being able to get into the 
christmas spirit when its 85 degrees the air is hanging like pea 
soup and there are palm trees with lights on them he said 
he saw his first hollywood christmas parade full of antique 
celebrities chauffeurdriven marching bands antique cars and 
tiny people claiming to have been in a 950 cbs series kuda bux 
hindu mystic 
i watched from a distance of about 15 feet and i was seeing 
it on our tv set and i realized that is the closest i ever want 
to get to halftime at the orange bowl 
and most every shoppingmall santa claus had a screen actors 
guild card 
oh yes if you sat in their lap theyd tell you what they 
want theyd say listen if you know anybody at paramount ive 
got a script also i dont really do this im not santa 
really shattered my bubble 
he survived all this he went on to play the evil garth gimble 
of norman lears mary hartman mary hartman and then garths 
twin barth host of the best talk show ever america 2night 
now in reruns on cable 
that started him on his way to fine films like serial to 
comedy albums two of them nominated for grammy awards and to

on cbs last season 
no matter hes working on a third family dog an animated 
sitcom about the life and times of a nameless dog and the family 
that lives with him the show isnt yet scheduled for cbs 
primetime roster 
mull is aware that some may consider it cbs reply to foxs 
the simpsons although this is not so in his show the focus 
is on a dumb animal with the accent on dumb 
in the show mull is the voice of dad the head of the clan 
with molly cheek as the mother of their two kids its the first 
time he has been a voice in a cartoon series he considers it a 
good deal 
ive had some lousy experiences in television but this one 
is a treat he said i dont have to shave i dont even have 
to bathe actually i do it only out of courtesy to molly 
mull spoke by phone from his home near santa monica calif a 
home he said contained all the oldfashioned christmas things 
including icy frost spraypainted on the window corners 
he his wife wendy a composer and their 5yearold daughter 
maggie rose plan to spend christmas quietly 
same goes for new years eve even if it is the custom during 
new years eve in hollywood to go to new wave clubs drink a lot of 
champagne and as the new year arrives holler im faabulous

the girl hair neatly coiffed wore a petite pearl 
choker by mitsukoshi black velvet dress by renoma and white lace 
gloves her escort in top hat sported a doublebreasted tux by 
abs dabsorba 
ready for the prom not quite thats still years away for the 
two pintsize models photographed for a magazine in outfits worth 
more than 3500 
the japanese penchant for designer brands and other luxury goods 
has brought some tots into the world of high fashion 
japans ultraperfectionist parents and doting grandparents have 
more money than ever and fewer children to spend it on the 
average number of children per family has dropped from about five 
in 1945 to 15 in 1989 
there are six pockets the two sets of grandparents and the 
parents who can be counted on to spend money on every child 
said toshiro niizaki planning director for seibu department 
stores childrens section in tokyo 
highly competitive department stores have encouraged the trend 
by building special kids sections stocked with designer goods 
sunday department store outings and the custom among 
statusconscious japanese of giving expensive gifts have done 
wonders for the boom in kiddy luxury goods 
when special occasions come up for youngsters it often is the 
grandparents who foot the bill for the goldthreaded silk kimonos 
that have become de rigueur for ritual shrine visits 
the visits start with the 100dayold childs first blessing a 
kimono worn only for that excursion can cost well over 1000 
subsequent visits during a girls third and seventh year and a 
boys fifth require new kimonos or western suits 
trend watchers say young parents fond of sports cars fur coats 
and diamond rings are willing accomplices 
when parents themselves are wearing designer clothes they 
want their kids to have things that are just as nice said 
niizaki a father of two 
young mothers are especially fashion conscious since they 
grew up during a fashion era introduced by teen magazines in the 
1970s said hideo takayama director of the childrens survey 
research institute in tokyo 
theyve got the tiresome habit of comparing themselves and 
their children with others they want their kids to have the best 
so everyone will see their kids as being good he said 
their elite tastes arent confined to fashion 
disco parties for tots and their mothers are a hit in the 
western city of osaka a 24yearold mother at one of them with her 
yearold daughter told a popular weekly magazine she spent about 
100000 yen 750 a month on the childs clothing and 
entertainment 
family gourmet dinners to commemorate special occasions at up 
to 450 for a family of four are popular at major hotels 
travel agents say sixday family tours to hawaii and guam 
complete with baby sitter and sometimes a doctor are fully booked 
at 2500 and up 
to get their children into the best schools possible parents 
send toddlers as young as 1 to preschools 
one such institution run by tokyos seiwa education co picks 
up and returns tots to their homes or their mothers offices in 
luxury cars 
school officials say about 50 children are on the waiting list 
for 120 places entrance fees range up to 3750 and monthly fees 
to 2200 
parents say the ultraexpensive clothes are only brought out for 
special occasions which makes spending 1300 for a ministrand of 
pearls or more than 450 for a tiny threepiece woolen suit and 
suspenders even more puzzling 
at our school we require the children to wear clothes that 
can get dirty and are easy to play in said taeko fukuda a 
nursery school teacher i think its very strange to buy such 
expensive clothes for fastgrowing children 
some people are worried by the trend 
in the past we didnt believe in being so extravagant we 
thought it would make children weak today some mothers seem to 
view their children as accessories rather than real people said 
takako shinagawa a child psychologist and grandmother 
ms shinagawa said its difficult to avoid spoiling 
grandchildren however and added there must be some place with 
decent prices but im too old to go looking for it 
niizaki of the seibu department store said he does not favor 
buying luxury clothes for children even though his departments 
sales have increased up to 20 percent a year 
we try not to buy too much he said of his own family you 
have to teach kids how to put up with waiting you cant just give 
them everything they want right away

after decades of focusing on work and building 
the economy singapore is becoming serious about having fun 
nothing frivolous of course but goh chok tong the new prime 
minister has promised a lighter approach goh 49 took over when 
lee kuan yew stepped aside last month after 31 authoritarian years 
lee made no excuses for the lack of municipal merriment in his 
clean prosperous citystate but approved carefully patrolled 
street festivals beginning two years ago they have become 
institutionalized with part of one main street closed an evening 
each month for a mass party 
the biggest of these bashes attract about 250000 people from a 
population of only 27 million 
we have got to find new ways of expressing ourselves and this 
is not only harmless it may well do us good lee acknowledged 
singapore also has discovered fun is good for business 
it is not just to have fun it is also because fun products 
sell better george yeo said to create fun products we need 
fun people fun events and fun places 
yeo recently was appointed acting cabinet minister in charge of 
information and the arts 
it may seem odd but we have to pursue this subject of fun 
very seriously if we want to stay competitive in the 21st 
century he said life should be effervescent yeo declared with 
more bubbles in the singapore champagne 
creative services will become very important in economic 
development and the right milieu is needed to attract creative 
people yeo said in a paradoxical way fun is serious 
business 
in trying to recapture the zest of old singapore for tourists 
who complain the nightlife is boring the government is rebuilding 
bugis street 
a raffish neighborhood that contrasted with the rest of this 
squeaky clean place bugis street attracted drunken soldiers and 
sailors transsexuals and other allnight revelers it was 
bulldozed out of existence five years ago to make way for a subway 
station 
for decades there was nothing remotely like it in singapore 
the ambience included hundreds of food stalls touts and smalltime 
con artists souvenir peddlers palm readers and pimps 
bugis street became naturally seedy over the years but the copy 
is a 72 millionproject sanctioned by the tourist promotion 
board 
in addition to encouraging more fun officials are determined to 
shed the countrys reputation as a cultural desert and help 
citizens develop threedimensional personalities the new prime 
minister wants them to be educated compassionate gracious and 
socially confident 
the 3d singaporean is to be fully operational and contributing 
to a culturally vibrant society by 1999 by the governments 
timetable 
since that target was set six years ago millions of dollars 
have been provided for the arts spending on a scale unprecedented 
in the 25 years since independence from britain 
by trying to generate more fun younger political leaders hope 
to attract a new generation said chan heng see singapores un 
ambassador younger voters did not readily accept the idea of a 
successful efficient hardworking boring society of conformist 
rigid overly disciplined people 
singapore should hang loose a little ms chan said but i 
think if we start talking of the politics of fun we immediately 
destroy the spontaneity of what we are trying to create

the coal industry always battered by 
economic and labor uncertainties enters the new year under the 
cloud of the clean air act of 1990 which could devastate the 
nations highsulfur mines at first and mean trouble for all mines 
later 
its going to hurt some people its going to shift the market 
maybe and we dont know how said david branand director of 
environmental affairs for the national coal association 
overall unfortunately in the longterm i believe the clean 
air act is going to be negative for the coal industry in general 
basically because of caps or restrictions on emissions said gary 
white president of the west virginia coal association 
the clean air act which became law nov 15 restricts sulfur 
dioxide emissions from coalfired power plants considered the 
leading cause of acid rain 
those plants primarily in the midwest and ohio valley must cut 
sulfur dioxide emissions by half or 9 million tons annually in 
the next decade 
the restrictions which take effect in 1995 and tighten in 2000 
essentially give power plants that now burn highsulfur coal three 
options 
they can install scrubbers at a cost of up to 100 million 
each which would eliminate up to 90 percent of the sulfur 
emissions and allow them to continue burning highsulfur coal 
they can switch to lowersulfur coal and pay generally higher 
transportation costs 
or they can trade or sell pollution allowances permitting some 
plants to exceed standards to the extent other plants come in under 
the limits 
so much of it depends on what the utilities are going to do 
and theyre in a state of uncertainty branand said nonetheless 
utility officials must decide soon which route they will take 
if youre talking about installing scrubbers not only are you 
talking about a major financial investment youre talking about a 
major construction effort to get them installed white said 
west virginia presents a microcosm of the challenges the clean 
air act poses for the coal industry 
the states highsulfur northern coal fields stand to lose 
business because of pollution restrictions 
at the same time the states lowsulfur southern coal fields 
are getting ready for a boom 
white said he hopes for expansion in the southern coal fields 
and a minimum loss in the northern mines but hes more pessimistic 
about the industrys longterm health primarily because the law 
will make it to expensive to build ne coalfired power plants 
the key to meeting the new clean air standards lies in the 
sulfur content of coal and its ability to produce energy rated in 
british thermal units or btu said john randolph director of the 
virginia center for coal and energy research 
wyoming kentucky and west virginia produce more than half the 
nations coal coal with a sulfur content of 06 percent or less 
makes up 44 percent of the known reserves in wyoming 16 percent in 
kentucky and 37 percent in west virginia 
but the coal in kentucky and west virginia generally is more 
efficient than that in wyoming randolph said 
the average central appalachian coal produces 12500 btu per 
pound while wyoming coal can produce as little as 10000 btu per 
pound 
by 1995 power plants must limit sulfur dioxide emissions to 25 
pounds per million btu central appalachian coal with about 16 
percent sulfur content will meet the new standards randolph said 
by 2000 sulfur dioxide emissions will be limited to 12 pounds 
per million btu so central appalachian coal would have to have a 
sulfur content of 075 percent or less he said 
in both cases western coal would have to be lower in sulfur 
content to make up for the shortfall in btu 
but while the western coal is less efficient than appalachian 
coal and costs more to transport to the midwestern power plants 
that need it it also is cheaper to produce industry experts said 
in the past year huntingtonbased ashland coal inc has spent 
180 million to buy two companies with major lowsulfur reserves 
mingo logan coal co in southern west virginia and pikeville 
kybased coal mac inc 
we believe ashland coal is going to be benefited from the 
clean air act amendments said vice president david todd we feel 
optimistic about that 
quantifying that is where the uncertainty is

homosexuality remains illegal in the soviet union 
after five years of political reform and attempts to start a gay 
liberation movement have been denounced by the press with a venom 
reminiscent of another era 
religion pornography gambling and political freethinking once 
grievous sins against communist society flourish under president 
mikhail s gorbachev but homosexuality has stayed underground one 
of the last taboos 
in the past year a few dozen soviet gays and lesbians have 
begun a campaign to get homosexuality legalized and increase social 
tolerance 
they have achieved some successes including launching the 
countrys first homosexual newspaper but soviet homosexuals say 
they also have been beaten by youth gangs in recent months and 
forced by police to undergo blood tests for aids 
there is no real gay liberation movement here and i am very 
skeptical there will be one said dmitri 33 a scientist like 
other homosexuals interviewed he asked to be identified only by 
his first name 
i am absolutely sure that if they announced a rally few 
people would turn out he said i personally wouldnt they 
would photograph us and that could lead to problems at work maybe 
even getting fired 
on warm evenings gay men often gather outside the bolshoi 
theater home of the renowned ballet 
when the weather turns raw they walk around the block to the 
sadko cafe for hungarian wine salted fish and mushrooms cooked in 
sour cream 
sadko has more charm than utilitarian soviet cafes and one 
other advantage privacy its widely spaced tables allow discreet 
conversation and lamps reflect dim light onto a vaulted ceiling 
the golubye literally light blue ones russian slang 
for homosexuals are careful to leave in threes and fours 
its not a good idea to walk out of here alone because you 
can never tell whos waiting around the corner with a stick and a 
taste for blood said serezha 24 
gay activists say youth gangs beat up homosexuals about once a 
month and that the attacks rarely are reported to the police 
because victims dont want to call attention to themselves 
whatever the threat of teenage toughs lurking outside the 
sadko at least provides a meeting place for the small number 
believed fewer than 250 of open homosexuals in moscow a city of 
9 million people 
conditions are said to be worse outside the capital and other 
major cities 
in small towns homosexuals are always visible said dmitri 
the scientist they have no place to gather and no place to 
hide 
activists said only a few men had been prosecuted in recent 
years for homosexual acts between consenting adults and all the 
cases were in provincial towns 
there is no reason to believe homosexuality is any less common 
in the soviet union than anywhere else on earth said vladimir 
shakhidshanian it just meets less public acceptance here 
shakhidshanian 50 is the author of a forthcoming book about 
sex called 1001 questions about that the avuncular armenian 
dispenses advice about sex in newspapers and on television 
during an interview in his cluttered office he riffled through 
some of the 8000 letters he has received from viewers including 
many gays and lesbians 
soviet homosexuals suffer loneliness shame and discomfort in 
their private lives and ignorance prejudice and persecution in 
society he said 
he said he knew of no soviet polls on attitudes toward 
homosexuality shakhidshanian said his letters and interviews 
indicated that tolerance of homosexuality rose in the early 1980s 
under western influence 
then came aids he said and turned public opinion 
strongly against homosexuals again 
according to official statistics 565 soviet citizens including 
74 homosexuals are infected with hiv the aids virus 
the leading causes of the spread of aids in the soviet union are 
medical mistakes including reuse of infected syringes and 
heterosexual relations said irina yeremova an epidemiologist 
homosexuals often are blamed she said 
the law against homosexuality dating from the 1930s sometimes 
has been used for political purposes as in the case of the late 
sergei paradzhanov an armenian film maker imprisoned in 197278 
he was convicted of homosexuality but his real crime was signing a 
ltter demanding the release of ukrainian dissidents 
anatoly sobchak a former law professor who now is mayor of 
leningrad and a member of the national legislature said he 
believes the statute will be removed when a new criminal code is 
adopted in 1991 
technically it prohibits only male homosexuality not 
lesbianism but lesbians are active in the nascent homosexual 
rights movement 
we suffer from the same kind of social intolerance the same 
fear of being fired under some pretext the same desire to live 
freely said mila 33 
the movements leading organization formed in moscow in october 
1989 is the association of sexuality minorities which publishes 
tema or theme the first soviet gay and lesbian newspaper 
to protect identities the association keeps no formal 
membership roll activists said it has only 20 to 25 regular 
participants but many more supporters 
the first three issues of the newspaper distributed in 
february july and november contained articles on such topics as 
gay cinema homosexuality in russian history 
in a scathing article printed by leading newspapers nov 15 the 
government tass news agency accused the group of harboring not only 
primitive homosexuals but necrophiliacs pedophiles and 
zoophiles 
where can you find a fresh corpse to excite a necrophiliac 
how much does it cost to have sex with a baby why doesnt moscow 
have official places for men to entertain themselves with little 
boys and girls with girls for only two rubles tema provides its 
readers with the answers to these and other nasty questions tass 
said 
roman kalinin temas 24yearold editor denied the paper had 
published such information tass knew perfectly well it was 
untrue he said 
in addition to publishing tema the association of sexual 
minorities collects information on civil rights violations 
it reported in september that police and soldiers in the black 
sea resort of sochi raided a gay cafe and used billy clubs to force 
suspected homosexuals into a bus the men were driven to a 
hospital where doctors were ordered to test their blood for aids 
the association said 
activists said western gay and lesbian groups so far have 
contributed several typewriters a small amount of money under 
1000 and 7000 condoms to the association 
kalinin who spent november in the united states meeting with 
homosexual groups at the invitation of the usbased international 
gay and lesbian human rights commission said he believes more aid 
will be coming 
already he said international activists have planned a gay 
parade through red square for the summer of 1991

the historic linkup of a tunnel under the english 
channel is only one step in a larger plan to connect the great 
cities of europe with a network of superfast trains 
rail planners envision sleek trains rocketing through the french 
alps across german plains and of course under the channel 
on board they hope will be travelers fed up with europes 
congested airports and highways by 2010 they could be riding from 
madrid to frankfurt in less than 10 hours compared to nearly 24 
hours now 
train will soon allow what only plane made possible 
predicts karel van miert the european communitys transport 
commissioner 
he recently introduced an ec plan to create a 205 billion 
western european highspeed network over 20 years the 15500 miles 
of electrified track would carry trains running at 120 to 200 mph 
the channel tunnel which linked up in early december will join 
london and paris with a 3hour train ride in 1993 it will enable 
a london banker for example to hop a train to brussels 
frankfurt madrid milan or dozens of other cities 
environmental worries ethnic squabbles and high construction 
costs could derail parts of the project finanbody 
when it will really be done i dont know said hughes 
corbeau a rail planner for the french transport ministry its 
going to cost a lot and demands concerted efforts from public 
powers 
highspeed rail systems minimum speed 120 mph already built 
or under construction in britain germany italy spain and france 
form the core of the proposed network 
also foreseen are new highspeed systems or linkups by rail or 
ferry in belgium the netherlands greece portugal switzerland 
luxembourg austria ireland and yugoslavia 
the technological star and pacesetter for highspeed rail is the 
chiselnosed french tgv or train a grande vitesse 
tgvs went into operation between paris and lyon in 1981 racing 
along at 174 mph they halved the rail time between frances two 
leading economic centers to two hours and boosted ridership 
between paris and southeast france from 122 million to 221 
million in nine years 
julian andriao 45 a chemistry professor from lyon is a 
regular rider he said the train may be a bit slower than an 
airplane but makes up for it by saving trips to airports and 
waiting at checkin lines 
i came here for a professional meeting this morning he said 
on a paris train platform ill be home in time for dinner with 
my family 
france expanded the tgv network last year with a second 
generation of more powerful trains running eastwest they cruise 
at 186 mph but one engine set a world rail speed record of 318 
mph 
the tgv runs at high speed only on special track on the 3hour 
trip from paris to geneva it slows to 125 mph on conventional 
track after lyon 
railway directors hope highspeed trains can win back airline 
travelers on trips of 600 miles or less hourslong airport delays 
are increasing especially at london paris and frankfurt 
transport studies show european air traffic increased 56 percent 
from 1975 to 1986 and could double by 2000 on the parislyon run 
air traffic fell to 1972 levels after the tgv began operating 
the complete train network will not be easy to accomplish if 
the planned hookup of london paris brussels amsterdam and 
cologne serves as any example 
it already has intergovernmental approval and the route lies 
over flat terrain so it should be among the easiest to build 
however 
britain refuses to lay special tgv track in the lush highly 
populated countryside between london and the channel tunnel adding 
30 minutes to the trip 
regions of flemish and french speakers in bilingual belgium are 
squabbling over who will get the special track and thus reap the 
most economic benefit 
in the netherlands the shortage of dry land makes it 
impossible to lay the long straightaways tgvs need to reach full 
speed 
the french transport ministry had hoped the line would be 
operational by 1995 its most optimistic estimate now is 1998

eastern zambia heavily infested by trypanosomiasis a disease 
borne by tsetse files that can be fatal to man and beast 
wilson recalled asking the hunter why he killed the calf the 
hunter replied he was only doing his job killing animals of some 
species as part of the governments antitsetse fly operation 
i knew he was right said wilson but i also thought 
something was awfully wrong 
when zambia achieved independence in 1964 wilson moved to 
rhodesia now zimbabwe where he was offered a good job in its game 
department 
nine years later wilson founded chipangali 15 mies south of 
zimbabwes second city of bulawayo with savings and sponsorships 
for wilson his wife paddy and their two sons home was a small 
thatched roof house and work was tending a few animals in a cluster 
of pens 
this was the beginning of the sevenyear war waged by guerrillas 
against white supremacy it ended in 1980 with independence under 
president robert mugabe 
we werent touched by the war and if guerrillas were roaming 
around here i never saw them said wilson but we did get 
quite a few soldiers popping in to drop off pets mainly monkeys 
theyd tired of 
people continue to deliver animals to wilsons care today 
chipangali is a honeycomb of more than 70 large enclosures and 
aviaries for the orphans of the wild the title of a book by 
wilson published in 1977 
a labyrinth of pebbled paths bordered by gardens of native 
trees plants and cactuses lead visitors to wilsons waifs 
weve strived to make the setting as naturally african as we 
can both for the animals and for people who come to see them 
wilson said 
his family still lives beneath the thatchroofed house flanked 
by enclosures for lions leopards and monkeys 
about 20000 people stroll around chipangalis 10 acres each 
year a third of them schoolchildren who are allowed to visit free 
of charge adults pay the equivalent of 2 
we encourage the kids said wilson who serves as manager 
for a trust fund set up to bankroll the orphanage africans 
brought up in the rural areas fully understand wildlife because 
its all around them but millions of africans born in cities 
and towns have never seen a lion a leopard or a snake 
urban children he said have lost contact with nature here 
we take them back to the wild 
the 10000 needed monthly for chipangalis upkeep comes from 
gate receipts sales of a wildlife calendar the orphanages 
restaurant and fundraising events such as horseracing 
scores of sponsors many of them foreigners adopt animals and 
send checks as foster parents 
we still battle said wilson who launched chipangali on 
400 a month we can never close so we must cut our cloth to 
suit our income 
wilson who as a game ranger survived charges by rhinoceros and 
bites from poisonous snakes has had few problems from his 
creatures 
a lion chomped off one of his fingers a visiting schoolboy was 
slightly injured by a leopard and some of his 40 employees have 
been bitten by monkeys 
besides running the orphanage wilson has authored three 
wildlife books helped produce a 25episode program for television 
and written some 60 research papers on african snakes animals and 
birds 
he was commissioned by the genevabased international union for 
conservation of nature and natural resources to study ways to 
prevent the extinction of the jentinks duiker antelope of liberia 
and won the 1987 rolex spirit of enterprise award for his work 
there 
in june he was among 500 people worldwide honored by the united 
nations for environmental achievements 
wilson left liberia in march just before the outbreak of civil 
war he fears the few surviving duiker were destroyed in the 
conflict 
thats my next concern he said as soon as things are 
settled down ill go back to see for myself

cheyenne vallancekirk is celebrating her 
first christmas with a sparkling tree new toys and a loving 
family she has everything a baby girl should have except her 
mommy 
hollie vallance is a soldier in saudi arabia waiting for a 
possible war wondering about the baby she left behind this summer 
a 7weekold bundle of sweetness now being cuddled and cared for 
by her daddy 
it comes pretty naturally says anthony kirk heating a 
bottle while cradling 5monthold cheyenne in his arms the 
babys teaching me if youre not doing something right shell 
scream and holler youve got to figure out what to do 
hes done a remarkable job boasts motherinlaw sharon 
vallance you can just tell shes a real happy baby and that just 
shows to me that a babys being well taken care of you know 
that things are right 
kirk is among thousands of army spouses whose lives have been 
turned around by operation desert shield a military operation in 
which roles are reversed for many families moms are toting guns 
and cleaning tanks in the persian gulf while dads are hauling 
groceries and washing clothes at home 
the separation creates a special strain and sadness in the 
christmas season 
none of us can really get in the holiday mood says mrs 
vallance its been real hard just to get the tree and decorate 
it i think its real hard hollie missing cheyennes first 
christmas 
still it will be a special day for baby cheyenne with gifts of 
clothes quilts singalong toys rattles and a little mirror for 
her crib shell have all the joy but none of the emptiness and 
fear her family shares 
were all scared to death if something happens over there 
what shell be doing and where shell be at mrs vallance says 
of her daughter 
kirk 27 often says he wishes he could trade places with his 
wife 
i wouldnt have to worry about hollie he says i just 
feel the baby needs her mother more than a father 
but cheyenne has been getting plenty of parenting since spec 4 
hollie vallance a 22yearold medic kissed her baby goodbye last 
august as the armys 197th infantry brigade pulled out from fort 
benning ga 
her maternity leave had ended just two days earlier 
at first kirk continued working at royal crown cola in 
columbus ga placing cheyenne with a baby sitter 
my boss told me you cant work and take care of the baby 
too he recalls i said you watch me ill do it it lasted 
five weeks 
father and daughter then moved into his parents southwestern 
michigan home just minutes from his inlaws raising cheyenne is a 
family affair 
kirks six brothers and sisters live at home or nearby and 
there are 10 grandchildren we always have little babies around 
the house so its nothing new says his mother sonja 
fatherhood however was new for kirk now unemployed 
he was sitting here one morning about 530 holding her and he 
had changed her dressed her and fed her and he looked at me and 
said i dont care what you say this is a womans job says 
kirks father larry 
but he has adjusted rising before dawn feeding cheyenne her 
formula changing her diaper dressing her soothing her as she 
starts teething 
its made me realize how much time and care a child needs 
he says 
he has learned cheyenne loves baths and other children and he 
jokes about her temper 
kirk dutifully chronicles all these details to his wife in 
letters faxes videos and a few precious phone calls 
he tells her how big cheyennes brown eyes are how shes grown 
into a 16pound charmer how shes started crawling how cute her 
pierced ears are how she enjoys looking in the mirror and how her 
tiny feet already are outgrowing the red mary janes that match her 
red velvet and lace dress 
i think she worries about missing everything mrs vallance 
says shes not seeing any of this i dont think she worries 
about her care she has the utmost confidence in him 
in one letter her mother received ms vallance told her a saudi 
family with a little girl visited her area one day she said she 
just had to go to her tent she just broke down she couldnt take 
it 
kirk and his motherinlaw stay busy both attended a support 
group meeting for families with relatives in the persian gulf it 
just made me feel good to talk about it he says 
both also try to be upbeat mrs vallance says her daughter is a 
positive thinker who had no complaints about being ordered to the 
mideast she really felt like it was her duty and thats what her 
job was she says 
last summer kirk thought his wife would be home in three 
months then six now everyone is hopeful the family will be 
reunited by cheyennes first birthday july 4th 
meanwhile kirk and mrs vallance regularly show cheyenne 
pictures of her mother 
a week before christmas kirks wife called and reassured him of 
her safety i told her it didnt matter im still going to 
worry he says 
i know someday well be back together he adds hopefully 
soon

behind the tattooed skins severed arms and rat 
skeletons in the university lab rests the worlds only collection 
of famous brains left to posterity by some of japans greatest 
thinkers 
each of the 120 brains of prime ministers novelists artists 
and scholars has its own container something like a fish tank in 
the university of tokyos medical department 
scientists there hope to gain some insight into what makes the 
brains of famous people special 
wed like to get many more said yutaka yoshida curator of 
the collection id especially like to get brains from 
mathematicians musicians and singers 
the collection was begun in 1913 when the family of taro 
katsura a threetime prime minister asked that his brain be 
preserved for study after his death the newest acquisition is the 
brain of former prime minister takeo miki who died in 1988 
so far the deeprooted reluctance among japanese to tamper with 
the dead has ensured that the museums resources far outweigh its 
ability to use them 
we try as far as possible not to cut them yoshida said 
we want to keep them in their original shape 
university researchers have crosssectioned several brains to 
allow some visual and microscopic comparisons most are 
undisturbed however immersed in amber formaldehyde gleaming 
palely behind small handwritten cards giving the names and special 
qualities of their original owners 
yoshida is a slight quiet man with 13 years of experience in 
the lab which also has diseased selections of human anatomy and 
wallhangings of tattooed skins donated by men who wanted to have 
their body art preserved 
as curator he has renewed efforts to learn from the collection 
of famous brains 
the brain of hisashi hamaguchi an eloquent prime minister 
assassinated in 1931 looks about the same as that of natsume 
soseki a famous novelist who died in 1916 or of yasuko miyake a 
writer who provided the only female brain in the collection 
researchers say the fibers in the part of hamaguchis brain 
that controls speech are very complex very special he said 
referring to a part of the left hemisphere that regulates speech 
and other motor functions in righthanded people 
you cant do much research just looking at the outside of the 
brains yoshida said were obviously going to have to start 
doing histological microscopic tissue studies in the future 
yoshida feels some japanese would protest such studies 
somehow i think the japanese would want to keep the famous 
brains the way they are now he said they wouldnt like to 
have them laying around on lab benches 
many universities keep frozen or preserved brains for research 
purposes but none has a collection of geniuses yoshida said 
the tokyo collection resulted from a preoccupation with the 
differences between asians and caucasians men and women geniuses 
and average people that emerged during the meiji era 18681912 
when japan began in earnest to study western science and 
technology 
eventually japanese medical researchers began to study brains 
with some controversial results the brains of some famous people 
they found were heavier than those of less distinguished thinkers 
japans heaviest brain of record was that of torasaburo araki a 
politician and doctor who left 574 ounces of gray matter behind 
when he died in 1942 and prime minister katsuras brain was second 
at 56 ounces the average japanese brain is said to weigh 455 
ounces 
it seems as if great thinkers ma indeed have heavier 
brains says yoshida but then so do many criminals i hear 
maybe they have a different sort of intelligence

howto guides are wildly popular in teaching 
everything from dating to dressing in japan where pressures to 
conform can be immense 
howto magazines attract japanese readers who are always 
fearful of doing something different by showing a standard of what 
people should be doing said masayoshi kinjo editor of the 
popular mens magazine brutus 
recently brutus described the right way to behave on a 
date 
order a tea immediately when your date shows up at a coffee 
shop to meet you smile even at waitresses and passersby to 
better your image dont order drinks that make you look like a 
wimp and finally enjoy sex 
many young japanese have trouble developing close relationships 
because of scholastic rivalries with other students and their 
parents long working hours books and television teach them how to 
do so said yasuo ueda an associate professor of journalism at 
sofia university in tokyo 
store shelves are filled with howto magazines paperbacks 
comic books and videotapes 
a typical company handbook provides guidance for conduct on the 
job 
shave every morning and clip your nails occasionally keep 
shoe polish and a brush in your locker to make your shoes always 
shiny bend your head 15 to 30 degrees when you bow but bow as 
much as 45 degrees to apologize 
researchers say reliance on such material results from an 
education system designed to make everyone the same through rules 
that dictate for instance the color of underwear and when 
students may go to the bathroom 
critics of the propensity for conformity acknowledge the 
education systems role in helping japan become an economic 
powerhouse but fault schools for failing to teach students 
creativity 
being always told what to do people stop thinking and 
young people have become very passive said ueda 
there should be so many different ways for them to live their 
own lives but people are making decisions based on a few 
stereotypes he said in an interview 
bunchin katsura a wellknown storyteller who teaches sociology 
at kansai university in osaka has had enough of the manuals 
could somebody please write a howto book entitled how not to 
depend on howto books he said 
young people like the manuals because following them provides 
reassurance that they are not outcasts from society 
katsura said the degree of reliance on selfhelp publications 
became clear to him on christmas of 1989 when he saw dozens of 
young men lined up at a hotel checkout counter while their 
girlfriends waited patiently to the side 
he attributed the lobby gridlockto magazines that instruct 
young men to seal a relationship with the opposite sex with a 
proposal to spend an intimate christmas eve in a hotel room in 
japan christmas is celebrated as an occasion to give gifts and to 
be with friends not as a religious holiday 
about 1800 howto magazines are published in japan each year 
in addition to many books according to the research institute for 
publications

arnold schwarzenegger took the 
easy job 
as the star of the new movie kindergarten cop 
schwarzenegger only had to look like he was ruling a schoolroom of 
children 
as the movies director and coproducer ivan reitman actually 
had to wrangle the 30 feisty tots and coax a lot of comedy out of 
them and their behemoth costar 
just try to tell a kid to hit a mark said reitman the 
amiable director of twins stripes ghostbusters and 
its sequel 
you say walk across the room stop on the line say your 
line and go over there and pick up a basketball say that to a 
5yearold and everything youve said before is forgotten he 
hears the word basketball something to do with a basketball you 
call action and boom he runs over and picks up the 
basketball 
having worked with such temperamental talents as dan aykroyd and 
debra winger reitman whos also the father of three children was 
equal to the task 
although they blew scores of lines and occasionally glanced into 
the camera reitman believes the children in kindergarten cop 
turned out as solid as schwarzenegger 
in the movie written by murray salem and the team of herschel 
weingrod and timothy harris brutish police officer john kimble 
schwarzenegger must teach an oregon kindergarten class so he can 
help track down a killer richard tyson a snarling stubblefaced 
tower of strength on the los angeles streets kimble is cowed by 
the wiseacre infants he must control them or blow the case 
a simple fire drill proves more difficult to kimble than an 
armed robbery unbuckling a childs suspenders trickier than 
defusing a time bomb 
having previously collaborated with schwarzenegger on twins 
reitman knew the star of terminator total recall conan 
the barbarian and predator possessed some comic skills the 
trick was to let the stereotype of the former body builder work for 
kindergarten cop rather than against it 
for the first reel or so its almost a parody of what he does 
and what he has done reitman said its all very carefully 
designed down to the lighting and the camera angles to bring up 
sort of a terminator image 
i thought it would be very interesting whether you can take 
the icon and the arnold cliche and then twist it around in new ways 
and really believe in this guy right through the end believe in 
his situations and get involved with him emotionally and with the 
people he meets 
reitman 44 and his family fled czechoslovakia for canada when 
he was 4 he has produced national lampoons animal house 
heavy metal and casual sex 
in twins he directed schwarzenegger and danny de vito as 
genetically designed twin brothers it marked schwarzeneggers 
emergence as an actor with more range than a variety of grunts and 
accented obscenities 
i thought kindergarten cop was a great film for him he 
had felt that he been getting typed and he needed some more 
complexities to the characters he was playing reitman said 
heres a guy who looks like a fantasy character at the top 
but if it works he becomes a real multidimensional complex human 
being 
there were two primary challenges in making kindergarten 
cop reitman said balancing the storys alternating themes of 
comedy romance and drama and eliciting credible performances from 
a bunch of 4to7yearolds 
theres a thing with child actors said reitman when you 
talk to them they sound fine but as soon as you give them 
something that has to be repeated take after take or is printed on 
a page theres a very natural tendency to become stilted and the 
audition process in which 2000 children were interviewed was 
very difficult to sit through because of that 
the 30 children including the twins joseph and christian 
cousins who alternate as student dominic were instructed by 
reitman the first day to follow five simple rules know your 
character act natural be disciplined listen and dont look at 
the camera 
with three murders in kindergarten cop and a barrage of 
beatings reitman admits kindergartners shouldnt see a film about 
them 
i really held back you dont really see anything reitman 
said but its just intense emotionally i felt the violence 
had to be there or the film would just peter out at the end

john tower believes his former senate 
colleagues did him wrong when they rejected his nomination as 
defense secretary now hes settling the score 
sen j james exon dneb is a genuine boozer tower 
writes in a book slated for publication in february sen ernest 
hollings dsc is the senate bully a study in arrogance 
and pomposity sen robert c byrd dwva has a tendency to 
resort to flatulent indignation 
tower a fourterm texas senator and former republican chairman 
of the senate armed services committee suffered the most 
ignominious defeat in march 1989 when the senate turned down 
president bushs selection of him to head the defense department 
the defeat came amid allegations that tower was an excessive 
drinker womanizer and held close ties to defense contractors all 
charges he denies in the book 
the rejection also capped a rancorous period in the new bush 
administration and the long tradition of senate comity in which 
only eight cabinet nominees had been rejected in the nations 
history 
the book titled consequences a personal and political 
memoir and published by little brown and co is towers first 
extensive response to the damaging blow the senate inflicted on his 
washington career 
he leaves several bridges smoldering in the books wake and 
fires shots at republicans and democrats alike tower directs much 
of the vitriol at sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate 
armed services committee who led the fight against the nomination 
presidential ambitions were i believe a major factor in sam 
nunns decision to oppose my nomination tower writes 
the former texas senator goes on to say 
if nunn had suspected that he would end up looking like an 
unscrupulous mudslinger who would stop at nothing to achieve his 
objectives perhaps he would have satisfied himself with making a 
few critical comments expressing whatever reservations he may have 
felt even to the point of indicating that i was on probation and 
then voting to approve the nomination 
but sam nunn was blinded by his own ambition 
nunns press secretary scott williams said last week that the 
senator would have no comment on the book in fact calls to senate 
offices of the other lawmakers also drew a no comment reaction 
tower cites several reasons for nunns opposition and says the 
armed services chairman was upset with bushs selection from the 
beginning 
tower believes that nunn who played a major role in advising 
1988 democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis on defense 
issues was upset by towers attacks on dukakis policies tower 
campaigned for bush in several states 
in addition tower had advised former president reagan to veto 
the fiscal 1989 defense authorization bill legislation that 
congress led by nunn and the pentagon headed by thendefense 
secretary frank carlucci had worked out 
tower suggests in the book that nunn was still smarting from 
reagans decision 
i did not regard nunn as an obstacle and that was a fatal 
misreading of the situation tower writes in hindsight what 
lay before me however was not confirmation as secretary of 
defense but a political killing field prepared by the chairman of 
the senate armed services committee 
the attacks on nunn are not limited to the confirmation process 
tower also compares himself to nunn 
unlike sam nunn who has a reputation for being distant and 
disdainful toward his staff i treated my aides with friendship and 
respect tower wrote in return i got tremendous loyalty and 
extended effort it was not at all unusual to punctuate a long 
stressful day with a break at the monocle 
the monocle is a popular restaurant and bar on capitol hill 
tower also criticizes the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee sen john warner of virginia who in towers 
eyes failed to live up to his role as the panels top gop lawmaker 
leading the fight for the presidents nominee 
to keep on good terms with sam nunn he ceded the rights of 
the republican minority to object to a course of action that was 
inimical to its best interests tower wrote 
warner who argued in several senate floor speeches for the 
nominee and voted to confirm tower was the lone senator to respond 
to the book 
youve got to know john tower as we do its his texas 
style warner said thursday 
towers attacks on exon as a heavy drinker are not new during 
exons reelection fight against republican hal daub in november 
tower campaigned for the gop candidate and made the same 
accusations exon denied the charges 
tower does not limit his criticisms to the senate the former 
senator believes that white house counsel c boyden grays 
inexperience in handling the nomination contributed in some ways to 
its demise 
in the end tower writes that he didnt resent his rejection as 
much as he was upset with the way it was done 
what was happening to me could have happened in an evil 
kafkaesque society tower writes it couldnt happen in the 
united states it couldnt happen in the us senate

the more things have changed on wall street from 
the 80s into the early 90s the more one thing remains the same 
big stocks keep soundly thrashing smaller counterparts in the 
battle for investors favor 
as the bearmarket year of 1990 draws to a close the typical 
loss suffered by bigname blue chips is far smaller than the 
declines sustained by the great mass of smaller secondary 
stocks 
for the latest 12month period through early december the 
composite index of the new york stock exchange where most large 
stocks are traded dropped 66 percent 
over the same span both the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market and the american stock exchange market 
value index showed losses exceeding 18 percent 
this sort of thing has been happening regularly ever since the 
mid1980s in apparent contravention of a prized doctrine among 
stock analysts and academic researchers known as the small firm 
effect 
over most extended periods of time their studies have 
concluded little stocks are likely to fare better than big stocks 
if only because small companies have room for greater percentage 
growth 
several theories have been advanced to explain why this pattern 
is no longer holding for one thing big stocks got greater benefit 
from the takeover mania of the 80s than did those of small 
companies which had fewer assets to restructure 
for another big stocks had a special attraction for foreign 
investors given their familiar names and their perceived 
stability 
but the most compelling reason of all may be the longrunning 
trend toward index investing constructing portfolios for pension 
funds mutual funds and other large pools of money to look as much 
as possible like a market index such as standard amp poors composite 
of 500 stocks 
indexers mostly buy big stocks and hold them since big stocks 
dominate the makeup of the indexes they try to replicate 
indexing enjoys great popularity as a lowcost way to 
participate in longterm market gains without the risk of 
underperforming that befalls many managed stock portfolios 
it is not so popular in the stock brokerage business however 
since it downplays just about every service wall street has to 
sell from stockpicking to execution of buy and sell orders 
indeed john j phelan jr who retires dec 31 as chairman of 
the new york stock exchange cites it as a prime force in the 
recession gripping the securities industry 
it has put an enormous cost squeeze all through the system 
he said during an interview last week right from the 
moneymanagement end of it to the execution end of it 
phelans view of the nearterm future offers little consolation 
for either brokers or partisans of the small stocks indexing is 
going to continue to have an enormous influence in the market for 
the next three to five years he says 
but sooner or later he maintains the pendulum that has been 
swinging away from active money management toward indexing will 
reach a point where it turns back the other way 
just about the time everybody indexes and everybody says money 
managers cant do better than the market then were going to get a 
whole crop of them doing better than the market he said you 
know thats going to come but we havent gone to that extreme yet 
money management is the only business in the world that says 
were mediocre phelan concluded the human condition is not 
going to live with that for very long

for stockmarket investors and people who work 
in the securities industry it hasnt been easy to see much bright 
promise in the early days of the 1990s 
stock prices have spent most of 1990 in a bear market that 
surpassed the crash of 1987 in duration if not in severity 
at the same time wall street itself languished in the fourth 
year of a stubborn industry slump 
the endofanera signals in 1990 seemed hard to miss in 
february the firm of drexel burnham lambert kingpin of the 80s 
junkbond boom abruptly collapsed and disappeared from the scene 
nine months later its foremost financier michael milken drew a 
10year prison sentence 
but in the midst of these backwardlooking events many analysts 
argue that the ground is being cleared and the seeds being sown for 
more bounteous times in the investment world as the decade 
progresses 
the economy has tumbled into a serious recession said erich 
heinemann chief economist at ladenburg thalmann amp co in new 
york the financial structure is at risk even so the year ahead 
could be surprisingly good for wall street 
with an assist from the federal reserve we expect the economy 
to rebound during the second half of 1991 this has exciting 
implications for financial markets 
to put a number on his optimism david bostian at jesup 
josephthal amp co forecasts that the dow jones industrial average 
will climb to 5000 as early as middecade 
this recession is providing painful but valuable lessons to 
governments corporations and individuals that will improve their 
economic conduct in the 1990s he maintains 
the new decade will see savings and investment favored 
relative to consumption and equity favored over debt to cite only 
two critical changes 
like many optimists in other areas of the economy wall streets 
bulls are counting on the present crunch ultimately to serve as a 
purgative and restorative rather than destructive force 
one central theme in this kind of argument is that the debt mess 
of the 1980s with all the problems it has caused will be cleaned 
up before too long but not forgotten 
says bostian i think the banks may have learned a 
longtoberemembered lesson on the importance of lending for 
productive economic activity rather than financial speculation 
what is more some observers argue a reborn distaste for credit 
excess is likely to help foster a longlasting decline in interest 
rates 
now that recession is clear to everyone anxiety about 
inflation will evaporate contends robert barbera economist at 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
backtoback decades of low inflation are likely to break the 
back of inflationary expectations as a consequence interest rates 
should decline more than inflation as real rates fall as well 
for investors who spent the past 10 years in money market 
funds or certificates of deposit the collapse of high real rates 
on cash instruments is not good news 
we believe that to obtain higher returns in the 1990s 
investors will need to accept the volatility associated with stocks 
and bonds and these of course would benefit from such a change in 
strategy 
whether they accept such reasoning or not some analysts suspect 
there is more pain to be endured before any party gets started 
to establish a bona fide bottom to the bear market they assert 
investors in greater numbers will have to be driven from the scene 
in discouragement or disgust 
this never again mood is not yet manifest in such important 
arenas as mutual fund activity indeed through the first 10 months 
of 1990 while the stock market was sagging investors snapped up 
56 billion in new shares of stock mutual funds challenging a 
record of 67 billion set in 1987 
at past market bottoms hardly anybody wanted any part of stock 
funds 
observers looking for extremes of pessimism say the requisite 
gloom is much easier to find however within the securities 
industry itself where talk abounds that the good days are forever 
gone 
aside from the business of money management executives in the 
brokerage business these days seem hardpressed to find any facet 
of their operations that promises much money to be made 
wall street has been through its own private recession for the 
past three years says heinemann firms have cut back they 
have pared their costs

not so long ago americans were carefree 
consumers armed with credit cards they went cheerfully into debt 
satisfying needs and whims with few worries about the future 
but the broadening recession has made oncespendthrift shoppers 
timid as evidenced by a sharp downturn in spending yet some 
observers see a silver lining to these hard times and say consumers 
may emerge as wiser and more demanding customers 
if consumers start retrenching and saving more that might 
make more money available for investment which could stimulate 
the economy said sandra shaber an economist with futures group in 
washington 
the slowdown in consumer spending may just be a mixed blessing 
its bad in the sense that its going to aggravate the 
downturn in the economy in the shortterm said lawrence 
chimerine a senior adviser with drimcgraw hill inc a 
forecasting concern in lexington mass but in the longterm a 
lot of families have been loaded with debt and they need time to 
make an adjustment 
still consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the 
gross national product must remain buoyant enough for the economy 
to recover 
over the past few months growth in consumer credit has dropped 
sharply in october consumer credit was growing at an annual rate 
of 24 percent down from a 46 percent growth rate in september 
and 5 percent in august 
a year earlier americans were taking on debt much more freely 
credit rose at an annual rate as high as 6 percet in august 1989 
the great heyday when consumers were borrowing even more 
rapidly than what their income growth was came in 86 ms shaber 
said but for the next two years debt continued to grow but at 
about the same pace as income and since the beginning of 1990 it 
has fallen behind the rate of income growth she said 
ms shaber attributed the recent slippage in consumer debt to a 
slowdown in income growth that began in 1989 and continued into 
this past year people have less money to spend and theyre going 
to buy less she said 
other factors also have helped bring consumer spending levels in 
line with income the tax reform act of 1986 which phased out the 
deduction for most consumer debt made some americans realize they 
had to take a more responsible attitude toward spending 
many consumers have put spending on nonessentials such as 
clothing furniture and appliances on hold as the unemployment 
rate climbs and the middle east crisis looms as a huge uncertainty 
the reluctance to spend money in department and discount stores 
has forced retailers to become more lean by cutting their 
inventories and buying less merchandise with less demand for goods 
at us factories production is down and that has meant layoffs 
for hundreds of thousands of workers in recent months 
it doesnt end there consumers who are not working have even 
less money so they are scaling back spending and the cycle begins 
all over again 
harry l davis a professor of marketing at the university of 
chicago graduate school of business found another silver lining 
people having little money to waste on goods that wear out or 
break down easily are becoming better consumers 
they have learned how to say no this quality isnt high 
enough davis said 
a consumers decision to put off a big purchase may be the 
result of being to some extent better informed and wanting to buy 
things that are going to be longerlasting values he said 
this growing sophistication among consumers is putting pressure 
on us manufacturers to come up with better ideas and products 
automakers must now market their cars based on durability and 
safety instead of image while mcdonalds is spending a lot of 
time grappling with consumer demands for healthier food davis 
said 
manufacturers are not the only ones having to shape up 
retailers facing tougher competition for fewer consumer 
dollars must come up with better merchandise at the right price 
they have to improve customer service and make their stores 
convenient and attractive 
the consumers are providing more challenge to companies 
davis said

if you read the lips of george bush and saddam 
hussein in 1990 youre probably wondering how youre going to pay 
the oil and tax bills this coming year 
those two elements of the economic equation suddenly turned into 
wild cards but the news isnt all bad 
higher taxes for one could help trim the us budget deficit 
which many economists call the main problem others fear a bigger 
tax bite will hamper economic expansion 
higher oil prices might revive energy conservation but it seems 
doubtful they will last the persian gulf crisis also has prompted 
the government to speed efforts at developing a national energy 
policy 
but in the short run the higher tax and fuel bills wont be 
much fun for anybody except perhaps the tax collectors and the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
consumers have to cut back on their spending because theyre 
spending more money on fuel and heating oil said edwin s 
rothschild of citizen action a washingtonbased consumer group 
businesses are having to spend more and people are being laid 
off the airlines are having a hard time 
rothschild estimated that before this cold season ends the 
average household that uses home heating oil will have to pay 
between 300 and 500 more to keep warm 
consumers also were paying about 30 cents a gallon more for 
gasoline as the year drew to a close experts pointed out however 
that when inflation is taken into account fuel prices were much 
cheaper in 1990 than they were in the early 1980s when the 
aftershocks of the iranian revolution pushed oil prices higher 
regardless the effects of the expensive oil will ripple through 
the economy which is already running into hard times 
it is a major contributing factor to the recession that we are 
entering rothschild said 
although many economists and wall streeters were proclaiming a 
recession throughout the fall the government carefully avoided 
uttering what has become known as the dreaded rword 
the administrations deeds spoke louder than words however 
when bush abandoned his read my lips pledge of no new taxes 
the government instituted a sweeping package of higher taxes on 
income gasoline cigarettes and liquor 
the gasoline tax increase of 51 cents a gallon added to the 
burden of higher fuel costs brought on by the persian gulf crisis 
economists say it will hit working people and the poor hardest 
during 1990 americans had to work fulltime from jan 1 to may 
5 before they had paid off their entire tax burden according to 
the tax foundation a washington watchdog group 
its too early to pinpoint the date of tax freedom day for 
1991 but the foundation estimates it will be pushed back again 
it really cant help but make it even worse tax foundation 
spokesman bill ahern said the only thing that could prevent the 
day from getting worse would be a phenomenal economic recovery for 
1991 that doesnt seem to be in the cards if you look at the taxes 
they are substantial 
many economists see the tax burden as a bigger threat to the 
family budget than expensive oil because oil is plentiful despite 
the gulf crisis 
in december opec ministers agreed to reinstate production 
quotas once the turmoil ends but oil analysts predict the cartel 
will have a tough time executing that plan 
the american petroleum institute a leading industry trade 
organization said if crude prices come down and stay down the 
prices of refined petroleum products will have to follow 
as 1991 progresses it could reveal whether the united states 
has changed any of its energy priorities after suffering the oil 
shock of 1990 
the energy department is expected to release a longawaited 
energy strategy that will include expanded uses of alternative 
fuels as well as proposals for drilling for oil in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge

it was the year manhattan apartment prices 
actually went down and some california builders staggering under 
unsold inventories gave away a new car with each house sold 
in florida new homes and condos sat empty because retirees 
could not sell their homes up north wouldbe home sellers in 
affluent new york suburbs slashed asking prices by 100000 and 
more and still no takers 
it was the year when lucille balls mansion in beverly hills 
an enclave where common economic trends arent supposed to apply 
sat unpurchased even after the asking price was cut from 78 
million to 56 million 
it was the year in which even the redhot seattle market turned 
as cool as the squalls off puget sound 
in short it was a time when regional weaknesses in home sales 
the northeast since the stock market crash of 1987 the oil states 
before that threatened to engulf the country in a national real 
estate recession 
or at least both coasts in many parts of the south and midwest 
home prices and sales levels have remained at more modest levels 
sales were up 3 percent during the first 11 months of 1990 at 
remax of northern illinois said betty hegner the president of 
the operation with 116 offices and nearly 2000 agents 
i have to say there are some markets where there definitely 
is a softening of the market especially during the last quarter 
she said 
expensive homes those priced above 200000 were selling 
slowly recently in part because their owners wont reduce prices 
she said but we have a lot of bright spots too we think its a 
good time to buy 
even on the coasts was it a recession or merely the end of a 
cycle that was still unclear in many regions take the northwest 
where few could believe that 1989 and early 1990 sales and prices 
could long be sustained any more than the increases in california 
in 1988 could go on forever 
we had phenomenal appreciation said maria bunting 
executive vice president of windermere real estate in seattle 
for a real estate agent it was as good as the wildest dreams of 
what they would like it to be 
by spring houses flooded the market as prices peaked buyers 
pulled back sellers panicked and home prices began to fall over 
the summer 
it was an adjustment period ms bunting said describing 
the region as now having a normal buyerseller balance 
lower prices brought home ownership closer to millions of 
people national association of realtors statistics showed a 
decline from july to october of 98300 to 92800 in the median 
price of a home the price at which half of the sales were for 
more half for less 
jill and robert mccarty saw both sides of the equation and 
figure they came out ahead the couple he an accountant and she a 
manicurist bought their dream house in december a fourbedroom 
2100squarefoot new home with a threecar garage in saugus an 
outer suburb north of los angeles 
they sold their first home a fixerupper they bought six 
years ago for 105000 in the working class sun valley area of los 
angeles for 207000 
we listed it at 229000 which would have been the fair price 
a little while ago but after two weeks we dropped the price when 
we saw what was happening she said 
meanwhile they returned to the tracts in more comfortably 
middleclass saugus and found builders cutting prices and throwing 
in extras with abandon 
we had been looking for two years up there and couldnt find 
anything we could afford she said so when the market got 
slow we said lets see what we could do we got a 310000 home 
for 250000 
that price included 5000 in closing costs paid by the builder 
and another 5000 in luxury carpet 
were never moving again mccarty said we would never 
have been able to do it if the market hadnt been like this

hard times could put a squeeze on research and 
development spending by us businesses but experts warn against 
cutbacks that divert americans from the global technology race 
its an easy but foolish place to cut said richard shaffer 
editor of technologic computer letter a computer industry 
newsletter 
despite gloomy talk many experts say us scientists and 
engineers continue to make breakthroughs in a variety of fields and 
hold their own in a number of technologies 
i dont think were any less innovative and creative than we 
were 20 years ago even though some people think were becoming 
soft and the japanese are going to run over us said donald 
wilson an assistant professor of management at rochester institute 
of technology 
still some financially struggling companies have little choice 
its selfdefeating in the long run but if youre worried 
about surviving this year you dont worry about the long run 
said david wyss research director of the economic consulting firm 
drimcgrawhill inc 
the need for us companies to maintain research and development 
spending is especially acute in light of steppedup research 
efforts by japanese companies particularly in this country 
in recent years many japanese hightechnology companies have 
opened us research centers to which they attract us scientists 
with high salaries japanese companies also have boosted research 
spending at us universities 
wilson said these moves are an admission that the united states 
is a hub of innovation were seen as kind of the creative 
leaders he said 
us companies overall spend more than twice as much on research 
and development as their japanese counterparts but a smaller 
amount as a percentage of gross national product 
japans science and technology agency says that nations 
research and development spending equaled about 285 percent of its 
gnp in 1989 compared with 253 percent in the united states 
in 1990 us corporate rampd spending is expected to total about 
108 billion with 357 billion of that coming from the federal 
government the national science foundation says 
as for the year ahead a trade group called the industrial 
research institute is optimistic its survey of 137 major 
researchoriented companies shows 41 percent plan to spend at least 
6 percent more on rampd than in 1990 only 16 percent expect a 
decline 
but the group notes the respondents combined rampd as a 
percent of sales is not expected to change from 1990 to 1991 a 
sluggish economy therefore would restrain actual rampd spending 
increases 
the national science foundation says it began detecting a drop 
in annual growth of rampd spending by us companies as early as 
1986 such spending grew 4 percent to 10 percent a year in the 
early 1980s after adjusting for inflation but fell to 2 percent to 
3 percent a year since 1986 the group says 
one of the main reasons was simply a slowdown in sales and 
profit expectations said foundation spokesman john jankowski 
an additional drag on corporate rampd spending has been the 
decline in the federal defense budget he said 
some experts believe the recession will force us companies to 
change the emphasis of their research 
i think they will try and do more with less which really 
means we will see a substantial focusing down peripheral areas or 
research with longerterm horizons will disappear said g 
steven burrill director of high technology for ernst amp young the 
accounting and consulting firm 
david methe another rochester institute of technology 
management professor says the real danger in a recession is that 
us companies may lay off research workers these employees 
represent repositories of knowledge and receptors of knowledge 
from outside that could not easily be replaced he said 
experts say they dont expect the recession to have the same 
impact on rampd in japan where companies are said to have a much 
longerterm focus 
i see them going the other direction with increased 
research spending burrill said 
while the total amount of us corporate research spending is 
important experts say they are equally concerned if not more so 
about the ability of us companies to turn innovations into 
products 
us companies have long excelled at basic research but have a 
spotty history of capitalizing on these breakthroughs in the 
marketplace that is an area in which the japanese appear to have a 
clear lead 
when you look at almost any product the basic work of it was 
done in the us and europe and when the products came out they 
were japanese whether its cds or video tapes said wyss 
experts trace part of the reason to the greater number of 
engineers in japan as a percentage of the population than in the 
united states another factor they cite is that japanese research 
is often more pragmatic and productoriented

viewed as a mechanical structure the us 
economy needs retooling reconditioning rebuilding parts have to 
be rehoned bolts and rivets tightened and the whole works needs a 
lube job 
it hasnt collapsed like the soviet system and it isnt likely 
to do so it doesnt need junking either because nothing better 
has been invented to replace it but it is badly worn abused by 
the greed and grind of the 1980s 
the greatest erosion was from debt and the resolution trust 
corp has the job of liquidating or selling off hundreds of 
collapsed savings and loan associations with the total bill 
conceivably reaching 600 billion 
throughout 1990 banks were forced to write off billions of 
dollars in failed corporate deals and loans with real estate 
developers and third world nations the total bank bill could only 
be surmised but the extent of the damage was illustrated when just 
one chase manhattan corp took a 1 billion charge against 
earnings to cover bad debts 
one of the oddest twists in the credit disaster was that banks 
themselves found it difficult to raise money bankers accustomed 
to hearing tales of woe from wouldbe borrowers had worse problems 
of their own chase the nations second largest commercial banking 
enterprise was forced to offer 13017 percent to sell 200 million 
of notes citicorp parent of the largest bank suffered the 
indignity of having its own credit rating lowered 
industrial companies many loaded with debt showed the strains 
standard amp poors corp found that dividend increases in 1990 fell 
to their lowest levels in 20 years 23 percent fewer than in 1989 
the payout money just wasnt there 
dun amp bradstreet said that in the first 11 months of 1990 
55000 companies failed up 19 percent from 1989 also disturbing 
was that the size of liabilities was up sharply indicating that 
more large companies were filing for protection from creditors 
nearly every industry was affected by failures failures among 
real estate companies which floated the debt among financial 
institutions which helped them raise the funds and among 
insurers which bought the highyielding debt rose more than 30 
percent 
what was the extent of that corporate debts this 
nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross 
national product rose to 67 percent in 1989 from 47 percent 20 
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago 
in the late 1980s half the funds raised by nonfinancial 
corporations came from debt issues with the other half from equity 
offerings but as recently as the 1960s and 1970s the average was 
only 24 percent debt 
in the 20 years through 1989 the ratio of interest expense to 
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent 
since the market plunge of 1987 securities firms had been 
shrinking their own businesses disbanding departments that had 
helped arrange takeovers and junkbond offerings laying off 
workers and closing entire offices the pace quickened in 1990 
with the economy sinking dealmaking was done and rather than 
christmas bonuses many highpaid employees received pink slips 
consumers were in debt up to the limit of their visa cards or 
the caps on their home equity loans personal bankruptcies rose 15 
percent in 1990 and would likely rise again in 1991 late in the 
year home mortgage delinquencies also rose 
uncle sam of course remained in debt unable to balance his 
budget by some estimates the budget deficit could exceed 300 
billion in the coming year this after a tortuous round of 
socalled budget trimming 
economic growth inevitably succumbed to such impossible 
circumstances and the big question now is how deep the downturn 
will be the consensus of forecasts including that from the white 
house is that any recession will be shallow and brief probably 
ending during the summer 
however many of the forecasts come with a caveat that never 
in the postworld war ii era have similar conditions been 
encountered forecasters point to the rickety condition of the 
financial underpinnings and ask if those loans can be repaid in an 
orderly way or whether the structural rivets will give way 
clearly a new era is here in the old era credit was cool in 
the new debt is dumb businesses seeking to rid themselves of debt 
are offering lenders equity instead rjr nabisco inc taken 
private in the biggest debtfinanced buyout ever offered just 
before christmas to trade stock and cash for some of it 
highyielding junk bonds 
lenders are biting the bullet and writing off loans that once 
they claimed were still collectable consumers are cutting 
consumption 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady hinted that legislation 
affecting banking would be on the agenda for 1991 the 
administration of president bush he said was committed to 
promoting legislation and encouraging regulations that will allow 
banks to reshape their activities to operate profitably and soundly 
in business environment made new by technological changes 
meanwhile businesses and households are seeking to cut waste 
work more productively and get those bills paid in short america 
is banking on a return to the old verities chief among them the 
exercise of common sense

the big three automakers have fresh management 
teams and their employees have new contracts but dont be fooled 
the us auto industry is facing old problems requiring action 
car and truck sales tumbled in 1990 profits fell and the 
specter of losses reappeared bluecollar workers wondered weekly 
if they would be at home or on the assembly line the industry was 
declared to be in a recession 
in a climate of unprecedented competition that includes japanese 
companies building cars in the united states executives and labor 
union leaders are looking for new ways to make money 
we are facing an extremely competitive struggle which is 
not going to go away chrysler motors president robert lutz said 
the economy can turn around but the japanese transplants and the 
offshore producers will still be there 
weve got to tell the fords the chryslers the hondas the 
nissans that weve got a product for them said joseph 
hasenjager union president at a general motors corp brake 
component plant in dayton ohio thats the only way you get job 
security 
union and management leaders are hopeful that new threeyear 
contracts between gm chrysler corp and ford motor co and the 
united auto workers will create harmony and avoid disputes that 
could further hurt the industry 
the contracts cover more than 450000 active autoworkers the 
companies have committed billions of dollars to provisions for full 
wages for workers laid off from plants closed because of sales 
slumps 
it is essential that we retain the good will we have ford 
president philip benton said the contract has reinforced that 
atmosphere 
the industry will need all the good feelings it can muster and 
more to reverse losses in market share 
at the end of november the big three held just over 70 percent 
of the us car and truck market to about 24 percent for japanese 
automakers in 1989 gm ford and chrysler had a 737 percent share 
to 224 percent for the japanese 
the industry appeared to be ready for a recovery in the late 
summer when iraq invaded kuwait oil prices skyrocketed and car 
and truck sales fell in the last three months of 1990 the big 
three companies are expected to record their first quarterly loss 
since 1981 
profits are under enormous pressure in north america and they 
started out from an abysmal level benton said 
analysts expect big three profits to fall about 75 percent in 
1990 from 84 billion the previous year that means intensified 
competition for the fewer car and truck buyers 
gms is making the challenge from spring hill tenn site of 
its saturn car project the sevenyear 3 billion effort is aimed 
directly at the honda civic nissan sentra and toyota corolla 
but car buying tanked as the first car rolled off the assembly 
line executives predicted that up to onethird of firstyear sales 
would come from owners of other gm vehicles 
saturns quality control resulted in far fewer cars being 
shipped to dealers than expected some dealers who had invested 
millions in saturn were asked to delay openings or had only one or 
two cars on the showroom floor 
it didnt make for good public relations in an industry that has 
stressed vehicle quality recognizing the reputation of japanese 
automakers for reliability 
management shakeups also are part of the big threes hopes for 
revival 
within 10 hours of officially succeeding roger smith in gms top 
job robert stempel unveiled a new management structure at ford 
harold poling took over from donald petersen but only for three 
years 
at chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald took early 
retirement to head a union effort to buy united airlines the bid 
failed but greenwald still received a reported 9 million 
as the industry worried about the erosion in americans devotion 
to american cars chrysler chairman lee iacocca faulted greenwald 
for leaving the struggling automaker 
he grew up with me hed been in the car business for 32 
years same two companies as me ford and chrysler said 
iacocca who delayed his 1991 retirement plans isnt there 
anything sacred anymore isnt there any loyalty to anything

ten years after a flood of lowcost imports 
devastated americas steelmakers one of the nations historic core 
industries is competitive again 
it took a great deal of pain and suffering but the industry 
is now awake and in some cases remarkably astute and smart said 
john jacobson an analyst with aus consultants in philadelphia 
the pain came in the form of 200000 job reductions hundreds of 
mill closings and billions of dollars in spending to increase 
efficiency the gain is evident in falling imports and rising 
profits 
lower production costs and a weaker dollar have boosted american 
steels competitiveness us steelmakers now produce a ton of 
steel in about 5 manhours lowest in the world and nearly half 
the time it took in 1980 
still the united states remains the worlds biggest steel 
importer foreign rivals especially japan and the european 
community arent standing still 
the japanese already were further ahead and theyre running at 
a much faster pace said hans mueller an economics professor and 
consultant at middle tennessee state university the americans 
are just catching up 
in the first nine months of 1990 imports comprised about 17 
percent of the us steel market making america the worlds 
largest importer according to the american iron and steel 
institute a washington trade group most imports came from europe 
and japan followed by canada south korea brazil and many other 
countries 
the ec and japan are the worlds leading exporters of finished 
steel the united states exported about 46 million tons in 1989 
far less than the top exporters 
the relative value of international currencies more than 
anything else will determine the global competitiveness of 
american steel in the 1990s said charles a bradford a metals 
expert for union bank of switzerland in new york 
the steel industry may be the biggest beneficiary of the 
weakness in the dollar he said the biggest cost of an 
integrated steelmaker is wages if you compare wages around the 
world its all a matter of the value of the dollar 
the united states was the dominant force in the international 
steel market following world war ii and led the world in steel 
production in the 1950s 
but japan and european countries rebuilt their postwar 
industries from scratch using modern technology as us mills 
rusted imports cracked 15 percent by the 1970s and reached an 
alltime high of 264 percent in 1984 
american steelmakers lost about 119 billion from 1980 to 1986 
when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200000 workers 
nationwide left the payrolls 
the picture is brighter now steelmakers made about 15 billion 
in profits in 1989 the cost of halting production while plants 
were modernized was a major factor in 1989 and will continue to 
hurt profits 
the cost of modernization is taking its toll but in the long 
run theyre much better off bradford said this is what you 
need to do if you want to be competitive 
in 1980 about 20 percent of american steel was made in modern 
continuous casters which turn molten steel directly into slabs 
skipping costly and timeconsuming steps 
today about 66 percent of american steel is made that way and 
the figure is expected to reach about 90 percent by the year 2000 
said sheldon wesson a spokesman for the american iron and steel 
institute in 1989 japan made about 94 percent of its steel and 
belgium about 91 percent in continuous casters 
the effort goes on nobody is satisfied wesson said the 
industry says it has spent in the last 10 years perhaps half what 
it would have liked to spend on mill modernization 
you look at the profit picture and you wonder where the next 
billion is going to come from he said this is all 
selffinanced this is all pulling yourself up by the boot 
straps

a city that relies on the auto industry 
to avoid the recession gripping the rest of america its happening 
in nashville 
economists said this southern city took its economic lumps early 
and has settled into a period of stability as other regions are 
forced to retrench the consolidation and weeding out already has 
occurred 
i think what has happened in nashville is that the boom growth 
levels have slowed down said william fox an economist at the 
university of tennessees center for business and economic 
research 
and in that sense nashville might have taken its economic 
lick early he said 
leading the way in nashville are a budding automotive 
manufacturing industry a diversified services sector and an early 
brush with negative growth economists said 
construction for example took a beating in 1989 and a 
little into 1990 fox said but at a time when maufacturing 
is generally going down nashville is being held up by the auto 
industry which is kind of odd 
car and truck sales and industry profits dropped in 1990 but 
two big manufacturers have chosen sites near nashville for new 
factories on which they are pinning hopes for buoyant sales 
general motors corp built its 19 billion saturn corp plant 
in spring hill about 40 miles south of nashville the plant and 
its more than 3600 employees and 700 contract workers began making 
the car in october 
more than 3500 people are employed by nissan motor 
manufacturing corp usa in smyrna about 25 miles southeast of 
nashville 
nissan is in the midst of an 490 million expansion that will 
add 2000 production jobs for total employment of 5500 by 1992 
the expansion will raise nissans smyrna investment to 12 
billion 
gm embarked on the sevenyear saturn effort to develop a car 
that could compete with the honda civic nissan sentra and toyota 
corolla 
saturn is in the early production stages and has not yet reached 
full output unlike aging plants that automakers are closing 
elsewhere in the country 
nissan and saturn dont look like theyll be a factor in 
recession fox said 
saturn intended to start slowly nissan is still in its 
expansion mode so they are not influenced by the business cycle 
he said they very well may be influenced three years from now 
nissan plans to build 165000 sentras at smyrna in the 1991 
model year the plant has a production capacity of 180000 cars a 
year nissans manufacturing president jerry benefield said 
the japanese automaker which also produces light pickup trucks 
in smyrna will add a third vehicle line which has not been 
disclosed with the expansion 
nashville also is weathering the decline facing other big cities 
because of a broad and recessionproof services sector of 
insurance companies hospitals and the headquarters of hospital 
corp of america 
it has a nice diversified economy and its very well 
located fox said this place is very well situated for growth 
and theres no reason to worry about it

credit boeing for the soft landing 
recessions usually hit this area harder than elsewhere but this 
time economists say the good fortune of the boeing co should 
cushion seattle and much of washington state from the economic 
downturn of the rest of the country 
in a state where a superheated economy produced an average 
annual job growth of 5 percent since 1985 economists are 
forecasting that things might return to normal 
economically the late 1980s were kind to seattle real estate 
values soared in a city considered by many to be among the most 
livable jobs were so plentiful that fastfood joints offered 725 
an hour for flipping burgers developers rebuilt the citys skyline 
with more than a dozen major buildings 
much of that prosperity can be attributed to boeing which has 
104700 workers in washington and accounts for one out of every six 
jobs directly or indirectly in the state 
by late december boeing had received 466 billion in new 
commercial jet business for 1990 approaching a sixth record year 
of orders planes ordered three or four years ago are rolling off 
assembly lines at a rate of better than one a day 
in november however state officials acknowledged that the 
recession gripping much of the country had spread mildly to 
washington state economist chang mook sohn forecasts a net loss of 
10000 nonfarm jobs statewide in the first half of 1991 about 5 
percent of the 21 million member workforce 
in seattle a real estate market that had seen home prices climb 
60 percent to 70 percent from 1987 to 1989 returned to normal as 
too many homes were put up for sale for prices too few buyers could 
afford 
construction also declined with some commercial developers 
delaying projects and complaining about an overbuilt downtown weak 
manufacturing and construction in turn have hurt services the 
retailwholesale trade and finance sectors sohn said 
what happened again sohn and other economists look to boeing 
from 1983 to 1989 boeings employment in this area exploded 
from 58000 to 106000 37 percent of all jobs created in 
washington during that period were with the planemaker 
it was the main force behind the rapid immigration to the 
state and the main force behind the housing boom that resulted 
said douglas pedersen vice president and chief economist for 
security pacific bank of washington 
boeings employment peaked in 1989 as commercial production 
became more efficient and defense cuts threatened government 
projects while the growth in aerospace jobs appears over for now 
sohn says boeings employment isnt likely to fall much further 
one of the big differences between the current downturn and 
previous recessions sohn said is the role of the aerospace 
industry in the past a slowdown in planemaking was an advance 
symptom of a recession and tended to pull down washingtons 
economy 
aerospace works this time is a buffer rather than a 
destabilizing force he said 
the recession of the early 80s was magnified here by boeing 
laying off 22000 employees as orders and deliveries of aircraft 
fell 
in 1982 106 aircraft were ordered and 176 were delivered as 
1990 drew to a close boeings orders already had reached 517 
airplanes and it had delivered at least 364 
it has a firm backlog of at least 1850 planes and hundreds more 
options for purchases and is booking delivery dates past the turn 
of the century 
the region isnt without its worries though the timber 
industry for example is hurting from a slump in homebuilding and 
higher log prices 
the home construction slowdown also has hit here but again not 
as hard as elsewhere 
statewide housing starts for 1990 total 43600 about 38 
percent fewer than 1989 pedersen says commercial construction 
also is lagging 
theres very little new building under way and little 
likelihood of more building in the next few years said jon 
runstad president and chief executive officer of wright runstad a 
major seattle developer

all the economy wanted for christmas was a 
discount rate cut or so everyone thought 
the federal reserves gift opened this past week received a 
lukewarm reception from the nations bankers and provided no 
immediate relief from the threat of recession 
the feds rate cut was generous by historical standards a half 
point to 65 percent it was the first reduction in the lending 
rate to banks in more than four years 
it even arrived early well before the the first of the year 
when most prognosticators had expected it 
still the feds generosity was lost on most banks which 
declined to pass the easier credit terms on to their customers 
only one big bank first national bank of chicago cut its prime 
lending rate in the wake of the feds big move 
others like citicorp appeared too weak to respond the 
nations biggest banking company said it would suffer a 
fourthquarter loss of up to 400 million from the costs of setting 
cash aside to cover bad debts and shrinking its staff by 85 
percent or about 8000 employees citicorp also said it would slash 
its dividend by 44 percent 
without the major banks to keep the credit lines pumping down to 
businesses and consumers the economic rescue mission launched by 
the fed could be complicated 
</TEXT>

statistics released during the week highlighted the economys 
ills 
the merchandise trade deficit swelled by auto imports and the 
high cost of foreign oil climbed to 1161 billion in october the 
biggest imbalance in almost three years 
starts of singlefamily houses in november fell to their lowest 
level since the 198182 recession 
consumer spending in november rose just 01 percent and income 
growth only matched inflation 
most distressing for the future of the economy was a report 
showing businesses planned only a slight increase in spending for 
modernization and expansion in 1991 
inflation which rose only modestly in november provided the 
only good news and cleared the way for the feds move 
the fed read the 03 percent rise in consumer prices last month 
as a signal it could safely loosen credit without giving ground in 
its fight to keep inflation controlled

the campaign to try to brighten up wall street 
in time for the holidays has received some extra lastminute help 
from the federal reserve 
but analysts warn that a promise of cheaper money from the fed 
and its chairman alan greenspan by itself is no assurance of a 
cheery start on the new year 
the central bank acted last tuesday afternoon to lower the 
discount rate the charge it sets on loans to private financial 
institutions to 65 percent from 7 percent where it had stood for 
almost two years 
the cut did not come as a total surprise to the investment 
world but most analysts who had been talking about the possibility 
were projecting it for some time after jan 1 
thus the timing as much as the substance of the move was 
interpreted as a signal that the fed was stepping up the pace of 
its efforts to ease credit conditions and relieve the pressures of 
a developing recession 
among the tools at the feds disposal the discount rate is 
often described as powerful symbolic and psychological device but 
observers are quick to add that it is not a magic wand 
in the midst of the last sustained bear market for stocks the 
fed also sent a message of christmas cheer to investors cutting 
the discount rate from 14 percent to 12 percent on dec 4 1981 
it was not until the second half of 1982 however that stocks 
bottomed out and the economy began its recovery from recession 
in todays situation furthermore many analysts wonder if 
cutting the price of money will be enough to get it moving faster 
through the financial system 
were in a credit crunch all right but it is not being 
engineered by the federal reserve board asserts charles 
laloggia a rochester ny investment adviser 
the credit crunch stems from the fact that the banking system 
is awash in bad loans which are getting worse by the day both 
bankers and banking regulators are now scared stiff of making new 
loans 
a credit contraction as described by james grant in his 
grants interest rate observer newsletter is a kind of malady 
unseen since the 1930s 
in a credit contraction he says borrowers are denied 
the principal rationing device for loans is not high interest rates 
but low creditworthiness the credit of the borrower or the 
liquidity of the lending institution or both 
such misgivings helped to mute the celebration in the financial 
world that followed the feds announcement at fridays close the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials stood at 263366 up 3985 
points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 216 to 18087 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
478 to 37361 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was u 046 at 30620 
volume on the big board averaged 17670 million shares a day 
against 15585 million the week before 
as if to dispel any illusions that the fed could dictate the 
level of interest rates bond traders pushed rates on longterm 
government bonds higher as the week progressed 
bond traders keep a continuous antiinflation watch manifesting 
their concern every time the fed takes a step toward stimulus that 
they suspect might eventually increase inflationary pressures 
at the moment however most forecasters dont see inflation as 
a major menace to the markets any time soon 
inflation should prove to be much less of a problem in 1991 
than it has been in recent years contends david blitzer 
economist at standard amp poors corp 
we expect to see some of the smallest price increases since 
the mid1980s and have hopes that the gains against inflation will 
be longlasting ones

in the soviet union 15 million people are on 
a waiting list for a telephone 
per capita income in this crumbling superpower is roughly that 
of mexico and about onetenth what it is in the industrialized 
democracies 
the soviet union is the worlds largest producer of wheat yet 
loses a fifth of its crop 10 times higher than us losses and 
must buy grain from the rest of the world to feed its people 
their cows produce only half as much milk as those in western 
europe 
the soviet union is an utterly backward nation as portrayed by 
the first sovietsanctioned international investigation of its 
economy it lags far behind the west in virtually every facet of 
life while squandering its rich natural reources and poisoning 
its environment 
the dispassionate drylywritten report by the international 
monetary fund world bank and two major european development 
organizations presents a portrait of worsening and inescapable 
hardship for the soviet people 
more astounding statistics from the longawaited report 
released friday 
a soviet household pays only about 3 percent of its income for 
rent which has remained essentially the same since 1928 thats 
about onetenth what a family in a major industrialized country 
would pay in a graphic demonstration of how the system has failed 
the report notes that nearly one in five families has been on a 
waiting list for an apartment for more than 10 years 
in some regions people are being exposed to environmental 
health risks 10 to 100 times greater than those acceptable in the 
west 
many of the industrial and agricultural regions of the ussr 
are on the verge of ecological breakdown posing an imminent threat 
to the health of present and future generations the 
investigators said 
a recent consumer survey showed that nearly 90 percent of 
basic industrial goods were in short supply but because there is 
practically no relationship between supply and demand stocks of 
machine tools are 10 or more times higher than in countries with 
market economies 
as much as 40 percent of perishable crops like fruits and 
vegetables goes to waste the problem shortages of packaging 
materials storage facilities outdated processing technology and 
poor transportation whats more soil and water are being ruined 
by environmentally insensitive production methods and in the 
process food is being contaminated 
the soviet union has a large manufacturing sector that amounts 
to roughly the same proportion of its gross national product as 
similar industries in east and west europe but inefficiency is 
rampant the soviets use 50 percent more energy to produce steel 
than the japanese and many factories employ two workers for every 
one in a similar western job 
the soviet union produces more iron ore zinc and nickel than 
any other country in the world it ranks second in production of 
gold aluminum and lead third in copper production yet with the 
exception of production of gold diamonds platinum and nickel for 
export the metal and mining industries are characterized by 
antiquated machinery and technologies with virtually no 
computerization and dwindling resources the report found 
it produces 22 percent of the worlds oil and 40 percent of 
global natural gas but the soviet unions coal and oil output is 
falling and domestic energy shortages are appearing the report 
blames outdated technologies obsolete equipment and poor 
maintenance 
while other oilproducing countries have enjoyed a windfall from 
the spurt in oil prices brought on by the persian gulf crisis the 
soviet unions oil production and exports have plummeted denying 
the country desperately needed hard currency 
the investigators concluded after their six months of study that 
the traditional centrally planned system has largely collapsed 
the bleak picture led the investigators to conclude that 
president mikhail s gorbachevs recently approved economic reform 
plan is too vague and too slow they called instead for the 
beleaguered soviet citizens to take the bitter economic medicine of 
ending price controls on heavily subsidized basic commodities while 
accepting wage controls to speed the transition to a market 
economy 
while conceding that unemployment would rise and output would 
fall the experts at the international monetary fund insisted that 
gorbachev must move quickly to estblish private property rights 
and let market forces drive reform in farming manufacturing and 
the crumbling distribution network 
ideally a path of gradual reform could be laid out which 
would minimize economic disturbance and lead to an early harvesting 
of the fruits of increased economic efficiency the study said 
but we know of no such path the more particularly given the 
difficult starting conditions 
while calling for technical assistance to help the soviets in 
their efforts to discard seven decades of a planned economy the 
study said that massive amounts of western aid would not be useful 
right now 
it said that without the implementation of a major and 
fareaching reform program a direct infusion of cash would be of 
little or no lasting value

some of northern europes welfare 
states wonder how to keep their cradletograve safety nets from 
fraying in the impending recession 
in the postworld war ii boom years the scandinavian countries 
the netherlands and west germany introduced programs that spend up 
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare 
welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that 
was supposed to pay the bill with growth slowing in many european 
countries some governments are considering cutbacks 
with less money available for welfare government officials 
complain more loudly about people abusing the system 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers says his nations welfare 
system which will cost the government 1323 billion guilders 
796 billion in 1991 is out of hand 
in a recent report the organization for economic cooperation 
and development citing hollands high income taxes and generous 
welfare benefits concluded that incentives to work are low the 
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate 
dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless amsterdam 
residents to the understaffed flower industry even after the 
government offered a car for every four workers to use for 
commuting as well as personal use 
denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 14 million 
people 28 percent of the population who live on welfare the 
centerright coalition government of prime minister poul schlueter 
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private 
industry 
denmark has 20000 people under 40 years of age getting 
permanent government pensions of 3709 kroner 662 a month 
because of drug or alcohol problems 
in europe welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless 
the system commonly includes free medical insurance sick pay 
disability and old age pensions and childcare and unemployment 
benefits 
in sweden parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off 
to nurse a sick child 
the basic thing is that everyone should have basic 
opportunities to take part in all activities within our 
society said annchristen filipson of the swedish social affairs 
ministry 
scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in 
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs their 
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the 
industrialized world 
last october swedens ruling social democratic party made the 
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 25139 
billion kronor 4513 billion just over onefifth of the gnp 
the government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor 269 
billion dollars from the welfare budget in 1991 the government is 
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent 
of a workers salary for the first three days in an effort to 
discourage malingering workers take an average 25 days of sick 
leave a year 
the welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by 
employers and employees and some are getting fed up 
ove danemar of the swedish employers federation criticized 
the whole system because it stimulates people to work less 
and to take more leisure time 
the private sector cant bear it any longer he said its 
no longer consistent with a modern economy 
critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but 
have ended up being abused during more favorable economic times 
the abuse was widely tolerated but with the continent entering a 
recession there is more clamping down on wasteful spending 
lubbers has vowed to curb hollands unsuitability for work act 
under which nearly 900000 people get lifelong disability pensions 
of up to 70 percent of their lastearned pay in the late 1970s 
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees 
passing the social cost on to the government 
about onethird of the programs beneficiaries claim 
psychological reasons for being unable to work in a recent speech 
lubbers said wryly looking at the statistics one has to 
admit that ours is a sick nation 
this spring the dutch government is expected to make deep cuts 
in the housing education and cultural subsidies that complement 
the welfare handouts themselves equal to at least 70 percent of 
the minimum wage it has borrowed heavily and diverted money from 
other programs to cover welfare costs 
only germany is making large welfare increases to pay millions 
of former east germans who are unemployed 
norway is slightly expanding its 1258 billion kroner 21 
billion welfare system on which almost a quarter of the 
population depends in some form or other the labor government has 
added about one billion kroner 166 million to the bill since 
coming into office last month and even the rightleaning opposition 
progress party favors the expansion

when it began welfare in northern 
europe was meant to stop the destitute from becoming a public 
nuisance todays welfare states regard a fair income as a 
universal right 
the 8thcentury emperor charlemagne decreed that his nobility 
should distribute food to poor peasants to keep them from joining 
marauding bands of beggars 
europe always has known institutionalized charity usually under 
religious auspices but elements of the modern welfare state 
appeared only a little over a century ago when cities were clogged 
with working families 
mechanization and poor working conditions created the need for 
health and accident insurance while economic downturns created a 
jobless class less easily absorbed than in farming society 
chancellor otto von bismarck gave germany a compulsory health 
insurance plan in 1883 similar programs followed there in the next 
few years for industrial injury disability and old age 
norways first state insurance law which provided accidental 
injury coverage for all was passed in 1894 followed by laws in 
1906 on medical insurance for the poor and oldage pensions in 
1936 
in the depressionridden 1930s sweden and the netherlands set 
up loosely defined social welfare programs modeled on the new deal 
of president franklin d roosevelt 
the dutch program quickly became so essential that a minor cut 
in benefits sparked three days of street riots in amsterdam in 
which five were killed 
cradletograve welfare programs were advocated by scandinavias 
dominant leftwing political parties after world war ii 
everyone has the right to employment a place to live 
education social security and health and hospital systems the 
result is a society in which there are few truly rich or poor 
says a book on social welfare published by oslos aftenposten 
newspaper 
a late arrival on the welfare scene is finland a largely 
agrarian nation where rural societies carried out their own 
informal welfare functions 
it was not until 1957 that finland passed its first major 
welfare law the national pensions act its comprehensive 
unemployment benefits law was not voted through until 1985

welfare state benefits can be so 
lucrative that even the recent offer of cars for personal use 
wasnt enough to lure dutch unemployed off the dole 
welfare recipients in denmark and the netherlands are frequently 
entitled to subsidies that help pay their rent child care basic 
furnishings and clothes 
coming on top of cash benefits those addons often mean a 
welfare recipient has a bigger income than a skilled industrial 
worker 
authorities in amsterdam recently offered the use of leased cars 
to people willing to take jobs in the flower industry in the 
aalsmeer suburb the plan failed because not enough people were 
interested 
another plan to give jobs to the unemployed in the northern 
village of stadskanaal in the vital flower bulb harvest 60miles 
away also failed the unemployed did not want to work that far away 
from home even though they were going to be given temporary 
housing in the region 
desperate bulb growers eventually returned to their illegal but 
tolerated practice of hiring seasonal workers from poland 
a dutch social affairs ministry study showed recently that a 
couple getting 1611 guilders 964 a month in benefits would lose 
5 percent if either partner were hired in a minimumwage job that 
pays the same mostly because of expenses like commuting that 
employers wont refund 
the prospect of losing welfare subsidies on rent and other 
basics often means that looking for a betterpaid job is barely 
worthwhile 
both the netherlands and denmark provide all parents with 
childrearing payments which take the place of the dependent 
deduction in the us tax system 
questions have been raised whether rich danish families should 
be getting benefits of 5600 kroner 1000 per year for each of 
their children dutch payments are considerably lower 
spurred by high taxation many welfare recipients even those on 
disability pensions resurface in the socalled black economy 
doing offthebooks bluecollar jobs in exchange for cash 
the dutch welfare ministry employs dozens of social 
detectives who have full police powers to investigate such abuses 
which defraud the state of tens of billions of dollars in welfare 
benefits and tax revenue each year 
although the benefits can be many applying for them can involve 
a frustrating monthslong trip through the bureaucracy to find out 
which of the many different welfare programs applies 
rigid qualification rules often hinder a recipients own efforts 
to seek a job dutch unemployment benefit recipients can be barred 
from attending job training programs because thats considered 
abusing dole money as an educational grant

toronto canadas new year is filled with problems the threat 
of separation by frenchspeaking quebec an increasingly volatile 
indian population and a deepening recession 
coping with it will be the most unpopular government since 
opinion polling began in canada half a century ago 
the latest polls say 58 percent of canadians rate prime minister 
brian mulroney who need not call an election for three years as 
the worst prime minister or one of the worst support for 
his progressive conservative party has sunk to 14 percent 
a commission created by the quebec legislature is holding 
hearings and will make recommendations in march on what steps to 
take after the failure of the meech lake constitutional accord in 
june that accord declared quebec a distinct society and 
provided for other constitutional changes sought by the province

the 1990s 
civil wars still sputter in guatemala and el salvador but 
economic issues are edging out insurrection as the major issues for 
1991 in mexico and central america

nicosia cyprus war or peace in the persian gulf oil glut or 
shortage a return to normal in lebanon or new disruption new 
moves toward solving the palestine problem progress or defeat for 
moderates in iran 
all these questions have global significance and there are no 
solid answers 
a war over iraqs seizure of kuwait could change the balance of 
power in the middle east 
if the usled multinational force succeeds in driving iraq 
from the emirate and incapacitating saddam husseins military 
machine the regional winners would be saudi arabia iran syria 
egypt and israel 
saddam wins if he keeps kuwait withdraws only partially or gets 
out completely under circumstances that let him claim the invasion 
led to progress on the palestine question 
if he keeps his millionmember armed forces intact along with 
his program for developing nuclear weapons he will be a continuing 
threat to neighboring oil producers and israel 
peace could bring an oil glut and prices of 10 a barrel or 
less war by interrupting production in saudi arabia and other 
gulf states could push prices to well over 50 a barrel 
in lebanon for the first time in nearly 16 years of civil war 
there is optimism that the battered former business center of the 
middle east is on the way back to normal 
skeptics abound however because armed militias remain active 
outside the capital such outsiders as israel and syria still 
intervene and political quarrels continue 
syrian reconciliation with the united states and britain and 
indications that president hashemi rafsanjani is gaining the upper 
hand in iran inspire hope that the last western hostages in 
lebanon will be released rafsanjani has moderated irans 
revolutionary fervor and improved ties with some western countries 
a desire to end the 3yearold palestinian uprising and better 
relations between the united states and soviet union could help 
move israel toward an international middle east peace conference 
but no one is predicting it

moscow mikhail s gorbachev will be challenged in 1991 as he 
seeks to prevent the further economic and political collapse of the 
soviet union 
gorbachevs international prestige remains high as demonstrated 
by the nobel peace prize awarded him in october and his continuing 
summits with western leaders 
at home however few soviet citizens have reason to celebrate 
the traditional new year holiday store shelves are often bare in 
major cities and many consumer items are scarce throughout the 
country 
although he has helped reduce world tension by concluding arms 
agreements pulling back from eastern europe and withdrawing the 
soviet army from afghanistan gorbachev has balked at the jump from 
a planned to a market economy many western analysts say that is 
essential to boosting production 
six years after gorbachev began relaxing 70 years of strict 
communist party controls ethnic unrest continues conservatives 
have urged tougher measures to curb it 
gorbachev prefers a more moderate course a new union treaty 
that would hold the 15 soviet republics together as a federation 
rather than under central control but some republics refuse to 
take part in the talks and others oppose his plan to keep economic 
control in the central governments hands 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia have 
declared independence and moldavia shows signs of following suit 
armenia is boycotting the talks because the kremlin will not give 
it control of the disputed nagarnokarabakh region 
russia by far the largest republic wants to sell its abundant 
oil natural gas diamond and gold for dollars on the world market 
rather than to the central governmnt for rubles as gorbachev 
proposes some other republics are following russias lead

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
1990 will go down as the most hectic year for a secretary of 
agriculture in the history of the united states 
yeutter noted the months of debate and negotiation as congress 
wrote a new farm bill the wrangling and eventual action on cutting 
the federal budget and of course the multilateral trade 
negotiations 
except for the trade talks that are still to be resolved 1990 
stacked up as a pretty solid chapter in yeutters book 
we would make a few changes if we had an opportunity to do 
so yeutter said last week but considering the complexities of 
whats happening and the rapid changes in the world i feel pretty 
good about the year 
yeutter a harddriving 60yearold gave his yearend appraisal 
during a telephone interview with farm broadcasters and later with 
a group of news reporters here 
despite yeutters enthusiasm for his job and accomplishments 
there are critics who contend the new farm law is a blueprint for 
disaster yeutter disagrees 
in my judgment we emerged with a farm bill package that is 
certainly respectable and probably a lot more farmerfriendly than 
most of our farmers around the country now believe or realize he 
said i think itll turn out to be a bill that will serve 
american agriculture very well over the next five years 
a favorite bone chewed by critics involves the budgetcutting 
plan approved by congress in october which will hold down federal 
spending by about 496 billion over five years 
the agriculture departments share of the cut was 136 billion 
many farm interest groups and some members of congress complained 
that agriculture was hit with too much 
meanwhile congress finished a fiveyear farm bill that includes 
provisions to carry out the spending cuts assigned usda mostly in 
the commodity programs that provide price supports and deficiency 
payments to farmers 
the new farm law will mean smaller subsidies going to farmers in 
the next five years other provisions including special 
assessments on some producers tighten the outlook further 
a lot of folks pay attention to this supposed 13 billion cut 
over five years which is a somewhat misleading number 
yeutter said and they make a simplistic evaluation of the bill 
that is not really an accurate reflection of a lot of its good 
features 
the deepseated concern of yeutters is the uruguay round of 
trade negotiations launched four years ago under the auspices of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
yeutter who was us trade representative in the reagan 
administration is a gungho advocate of liberalizing gatt rules so 
that countries can produce and trade to the fullest of their 
abilities 
the us view on agricultural trade is for fewer protective 
import barriers a reduction in domestic price supports and a 
phaseout of export subsidies 
many countries sided with the united states during what was 
supposed to be the windup of talks in brussels earlier this month 
but the push wasnt enough to convince the european community to 
compromise meaningfully on reducing farm subsidies and the 
brussels meeting collapsed another attempt may be made in 
midjanuary 
yeutter and other advocates of freer trade have painted 
optimistic pictures of longrange prosperity for farmers under 
liberalized gatt rules 
but there is a measure of ambivalence among us farm 
organizations and individuals regarding the uruguay round 
a few condemn the talks outright as a sellout of longstanding 
protection for small farmers others favor parts of the package 
while some go along entirely with the us negotiators 
the national family farm coalition which represents about 40 
farm and rural advocacy groups joined thousands of european 
farmers who protested the gatt talks in brussels on dec 3 
randolph nodland president of the coalition said the us 
government negotiated a deal behind closed doors that trades away 
american agriculture for what they hope will be gains in other 
sectors of the economy 
the european farmers objected proposals that would reduce ec 
subsidies and protection from imported commodities 
harvey joe sanner president of the american agriculture 
movement a member of the coalition said that unelected free 
market zealots like yeutter and carla hills the us trade 
representative have misrepresented the needs of rural america 
both nodland and sanner accused the bush administration of 
trying to use the 1990 farm bill to eliminate federal farm 
programs 
the national farmers union while not a member of the coalition 
is asking the new congress to change the 1990 farm law to prevent a 
decline in farm income when its provisions take effect 
the 1990 farm bill is simply a disaster where rural america is 
concerned said nfu president leland swenson we want a 1991 
version of the bill that revitalizes rural america 
yeutter said the nfus campaign for another farm bill was a 
big mistake and that the next time around congress might provide 
even less money 
the way it looks now yeutter will have a busy year in 1991 
too

in a quest to sweeten profits the nations 
banks are holding off as long as possible before they cut their 
prime lending rate 
the normal rush among banks to follow a move in the prime rate 
didnt develop after first national bank of chicago cut its prime 
05 percentage point to 9 thursday morning 
in healthier times the nations largest banks such as citibank 
and chase manhattan generally would have followed first national 
the nations 13th largest banking company by cutting their prime 
rates as well economists said but banks are holding out as long 
as possible to profit from the difference in their borrowing costs 
and the interest borrowers pay them 
first chicagos move came one day after the federal reserve cut 
the discount rate its loan fee to financial institutions by 05 
percentage point to 6 percent in order to stimulate the economy 
through looser credit it was the first cut in that key rate since 
august 1986 
banks are suffering through the worst earnings crunch in many 
years and in some cases are experiencing higher funding costs 
despite the feds actions said fritz elmendorf spokesman for 
the consumer bankers association in arlington va 
a cut in the prime is watched closely because bankers use it as 
a basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining 
many types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans the prime 
rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money including interest 
it pays on savings accounts or certificates of deposit 
though bankers deny theyre profiting at consumers expense 
economist howard sharpe disagreed 
yes consumers are being gouged but the problem is that if 
the banks dont stay solvent the consumer would get gouged even 
more said sharpe chief economist of sharpes capital market 
associates inc in new york 
federal bank regulators are pressuring banks to improve their 
equity capital ratios which help cushion a bank from failure the 
federal deposit insurance corp predicts 180 banks with total 
assets of 70 billion will fail next year because of declining real 
estate values and a souring economy 
a number of banks are expected to improve capital levels by 
slashing dividends this quarter in the face of rising loan losses 
a delay in a prime rate cut can slightly boost profits and make 
things a little better for the grim quarter 
a decision to delay a prime rate cut has very little to do 
with raising capital said sharpe 
bankers say the cost of their funds still remains high despite 
the feds actions the fed has cut the federal funds rate the rate 
banks charge each other on overnight loans three times this month 
to 7 percent 
the question is why hasnt the funds rate come down because 
people are scared they dont know which bank will be in trouble 
sharpe said 
samuel d kahan chief economist for fuji securities inc said 
the reason why bank costs havent declined is that banks must still 
pay relatively high rates of interest to holders of 3month 
certificats of deposit one of the banking industrys major 
sources of funds 
although there is an appearance that rates have gone down 
they have not come down for banks he said the prime rate is 
set to move in line with the cost of bank funds 
earlier this month a handful of smaller banks cut their prime 
rates to 9 percent in response to more subtle fed policies to 
encourage lending 
the national bank of canada and canadian imperial bank both cut 
their prime rates 05 percentage point to 12 percent on thursday 
which banking analysts called an indirect result of american 
lending policies

with christmas sales still lagging going into 
the final weekend of the season some retailers are intensifying 
efforts to hook lastminute shoppers by increasing markdowns and 
putting more merchandise on sale 
but analysts said even an eleventhhour consumer spending spree 
which most retailers are hoping for wont be enough to turn the 
season around 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said 
thursday it was expanding markdowns to include more merchandise 
lines and stepping up advertising in hopes of attracting more 
buyers 
we are adjusting to the conditions said matthew howard 
sears senior vice president for marketing who described his 
companys christmas sales as slightly below expectations 
sears which two weeks ago moved up price reductions on winter 
apparel lines added new markdowns on merchandise including 
exercise equipment home lighting and electric blankets howard 
said in a phone interview 
the retailer was also moving up its annual furniture clearance 
sale which traditionally does not begin till after christmas he 
said it decided to extend a nointerest financing incentive for 
major appliance buyers through jan 1 
we felt all along that this weekend would be the one thats 
most critical howard said 
sales have been at best sluggish for many stores burdened by 
worries about their jobs the economy and the middle east crisis 
consumers have been spending cautiously and warmer weather has 
stalled sales of heavy clothing and other winter merchandise 
retailers and analysts reported consumers were generally 
shunning expensive gifts for cheaper and more practical items 
walter loeb a retail analyst and consultant said he has found 
retailers are selling more smaller items such as accessories and 
cosmetics this year 
across the country retailers have had sale signs up for 
weeks in an attempt to lure shoppers like sears theyve increased 
discounts as the days have gone by and in the last days of the 
season some of the price cuts will be heavier 
starting last weekend stores did push the panic button and 
theyre pushing harder to get sales said jeffrey edelman a 
retail industry analyst with barclays de zoete wedd inc 
its not working all that well thats the scary part of 
it he said 
however howard said sears earlier markdowns did produce 
significant favorable results 
at jc penney co inc customers this weekend will see 
markdowns of 50 percent on some items spokesman duncan muir said 
penneys sales through last weekend ran about even with last 
year a disappointing performance muir said 
with what we bought for christmas we cant be happy muir 
said referring to the merchandise penney hasnt been able to move 
on the other hand we realize were in a recessionary environment 
and its a difficult period 
one bright spot for penney was a pickup in catalog sales aided 
by special promotions such as 15 off on a purchase of 75 
weve got our fingers crossed going into the last weekend 
muir said 
but loeb said that while a lastminute rush is now developing 
i still dont see the enthusiasm the momentum that would make up 
for a lot of this lost time 
loeb predicted that when christmas is over the retail 
industrys overall sales will be down 3 percent from last year 
after inflation is subtracted the decline will be even sharper 
some retailers who were satisfied with their sales earlier in 
the season seem to have lost some optimism 
its certainly difficult and were looking forward to the 
weekend said ann barkelew a spokeswoman for dayton hudson 
corp the concern always is will we have enough people 
in the first few weeks of the season dayton hudson had said it 
was pleased with its results 
through last week dayton hudsons overall sales were about the 
same as a year earlier ms barkelew said strong business at the 
companys target discount stores and mervyns apparel chain was 
offset by poor sales at its daytons hudsons and marshall fields 
department stores 
kmart corps vice president for marketing michael wellman said 
of this christmas its a season that could be better 
however he said its not over yet im not pessimistic by 
any stretch of the imagination 
kmart has increased advertising during the last week before 
christmas but that was all planned in advance wellman said

don r dixon bought a savings and loan in his 
small texas hometown built it into a profitmaking machine and saw 
it collapse from gluttony 
as the owner of vernon savings association dixon collected fine 
art and antique cars hosted parties on the potomac for 
washingtons elite jethopped to europes fivestar restaurants 
and even met the pope 
dixon may pay dearly for those heady days of the early and 
mid80s 
on thursday he became the latest and most important vernon 
executive to be convicted of defrauding its customers and 
contributing to its 13 billion 1987 failure one of the first 
costly collapses in the savings and loan crisis 
dixon said during his sevenweek trial that vernon cost him 
everything i lost a lot of money i lost my credibility i lost 
my career 
he may now lose his freedom 
dixon faces 115 years in jail and a fine of up to 575 million 
according to marvin collins us attorney for the northern 
district of texas he will be sentenced by us district judge a 
joe fish on feb 19 
us magistrate john b tolle thursday ordered dixon held 
without bond until his sentencing after proseuctors argued dixon 
had money overseas and might flee 
dixon is not a household name like charles keating or neil 
bush but he is a one of the most celebrated and writtenabout 
figures in the thrift crisis 
don dixon was the highest of the high fliers among the savings 
and loan crooks attorney general dick thornburgh said in 
washington after the conviction 
dixon and six other former vernon officers also face a 540 
million civil lawsuit brought by federal regulators 
dixon 52 grew up in vernon a town of 11000 near the oklahoma 
border about 130 miles northwest of dallas he got his start in 
texas business developing condominiums 
during the trial he said he bought vernon savings in 1981 
because he was eager to become involved in all aspects of the real 
estate industry from financing to marketing 
congress and state legislatures were moving then to weaken the 
restrictions that had kept thrifts primarily providers of home 
mortgages dixon thought deregulation would save the industry and 
help him make money 
a month after buying vernon savings from rb tanner who had 
founded it 21 years earlier dixon asked the thrifts board to 
approve the 125000 purchase of a small western sculpture his 
buying spree was on 
dixon soon moved vernons main office to dallas and then had the 
thrift buy a fleet of jets a yacht that he moved from tampa to 
washington dc a colorado ski chalet beach houses and a 
rollsroyce and ferrari dealership in california 
the houses were needed as vernon moved into the lucrative real 
estate market dixon testified during the trial it was important 
for us that the savings and loan appeared to be part of that 
communitydixon said 
he became so wellknown in southern california that the roman 
catholic bishop in san diego introduced dixon to the pope during a 
trip to rome that regulators learned was paid for by vernon 
dixon built vernon on deposits handled by brokers for 
institutional investors seeking high interest rates he increased 
the thrifts asset base more than 10fold including hundreds of 
condominium units his real estate company was building 
the thrift even put dixons picture on a promotional 3 bill 
that also carried the slogan in don we trust 
but vernons flimsy loan base became apparent when real estate 
values fell with the price of oil in the mid80s vernon was the 
largest thrift failure in history at the time it was seized in 
march 1987 
dixon was the 11th person and eighth vernon officer convicted of 
criminal wrongdoing that contributed to the thrifts failure 
woody lemons who was vernons chief executive officer was 
sentenced in april to 30 years in prison the stiffest penalty yet 
handed any figure in the savings and loan crisis

mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics 
corp are sending notices to about 8000 workers who could lose 
their jobs if the defense department scraps the a12 avenger bomber 
program 
the defense contractors both based here are the prime 
contractors on the 48 billion a12 program which has been 
threatened because of cost overruns and schedule problems 
a decision could come as early as jan 2 
both companies like other defense contractors have been hurt 
by the broad slowdown in weapons orders since warmer relations 
between the eastern and western blocs 
mcdonnell douglas said thursday it would notify about 4000 
employees at mcdonnell aircraft that they could be laid off as soon 
as jan 2 officials said the layoffs would not be limited to 
people working on the a12 program 
later thursday general dynamics said it also would notify about 
4000 workers at its fort worth division that they could be laid 
off as early as jan 2 
general dynamics president herbert f rogers said the company 
was hopeful the navy and the department of defense would continue 
the program 
the possibility exists however that the government will 
terminate the program rogers said as a result we are 
forewarning affected employees that layoffs could occur suddenly 
and without as much notice as we have given during our planned 
downsizing operations 
mcdonnell aircraft spokesman jim reed said that officials on the 
a12 team would continue to hold discussions with the navy and the 
defense department to resolve difficulties and assure 
continuation of this vital national defense program on a mutually 
satisfactory basis 
both companies emphasized to employees that the layoffs would 
occur only if the program were terminated or changed significantly 
last week defense secretary dick cheney ordered the navy to 
justify the project or kill it because of what he called 
intolerable problems 
defense department audits on the program allege that hundreds of 
millions of dollars in excess payments have been made to the two 
companies 
earlier this week the st louis postdispatch and the los 
angeles times reported that a separate pentagon audit concluded 
that the a12 contractors have a possible chance of bankruptcy 
officials of general dynamics and mcdonnell douglas disagreed with 
the audits findings 
both companies have said they were cooperating with reviews of 
the a12 and that they believed they had solved the major technical 
problems that had come up 
the a12 was envisioned as a deepstrike bomber with 
radarevading capabilities it was meant to be the navys main 
carrierbased attack plane for the early 21st century 
just eight months ago cheney assured congress the a12 project 
was on schedule and within its thenclassified budget a pentagon 
inspector generals report released earlier this month said cheney 
had not been aware of the projects serious problems because senior 
aides had failed to communicate the schedule delays to him 
the project is at least 1 billion over cost and at least 18 
months behind schedule among the chief technical problems is 
excess plane weight due to the thickness of the construction 
material needed to make the plane strong enough for carrier 
landings said a navy report released earlier this month

the boeing co said a 18 billion order from 
delta air lines helped it set a company record of 477 billion 
worth of airplane orders this year 
boeings 1990 tally tops by 11 billion its previous high mark 
of 466 billion set last year even though the number of planes 
ordered fell from 1989 
boeing said thursday that 543 planes were ordered this year 
down from 883 last year the biggest drop came in orders for the 
shorthaul 737series 162 planes this year from 463 last year 
but the overall dollar amount of the orders increased because of 
a sharp rise in orders for boeings most expensive jet the 747400 
jumbo 
this year airlines ordered 172 of the 747400s which cost 
between 125 million and 147 million each boeing received orders 
for 68 of its 747400s in 1989 
deltas order announced thursday includes six new 767300 
twinjets which sell for between 78 million and 86 million each 
boeing also disclosed that delta placed orders earlier this year 
for three more extendedrange 767300s an additional standard 
767300 nine 757200s and seven 737300s 
boeing spokesman t craig martin said the previous orders 
included options delta converted to firm purchases this year and 
several jets added to earlier orders during the final contract 
negotiations for those orders

chevron corp said it will charge 220 
million against fourthquarter earnings because of its previously 
announced plan to sell its fertilizer operations 
analysts said they were not surprised at the size of the 
aftertax charge or the timing of thursdays announcement because 
oil companies traditionally take writeoffs in the fourth quarter 
analysts also said they expected chevrons fourthquarter 
profits to rise pushed higher by the recent jump in natural gas 
and crude oil prices 
chevron announced last month that it would sell its fertilizer 
operations which each year produces 1 million tons of nitrogen 
fertilizer and 450000 tons of phosphate fertilizer the company 
was not hopeful for the future of the business because of the 
depressed farm economy 
the 287 millionayear business accounts for less than 1 
percent of chevrons 319 billion in revenues it employes 600 
people at plants in richmond calif wyoming washington and 
oregon

a series of economic reports by the 
agriculture department in recent weeks points to 1991 as a pretty 
good year for farmers although most admit there are uncertainties 
perhaps more than usual 
one will be the reaction of farmers when they sign up for 1991 
crop programs under the new farm law which gives them more 
flexibility to plant what they choose 
a price for this freedom of course is a cutback in the acreage 
that will be eligible for deficiency payments the federal 
subsidies designed to help support farmers incomes when market 
prices decline 
even so department economists forecast that 1991 net cash 
income will be in the range of 55 billion to 60 billion that 
would compare with a record of 59 billion estimated for 1990 
net cash income is the difference between gross cash income in a 
calendar year and cash expenses 
although 1990 shapes up as a banner year for farm income 
generally that doesnt mean all farmers everywhere have had it 
good and usda hasnt closed the books on gathering all the 
statistics on this year 
mitch morehart of the departments economic research service 
says in the december issue of farmline magazine that the seventh 
annual farm costs and returns survey will begin in midfebruary 
the survey will be conducted over six weeks among 24000 farmers 
and ranchers in the 48 contiguous states information will be 
gathered on their operations in 1990 
morehart said that of the six surveys so far the one earlier 
this year for 1989 was financially the best for us producers 
the annual survey tells us how much it costs to produce 
various commodities in different areas and helps us maintain a good 
understanding of the financial strengths and weaknesses of us 
agriculture morehart said 
for example here are a few of the highlights from the last 
survey 
in 1989 net farm income was positive for 69 percent of the 
farms compared with 64 percent in 1988 generally that means the 
farms operated at a profit 
farm assets averaged 404209 per farm in 1989 up from 
359575 in 1988 average net worth per farm was 356191 compared 
with 311343 in 1988 
farm operator debt was basically unchanged averaging 48018 
per farm in 1989 
the number of farms with high debt continued to decline to 11 
percent with debtasset ratios above 04 at the end of 1989 that 
means debts amounted to more than 04 or 40 percent of total 
assets also 48 percent of the farms had no debt at all 
morehart said the highest proportions of financially vulnerable 
farms in 1989 were the northern plains mountain and pacific 
regions 
the largest increases in the percentages of profitable farms 
occurred in the great lakes states corn belt northeast and 
appalachia regions dairy and tobacco operations led all production 
specialties with 85 percent reporting positive returns 
 
washington ap an agriculture department trade report says 
food exporters may want to plan ahead for selling products to the 
over60 crowd in a number of countries 
by the year 2000 one in five people in the developed countries 
will be over 60 according to united nations statistics by 2025 
one in four will be over 60 
the report included in the january issue of agexporter 
magazine cited a number of observations based upon reports by us 
agricultural attaches and trade officers 
in france older consumers will be demanding more healthful 
foods including lowfat lowcholesterol and sugarfree products 
enriched with vitamins and proteins 
special dietary food products will continue to be popular but 
the senior generation doesnt want products advertised as 
geriatric 
in germany where 25 percent of the population will be over 60 
by the turn of the century older consumers have purchasing power 
three times higher than that of the average 20yearold 
indications point to a growing market for higher quality food 
products particularly those with a high degree of convenience such 
as frozen foods and readytocook meals 
in spain consumers are fairly conservative in their eating 
habits and most favor fresh foods so prepared frozen or canned 
items are not good bets in the spanish consumer market 
fresh fruits and vegetables are popular and prospects appear 
excellent for sales of natural fruit juices to spains older 
generation 
in britain older consumers can be targeted for fresh fish 
meat fresh vegetables breakfast cereals brown bread lowfat 
butter sunflower oil margarine cheese fruit juices and 
stirfried foods 
microwaveable products also have a sales potential in britain 
in japan about 12 percent of the population was over age 65 in 
1989 by the turn of the century about 16 percent will be but 
products specifically tailored to the older population are not yet 
found in japanese retail markets 
one reason older foreign consumers offer less opportunity at 
present for us foods is that they are traditional eaters 
 
washington ap the soviet union has bought more corn from the 
united states boosting purchases this week to nearly 1 million 
metric tons according to the agriculture department 
officials said private exporting companies sold an additional 
300000 tons to the soviets under terms of the current longterm 
supply agreement between the two countries 
a sale of 266500 tons of corn was announced tuesday the first 
large us grain order in two months another sale of 385000 tons 
was announced wednesday 
a metric ton of 2205 pounds is equivalent to 394 bushels of 
corn the 300000 tons would be about 118 million bushels

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in quiet trading this morning on the chicago board of trade 
after two days of losses linked to the slow pace of export sales of 
us grain 
the markets drew support from news that the agriculture 
department offered to subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of 
wheat to egypt and from thursdays confirmation that the soviet 
union bought 300000 metric tons of us corn said john frazier 
director of agricultural commodities trading for gerald inc in 
chicago 
he said prices also were helped by perceptions that livestock 
producers in the western states will need to feed more grain to 
their cattle to sustain them through the current cold spell 
trading activity was extremely light as some traders got an 
early start on the christmas weekend he said the grain markets 
will be open monday until noon and will be closed on christmas day 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to 1 cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in marh at 261 a bushel 
corn was cent to cent lower with march at 234 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to cent lower with march at 112 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent lower to cent higher with january at 570 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were modestly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent to 28 cent higher with february at

citing declines in advertising the boston globe 
said today it will reduce its work force by 100 fulltime positions 
through attrition over the next five years 
the 100 positions represent about 5 percent of the fulltime 
staff at the globe which employs 2075 fulltime and 500 parttime 
workers spokesman richard gulla says the reduction will be company 
wide with no particular department targeted 
we are experiencing the same economic forces affecting other 
companies said william o taylor publisher of the globe and 
chairman of the newspapers parent company affiliated publications 
inc 
advertising is down significantly this year and the outlook 
is cautious at best he said we think this is the least 
painful way to address the need to be as costeffective as we can 
for the future 
the attrition program is another step in an overall costcutting 
effort at the globe which began implementing budget cuts in the 
spring of 1988 it has also included reductions in department 
expenditures and in hours of some parttime staff 
last week taylor said he expected earnings to be down 
significantly at affiliated publications and that the company 
planned to raise the price of the globe from 35 cents to 50 cents 
in april in areas 30 miles outside the city

the advertising and marketing giant wpp group plc 
said friday it wont pay its shareholders a midyear dividend 
because of weak cash flow 
the owner of the usbased j walter thompson and ogilvy amp 
mather worldwide advertising agencies said its priority was to 
conserve cash 
wpp has grown into the largest ad and marketing group in the 
world through acquisitions over the past five years but has seen 
growth in its businesses slowed by the economic weakness in the 
united states and great britain 
we consider that it would not be in the best interests of the 
company to pay the interim dividend for 1990 and therefore this 
dividend will not be paid wpp said in a letter to shareholders 
the interim dividend was to have been for the six months ended 
june 30 and was to have been paid on jan 2 the company said in 
august it was going to pay a halfyear dividend of 137 pence or 
26 cents a share last year the interim dividend was 113 pence 
or 215 cents a share 
wpps decision to omit the dividend surprised analysts 
this underlines how difficult a position the company is 
in said an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd ltd who declined 
to be identified if it has to conserve cash to this extent its 
obviously pretty serious 
wpp also said it could be some time before the group can 
resume the pattern of growth in profits and earnings experienced up 
until a few months ago 
wpp reported a 77 percent rise in pretax profit to 46 million 
pounds or 87 million for the first six months of the year from 
26 million pounds in the same period a year earlier 
however the group warned in november that its fullyear pretax 
profit wouldnt match stockbrokers estimates of about 110 million 
pounds or 209 million 
the news prompted a 70 percent drop in the value of its stock 
over two days and fridays announcement ignited another decline 
the stock which had been trading at 392 pence before the 
november announcement was down another 14 pence on friday at 47 
pence on londons stock exchange 
some analysts say wpp may have trouble meeting its debts which 
they said totaled 320 million pounds or about 600 million 
barclays de zoete wedd is forecasting wpp will have a 1990 
pretax profit of 85 million pounds or 162 million wpps pretax 
profit came to 75 million pounds in 1989 
its 1989 profit after taxes was 405 million pounds or 77 
million on revenue of 44 billion pounds or 84 billion

the european community friday voted to 
continue compensating the united states for reduced corn exports 
into spain and portugal avoiding a costly transatlantic trade war 
washington had been gearing up to increase duties on several ec 
food and drink products if the ec had decided to end compensations 
for losses in corn and sorghum exports to spain and portugal 
the united states will now refrain from such measures and resume 
negotiations with the community to settle the issue for good by the 
end of next year officials said 
the temporary settlement ended one of three farm disputes that 
have been marring trade relations between the united states and the 
12member ec the move was also expected to facilitate attempts to 
restart the world trade talks that collapsed earlier this month 
the talks supervised by the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade fell apart over farm subsidies that the united states wants 
to eliminate but the ec hopes to maintain 
the talks are scheduled to resume in geneva next month 
the corn dispute arose after spain and portugal joined the trade 
bloc in 1986 and import duties were increased on us corn and 
sorghum feedgrains 
one year later the ec trade bloc agreed to compensate the 
united states for losing an estimated 400 million in annual trade 
two million tons of corn and 300000 tons of sorghum now are 
allowed into spain and portugal under reduced levies 
the ec wanted to end the compensations this year but granted a 
oneyear extension friday after the the united states threatened to 
retaliate with about 400 million in extra duties on ec products 
the ec and the united states are still at odds over two other 
issues one is the banning of us pork imports for what the ec 
considers to be unsanitary slaughterhouse conditions in the united 
states 
the other is a us ban on ec sparkling wines that contain a 
japanese additive which washington thinks could be unhealthy

more than 100000 current magazines bound for 
us troops in saudi arabia were hung up in a minnesota printing 
plant today because of a mixup over cigarette advertising on their 
covers but a spokesman at the pentagon said they would be on their 
way in a week 
the magazines were scheduled for shipment overseas by operation 
desert news an organization formed in charleston sc to provide 
us military personnel in the persian gulf with reading matter 
officials of the defense logistics agency which oversees such 
shipments discovered thursday that the magazines were being bound 
in special outside covers containing a camel cigarette 
advertisement but not containing a military disclaimer about 
tobacco products 
the rj reynolds tobacco co is the only corporate sponsor of 
operation desert news 
were going to print the declaration on the front and take the 
camel off the back said lt col hery wyatt spokesman for 
defense logistics he said officials of the st cloud minn firm 
that is doing the printing told the agency the task could be done 
in a week 
wyatt said the covers bear the name of the rj reynolds co on 
the front and the camel ad on the back 
he said lawyers at the pentagon and at the us central command 
at macdill air force base fla which screens the content of 
magazines bound for the gulf worked out the new arrangement 
normally when its a cigarette company the defense department 
requires a disclaimer be put on it that they are not sanctioning 
the troops smoking said major maureen deciantis a public 
affairs officer for central command in this case it was not 
done because desert news didnt know they had to do it and we 
didnt know they had a tobacco company as a backer 
both wyatt and staff sgt jefferson sammons of the central 
command public affairs office said that as first submitted to 
central command the covers did not bear the advertising matter 
tim karnes a charleston publisher who organized operation 
desert news said the organization submitted a rough draft of the 
first page of the cover which might not have contained the rj 
reynolds identification and did not submit the back page 
he said the organization did not realize any disclaimer would be 
needed but everybody involved knew that rj reynolds was the 
sponsor 
its magazines that were sending karnes said were not 
sending cigarettes 
he said the organization is seeking other corporate sponsors 
karnes publisher of auction guide magazine spoke by telephone 
from acapulco mexico where he is attending a family gathering 
over the christmas holiday 
the communication just kind of got snafued deciantis said 
dean foster a spokesman for operation desert news in 
charleston said the defense department and operation desert 
news are working toward the same goal and that is to get the 
magazines to the troops as expediently as possible 
the magazines are sent aboard ships the ocean passage takes 
about three weeks

if lower interest rates from the federal reserve 
are going to rescue the economy the central bank needs help from 
consumers banks and businesses 
the banks seem to be starting to go along 
first national bank of chicago the nations 13thlargest us 
banking company was the first major lender to follow the feds 
lead lowering its prime rate from 10 percent to 95 percent 
smaller banks also moved to ease their prime rates as well 
interest rates on many business and consumer loans like home 
equity lines of credit are tied to the prime 
lower borrowing costs for consumers combined with optimism that 
the recession might be short lived could prompt many to buy a new 
car dishwasher or even a new house 
slouching consumer confidence has been one of the darkest clouds 
hanging over this recession 
in november the conference board a businesssupported research 
group reported its consumer confidence index fell near levels last 
seen in the depths of the 1982 recession 
the conference boards survey found more people expecting higher 
unemployment and weaker business conditions in the coming months 
and were scaling back plans for major purchases 
businesses have also started to change their plans based on 
economic pessimism the commerce department reported last week that 
businesses planned to increase spending to modernize by a scant 04 
percent in 1991 
this year modernization spending increased 41 percent 
there are a lot of different ways you send a message 
lowering the fed funds rate is a very technical message the 
discount rate is still another way of communicating and the fed was 
trying to do something dramatic but the prime rate is very visible 
to a lot of people said maury harris chief economist at 
painewebber inc 
fluctuations in the discount rate interest the fed charges to 
lend money to banks have little direct affect on the economy and 
the move to lower the rate from 7 percent to 65 percent was seen 
widely as symbolic 
in an economy driven by perceptions symbols are important 
the feds message was clear and sent loudly announced in the 
afternoonon on an otherwise slow news day many editors at 
newspapers and broadcasting stations treated the move as the days 
top story rather than a purely business news development 
recent moves by the fed to lower the federal funds rate 
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to 7 percent 
have been largely left to the business pages 
the fed wanted to tell consumers they are going to do 
something the message to banks was think about lowering 
interest rates said brian j fabbri chief economist at midland 
montagu a division of midland bank 
the message to everyone was that the fed has made the recession 
its top priority rather than the antiinflation tight money 
policy 
this summers tightmoney policy which was intended to bring 
the economy into a soft landing to squeeze out inflation was 
blown off course when saddam hussein invaded kuwait aug 2 
the invasion and higher oil prices which took money out of 
consumers pockets on top of the tight money policy pushed the 
economy into recession fabbri said 
although lower interest rates may help pull the economy around 
they may not hold the quick answer fabbri said 
it will take six to 12 months for increased borrowing and 
increased bank profitability to lead the way to recovery he said

automakers will get longer christmas and new years breaks because 
of anemic car and truck sales 
the workers at 17 general motors corp and chrysler corp 
assembly plants will still be getting nearly all of their normal 
pay through the supplemental unemployment benefit program but the 
temporary layoffs have still caused worry about the economy and the 
auto industry in particular 
its scary said elaine swiderski financial secretary for 
united auto workers local 435 at general motors corps assembly 
plant in wilmington del sometimes your sub checks are 
delayed 
officials for each of the big three have predicted a sharply 
lower rates of sales for cars and trucks in 1991 even if war does 
not break out in the middle east 
sales could plunge if shooting erupts 
general motors corp said it would shut down 14 assembly plants 
the week of jan 2 while chrysler will idle three the shutdowns 
will affect 41650 workers 
gm plants down until jan 14 are lansing reatta detroit flint 
pontiac east lansing b and most of the hamtramck factory all in

gm said wilmington will resume production jan 7 
chrysler will keep its st louis mo car and toledo ohio 
jeep plants down until jan 21 the companys sterling heights 
mich car assembly plant will be down until jan 28 
ford motor co said friday all of its plants will operate the 
shortened work week beginning jan 2 all three automakers plants 
shut down next week for the traditional holiday vacation 
ford has not announced which plants would operate the week of 
jan 7 
swiderski said a temporary layoff isnt bad if employees know 
they will be returning to work soon but if the layoff is extended 
or the number of temporary layoffs begins to mount perceptions may 
be different 
how is it going to be in the future she wondered the way 
the economy looks to me its scary people arent spending money 
like they used to people dont know what the heck is going to 
happen 
the supplemental payments workers will receive are included in 
united auto workers union contracts with the big three the program 
is aimed at providing employees 95 percent of their regular pay 
when they are laid off from plants because of slow sales

general dynamics corp on friday announced a 
major reorganization of its fort worth division including the 
reassignment of the director of the troubled a12 avenger bomber 
program 
the st louisbased defense contractor said the reorganization 
would emphasize five business groups considered vital to the 
divisions future including the a12 program which the pentagon 
has threatened to scrap because of cost overruns and schedule 
problems 
the company said charles anderson the a12 program director 
was reassigned as division vice president of a new unit called 
special programs and other business 
his replacement is ted webb the former head of the f16 fighter 
jet program who retired last year 
company spokesman mike hatfield said andersons transfer was 
part of an overall restructuring of the a12 program he said the 
reorganization had been in the works for several months and was not 
tied exclusively to the program 
general dynamics and mcdonnell douglas corp are the prime 
contractors on the troubled 48 billion bomber program 
on thursday the companies announced they were sending notices 
to 8000 workers warning they could be laid off if the navy 
scrapped the program a decision is expected as early as jan 2 
last week defense secretary dick cheney ordered the navy to 
justify the project or kill it because of what he called 
intolerable problems defense department audits allege that 
hundreds of millions of dollars in excess payments have been made 
to the two companies 
earlier this week the st louis postdispatch and los angeles 
times reported that a separate pentagon audit concluded that the 
a12 contractors have a possible chance of bankruptcy 
officials of general dynamics and mcdonnell douglas disagreed with 
the audits findings 
both companies have said they were cooperating with reviews of 
the a12 and believed they had solved the major technical problems 
that had surfaced 
under the reorganization announced friday a number of related 
electronic products were combined in a military electronics 
business group special projects and other separate business 
elements were combined in the special programs and other business 
unit 
each group will be headed by a division vice president who will 
have expanded authority and responsibility and will report directly 
to company president herbert f rogers who is also general manager 
of the fort worth division 
the changes are effective immediately and will be followed by 
other realignments within the division to focus resources on the 
five key business areas the company said 
those areas include the f16 fighter jet and the advanced 
tactical fighter program 
general dynamics is the nations secondlargest defense 
contractor behind mcdonnell douglas it has nine divisions and six 
major subsidiaries all involved in defense work except cessna 
aircraft which makes general aviation aircraft

some satellite dish owners in central and south 
america no longer will get cable news network for free 
turner broadcasting system inc cnns owner said thursday it 
plans to begin scrambling its cnn feed south of the border 
the company said it will make the switch next month when it 
begins beaming the turner network television movie channel to the 
region on a scrambled signal tbs said the dish owners were 
receiving the service illegally for two years 
tbs feeds its 24hour news channel into about 35000 hotel rooms 
and 250000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35 
broadcast clients tv stations and networks 
south american satellite dish owners who want to continue 
receiving cnn would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an 
equipment company at a cost of about 1300 and then enter a 
contract with cnn to unscramble the feed 
although cnn does not now contract with individuals spokeswoman 
kitsy riggall said the company would certainly work with anybody 
who wants to receive it 
tbs which has been scrambling its signal in the united states 
for five years said it was concerned about weak copyright laws 
in the region 
the company said it has no plans to scramble cnns signal to the 
rest of the world

the soviet unions most recent political turmoil 
has become another wild card faced by western oil companies 
examining possible deals for exploring drilling and exporting 
crude from its vast reserves 
im sure it delays everything said john lichtblau 
president of the petroleum industry research foundation one of 
the problems they have with making deals over there is that they 
didnt know how reliable their partner was who their partner 
was 
texaco inc one of several major petroleum explorers interested 
in the soviet union is puzzling to figure out who to negotiate 
with among the many layers of soviet bureaucracy spokesman david 
dickson said 
is it the soviet government dickson said is it the 
russian republic is it the local authorities 
apparently none of the majors have gone beyond signing 
agreements that commit them to exploring possibilities of joint 
ventures experts said 
our discussions are still too preliminary to make any 
judgments about possible outcomes exxon corp said in a 
statement other oil companies interested in soviet ventures 
include chevron corp amoco corp british petroleum and arco 
experts say chevron might be the most advanced in getting a deal 
with the soviets but like the others chevron will say little 
about the status of its plans 
we are in the final stages of negotiations on a joint 
venture spokesman larry shushan said friday were not really 
in a position to speculate as to timing 
chevrons deal would be in the large tengiz oilfield in the 
northeast caspian sea region which the soviets have estimated 
could contain 25 billion barrels of oil that would be enough to 
supply all the american oil needs for decades 
the uncertainties facing the oil giants were heightened this 
week when soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze quit 
shocking president mikhail s gorbachev and stirring concerns that 
a dictatorship could emerge or that more troubles could develop 
it could be a detriment exxon spokesman lance lamberton 
said i cant quantify it 
the soviet union is the worlds largest oil producer but its 
industry has fallen on hard times after peaking out at 125 million 
barrels of crude oil a day in 1988 
its now down to 113 lichtblau said the general 
assumption is that it will continue to decline to under 10 million 
barrels a day in couple of years thats a huge decline if nothing 
is done it could go down to nine perhaps 
the problem is technology the soviets have extracted much of 
the oil that was relatively easy to obtain and they are unable to 
get to some additional reserves which will bring in needed hard 
currency without help from the west 
big oil companies looking toward the soviet union can envision 
the potential for vast production possibly even enough to cut back 
on the market clout wielded by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
the uncertainties of dealing with the soviets are obvious but 
the recent persian gulf crisis shows that the west already depends 
on an uncertain energy supply several potentially unstable sources 
of energy are logically better than only one strategists say 
theyre not likely to be unavailable at the same time since 
their politics are totally different lichtblau said 
its unclear how much new oil could be found in the soviet 
union although some experts say higher production could easily 
equal that of a moderatesized opec member 
for now efforts by us companies involve enhanced production 
of crude that has already been discovered rather than 
wildcatting or looking for new oil fields 
in one such venture a private company synergy trading corp 
of greenwich conn hopes to set up a deal worth at least 250 
million for enhancing onshore wells in the soviet republic of 
azerbaijan and a deal worth more than 1 billion for developing 
new offshore wells there 
william f wilson who handles equity crude deals for synergy 
estimated the onshore project could produce 15 to 20 million 
barrels of oil a year 
offshore could be double that wilson said friday 
it remains uncertain how much of the oil synergy and its 
partners could obtain the soviets will not let western companies 
get involved in existing production but they have expressed a 
willingness to let oil companies claim a portion of new oil they 
can produce 
synergys executives who have years of experience in making 
grain and oil deals with the soviets said they can get approval 
for the onshore project from azerbaijan authorities while the 
offshore deal needs to be cleared by soviet authorities in moscow 
synergy said political troubles in the soviet union and its 
republics can slow things but the executives dont believe it will 
stop any deals 
youve just got a longer fuse in these projects wilson 
said

us and british government officials suspended 
negotiations friday on their dispute over granting united airlines 
and american airlines access to londons heathrow airport 
the two sides which held talks on thursday and friday 
discovered a gap in their positions and said they had not set a 
date for resuming talks 
no progress was being made in the negotiations said cyril 
murphy a united airlines executive 
the united states has indicated it is prepared to pay the 
british a reasonable price for allowing a timely succession at 
heathrow said murphy 
the british have come back and put on the table a long list of 
demands and essentially said we want everything on our list the 
us has gone back and said the price is too high why dont we 
negotiate and thats where progress stops 
the british offered to meet again in january said a spokesman 
for the british department of transport who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
american said sunday it would buy twas london and other 
overseas routes for 445 million united agreed in october to buy 
most of pan ams london routes for 400 million 
the airlines are trying to secure access to heathrow which is 
britains most attractive airport because it is closer to central 
london is served by the subway system and offers more air 
connections 
but british law has barred new entrants from the congested 
airport since 1977 and diverted them to londons gatwick and other 
british airports 
united and american are hoping to get in through an air services 
agreement between the united states and britain allowing successors 
to existing us airlines to assume their heathrow rights 
both airlines have said the deals will not proceed if they dont 
win access to heathrow 
an american government source knowledgable about this weeks 
negotiations said officials identified that there was a gap 
between our perceptions in the best way to go forward on the 
issue 
were still working on resolving the issue we have not come 
to an agreement as of yet said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the spokesman for the british department of transport said the 
sides had a useful exploratory meeting at which they identified 
and explored their differences 
a source at one of the us airlines said the british officials 
want to restrict the right of us airlines to fly from london 
onward to continental cities britain also wants to give another 
british carrier access to heathrow 
the government also wants any new usbritish routes into 
heathrow to be granted to british carriers and wants more access 
to the us domestic market he said 
the british goverment is not expected to make a decision until 
at least midjanuary after the civil aviation authority has 
completed a report on the allocation of landing slots at heathrow

despite falling short of circulation goals the 
sports newspaper the national said friday it will boost the daily 
cover price by a quarter to 75 cents effective jan 21 
in addition the newspaper said it would test a 1 daily price 
for one or two of its 10 metropolitan editions specific editions 
have not yet been selected for the test said spokesman stephen 
hammond 
the move comes as the 11monthold newspaper has yet to prove 
there are enough readers to sustain the first allsports daily in 
the united states 
it also comes as the weakest advertising market in 15 years has 
driven newspapers to find alternate methods of generating more 
revenue 
in boosting prices the national said it was following the lead 
of national newspapers such as the wall street journal and the new 
york times which have recently either boosted or plan to raise 
prices 
the journal boosted its price per copy to 75 cents from 50 cents 
on dec 3 while the times plans to boost the price of its national 
edition to 75 cents from 50 cents in the midwes and from 60 cents 
in the southwest in january 
everybody is going to be more aggressive in circulation 
pricing next year said peter appert media analyst at cj 
lawrence morgan grenfell 
but boosting the cover price may be particularly risky for the 
national which is counting heavily on circulation revenue 
only two weeks ago the newspaper told advertisers that it was 
reducing its circulation guarantee by 27 percent to 200000 copies 
the admission that it was not making its guaranteed average of 
275000 followed a review that resulted in the elimination of its 
sunday edition the dismissal of the circulation manager and two 
other top executives and layoffs of 18 other employees 
the paper is now publishing five times a week monday through 
friday 
whether the cover price increase drives away readers remains 
unclear 
the nationals hammond said the newspaper feels it has a loyal 
and dedicated audience that will pay the higher price 
the media analyst appert said for the the dedicated sports 
fanatic 75 cents versus 50 cents wont be a problem just like it 
isnt a problem for the wall street journal and dedicated financial 
readers 
but will they lose some marginal circulation absolutely he 
said 
the national premiered jan 31 with editions in new york 
chicago and los angeles it has since added editions in san diego 
san francisco dallas detroit boston miamifort lauderdale and 
baltimorewashington dc 
it is scheduled to expand next year with editions in 
philadelphia atlanta denver and seattle insiders said 
the national is owned by national american sports 
communications a private partnership controlled by mexican media 
baron emilio azcarraga he has declined to be interviewed about the 
newspaper 
it has been reported he was prepared to spend 100 million over 
five years on the paper and that firstyear losses exceeded his 
expectations 
media analysts say it remains unclear whether there are enough 
readers for a sports daily they say local newspapers and 
established outlets such as gannett co incs usa today newspaper 
are already providing a heavy dose of sports news 
in addition usa today disclosed last week it is studying 
whether to produce a weekly sports tabloid which could mean even 
more competition for sports readers 
asked to rate the nationals chances for survival appert said 
its still a long shot

american companies that still do business in 
south africa find that economic sanctions havent hurt their 
business performance new investment research findings show 
since 1980 companies with south african business ties saw their 
return on investment improve by one percentage point per year over 
companies without business dealings in that nation researcher john 
freeman said in an interview friday 
return on investment a commonly used barometer to measure a 
companys financial performance is a percentage calculated by 
dividing assets into net income 
the joint research by freeman a manager for barra an 
investment consulting firm in berkeley calif and martingdale 
asset management in boston sought to neutralize all the other 
things and isolate the south african factor freeman said 
their unpublished research was conducted for investment fund 
managers to help them understand the risk of divestiture from south 
africa he said 
the study showed that between january 1980 and august 1984 
companies with south african ties lost 150 basis points in the 
return on investment annually when compared with nonsouth african 
companies a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
the trend then reversed itself from august 1984 to october 
1990 companies with south african ties outperformed the others by 
280 basis points per year 
freeman admitted the research results surprised him activists 
who oppose apartheid south africas policy of racial separation 
were surprised as well 
the research raises the question of whether the sanctions were 
designed to make companies unattractive as investments hurt their 
business or merely force them out of south africa 
our view is the goal was to get major companies to leave south 
africa said patrick mcveigh vice president of franklin research 
and development corp in boston franklin offers what it calls 
socially responsible investment portfolios for companies without 
south african connections 
he said wounding a companys performance generally was a 
secondary weapon of divestment but it never was a primary 
goal 
since 1984 170 us companies have removed their employees or 
direct investments in south africa said meg vorhees south african 
research director at the investor responsibility research center in 
washington which keeps track of american corporate relations with 
south africa she said 114 us companies maintain direct 
investments or employees in that nation 
the pullout stems from international outrage over the political 
suppression and human rights abuses of south africas blacks as of 
june 1990 19 states and 55 cities have adopted policies calling 
for full or partial divestiture of securities with south african 
links said ms vorhees 
the divestment question was posed to numerous government pension 
funds endowments and foundations throughout the 1980s scattered 
protests flared on college campuses during the period as students 
urged school pull south africanrelated investments 
she criticized the martingdalebarra findings saying most 
american companies derive a small amount of their business from 
south african subsidiaries or investments 
its hard for me to believe it would make that much of a 
difference in general us companies with operations in south 
africa account for less than 1 percent of their assets she said 
franklin says its south africaclean investment portfolio has 
performed slightly better than the standard and poors 500 index 
during a 15year period the difference is very small said 
mcveigh if anything over time its become less of an issue 
because of the companies that have pulled out of south africa

has agreed to acquire the weekly reader funk amp wagnalls 
encyclopedias and other publishing operations from the 
privatelyheld field corp 
terms of the deal were not disclosed but one source familiar 
with the transaction said the price was about 200 million 
kiii holdings is a new yorkbased investment partnership headed 
by several former executives of the publishing giant macmillan inc 
and backed by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
the partnership already has interests in educational publishing 
trade magazines and directories for the transportation industry 
the deal would more than double the size of its operations as 
the assets being acquired generated revenue estimated at nearly 
300 million this year compared with kiiis operations with about 
230 million in revenue 
field corp based in chicago is owned by marshall field v and 
the field family trusts it put its publishing operations up for 
sale last summer reportedly because it was dissatisfied with its 
return on the operations 
the source who spoke on condition that he not be identified said 
there were believed to be a number of companies interested in parts 
of the operation being sold but far fewer were interested in all of 
them 
he said field has been talking exclusively with kiii holdings 
for the past six weeks 
kiii has agreed to buy the assets of field publications lp 
which include the weekly reader a current events publication 
that reaches more than 85 million elementary school children and 
700000 teachers with information designed for use in the 
classroom 
field publications based in middletown conn is the largest 
us marketer of childrens book clubs and other programs supplied 
regularly through the mail 
kiiis newbridge communications business already markets 
educational materials through book clubs and other direct marketing 
programs to more than 400000 teachers 
funk amp wagnalls based in ramsey nj publishes encyclopedias 
for children and markets them primarily through supermarkets 
these busineses offer a strategic fit with the educational 
focus of newbridge said william f oreilly chairman and chief 
executive of kiii holdings this is one of those rare 
opportunities where there is a real compatibility with existing 
operations 
kiii holdings president charles mccurdy said no sunstantial 
changes are planned at either company in terms of product or 
management 
the deal is expected to be completed in early 1991

the most comprehensive western study of the 
soviet economy ever made concluded friday that mikhail gorbachevs 
only hope to save it is a radical irreversible break with the 
past 
the study called for the besieged soviet citizens to swallow the 
bitter economic medicine of ending price controls on basic 
commodities while accepting the imposition of wage controls 
while conceding that unemployment would rise and output would 
fall experts at the international monetary fund insisted that 
gorbachevs more gradual reforms had not worked and must be junked 
the report supported president bushs arguments that large 
amounts of direct aid should not be given to the soviet union 
without more fundamental reorganization of its economy 
in the short term the report said western countries should 
emphasize technical assistance in such areas as banking law and 
transportation help with environmental problems and modernization 
of energy production system would be useful it said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said friday that the 
report was being distributed to the leaders of the nations which 
had requested it last july at the sevennation economic summit in 
houston it was ordered in an attempt to bridge a gap between 
french and german leaders pushing for endorsement of an immediate 
15 billion aid package and a reluctant bush and others 
the general recommendations of the report are recommendations 
that the united states will support and subscribe to baker said 
in comments which indicated the document is likely to form the 
blueprint for western assistance to the soviets in the next year 
preparing the report were experts from the 154nation imf and 
its sister organization the world bank the organization for 
economic cooperation and development and the european bank for 
reconstruction and development 
president bush and other members of his administration were 
briefed thursday by imf managing director michel camdessus and 
world bank president barber conable 
the specific measures that have been adopted do not yet 
constitute the coherent and comprehensive program which in our 
view is necessary if the transition to a freemarket economy is 
to be successful the study said 
the old governmentcontrolled economy has collapsed and been 
replaced by depleted store shelves rampant growth of the black 
market and bartering for goods 
gorbachev must move quickly to establish private property rights 
and reform such vital sectors as farming the crumbling 
distribution network energy production and manufacturing the 
study said 
immediate help could be useful in modernizing oil drilling 
techniques and nuclear power plants and upgrading the natural gas 
pipeline system it said 
these changes cannot be made in a matter of weeks the 
report said but the imperative is to make sufficient progress at 
the beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with 
the past and the process gains an unstoppable momentum 
in many ways the report called for the coldturkey economic 
reforms that poland has undertaken over the past year those 
reforms have put goods in the stores slowed inflation and 
stabilized the international value of the currency but at the cost 
of much pain and disenchantment 
it is an open question whether gorbachev could do the same in 
the sprawling more diverse soviet union given the widespread 
dissatisfaction in the various republics with his leadership 
but the international monetary fund said the soviet central 
government could not return to a directed economy even if it wanted 
to and has no essential choice but to accelerate the transition to 
a market economy 
ideally a path of gradual reform could be laid out which 
would minimize economic disturbance the report said but we 
know of no such path the more particularly given the difficult 
starting conditions 
in addition to the united states fridays report was requested 
by japan germany britain france italy and canada 
a separate study done for the european economic community came 
to the same conclusion friday that massive amounts of direct 
western aid now would be wasted

the soviet union owes 552 billion abroad 
putting it among the worlds top debtors according to a study 
friday from the international monetary fund 
it said that was the total last june based on calculations of 
its own staff 
the figure was higher than some previous estimates the cia put 
net soviet debt last year at 333 billion according to the world 
bank the funds sister organization indonesias debt the fifth 
largest in the third world was 531 billion last year egypt was 
sixth with 488 billion 
the top third world debtor brazil owed 1113 billion 
the bank gave no figure for the soviet union which does not 
belong to either the bank or the fund 
the soviets would like to join and be able to borrow from them 
as well as from governments and commercial banks the united 
states the most influential member has opposed membership for the 
soviets president bush has proposed a special status which would 
give moscow technical aid but not loans 
many bankers and business people consider the amount that a 
country has to pay out in the course of a year more important than 
the total debt the fund estimated that 134 billion in principal 
and interest was due from the soviets this year and 94 billion in 
1989 
by way of comparison brazil which owes twice as much as the 
soviets had 93 billion due last year but has actually been 
paying only part of it this year brazil has not been paying 
interest at all there has been no public indication that the 
soviets are behind on their debt payments but the report said 
trade credits of about 5 billion are overdue 
a large amount of the principal of soviet debt about 12 
billion worth according to the report will fall due next year 
the fund estimated that in trade with the western world the 
soviets will be buying 66 billion to 99 billion worth of goods 
and services more than it sells in 1991 such a deficit would 
increase its debt further 
we must stress that balance of payments assistance should 
accompany the introduction of a major and comprehensive reform 
program the report added 
without such a reform additional financial resources would be 
of little or no lasting value

former dallas thrift president edwin t mcbirney 
iii agreed to plead guilty to fraud and help federal investigators 
chase other thrift scandal figures the justice department said 
friday 
mcbirney who led sunbelt savings association is the second 
major thrift official in two days to be convicted of wrongdoing 
that cost taxpayers millions of dollars 
a federal court jury on thursday found former vernon savings 
association owner don r dixon guilty of 23 counts of fraud and 
misapplication of funds a magistrate ordered dixon held without 
bond until his feb 19 sentencing 
federal prosecutors have dealt a onetwo punch to the savings 
and loan crooks this week attorney general dick thornburgh said 
in washington 
sunbelts 1986 failure is estimated to have cost taxpayers 2 
billion and vernons in 1987 cost 13 billion 
in return for his help prosecutors agreed to limit mcbirneys 
penalty to 75 million in restitution and 85 million to settle 
civil claims by the federal deposit insurance corp mcbirney also 
may be sentenced to up to 15 years imprisonment 
we are confident that mr mcbirneys cooperation is going to 
lead to the indictment of other major insiders in the next two 
years said marvin collins us attorney for the northern 
district of texas 
mcbirney 37 filed the plea in federal court friday a date had 
not been scheduled for him to appear before a judge 
the deal was made last month but prosecutors arranged not to 
file or publicize it until dixons trial was over collins said 
they did not want to risk complicating the dixon trial which 
began in october he said in september the fraud conviction of 
two vernon borrowers was thrown out when the judge learned the jury 
had discussed dixons indictment during its deliberations 
we were being perhaps just a little extra cautious collins 
said with these very large cases we are taking extra care 
mcbirney who was indicted in july on 17 counts agreed to plead 
guilty to four counts of bank fraud filing a false corporate tax 
return causing a false statement to be filed by sunbelt and 
misapplying 250000 in sunbelt funds 
the bank fraud count stems from a 700 million deal to finance 
the purchase of real estate in southern california by a sunbelt 
subsidiary 
mcbirney agreed to admit that he arranged a fraudulent 30 
million reciprocal loan arrangement with western savings 
association another former dallas thrift to help finance the real 
estate deal 
the former owner of western savings jarrett woods goes on 
trial next month on 37 charges he misapplied funds and falsified 
records that led to the thrifts 1 billion failure 
dixon 52 was convicted of illegally spending money from his 
vernon savings association on prostitutes and a california beach 
house he could be sentenced to as many as 115 years in prison and 
fined 575 million for his convictions on 23 fraud counts

the fbi arrested three men friday in an 
alleged 2 millionamonth scheme to lease nonexistent copy 
machines to businesses around the country 
the fbi said in an affidavit that the defendants purported to 
sell the copiers to companies that buy used xerox corp machines 
for leasing 
the buyers believed the copiers would be leased for them by a 
pennsylvania company the fbi said the alleged scam relied on the 
buyers never having to see the machines since they supposedly were 
being leased by a third party 
this is a typical pyramid scheme where an investor group pays 
in a large amount and is then paid back on a monthly basis milt 
ahlerich the fbis special agent in charge of connecticut said 
they think they are getting a terrific return on their 
investment but the money is actually coming out of their original 
investment he said 
randy t hilgert 32 of madison thomas j becker of north 
kingstown ri and john f rodgers of arcola pa each was 
charged with wire fraud mail fraud and money laundering ahlerich 
said 
hilgert was released friday on 25000 bond the status of the 
other two men was not known federal agents seized property 
belonging to the three and records from the businesses involved 
the alleged victim companies were paid a monthly fee for leasing 
the nonexistent machines sales of the machines averaged about 2 
million a month but in september for example lease payments 
totaled only 570000 
a large percentage of the victims were banks located around the 
country ahlerich said several companies allegedly were victimized 
but declined to specify 
hilgert was the broker for the machines the fbi said he 
allegedly deposited about 500000 a week into an account at the 
new england savings bank in madison the bank which said it knew 
hilgert for years as a local carpenter and landscaper notified the 
fbi about the deposits 
on the same day he made the deposits the fbi said hilgert 
would wire 90 percent of the money to becker associates of 
bridgeport pa 
in one example hilgert sold 14 used copiers to banc one leasing 
corp of columbus ohio which believed the machines would be 
leased by becker associates which was operating under the name 
rhino copy the affidavit said 
rhino copy was supposed to be leasing the machines for banc one 
and then making monthly payments to the bank the fbi said since 
it was receiving monthly payments on time banc one decided to buy 
10 more machines 
fbi special agent marilyn lucht went to pennsylvania for banc 
one to inspect the machines the company thought it owned the 
affidavit said she found about 90 copiers at rhino copy but only 
six were operational 
lucht said becker and rodgers told her all of their machines 
were leased had been purchased by hilgert and were refurbished by 
centralized services inc 
centralized services was a vendor and refurbisher of the used 
copiers sold by hilgert to the victim leasing companies fbi said 
lucht said in an affidavit that the company only exists on 
paper 
centralized services president is a former xerox repairman 
ralph sylvestri the fbi said he has not been charged and the fbi 
declined to comment on his role in the investigation

a higherthanexpected federal deficit tensions 
in the middle east and the holiday season combined to depress bond 
prices friday in moderate trading 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond was down point or 
625 per 1000 in face amount at fridays closing its yield 
which rises when prices fall was up to 829 percent from 823 
percent late thursday 
we had more rhetoric coming from mideast situation the 
holiday atmosphere and a largerthanexpected budget deficit put 
it all together and i think it explains what happened today said 
kevin flanagan a money market economist for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
the federal government reported a 481 billion deficit in 
november a 62 percent increase over a year earlier the government 
blamed the red ink on the persian gulf buildup and a failing 
economy 
traders generally see large deficits as pushing up interest 
rates because the treasury must offer attractive yields when it 
peddles large amounts of debt to finance government operations 
iraqi president saddam hussein predicted in an interview 
broadcast friday that if war broke out in the gulf president bush 
would be forced to retreat after american casualties reached 5000 
saddam also refused to pull out of kuwait by the jan 15 
deadline set by the united nations for avoiding force traders 
predict a gulf war will hike the price of oil and increase 
inflation which erodes the price of bonds 
in addition the market faced what traders called yearend 
pressures because banks are scrambling to obtain cash and in turn 
bidding up the cost of funds to fulfill financial obligations 
before the new year 
broker marilyn cohen viewed the price drop as a normal 
pullback in a bull market for bonds people were so overbought in 
the bond market she said 
ms cohen investment broker for capital insight inc in beverly 
hills calif said she wasnt distressed over the decline in bond 
prices because clearly interest rates are not going up for the 
time being 
this is the relief the bond market needs in order to gather 
full steam and move ahead again she said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities were down 116 point to 732 point intermediate 
maturities fell point to 1332 point and longterm issues lost 
point to point the telerate inc financial information service 
reported 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer was down 291 to 118199 
yields on threemonth treasury bills held at 673 percent as the 
discount rate rose 1 basis point to 654 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 691 percent as the discount rose 6basis 
point to 660 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 693 
percent as the discount was up 4 basis points to 651 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 7 percent up from 7lsqb percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively

bank of new england corp would receive an 
injection of 605 million in capital if the ailing company agrees 
to a debtforequity swap proposed friday 
committees representing holders of 705 million worth of bank of 
new england bonds have agreed to exchange their bonds for stock 
that will give them 92 percent ownership of the company said 
wilbur ross who represents some of the bond holders 
meanwhile in washington the securities and exchange commission 
announced the troubled bank has settled without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing allegations that it didnt disclose financial 
problems in its quarterly financial statements 
settlement negotiations were reported earlier but neither the 
sec nor the bank would provide details until fridays announcement 
in washington 
under the debtforequity swap the debt would be reduced from 
705 million to 100 million the difference or 605 million 
would be converted to equity capital for the bank 
thats a huge amount ross said the bank severely needs 
capital 
but an analyst said this deal alone could not solve the banks 
problems 
gerard cassidy a bank analyst with tucker anthony inc called 
the deal a major step forward but i would not say this event in 
and by itself is a panacea for their problems 
he said the bank must reduce its troubled loan portfolio and 
hope that the economy will halt its slide and begin to rebound 
james dorsey a bank spokesman said the bank would review the 
bondholders offer and discuss it with the board of directors 
ross reading from a statement said the deal would provide the 
bank with additional flexibility and financial wherewithal to 
continue to address its current financial problems 
at the same time the finances would be saving the federal 
government enormous taxpayer sums which would otherwise be spent if 
the bank or its subsidiaries were to be closed 
bank of new england has struggled for more than a year from bad 
real estate loans analysts say the bank was hurt by a declining 
real estate market that exposed shoddy lending practices 
a congressional report released this week concluded that the 
bank became insolvent by some measures in june although the bank 
disputed the calculations 
at the end of its most recent quarter on sept 30 the bank had 
a capital to assets ratio of 11 percent below the 3 percent 
target set by federal regulators in orders signed by the government 
and the bank earlier this year 
the bank declined to say whether the capital infusion would push 
the ratio above that goal 
cassidy said it is uncertain whether the added capital would 
allow the bank to reach the 3 percent target noting that the bank 
is expected to report a fourthquarter loss 
under any proposed debtforequity swap the banks common 
shareholders will likely be wiped out the bank has said 
bank of new england shares were selling for 1 down 25 cents a 
share in late trading on the new york stock exchange 
in the sec action the federal stock market watchdog filed a 
civil lawsuit against the bank at federal court in washington 
charging the bank of new england knowingly understated losses in 
its loan portfolio in a quarterly financial report in september 
1989 
without admitting or denying the allegations the bank agreed to 
restate its third quarter financial statements for 1989 to have 
independent accountants review its internal auditing procedures and 
to otherwise reform its quarterly financial reporting practices 
were pleased we were able to arrive at a satisfactory 
settlement with the sec and that we can put this matter behind 
us said dorsey the bank spokesman the sec settlement has no 
affect on the companys current business operations and will in no 
way interfere with our ongoing affairs 
sec chairman richard c breeden said the agency did not seek 
monetary penalties from the bank because the allegations predated 
a 1990 law giving the sec powers to impose fines 
breeden said the banks second quarter financial statement in 
1989 didnt adequately address trends affecting the bank including 
the deteriorating new england real estate market in the third 
quarter it failed to contain adequate provisions for losses 
said breeden adding that the bank didnt take a 1 billion 
writeoff of its loan losses until after it made a 250 million 
public securities offering

bondholders in donald trumps taj mahal casino 
will have a say in who sits on the board of the atlantic city 
gaming house under a proposed bankruptcy reorganization plan 
documents disclosed friday 
a compromise arrangement reached last month between trump and 
investors after trump missed a 473 million interest payment 
called for restructuring the debt in what is known as a 
prepackaged bankruptcy filing 
the prepackaged plan which negotiators said would enable the 
casino to emerge from court protection within weeks was unveiled 
friday in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
it calls for noteholders to swap bonds paying 14 percent 
interest for a package of lower paying bonds plus stock in the taj 
mahal 
the stock would entitle bondholders to elect three of the seven 
members of the board of directors trump would get to pick the 
other four 
the deal calls for holders of bonds due in 1998 which pay 14 
percent interest to exchange them for bonds due in 1999 that will 
pay 1125 percent interest 
in addition for each 1000 in old bonds investors would get 
one share of class b stock which has voting rights and one share 
of class a common stock 
the taj mahal has been unable to break even since its april 2 
opening in atlantic city 
the deal was reached about 12 hours after trump missed a 473 
million interest payment on 675 million worth of highyield junk 
bonds used to finance the taj mahal the bondholders had threatened 
to push trump into bankruptcy proceedings and seize control of the 
casino 
under a compromise arrangement bondholders initially will 
receive 50 percent of the stock in the casino but if trump is able 
to pay the original 14 percent interest on the bonds his stake in 
the taj mahal will increase to 80 percent 
in a prepackaged bankruptcy a debtor and creditors agree on a 
plan to reorganize a company before entering court proceedings 
such arrangments require approval of twothirds of creditors 
holding 50 percent of a companys debt they typically reduce the 
time a company needs to reorganize its debt

airlines said they were close to a combination that would end 
their rivalry and mark a dramatic consolidation in the troubled 
industry

buyout of pan am corp last weekend in a deal worth about 375 
million pan am chairman thomas g plaskett responded with a letter

but plaskett said pan am would need an infusion of cash before 
the purchase could be completed 
 
washington ap the federal government ran up a 481 billion 
deficit in november a 62 percent increase over a year ago due in 
part to the persian gulf buildup and a failing economy the 
treasury department reported 
combined with the october deficit the imbalance for the first
