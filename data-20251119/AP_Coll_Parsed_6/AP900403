a fuel slick in the allegheny river slid 
past pittsburgh without entering the citys intake valves and the 
fastmoving oil posed little threat tuesday of fouling water 
downstream officials said 
nine oil booms were removed from the allegheny near freeport on 
tuesday said epa spokeswoman carrie deitzel another 16 booms will 
remain in the river 
the situation is good and its the best its been said carl 
kuehn deputy director of the pennsylvania emergency management 
agency 
federal state and local officials began formal investigations 
of the spill which began late friday 35 miles north of pittsburgh 
when at least 76000 gallons of diesel gasoline and kerosene 
spilled from a ruptured underground pipeline owned by the buckeye 
pipe line co 
buckeye said the ruptured pipeline was triggered by a landslide 
but charles duritsa regional director of the state department of 
environmental resources said residents near the spill site smelled 
fuel a day before the landslide 
there was speculation the leaking fuel weakened the ground and 
caused the slide he said 
officials on tuesday criticized the national transportation 
safety board which issues permits and regulates the nations 
pipeline system for not becoming involved in the cleanup and 
investigation 
we feel there is a need for further investigation we would 
like to see more indepth action by the ntsb kuehn said we 
are not happy with the response at this time 
communities downstream from the spill were forced to close the 
intake valves into their water treatment plants as the muck slowly 
moved downstream the spill at one time had threatened the water 
supplies of up to 1 million people along the allegheny and ohio 
rivers 
officials said small globs of the mixture from fuelsoaked soil 
will continue to seep into the allegheny at the ruptured pipeline 
near freeport the amounts appear to be insignificant but will be 
monitored continually said dave wright of the environmental 
protection agency

the berlin wall the warsaw pact and 
other legacies of world war ii are fading fast but some things 
live in infamy as sony corp of america was recently reminded 
the japanese electronics company acknowledged monday that it 
apologized to a customer for using dec 7 the date of japans 
attack on pearl harbor as an example in an owners manual 
explaining how to set the date on its videocassette recorders 
sonys apology came in response to a complaint by scott l 
edelheit a boca raton fla man who said his father was killed at 
pearl harbor in 1941 
the date was inadvertently used in the japaneseprinted manual 
for a vcr edelheit had bought said jason farrow a spokesman at 
sonys us headquarters in park ridge 
we try to be sensitive on these issues he said it would 
be irrational for anyone to think that a company that does 25 
percent of its business in the united states would ever 
intentionally do anything like that 
farrow said sony had not determined whether the mistake occurred 
at its tokyo office or whether the date was changed by the printer 
ken iwaki sony deputy president in tokyo told edelheit in his 
letter that the company has told the concerned people in tokyo to 
be more careful and not to let this happen again 
edelheit has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached 
for comment

evidence of test buying and other cheating has 
led the educational testing service to cancel the scores of some 
6600 students in india who took the graduate record examination 
between october and february 
in the wake of what is almost certainly the worst case in 
history of cheating on standardized tests ets said monday it will 
offer the exams less often and at fewer locations in india 
a fivemonth investigation found security breaches at many test 
centers and evidence students had been able to buy copies of the 
exam in advance 
the problems came to light in december when the princeton 
njbased test service said it was wiping out the scores of 2744 
indian students who took the gre in october the test is for 
admission to graduate school 
ets spokesman ray nicosia said at that time that the test 
service had received dozens of letters from indian students and 
test center supervisors indicating that students had been able to 
buy copies of the test beforehand 
the test administered to some 366000 students worldwide each 
year is taken by 14000 indian students 
the cheating continued despite the investigation said charlotte 
kuh ets executive director of gre programs 
she said the service canceled the scores of students who took 
the gre on jan 20 feb 3 and feb 10 bringing the number of 
cancellations to about 6600 
the problem was somewhere in our shipping process said kuh 
she would not say who the culprits were 
we are certain that the majority of students in india did not 
have preknowledge of the test questions said kuh 
nonetheless because it is etss responsibility to provide valid 
test scores ets must cancel all scores in group security cases 
when it is impossible to determine which scores are valid and which 
are not

a spat between mexico and panama over whose 
government has the most or least legitimacy is heating up with 
officials and newspapers trading insults and demanding 
explanations 
mexicos official government newspaper el nacional used words 
like bluster swagger and stupid on monday to describe 
president guillermo endara of panama 
newspapers in panama meanwhile said mexicos party 
dictatorship had been a model for panamas bygone military 
regimes 
the war of words began friday after the rio group of nations 
mexico colombia uruguay argentina venezuela brazil and peru 
called for elections in panama to legitimize its postinvasion 
government 
the rio groups statement issued in mexico city angered 
endara who was sworn in during the us invasion in december 
mexico peru and argentina have refused to send ambassadors to 
endaras government 
endara shot back saturday saying mexicos government took power 
through election fraud and panama doesnt need its endorsement 
he said his own government was legitimized by the people at 
the polls on may 7 we dont want the legitimization of the mexican 
government because it is a government that came to power 
through sheer electoral fraud 
international observers say endaras ticket overwhelmingly won 
the may 7 panamanian election which strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega later voided 
mexicos foreign ministry responded dryly to endaras attack 
with a statement saying it will proceed through diplomatic 
means to ask for an explanation 
election fraud is an extremely touchy subject in mexico where 
the institutional revolutionary party or pri has been in power 
for 61 years 
unlike panama or nicaragua mexico does not allow international 
election observers the results of its 1988 presidential election 
are still clouded by accusations that the pri resorted to electoral 
fraud to stay in power 
the pri on monday demanded an apology from endara it also 
accused him of presiding over the persecution torture jailing 
and execution of thousands of panamanians 
the party did not elaborate but it appeared to be making a 
reference to the us invasion when hundreds of members of 
noriegas defense forces were arrested there have been no reports 
of torture or execution 
the panamanian regime must offer an apology and give clear and 
satisfactory explanations for the serious breach it has 
committed the party said in a statement 
in mondays editorial el nacional said the swaggering tone 
the superficial and stupid reaction of endara show what kind of 
person has been put in charge of governing panama 
his bluster derives from the circumstances in which he became 
president sworn in at a barracks of the power invading his 
country backed by a foreign power 
in panama foreign minister julio linares said mexico seems to 
have been more comfortable with noriegas dictatorship than the new 
civilian government the us invasion ousted noriega from power 
mexico has made more trouble for endara in three months that 
it did in 21 years of military dictatorship he told reporters 
the panama city daily el editorial said panamas military 
regimes had used the pri as a model while la prensa suggested 
mexico reform its party dictatorship

czechoslovakias bestread 
underground newspaper has published its first issue as a 
fullfledged daily and pledges to stay independent 
despite police harassment lidove noviny peoples news had 
circulated monthly in hundreds of selfpublished copies since 
december 1987 
it carried frequent contributions from such notable former 
dissidents as vaclav havel now president havel and jiri 
dienstbier now foreign minister 
during its underground existence the paper was granted 
exclusive interviews by late soviet dissident andrei sakharov 
president bush and other wellknown political figures angering the 
former communist authorities 
lidoves editor jiri ruml was the last of czechoslovakias 
leading dissidents to be released from prison only nine days after 
the countrys peaceful revolution began nov 17 
in its first issues this year the paper printed criticism of 
the communist party as well as the countrys strongest opposition 
force civic forum enhancing its image as the voice of 
freethinking people 
mondays first daily issue consisting of eight pages and a 
press run of 250000 copies carried a melange of news comment and 
opinion including articles about lithuania independence drive and 
german reunification plans 
political and commercial independence is a tenet of the paper 
there were offers from press tycoons like robert maxwell and 
rupert murdoch to buy stock in our paper but we rejected them 
ruml told a news conference last month we are not going to 
accept any capital from anyone 
the commercial side of the lidove noviny publishing project is 
supported by a line of some 30 publications including two books by 
havel and a large number of previously unpublished works by other 
dissidents 
looking back at 40 years of censorship by communist authorities 
ruml made it clear he wanted his paper to be different 
one of the main priorities is to revive the good language in 
which newspapers should be written not that communist journalese 
gibberish we have been reading so far he said

digital audio tape recording the home taping 
enthusiasts dream and the music industrys worst nightmare 
finally is here 
with a protracted legal battle over this latest advance in 
highend recording potentially resolved manufacturers are 
promising to roll out their consumer dat machines by summer nearly 
three years later than first expected 
the recording industry aware of statistics showing that four 
out of 10 people over the age of 10 have taped recorded music in 
the past year is holding its breath in dat the big guns in the 
hardware industry are unleashing a product that threatens to do to 
the humble audiocassette what tapes and fancy compact discs did to 
the oncemighty vinyl lp 
it has the potential of doing what cd did in its initial 
introduction into the marketplace or about 35000 units in the 
first year said paul foschino assistant general manager of 
technics the secaucus njbased arm of japans matushita 
electric corp 
matushita plans to introduce a dat recorder in the united states 
under the technics label this summer at a cost of about 1200 to 
1300 foschino said the machines will carry a panasonic label in 
europe and japan 
philips consumer electronics plans to introduce a dat machine 
this year and it also is developing a cassette that could be 
played on both digital equipment and the analog cassette machines 
already in use according to the trade publication audio week 
how well the pricey dat machines fare with consumers is an open 
question but some analysts predict that like cd players the 
prices will come down sharply when the new format gains popularity 
a disturbing blip on the horizon for dat manufacturers however 
is the prospect of recordableerasable cds which tandy corp for 
one is developing 
the imminent arrival of these digital technologies has revived 
the debate over home taping and whether artists should be 
reimbursed for potential lost sales the money most likely would 
come from royalty fees on blank tapes or recorders 
a recent study by the congressional office of technology 
assessment said home taping may be causing as much as a 22 percent 
loss in prerecorded music sales ota said its survey in fall 1988 
showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped recorded music in 
the previous year 
songwriters composers and music publishers claim that with dat 
theyll lose even more royalties as listeners make virtually 
perfect tape copies of their favorite compact discs 
but a bill pending in congress to limit the number of copies 
that dat machines can make has eased concerns of record 
manufacturers and cleared the way for introduction of the machines 
the bill codifies an agreement reached last summer in athens 
between the recording and manufacturing industries 
although the bill by rep henry waxman dcalif does not 
address the royalties question the record industry considers the 
measure to be a major step forward 
david leibowitz senior vice presidentgeneral counsel of the 
recording industry association of america says the group remains 
very committed to royalties 
however we dont believe that royalties are politically 
achievable at the present time which is why we felt that we should 
at least secure some protection he said 
but the artists who create the songs arent satisfied they 
question whether or not the new anticopying technology is 
tamperproof and say that even limited copying cuts into their 
business and will lead ultimately to fewer recordings being made 
we want the technology to move forward but the question is 
will it allow us to make a living and will consumers have product 
available said ed murphy president of the national music 
publishers association 
opponents of fees on blank dat tapes or recorders claim such a 
royalty system would be unfair to those who dont use the tapes to 
record music 
if you want to tape your childs first words why should you 
pay michael jackson for that said ed baxter chief counsel to 
the senate judiciary patents copyrights and trademarks 
subcommittee 
it is still uncertain how the dat bill will fare this year in 
the house in a session shortened by electionyear politicking and a 
major clean air bill that is tying up the energy and commerce 
committee where the bill resides 
i dont think its a terribly controversial issue but its 
just a question of whether theres enough time said one 
congressional aide who would not allow his name to be used 
to the recording industry the scary part about dat which uses 
the 1s and 0s of computer language to make exact duplicates of the 
source material is that as many as 20 generations of digital 
copies can be made without discernible loss of quality 
faced with the threat of runaway home copying which copyright 
law generally has declared to be legal personal use the riaa 
in 1987 threatened to sue any manufacturer that introduced a 
consumer dat model before copyright issues could be addressed 
the athens agreement settled the legal question for now by 
instituting the serial copy management system scms will allow one 
dat copy to be made from a copyrighted cd but the user cannot make 
a copy from the dat copy it would allow a cd to be copied 
indefinitely onto different blank dat tapes 
the system also limits to two the number of generations of 
copies that can be made from a nondigital source such as todays 
analog audiocassettes lps or radio broadcasts one copy of a 
copy could be made from analog sources 
scms uses a silicon chip that will be able to detect an 
electronic antipiracy flag that is placed on a copyrighted 
digital material such as music cds the chip will write this 
flag onto the first dat copy made from the cd if a dat recorder 
detects this flag its record function will not operate 
professional dat machines without scms already are in use in 
the united states in the recording broadcast and computer 
industries at hefty prices ranging from 2500 to 7000 gray 
market consumer models can be had for 1600 to 3000 
automobile dat players have been available for more than a year at 
1500 and up with some prerecorded dat tapes mostly classical 
and jazz available at about 25 
dat tapes which are about half the size of conventional 
audiocassettes can store as much as two encyclopedias worth of 
data much more than conventional cartridges used for backup 
computer storage dat tapes could be useful as backups to hard 
discs on personal computers 
dat machines work something like a typical videocassette 
recorder a mechanism inside the dat machine opens a door on the 
back of the dat cassette and draws the 13inchwide tape around a 
spinning recordplay drum the recording is accomplished at the 
dizzying speed of 123 inches per second 65 times faster than 
todays audiocassette deck

sunday from lithuania 
</TEXT>

the standard photograph of soviet 
founder vladimir i lenin found in the office of every factory 
manager has vanished leaving a telltale patch on the wall over the 
desk of vincas babilius 
i had all the books too babilius said pointing to bare 
shelves that once held the works of lenin and karl marx but since 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 babilius no longer 
feels compelled to follow the soviet model to run the vilnius 
electrical measuring device factory 
while lithuanias political leaders struggle daily with moscows 
effort to make them renounce the declaration of independence 
people all over the small baltic nation are quietly moving to 
establish a state run on its own principles 
they have an enormous task lithuanias telephone and 
connections to the outside world go through moscow its sole direct 
route to poland and the outside world is a tiny back road so 
overused that passing through frontier formalities can require 
days it is caught in a web of connections to the soviet economy 
which is rapidly careenng downhill 
babilius knows it will take years to untangle the mess left by 
50 years of communism 
but he has begun already he has banned the political meetings 
that consumed staff time and helped ensure communist grip on power 
at work you have to work he said simply 
on the lithuanianbyelorussian border the new government so far 
has been unable to station frontier guards because of the angry 
reaction from moscow 
but some enterprising citizens have lopped off the 
russianlanguage half of a huge concrete sign at the village of 
sumskas and left it lying in the dirt theyve repainted the 
remaining half to say lithuanian republic and dropped the 
soviet socialist that used to fall in the middle of the name 
the culture ministry is gathering artists designs for a 
lithuanian currency and banker romualdas visokavicius has already 
sought printing bids in west germany 
the newspaper sovietskaya litva or soviet lithuania has 
changed its name to eko litva or echo of lithuania control has 
been transferred from the communist party to the government 
an enterprising printer has stamped restoration of the 
lithuanian republic over the wording on a decorative vilnius 
envelope even though it still carries a 5kopeck soviet stamp 
on a recent sunny spring day workers chipped at the parliament 
building to remove a row of soviet emblems embedded in the front 
wall a few yards away over the front door a modern batik in the 
lithuanian colors of yellow green and red depicts an ancient 
lithuanian knight on horseback three weeks ago it too identified 
this as a seat of soviet power 
but building a new nation is much more than surface changes and 
lithuanians are just beginning that part of the task 
a raft of economic reforms is already drafted harvard economics 
professor larry summers has written a plan for switching to a 
market economy that calls for swift price reform and introduction 
of an independent currency by next year 
another american adviser new york lawyer william hough of the 
firm walter conston alexander amp green has been writing appeals 
to foreign governments for formal recognition 
ive been trying to get them to adopt the delaware commercial 
code he said the other day 
adoption of this standard would give lithuania a set of rules 
for a market economy simply and quickly he argued and it would 
encourage foreign investment 
at one stroke thousands of companies and lawyers around the 
world would understand exactly what their law is hough said 
hough said hed been doing some of his work at the lithuanian 
foreign ministry an elegant but nearly empty shell that he found 
a perfect example of the hollowness of the soviet unions claim 
that lithuanian was sovereign while part of the soviet union 
they dont even have a library he said 
the republic is already partially on its way to its own airline 
air lithuania doesnt have its name on a single plane but months 
ago it leased the entire aeroflot operation serving lithuania said 
gintautas preidis the groups banker 
such leasing operations are a key part of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs own economic reforms and the lithuanians 
have already taken advantage of it to start up direct flights from 
vilnius to east berlin and leipzig frankfurt is next 
some lithuanians already had passports issued by their 
stillfunctioning embassies abroad most west european governments 
honor the passports because they never recognized soviet 
annexation 
but soviet kgb troops still control lithuanian borders so even 
emissaries of the new government had to use their red soviet 
passports to get out of the country 
when the soviets barred foreign correspondents lithuanian 
foreign minister algirdas saudargas met british correspondent 
edward lucas as he walked off the onceaweek flight from east 
berlin right before the stunned face of a soviet border guard 
saudargas issued him a lithuanian visa numbered vt0001 it 
included stamps of both independent and soviet lithuania 
the attempt didnt last long lucas was forced to leave sunday 
with the rest of the foreign press corps 
the lithuanians were forced to readopt their 1938 constitution 
which is not nearly democratic enough for most activists this was 
done it in part to establish legal continuity with the independent 
lithuanian nation that existed before soviet occupation and 
annexation in 1940 
but the lithuanians didnt have a new constitution written 
either

federal judges across the country 
increasingly are ordering criminals not only to pay the time for 
their crime but to pay the cost of their prison stay 
from jan 19 1989 through the end of october federal judges 
ordered 254 defendants to pay a monthy fee during their prison 
sentence according to the us sentencing commission in 
washington dc 
we see this as merely an equitable and common sense thing to 
do said judge william wilkins jr of the 4th us circuit court 
of appeals in richmond va chairman of the sevenmember 
commission 
if you have the wherewithal to reimburse taxpayers for the 
cost of your imprisonment which you caused through the commission 
of a criminal act then you ought to have to pay wilkins said 
some civil libertarians however are objecting they say the 
inmates arent getting their moneys worth because of overcrowded 
prison conditions 
the commission created in october 1985 after public outcry over 
sentencing discrepancies instituted mandatory sentencing 
guidelines to be applied uniformly in federal courts 
but judges must use discretion in deciding which convicts will 
pay for their prison stay only those who can afford the monthly 
payment of 121005 plus 9166 a month during probation can be 
ordered to pay 
those fees calculated by the us bureau of prisons cannot be 
imposed if they would leave the defendants family destitute or on 
welfare said paul martin a commission spokesman 
it was kind of a very simple thought select those folks who 
have the ability to pay for their cost of incarceration or 
supervision martin said its mainly earmarked of course for 
the white collar defendant someone who has some financial 
resource 
of the 45000 cases that reach federal court every year few 
criminals appear to fit the bill 
most people who are put away in the federal court system are 
indigent they dont have a dime ive had clients who didnt have 
enough money to buy a sixpack of beer said ron wheeler an 
attorney in des moines 
last year wheeler represented a university of iowa student 
charged with possessing lsd with the intent to sell the student 
matthew follett of kenilworth ill pleaded guilty 
in august us district judge charles wolle sentenced follett 
to seven years in prison plus four years of probation 
noting that follett had a substantial trust fund wolle also 
fined follett 20000 and ordered him to pay for his prison stay 
plus the monthly fee during probation 
i dont have any problem with that at all wheeler said 
if theyre convicted and can pay the cost of being kept in 
prison i think they should 
it looks nice on paper but in actuality there arent a lot 
of these kinds of defendants 
in february in another drugrelated case us district judge 
francis j boyle of providence ri ordered three men accused of 
supplying 75 percent of the citys heroin to pay the costs of their 
confinement 
its the just thing to do boyle said at the time to the 
extent that a defendant is able to pay for it the defendant should 
be required to 
wilkins and others who support the program say requiring inmates 
to pay for imprisonment isnt meant as a deterrent 
the deterrent effect comes through the imposition of a prison 
term the judge said 
one critic of the program is alvin j bronstein director of the 
national prison project of the american civil liberties union who 
noted that the federal prison system is running at 170 percent of 
capacity and getting worse every month 
it is clear to me that federal prisons today are basically 
unconstitutional because of the conditions of overcrowding 
inadequate medical care and all the problems created by that mass 
of overcrowding he said 
it seems unseemly and highly inappropriate if not illegal 
to be requiring defendants to pay for room and board or the cost 
of being incarcerated in an unconstitutional facility bronstein 
said

along the grassy streets of pearl 
lagoon on the edge of its lonely dock in hammocks swaying in the 
shade people are waiting for the revolution a ferry boat as 
elusive as a campaign promise 
it sailed into the lagoon on the sunday after nicaraguas 
election spent an hour or so then sailed away 
a few people rode on the ferry many just heard of it but 
everyone seems to have an opinion about it 
some people think it is progress said irma de sosa a 
schoolteacher who has become an authority on the subject by virtue 
of being one of those who rode 
some feel like the government is just fooling the people that 
the boat wont come back she said spreading her hands and 
smiling 
well just have to wait and see 
the sandinista government far away in managua had long 
promised pearl lagoon a ferry for the 30mile run to bluefields 
port the link to the rest of the world for nicaraguas thinly 
populated atlantic coast 
that single visit by the revolution a 150passenger vessel is 
the only evidence residents have seen 
in many ways the ferry symbolizes the regions long fight for 
autonomy for some control of its own fate 
places like this town of 1900 are the essence of the atlantic 
coast an englishspeaking area so isolated from the rest of 
nicaragua that it seems like another country 
not a shot was fired here when the sandinistas overthrew the 
late president anastasio somoza in 1979 and the atlantic coast was 
largely untouched more than a decade later there still is no road 
between it and the spanishspeaking pacific side of nicaragua 
it was not the first time revolution passed the region by 
when the rest of central america was fighting for independence 
from spain the coast was a british protectorate with miskito 
indian royalty british buccaneers raided the spanish fleet with 
ships built in pearl lagoon 
the atlantic coast region is home to onetenth of nicaraguas 
33 million people a rich mixture of creoles latinos and sumo 
rama garifona and miskito indians it includes half the national 
territory of about 50000 square miles 
pearl lagoon has a couple of toyota trucks but the green 
streets look more like the fairways of a golf course it doesnt 
receive television from managua 200 miles to the west 
as with most hamlets dotting the coves inlets and rivers water 
is pearl lagoons only link to the world 
a regular ferry a boat of its own would mean a measure of 
independence and an end to the balmy isolation that envelops the 
lagoon like a daydream 
the atlantic coast is the poorest region of one of the 
hemispheres poorest nations but pearl lagoon is a fortune in the 
raw 
it rests on the banks of one of the richest breeding grounds of 
the succulent white shrimp on the edge of rich lobster beds it is 
the kind of place that feeds the dreams of entrepreneurs 
a businessman remembered simply as the chinaman the lagoons 
last success story dried and exported shrimp the sandinistas 
confiscated his shrimp plant fishing boats and rice mill and 
drove the chinaman into exile 
the boats went to bluefields said leslie hunsack a 
60yearold fisherman it did us no good here in pearl lagoon 
after the sandinistas nationalized the fishing industry pearl 
lagoon was left with a single customer that set its own price the 
government 
fishermen say months sometimes pass between the visits by boats 
from outside to pick up the catch we have our nets out and we 
catch this fish and we cant do anything with it said linton 
fox a community leader 
at least two young fishermen have died trying to make an extra 
dollar a pound on their lobster they were shot by government 
agents while on smuggling runs to the colombian island of san 
andreas 110 miles southeast of pearl lagoon 
we have always felt like a colony inside a country said 
labor leader alvin guthrie a creole from the coast elected to the 
new national assembly under the sandinistas it was like having 
spanish viceroys around 
in the northern atlantic coast region the managua governments 
attempts to enforce its policies provoked a bloody uprising of 
miskito indians 
finally the sandinistas admitted they had made mistakes and 
passed a regional autonomy law that at least in theory was the 
most sweeping in latin america 
autonomy remains a promise however not a reality 
members of the first autonomous councils one for the north 
coast and one for the south where pearl lagoon and bluefields are 
located were chosen in the feb 25 general elections 
still to be negotiated is the relationship between the regional 
and central governments at heart a question of control over gold 
lumber and fishing resources 
we dont know much about autonomy said fox a member of the 
regional assembly but wed have the rights to our property our 
lumber our fish our shrimps would go to build up our little town 
not to build up managua or bluefields 
the sandinistas failed to overcome the suspicions and 
hostilities of the coast with the autonomy project like the rest 
of nicaragua the coast voted against them in the february election 
sandinista leaders predict autonomy would die under the 
government of president violeta barrios de chamorro which takes 
office april 25 
her conservative alliances platform does not mention autonomy 
and sandinista leaders say its goal of privatization is 
incompatible with local control of the regions riches 
the backbone for autonomy is the natural resources what is in 
the sea and what is in the forest said johnny hodgson a 
sandinista leader in bluefields 
british and american companies that exploited the coast the 
somoza dictatorship the sandinistas none brought prosperity or 
gave the coast a real say in its affairs 
hunsack the fisherman picked up his saw and prepared to cut 
another board 
he is tired of waiting for the revolution and is building his 
own boat 
this autonomy the sandinistas had they were using people as a 
tool hunsack said we expect better we couldnt get worse

leon trotsky resisted vladimir ilyich lenins 
offers to become the soviet revolutionary leaders successor 
because he feared his jewish origins would hurt the communist 
cause according to a new historical study 
soviet historian victor danilov says a document has come to 
light that contains trotskys only known explanation for turning 
down lenins offers of high office 
writing in history workshop a journal published by oxford 
university press danilov cites what he says is a hitherto 
unpublished speech trotsky made at a congress of senior soviet 
communists held oct 2527 1923 
trotsky was lenins partner in leading the 1917 revolution but 
now lenin was ill and josef stalin and his supporters were 
maneuvering to oust trotsky from the leadership 
defending himself to the congress against charges that he lusted 
for power trotsky sought to demonstrate how he consistently shied 
away from high office danilov wrote 
the fact is comrades that there is one personal aspect of my 
work which although playing no role in my personal life and my 
daytoday existence is nonetheless of great political 
significance this is my jewish origin trotsky was quoted as 
saying 
i clearly remember vladimir ilyich stretched out on the floor 
in the smolny his leningrad headquarters on 25 october 1917 and 
saying to me we must make you peoples commissar of the interior 
comrade trotsky you shall crush the bourgeoisie and the 
aristocracy 
and i refused i said that in my opinion there was no point in 
playing into the hands of our enemies it would be far better i 
said if there was not a single jew in the first soviet 
revolutionary government stuff and nonsense vladimir ilyich 
said thats all rubbish however my words evidently had their 
effect for i was not appointed commissar of the interior but of 
foreign policy although to be honest i was equally loth to 
accept this post 
according to the speech trotsky also was reluctant to take on 
the post of war commissar and i was right remember how at 
critical moments of the yudenich kolchak and wrangel military 
campaigns our enemies were able to exploit the fact that the red 
army was headed by a jew this was a very great inconvenience to 
us 
trotsky was born lev davidovich bronstein into a middleclass 
russian jewish family trotsky was an alias he assumed while on the 
run from czarist authorities 
he was quoted as saying in the speech that lenin thought his 
preoccupation with being jewish was merely a personal whim of 
mine and frequently referred to it as such in conversations with 
me and other comrades 
when lenin offered to make him his sole deputy in effect lining 
him up as an heir apparent i firmly turned down his offer on the 
grounds as before that we should not give our enemies the 
opportunity to say that our country was being ruled by a jew i 
think vladimir ilyich agreed with me although he again said 
stuff and nonsense i felt that he said it this time with less 
conviction and that privately he agreed with me 
danilov wrote that trotskys speech was recorded in summary by 
stalins assistant b bazhanov and came to light only now when 
the soviet policy of glasnost is allowing historians to enter 
onceforbidden areas 
danilov wrote there was no reason to distrust bazhanovs 
account so fully does it convey the sincerity and conviction of 
trotskys words and so damningly does it reflect upon the 
organizers of this kangaroo court 
lenin died a year later trotsky was expelled from the communist 
party in 1927 and transformed by stalinist propaganda into the 
archenemy of the people he went into exile and ended up in mexico 
where he was murdered in 1940 by an acquaintance described by 
trotskys friends as a stalin agent

willie nelson hopes the fourth farm aid 
concert can elicit greater support for the family farmer 
the singer and fellow organizers musicians john mellencamp and 
neil young had hoped they had performed their final farm aid 
concert when they left the stage in 1988 in lincoln neb 
we thought the problem might have gone away by now nelson 
the president of farm aid said last week in a telephone interview 
from montreal where he was on tour 
farm aid iv will be held saturday in the hoosier dome before 
45000 people 
the tentative lineup of more than 60 acts includes guns n 
roses bonnie raitt don henley bruce hornsby richard marx john 
denver lou reed iggy pop jackson browne dwight yoakum kt 
oslin and crosby stills and nash the cable nashville network will 
carry the show from noon to midnight 
the concert sold out in less than 90 minutes but nelson said 
urban problems such as homelessness and unemployment dilute the 
concern city dwellers hold for the struggle of family farmers 
theres a lot of apathy out there its a little difficult for 
someone living in a big city to get excited about whats happening 
on the farm he said

for the past several months a squad of 
cuban military pilots have been on 24hour alert for the attack of 
an invisible enemy last week the first assault came 
the united states started sending tv marti signals toward cuba 
the signal has carried mostly replays of old sports events and 
comedy shows but the cuban government regards it as a deadly 
serious offensive 
this is a war they have begun it said lt col thais 
martinez gesturing toward the united states as he spoke monday to 
foreign journalists at baracoa air base a halfhour drive from 
havana 
about 120 feet away stood two sovietmade helicopters key 
elements in the antitv marti defense system 
the helicopters take off as soon as tv marti begins to penetrate 
cuban air space apparently with the help of onboard transmitters 
the choppers are able to interfere with the signal 
martinez is pleased with the results 
everything has been covered he said contending that tv 
martis signal emanating from a balloon off southern florida 
has been almost completely unable to reach cuban tv sets for more 
than a few minutes 
the work of the helicopters is supplemented by two tall tv 
antennas in havana also with jamming capability 
tv marti is the video version of radio marti the 5yearold 
station designed to bring entertainment and balanced news to cuba 
both are run by the us governments voice of america 
transmissions of tv marti are being sent during the early 
morning hours and the bush administration says that after the 
current testing phase is over it will decide whether the project 
is technologically and legally feasible 
president bush told a convention of the national association of 
broadcasters in atlanta on monday that tv marti will keep 
transmitting despite concerns cubas president fidel castro may 
widen his jamming of us radio stations in retaliation for tv 
martis transmissions the cubans have jammed the signals of am 
radio stations in the us southeast 
cubans not sympathetic to their government are eager for tv 
marti to succeed contending it will bring a new dimension to the 
drab fare now available from local programming 
but to cuban officialdom and to many ordinary citizens the 
initiative is just another example of us imperialism at work 
its a question of dignity said col jose herrera 
martinez said several bases are involved in the same type of 
jamming operations as the baracoa facility 
he said the efficiency of the jamming operation has grown by the 
day the first day jamming started after 10 minutes the state 
department claims it was 23 and the figure has dropped 
progressively since 
it now takes only three minutes said martinez 
but the intereference is costly 
first lt gustavo sojo said the helicopters use up about 225 
gallons of gasoline per hour a substantial amount for a country as 
small and hardpressed as cuba thats about 1200 per helicopter 
for four hours in the air 
despite the costs the government appears prepared to stand firm 
against the airwaves incursion 
we are ready to resist for whatever time is necessary said 
martinez

president bush wont get 800 million to aid 
new democracies in panama and nicaragua until he produces a broad 
spending plan showing how the money serves us goals says senate 
majority leader george mitchell 
mitchells warning poses new difficulties for the aid package 
which bush wants enacted by thursday before congress adjourns for a 
12day easter recess the money bill was scheduled for house action 
today but its chances for completion this week appeared dim 
bush had hoped to provide the money 500 million for panama 
and 300 million for nicaragua quickly as a tangible 
demonstration of the benefits of democracy and to aid panamanian 
president guillermo endara and nicaraguan presidentelect violeta 
chamorro 
the house appropriations committee approved the money bill last 
week but only after swelling it to 24 billion by adding money 
for domestic disaster relief food stamps veterans benefits and 
other items 
mitchell dmaine complained monday that the aid for panama and 
nicaragua was being sought without proper justification and without 
regard to how it fits with overall us goals 
the administration is asking congress to put together a jigsaw 
puzzle without any overall picture and without all the pieces 
mitchell said in a statement that called the white house approach 
piecemeal 
he said he hoped to have the senate begin work wednesday on a 
companion bill setting up aid programs for the two countries but 
that bill contains no money to fund the programs 
by approaching foreign aid on a countrybycountry basis and 
in oneshot increments the administration has provided no overall 
or longterm view of how all the pieces can and should fit 
together mitchell said 
they have provided no rationale as to how this request relates 
to other parts of the budget to other foreign aid spending to 
defense or domestic spending to the deficit he said 
mitchell contended the administration has provided no plan for 
future aid to the two central american countries or how their 
priority for aid compares with that of emerging democracies in 
eastern europe and elsewhere 
mitchell further spelled out his request in a letter to 
secretary of state james a baker iii saying the spending plan 
should cover plans for the next three to five years for foreign 
aid defense spending domestic spending and the deficit 
the administration has not explained the relationship between 
this request and our overall national security objectives 
mitchell told baker 
i believe it is essential that the senate have such a plan 
before it appropriates the emergency aid requested by the 
administration for panama and nicaragua 
administration officials testifying before congress have said 
the money is needed as a speedy response to conditions that could 
not have been foreseen when the white house wrote its budget for 
this year the administration wants to pay for the aid through cuts 
in the pentagon budget 
officials have said they regard the aid to panama as a onetime 
infusion to jumpstart the countrys stalled economy for 
nicaragua the administration has asked an additional 200 million 
for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
mitchell said he would not delay in meeting the genuine 
emergency needs for panama and nicaragua but he added i do 
not believe we should appropriate the full amount requested until 
the administration submits a meaningful longterm foreign aid 
plan 
in the first spurt of us aid to emerging democracies mitchell 
and senate democrats led the way last year in providing millions 
for poland and hungary mitchell called bush timid for not 
doing more for emerging democracies 
in a brief interview mitchell said mondays statement was not 
inconsistent with last years action but was a response to the 
sheer number of these oneshot requests when they accumulate in 
number the need for an overall plan becomes apparent

the whims of fashion can be cruel say mohair 
producers who raise goats in the cactusstudded southwest as they 
seek continued government aid for the times when designers shun 
their luxury yarn 
prices received by us mohair producers depend on how the 
fashion designers in europe want to treat us says brian j may 
executive director of the mohair council of america in san angelo 
texas 
the mohair producers are asking congress to continue payments to 
some of the 3500 texans who raise angora goats animals suited to 
a unique expanse of arid and brushy land in west and central texas 
small numbers of angora goats also are raised in new mexico and 
arizona 
nationwide about 10000 ranch families including 5000 navajo 
indians tend the angora goat whose fleece finds its way into 
2000 suits in japan or handknitted sweaters in europe the 
united states turkey and south africa produce most of the worlds 
50 million pounds of mohair 
prices have dipped low enough during 17 of the last 35 years to 
trigger payments from the agriculture department to mohair 
producers may said 
the government paid an average of 42 million a year during 
19861988 when mohair prices were the lowest in more than a decade 
the department said that total represents almost 56 percent of all 
government payments made since 1962 
some years may said prices dip so far below the cost of 
production it would be disastrous without the federal aid 
may contends congress should renew the program while it drafts 
the 1990 farm bill he says the program financed through a tariff 
on imported wool and mohair would help keep mohair producers in 
business as their trade association seeks new ways to beat market 
volatility through new overseas outlets and new fabrics 
all but 2 percent of domestic mohair is exported with europe 
leading the list of customers followed by asia and india the 
industry completed its first sale to china less than a year ago 
selling nearly 1 million of the brushy yarn and closed its first 
sale worth 15 million with the soviet union in december and 
january may said 
overseas sales of mohair have totaled more than 200 million in 
the past 35 years he said may hopes the thaw in relations with 
eastern europe will expand markets for mohair and help improve the 
us balance of trade 
the governments support also keeps otherwiseinhospitable land 
in production may said in some parts of southwest texas wool and 
mohair account for 80 percent of all agricultural income 
no one is going to cut up rocks and cactus land for real 
estate may said you cant run cattle out there these people 
arent getting rich off the government were maintaining this 
areas resources were using what would normally be considered a 
very minimaltype rangeland and making it a productive way of life 
for these counties to survive 
sen phil gramm rtexas added it may be a luxury fabric 
but if youre tending angora goats in the hill country of texas 
its a tough hard way to make a living 
may said angora goats contribute to water conservation by eating 
waterwasting woody brush plants and are often used instead of 
toxic chemicals to open up brushinfested pasture land 
but the agriculture department in a report on wool and mohair 
questioned whether there should be a program for wool and mohair a 
declining industry since world war ii 
today the wool program is under scrutiny because of its 
objectives and its rising costs the report said asking whether 
the programs costs have exceeded acceptable limits 
it said total wool and mohair spending was estimated at 1306 
million in 1988 about 1 percent of the 125 billion in spending 
on agricultural price supports and related programs

republican party chairman lee atwater is 
undergoing a new course of treatment for a brain tumor that a party 
official concedes is more serious than originally thought 
doctors treating atwater 39 said the tumor has the potential 
to behave aggressively a phrase repeated monday in a statement 
issued by mary matalin the republican party chief of staff 
atwater was at montefiore medical center in new york city where 
doctors planned to implant radioactive isotopes in the tumor in an 
effort to kill it 
since the tumor was diagnosed march 6 atwater has undergone 
daily radiation treatments 
bj cooper communications director at the republican national 
committee said atwater has conferred with several doctors since 
the original diagnosis and the consensus was that the growth was an 
astrocytoma located in the right frontal lobe 
make no mistake its serious said cooper who said there 
now was a clearer sense of its seriousness 
weve learned a lot more he said 
doctors not involved in atwaters case agreed that the type of 
tumor described was persistent and dangerous 
dr stuart grossman director of neurological oncology at the 
johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore said astrocytomas are 
tough tumors to cure they do have a tendency to come back 
astrocytomas are graded i through iv although grade iv is 
usually called by another name the announcement did not identify 
the grade of atwaters tumor 
all of these types of tumors are potentially curable and 
potentially fatal said dr r william harter an associate 
professor of radiation oncology at georgetown university hospital 
here 
harter said for a grade i astrocytoma the fiveyear survival 
rate is about 50 percent when treated aggressively for grade ii 
he said the fiveyear survival rate is 25 percent and for grade 
iii it is 10 to 20 percent grade iv tumors which are more 
commonly called glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma 
are always fatal said harter 
grossman cautioned however a fiveyear survival does not 
equal cure these types of tumors usually come back 
another doctor who asked not to be quoted said patients with 
astrocytomas run a substantial risk of dying from this disease at 
some point 
atwater was expected to remain in the hospital for about a week 
and then return to his washington home where according to the rnc 
he probably would rest for several weeks 
cooper said the chairman had been coming into party headquarters 
daily before he went to new york 
he said daytoday matters were being handled by jeanie austin 
the party cochairman and matalin 
lee to this point has been involved in all major 
decisions said cooper

charges against an american civil liberties 
union attorney could be reinstated if the most restrictive us 
abortion law is upheld in federal courts a territorial official 
said monday 
the charges agaisnt janet benshoof were dropped by territorial 
attorney general elizabeth barrettanderson who said she wanted to 
await the outcome of a federal court case before proceeding with 
any criminal action 
a memo filed in superior court by assistant attorney general 
dianne pierson asked for dismissal of the complaint because the 
federal court has placed a hold on enforcement of the antiabortion 
statute in this us territory in the pacific ocean 
benshoof was charged march 21 two days after the law was 
signed with solicitation to commit abortion the complaint against 
her was filed following a speech in which she encouraged women 
seeking abortions to travel to hawaii 
the new law prohibits abortion except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the woman 
us district judge alex munson issued a restraining order on 
march 23 the order is to remain in effect until a lawsuit 
challenging the law in heard in federal court on may 8 
if the federal court finds the law to be constitutional there 
is a possibility benshoof could be recharged for violating the 
statute barrettanderson said 
in another development gov joseph ada failed to show for a 
deposition hearing monday in connection with the lawsuit 
munson denied adas request that the court issue a protective 
order on the grounds that adas testimony was privileged 
information and not relevant to the case 
munson said adas testimony is pertinent to the outcome of the 
case and ordered ada to give a deposition

brent musburger gave a thumbsup sign to his fans 
at the end of the national collegiate athletic association 
basketball championship monday and promised a comeback at the end 
of his last broadcast on cbs 
folks ive had the best seat in the house thanks for sharing 
it ill see you down the road musberger said in his final 
signoff for the network he had worked at for more than two decades 
the network announced sunday that it wouldnt renew musburgers 
2 millionayear contract after it expires june 30 
musburger waited until the final moments of cbs broadcast of 
the university of nevada las vegas 10373 victory over duke 
university before saying farewell 
as you know he said this was my last assignment with cbs 
after 22 years with the television network radio network and the 
stations and i had an opportunity to work with the greatest 
directors producers technicians in the world not to mention 
analysts like my good friend billy packer billy we have shared 
some great memories 
musburger than put his arm around packer 
brent we saw a great champion here tonight said packer 
the former wake forest coach turned announcer its been an honor 
for all of us to work with a great champion of broadcasting 
after the broadcast was over fans at mcnichols arena shouted 
encouragement 
youre a pro baby one yelled 
musburger raised an arm to the crowd and gave a no 1 sign 
with his index finger extended he gave a thumbsup and shook 
hands with packer and much of the crew 
musburger did not answer questions jimmy tubbs musburgers 
personal assistant said the broadcaster would not discuss his 
departure from cbs while in denver but would be available for 
questions later in the week 
the main issues in musbergers contract dispute apparently were 
money and highprofile assignments cbs officials said musburger 
the networks most prominent sportscaster wanted more of both than 
the network was willing to give him 
cbs most pressing problem in replacing musburger is to find 
another no 1 baseball broadcaster before airing its first game 
april 14 musburger also was in line to be host of the networks 
coverage of the 1992 and 1994 winter olympics 
cbs leads the networks in major sports broadcasts with coverage 
of major league baseball the national football league the 
national basketball association the ncaa tournament the us open 
tennis tournament the masters golf tournament and college 
football nbc takes over nba coverage next fall 
musburger was to have teamed with tim mccarver on major league 
baseball telecasts al michaels is considered the top candidate to 
replace musburger if abc lets him out of his contract which runs 
into 1993 michaels an experienced baseball announcer is 
reportedly feuding with abc sports president dennis swanson and 
might be interested in the cbs job 
michaels agent art kaminsky declined to speculate about his 
clients chances of switching networks 
its inappropriate kaminsky said brent has been there 
for 15 years and this is so sudden i and everyone else owe him 
some respect we should let him work the game before talking 
about his successor he said 
swanson asked whether abc would let michaels out of his 
contract said i dont comment on hypothetical questions 
if cbs cant get michaels it might try to lure bob costas from 
nbc but costas whose first love is baseball also has a contract 
running into 1993 costas would lose his latenight talk show and 
scheduled nba assignment if he left nbc 
another possibility is simply filling musburgers roles with 
other cbs announcers cbs sports president neal pilson wants to 
give younger cbs sportscasters such as jim nantz greg gumbel and 
james brown expanded duties at the network

i rely every day on the security of a gti 
vest says oliver l north in a catalogue promoting his own line 
of body armor more popularly known as bulletproof vests 
north the linchpin of the irancontra affair has gone into 
business with another key figure in the scandal former cia station 
chief joseph fernandez 
the pair fired from their government jobs are the sole 
proprietors of guardian technologies international which will 
manufacture lightweight vests 
there is no other partner fernandez said its our idea 
our money and our effort ollie north is the chairman and im the 
president of the company 
guardian will use a material called spectra made by aerospace 
manufacturer alliedsignal corp fernandez contended it is lighter 
than other material used in vests and therefore more likely to be 
worn by police officers who dont like body armor because it is too 
bulky 
we are looking ahead for our future fernandez said 
obviously with our experience and background we feel 
comfortable dealing with americas law enforcement community 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel was convicted last 
year of three felony counts stemming from his role as a white house 
aide helping the nicaraguan contra rebels he was assessed no jail 
time and has been out on the lecture circuit with speech fees of 
25000 
fernandez once cia station chief in costa rica was charged 
with obstructing inquiries into the irancontra affair by the cia 
inspector general and the tower commission but the indictment was 
dismissed after attorney general dick thornburgh refused to release 
classified information 
gtis eightpage fullcolor brochure shows vests worn under 
shirts over shirts as safari jackets and rain coats and the 
outfits worn by swat teams one of the models was norths bodyguard 
during his trial last year and on his speechmaking trips around the 
country 
a subcontractor will turn out the garments until the 
northfernandez firm has its own production facilities fernandez 
said 
we have an affinity for americas law enforcement officers and 
whenever ollie travels around the country he had the good fortune 
to meet many of these officers fernandez said the growing 
risk we see on the streets today as a result of drug trafficking 
and violent crimes just made it a natural area we want to work in

monday when the dynamite charge was set off by remote control the 
officials said 
eight victims were private guards hired to protect the mines and 
the ninth was a driver they said 
the attack comes as the maoistinspired shining path guerrillas 
step up bombings and assassinations in an effort to thwart sundays 
general elections

with a special dye to prevent vote fraud the shining path has 
threatened anyone wh casts a ballot sunday

republicans are expressing confidence that 
labor lawyer t timothy ryan jr will win senate approval to run 
the savings and loan bailout despite disclosures that he used 
marijuana and cocaine in the 1970s 
in my view the nominee will be confirmed senate gop leader 
bob dole of kansas said monday after huddling over the weekend with 
treasury secretary nicholas brady on salvaging president bushs 
nomination of ryan to head the office of thrift supervision 
ryan 44 who was the labor departments chief legal officer in 
the first two years of the reagan administration barely survived a 
1110 vote last friday in the senate banking committee where 
democrats sharply criticized his lack of knowledge and experience 
on thrifts and banking 
just hours later nbc news disclosed that ryan had admitted to 
the fbi and bush administration officials that he had occasionally 
used marijuana and tried cocaine once perhaps twice in the 
1970s 
i would hope that the nomination of mr ryan will be acted on 
this week dole said referring to estimates that savings and 
loans losses are continuing to drain the treasury of 20 million to 
30 million weekly 
banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich a 
chief opponent of ryans nomination also called for a speedy vote 
riegle had predicted his panel would vote down the nomination but 
that was before the administration launched a lobbying blitz on 
ryans behalf 
mr ryan clearly lacks the necessary professional 
qualifications for what is the single most complex and important 
financial job in our country today riegle said hundreds of 
billions of dollars are at stake 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine would not 
venture a guess monday how the substance abuse issue will affect 
the vote 
thats a matter for each senator mitchell said i think 
there is widespread concern about the thoroughness of his 
qualifications for such an important job 
sen john warner rva said ryans admission that he dabbled 
in drugs should be placed in its proper historical context of the 
vietnam war era 
warner said ryan made a mistake in trying drugs but added no 
matter how serious the mistake was it seems to me that that 
generation was subjected to a most unusual period of history and as 
such we should examine each case individually today 
but rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
committees financial institutions subcommittee questioned ryans 
suitability for the job in light of the drug disclosure 
the man admitted he was on cocaine he admitted he was on 
marijuana annunzio said whats that say to children youre 
telling to just say no he sure puts a crimp on the war on 
drugs 
the senate banking committee had access to the fbi files but 
ryans acknowledged drug use never arose during his confirmation 
hearings

the bush administration is standing firm in 
its prohibition against federal fetal tissue research because it 
believes the research would bring increased abortions a government 
health official says 
dr james o mason assistant secretary for health in the 
department of health and human services defended the ban before a 
house subcommittee on monday and said it would remain in place 
until he saw evidence the research would not increase abortions 
researchers say the use of fetal cells has the potential to help 
patients suffering alzheimers parkinsons and huntingtons 
diseases as well as paralysis diabetes and other illnesses but 
the research is opposed by abortion opponents 
mason said the possibility an aborted fetus could have medical 
benefits for others would provide a powerful inducement and an 
additional rationalization for a woman agonizing over whether 
to abort her pregnancy 
the result he said would be to tilt some already vulnerable 
women toward a decision to have an abortion 
mason commented under sharp questioning by rep henry waxman 
dcalif at a hearing of the health subcommittee that waxman 
chairs 
the ban prohibits federal funding to research the implantation 
of fetal cells into humans private research continues waxman said 
he said the administrations order was a result of misplaced 
allegiance to the most extreme elements of the antiabortion 
movement 
this is wrong scientifically and ethically waxman argued

president bush can shift money to military 
personnel accounts to avoid laying off troops but it must come 
from the strategic defense initiative the b2 bomber or two other 
prized weapons programs the chairman of the house armed services 
committee says 
it must be clearly established that military people are a 
higher priority than hardware rep les aspin dwis said 
monday in a letter to defense secretary dick cheney 
aspin said he does not oppose some relief for our men and 
women in uniform but that the source of the money must be several 
of the administrations prized strategic weapons 
funds for any reprogramming relief for fiscal year 1990 must 
come from four of the favored weapons programs that were earlier 
spared larger cuts sdi b2 ssn21 attack submarine and the 
armys light helicopter program the chairman said 
in addition aspin is seeking public assurances from cheney and 
white house budget chief richard darman that the attempt to shift 
funds to avoid the impact of the grammrudman budgetcutting law 
wont happen again 
meanwhile a pentagon source said monday that cheney is 
determined to find money to cover the personnel expenses even if 
he has to shift funds from other accounts without congressional 
approval 
the defense secretary has legal authority to shift up to 3 
billion among accounts without specific approval from capitol hill 
but such a step might anger lawmakers since such transfers are 
supposed to cover only unexpected shortfalls 
the source expressed confidence that an agreement would be 
worked out by the end of the week when congress leaves for its 
easter recess 
aspin and several lawmakers planned to meet with cheney today to 
discuss the issue 
aspin had blocked bushs attempt to transfer 852 million from 
several pentagon accounts to military personnel to avoid massive 
layoffs 
the president had the option last august to exempt personnel 
accounts from the grammrudman law but pentagon officials 
testified recently that they did not urge him to exclude those 
accounts on the assumption that congress would agree to the 
transfer 
four congressional committees are required to approve such a 
shift in defense funds and aspin declined to bring the issue up in 
his committee 
i objected to your fiscal year 1990 reprogramming requests for 
personnel because they represented an attempt to ease the pain of 
grammrudman on the pentagon but nowhere else aspin said in 
his letter to cheney that was and is unacceptable

americans are smoking less than any time since 
1942 
the agriculture department says cigarette use dropped 5 percent 
in 1989 the largest decline in six years and the trend is 
expected to continue 
overall american smokers consumed about 533 billion cigarettes 
last year the departments economic research service said monday 
exports however jumped 20 percent to 142 billion cigarettes 
annual use by the us adult population dropped 7 percent to an 
average of 2888 cigarettes the report said economist verner 
grise said that was the lowest average since 1942 when the average 
was 2585 cigarettes per adult 
the peak was 4345 cigarettes in 1963 before beginning its 
longtime decline 
the average is for all americans 18 years and older smokers and 
nonsmokers alike it is a statistical comparison only and does not 
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population 
domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall 
this year because of higher prices increased restrictions on where 
people can smoke antismoking activity and declining social 
acceptance of smoking the report said 
meanwhile the report said total us tobacco output could 
increase substantially this year perhaps by 8 percent over the 
1989 crop of 14 billion pounds however smaller onhand 
inventories will reduce total supplies for 199091

the senate is on the verge of approving 
stricter air pollution controls for the first time in a decade 
while a house committee reports progress in crafting its own 
version 
the senate planned today to move through a remaining string of 
amendments under an 8 pm edt deadline for a final vote on the 
pollution control package 
the clean air bill has dominated the senates agenda since 
january it is the product of three weeks of closeddoor 
negotiations with the white house and then lengthy debate and 
tradeoffs on the senate floor and in negotiations among senators 
across the capitol the house energy and commerce committee was 
expected to move a step closer toward approving clean air 
legislation with a scheduled vote on a newly reached compromise 
over regulating toxic air pollutants 
the panels chairman rep john dingell dmich said he hoped 
the bill would be ready for a final vote in the committee later 
this week before congress takes its easter recess the measure 
would go to the house floor in may 
both the senate and house bills represent the first toughening 
of federal air pollution controls in 13 years the federal clean 
air act enacted in 1970 was last revised in 1977 although 
environmentalists and many federal pollution control officials for 
years have acknowledged serious shortcomings in the law 
the bills impose new pollution controls on industry automobiles 
and electric power plants and have been estimated to cost the 
economy 21 billion a year 
the compromise reached monday in the energy and commerce 
committee by dingell and other key members of both parties involved 
a provision that covers releases of toxic chemicals including 
cancercausing substances from industrial sources 
as part of the agreement the legislation would require more 
than 90 percent of industrial polluters to install maximum 
available technology to control toxic chemicals the bill 
originally covered only 50 percent of the polluters exempting many 
of the smaller sources 
but in return attempts were abandoned to require a secondstage 
healthbased standard that has been strongly opposed by 
industry 
that socalled residual risk provision which some committee 
members had wanted would have required industrial plants to meet 
minimum cancer risk standards based on exposure to nearby residents 
no matter what technological controls are being used by the 
polluter if the standard could not be met a plant would have to be 
shut down 
the decision was not to fight about the residual risk issue 
now as long as we are getting the best reductions of toxic 
chemicals up front said rep henry waxman dcalif who has 
pushed for strong toxic control provisions in the bill 
its the best we can get right now added rep bill 
richardson dnm who had been preparing an amendment for a 
healthbased requirement im willing to forgo residual risk in 
exchange for tighter stricter standards up front 
under the compromise the environmental protection agency still 
would be required to assess in the year 2000 whether additional 
controls are required and could impose additional standards if 
there is not an ample margin of safety from cancercausing 
pollutants

some foreign fruit and vegetable producers try 
to conform with us bans on certain pesticides but others often 
are unaware of restrictions according to a report to congress 
the general accounting office said monday it found that each of 
five countries checked has laws and regulations controlling 
pesticide availability and use by their own producers however 
those laws and regulations often dont mesh with us standards 
latin american and caribbean countries supply most of the fruits 
and vegetables imported by the united states in 1988 those 
totaled 55 million metric tons or 77 percent of total imports 
the five countries checked by gao the investigative arm of 
congress were chile costa rica dominican republic guatemala and 
mexico which accounted for more than half the 1988 produce imports 
exporters and producers in some of the countries try to use 
practices that take us pesticide restrictions into consideration 
the report said the gao found this to be done by multinational 
firms in all five countries and by other growers in chile and 
mexico 
where us requirements were not specifically considered in 
selecting pesticides for use on exports particularly among the 
less experienced growers in costa rica the dominican republic and 
guatemala growers had not developed networks for obtaining 
information on their export markets pesticide requirements the 
report said 
the gao was asked to look into efforts being made by foreign 
governments and private industries to ensure imported fresh produce 
meets us safety requirements 
the report was requested by reps leon panetta dcalif and 
frank horton rny 
efforts are being made in the current uruguay round of trade 
negotiations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade to 
harmonize food safety and sanitary requirements including 
pesticide residue standards 
the gao said the five countries like the united states have 
not designed their food safety and quality systems to meet the 
import requirements of other countries 
however the report said some of the countries limit the legal 
availability of pesticides that are also not allowed in the united 
states and help to increase the likelihood that exports to the 
united states will not contain residues of those chemicals 
for example the five governments had prohibited or not 
registered from 81 percent to 94 percent of 52 pesticides whose 
registration the environmental protection agency had canceled or 
suspended as of oct 25 1988 including 26 whose registrations had 
been voluntarily canceled by manufacturers the report said 
gao also identified 110 pesticides registered for use in one or 
more of the five countries that do not have epa tolerances 
established for food use in the united states in some cases epa 
may not have evaluated the pesticides or may have denied a us 
tolerance or registration 
registering pesticides that do not have us registrations or 
epa tolerances may be appropriate in a country because of its 
specific pest problems crops and climate because the pesticides 
are suitable for nonfood uses or because exporters need 
alternative pesticides to be legally available to meet their export 
markets differing requirements the gao said 
even so a pesticide permitted in a foreign country could result 
in that countrys produce being refused us entry if residues are 
detected by the food and drug administration the report said

when the buffalo ny transit system came to 
a halt the squeal of its brakes was a familiar sound to public 
transportation officials in youngstown ohio and birmingham ala 
in 1981 those two cities saw their federally subsidized bus 
systems fail because they were unable to raise local taxes 
the two systems did rise and roll again youngstown got an 
advance on its state funding to tide it over until the levy passed 
birmingham was revived by a beer tax so reports of the death of 
the niagara frontier transportation authority in buffalo may be 
premature 
yet transit experts predict that the inherent problem a 
shortage of mass transportation funding at the federal state and 
local levels will recur 
arlee reno transportation director of the urban institute a 
washingtonbased think tank said monday it is likely that a 
solution will be found to buffalos problems but fares may go up 
while ridership declines 
it might be a situation where everybody has to compromise more 
than they want reno said 
buffalo is an example of a local community that is 
hardpressed to come up with the dollars necessary said charles 
bishop spokesman for the american public transit association 
and it may indicate thatnow is not the time to be turning to 
local governments for more 
last month president bush and transportation secretary samuel 
skinner announced a federal transportation policy that continues a 
decadelong effort to shift to state and local governments the 
burden of paying for mass transit 
but deep federal cuts throughout the 1980s have left mass 
transit in a state of continuous fiscal crisis particularly in the 
northeast reno said 
in a lot of places weve seen deterioration of the 
infrastructure and in some places instead of that happening we 
simply run out of operating money he added that appears to 
have happened in buffalo 
buffalos system reached a crisis on monday because erie county 
legislators failed to find a source of transit funding as they 
agreed to more than two years ago 
but the citys problems have been exacerbated by economic 
difficulties in the region declining population and the general 
trend of shrinking ridership for large eastern cities reno noted 
the niagara frontier transportation authority faces a 156 
million budget gap this year the deficit is monumental compared 
with those that temporarily shut down mass transit in youngstown 
and birmingham 
the birmingham bus system closed in march 1981 because of rising 
costs declining ridership and a projected deficit of 800000 at 
the time the system served 11000 riders making about 30000 
trips a day but the alabama legislature refused to pass an 
emergency funding measure and the buses stopped running 
the system remained shut until june 1981 said jerome c 
beasley general manager of the birminghamjefferson transit 
authority 
but the fight is never over beasley said every two or 
three years we go through these problems 
beasley said a bill in the legislature would provide 5 million 
for mass transit throughout the state at least thats a foot in 
the door he said right now the state gives no money at all 
youngstown was left without bus service in november 1981 when 
voters rejected a proposed tax that would have raised about 1 
million at the time the western reserve transit authority faced a 
15 million deficit it served 5000 daily riders including 2900 
public school students 
the ohio city got a reprieve when the governor stepped in and 
advanced the authority its 1982 state funding said jim ferraro 
agency executive director that enabled the bus system to reopen in 
a month and run until a twomill property tax assessment was 
passed he said 
but the assessment has to be periodically reauthorized and it 
doesnt always pass on the first try ferraro said 
in addition he said the amount of the assessment has dropped 
as property values plummeted and its value declined as the cost of 
living rose

a new survey suggests only 38 percent of 
eighth graders know congress makes laws more than half dont know 
the meaning of separation of powers and barely half know the united 
states is a representative democracy 
ina vs mullis of the educational testing service outlined 
those and other examples monday to show the significant gaps in 
knowledge american students have in history and civics 
ms mullis helped conduct the first surveys of achievement in 
history and civics at grades four eight and 12 for the national 
assessment of educational progress popularly known as the nations 
report card 
the key result of the 1988 assessments which coincided with the 
bicentennial of the writing of the us constitution was that 
american students have basic facts and skills in history and civics 
but cannot apply what theyve learned to draw conclusions and 
demonstrate understanding 
the assessment seems to show a trivial pursuit sort of 
familiarity with some of the key figures and dramatic events of our 
past but even on this level the gaps are wide said richard 
riley former governor of south carolina and a member of the 
assessment governing board 
mary frances berry a history professor at the university of 
pennsylvania and member of the us civil rights commission said 
the assessment gives us fresh evidence for despair 
if the report is accurate our high school graduates on 
the whole lack the kind of understanding of the nations heritage 
that is necessary to be an informed citizen in a democracy she 
said 
key findings were 
most fourth graders knew why thanksgiving and july 4 are 
celebrated but only 36 percent knew why columbus sailed to america 
more than threefourths of eighth graders could identify the 
rev martin luther kings i have a dream speech but fewer than 
half knew he advocated nonviolence 
in both 1986 and 1988 11th graders correctly answered only 55 
percent of history questions scores improved however on 
questions about exploration and colonization and the rise of 
modern america and world war i 
nearly onethird of eighth graders and almost half the high 
school seniors didnt recognize the presidential veto 
congressional veto override and supreme court decisions as examples 
of the federal system of checks and balances 
the ets evaluated the history achievement of 16000 students and 
the civics achievement of 11000 other students the tests were 
graded on a scale of 0 to 500 
ms mullis said there was a vast gap between the performance of 
students attending schools in rich and poor urban neighborhoods 
for example about twothirds of the eighth graders performed at 
or above level 250 which reflected knowledge of a variety of 
historical figures events and terms 
however although 80 percent of the eighth graders from 
higherincome neighborhoods attained that level fewer than half 
the disadvantaged eighth graders did

reports of child abuse and neglect rose 9 
percent last year the largest increase since 1985 says the 
national committee for prevention of child abuse 
the survey released monday found that 24 million reports of 
child abuse and neglect were recorded in 1989 by state child 
welfare agencies including at least 1237 child abuseabuse 
related deaths 
ann cohn executive director of the abuse prevention committee 
said the growing problem of drug and alcohol abuse figures 
prominently the increase along with social problems such as 
poverty and homelessness 
but she said some of the increase was due to state changes in 
the definitions of child abuse and in their reporting systems 
the 24 million reports last year compared with 22 million in 
1988 
most of the abuse occurs in the home according to the survey 
the group also concluded based on a nationwide telephone 
survey that fewer parents are disciplining their children with 
insults swearing or spankings 
the telephone poll of 460 randomly selected parents found that 
the proportion who said they had not used swearing or insults as 
discipline in the previous year rose from 45 percent in 1988 to 60 
percent this year 
it also found that those who said they never spanked or hit 
their children grew from 36 percent in 1988 to 49 percent this year 
the proportion who said they often swore or used insults to 
discipline their children went from 2 percent in 1988 to 3 percent 
this year and the group that said they often hit their children 
went from 4 percent to 5 percent 
the survey conducted by schumlan ronca and bucuvalas inc of 
new york has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage 
points

depression said rep jose serra of the centerleft brazilian 
social democratic party 
collor de mello passed the measures by decree on march 16 the 
day after he took office as the countrys first popularly elected 
president in 29 years 
they became law immediately but can be voted down by congress 
within 30 days legislators were to begin voting on the plan monday 
but failed to obtain a quorum congressional leaders said they 
would try again today 
the economic measures designed to halt record 4000 annual 
inflation includes a 30day price freeze a new national currency 
and drastic government spending cuts 
the package also contains an 18month freeze on assets of more 
than 1200 in private savings accounts and 600 in money market 
funds 
the freeze withdrew about 115 billion from circulation or 80 
percent of bank deposits and led to a brutal drop in consumer 
spending 
restaurants movie theaters and shops have seen a radical drop 
in business 
i havent gone out to eat or to a bar since the plan was 
announced ive cut out all expenses that arent absolutely 
necessary said saulo de oliveira a 36yearold businessmen 
even rios illegal but widely tolerated numbers racket known as 
the animal game has reported a drop of 50 percent in receipts 
the game conducted on street corners is popular among brazils 
working class 
while early opinion polls showed as much as 87 percent of the 
public backed the plan in recent days grumbling has increased 
especially from those who saw their money confiscated 
for the love of god liberate my miserable money brasilia 
housewife maria laila reportedly wrote to economic minister zelia 
cardoso de mello 
on the other end of the spectrum antonio ermirio de moraes one 
of brazils leading businessmen saw 500 million caught in the 
bank freeze an obviously distraught de moraes recently told a tv 
talk show host he had considered leaving the country to start life 
anew overseas 
a joke now making the rounds is that collors measures have made 
businessmen sleep like babies one hour of sleep and two hours of 
crying one hour of sleep and two hours of crying 
because of the freeze on accounts businesses are having a hard 
time paying march salaries subsidiaries of some foreign companies 
such as general motors and nestle had to borrow money from banks to 
pay workers 
but many observers say that if companies dont pay their workers 
soon strikes will break out 
well invade the banks if money for salaries is not freed 
said vicente paula da silva president of the sao paulo 
metalworkers union 
it wont help because the banks dont have money replied 
leo cochrane jr head of the brazilian banking federation 
but while much of brazil struggles to stay afloat one sector on 
the upswing is the spiritual 
the folha de sao paulo newspaper reported city churches have 
seen especially heavy traffic the past several weeks worshippers 
have packed the church of saint judas tadeu the patron saint of 
lost causes 
everyone from shantytown residents to big businesmen dont 
believe in anything anymore and are seeking the protection of the 
saint rev odilo hoepers told the newspaper

outgoing president daniel ortega 
says a twoday summit with four other central american leaders in 
this new beach resort will bring good news for regional peace 
the top item on the agenda was demobilizing the usbacked 
contras who have waged a 10year war against nicaraguas leftist 
sandinistas who were voted out of office in february 
as the meeting began monday president rafael leonardo callejas 
of honduras said the contras top military commander had agreed to 
disband the forces before nicaraguas new government takes office 
on april 25 
in another development leftist salvadoran guerrillas and that 
countrys rightist government agreed to meet wednesday in geneva to 
renew talks under the mediation of un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar 
ortega said talks at the first session were wideranging and 
very good there was ample discussion about the demobilization of 
the contras and the democratization of el salvador and guatemala 
he refused to go into details 
i believe that tomorrow we will have an excellent declaration 
to make to the peoples of central america who want peace ortega 
said 
also at the summit were presidents alfredo cristiani of el 
salvador vinicio cerezo of guatemala and oscar arias of costa rica 
arias won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for working out the 
first of a series of central american peace accords aimed at ending 
civil wars in the region he will leave office on may 8 turning 
over the presidency of central americas most stable democracy to 
rafael angel calderon he was barred by his countrys constitution 
from running for reelection in the february vote 
on monday arias mirrored ortegas enthusiasm i am very 
optimistic we will have a magnificent declaration to make that will 
benefit the peoples of the region 
a point of deadlock has been the demobilization of the contras 
inside nicaragua and in base camps in neighboring honduras before 
ortega turns over power to violeta barrios de chamorro 
ortega has indicated reluctance to hand over the military and 
police while the rebels are still active 
in an accord march 23 with representatives of mrs chamorro a 
contra commander agreed to demobilize but deep divisions remain in 
the rebel ranks with many rankandfile fighters saying they wont 
lay down their arms soon 
but callejas said top rebel commander israel galeano also known 
as commander franklyn had assured him the contras would disband by 
the time chamorro is sworn in 
there have been doubts about the viability of the march accord 
because galeano did not sign it and thousands of contras have since 
returned from honduras to nicaragua with their guns 
a contra spokesman in tegucigalpa the honduran capital 
announced late monday that the rebels inside honduras would 
surrender their weapons april 18 to a un peacekeeping force at 
the border town of yamales 
those inside nicaragua are expected to gather in previously 
determined security zones and do the same around that date 
in an open letter to the summit salvadoran guerrillas proposed 
a plebiscite on constitutional reform to reduce the armed forces 
purge the military of rightwing elements and subject it to 
civilian authority 
the letter proposed the plebiscite be held jointly with the 1991 
elections for a new national assembly it also proposed the 
60member legislature be expanded and the elections and plebiscite 
be held without any military presence and monitored by 
international observers 
the letter said that if an agreement is reached the rebels 
will turn into peaceful political parties 
the letter has positive aspects that we should take into 
account all this will be discussed by our representatives with 
those of the front in geneva cristiani said 
the last peace talks on ending el salvadors decadeold civil 
war which has claimed 72000 lives were suspended in november

mcdonalds which years ago was challenged 
on the weight of its quarterpounder is facing a dressingdown for 
the way it sells salad 
the city wants mcdonalds to tell customers how much their 
salads weigh 
its as ridiculous as it sounds mcdonalds lawyer arthur 
makadon said monday its a question of bureaucracy taking 
consumerism way beyond anything that was intended by policy or 
law 
this weighty matter has reached the courts as the city tries to 
enforce pennsylvanias weights and measures act of 1965 
the city requires of any food vendor that sells food in a 
package that it inform the customer what the customer is paying 
for said andrew p bralow chief deputy of the city solicitors 
enforcement division 
that just toasts mcdonalds croutons 
its in a transparent container you see what youre 
getting makadon said 
but the city thinks this is a good time great case to prove its 
point that the containers must be marked by weight 
last week common pleas judge nicholas m dalessandro ruled 
that mcdonalds must post the weights on its menu board 
mcdonalds refusing to wilt asked him to reconsider 
were saying first the law doesnt apply to restaurants 
makadon said secondly it does not apply where you customarily 
buy something by count one salad or two salads 
when mcdonalds introduced its quarterpounder in the 1970s 
someone pointed out that it didnt weigh a quarter pound when 
served mcdonalds now notes that the burger weighs a quarter pound 
before cooking 
the state has issued similar warnings to mcdonalds wendys and 
burger king restaurants in allentown bethlehem and easton 
we havent pursued them further until we get a precedent in 
the philadelphia case said fred yahner director of the state 
weights and measures bureau 
one of the basic rules of weights and measures is that 
products like these should be sold by weight we cant make 
exceptions

a judge ruled attorney general john van de 
kamp may use san francisco chronicle articles in a tv commercial 
for his gubernatorial campaign despite the papers objection that 
such use implied an endorsement 
us district judge john vukasin on monday denied a chronicle 
request to bar use of the newspapers name in the commercial 
i suspect it the ad comes dangerously close to creating a 
false impression that that is the chronicle speaking vukasian 
said 
but he said the van de kamp campaign properly identified itself 
as the sponsor of the commercial and was clearly quoting the 
chronicle as a source of information 
neil shapiro a lawyer for the chronicle said the newspaper 
still may sue for damages 
the ad first shown two weeks ago attacks former san francisco 
mayor dianne feinstein van de kamps rival for the democratic 
nomination over her management of the city each subject is 
illustrated by a chronicle clipping about a controversy the 
papers name appears several times at the bottom of the screen 
the chronicle sued last week to stop the use of its name and 
masthead saying the ad violated the newspapers trademark and was 
meant to mislead 
if we wish to endorse someone we will but we dont want 
somebody stealing the endorsement shapiro told the judge 
saying some angry readers had telephoned the paper to complain 
about its apparent endorsement the lawyer declared that the ad 
confuses people into believing the chronicle supports endorses 
or even prepared it 
but kantor said van de kamp had an obligation as well as a 
constitutional right to quote the chronicle as the source of 
material in his commercial 
he also said the ad would be protected by freedom of speech even 
if it was misleading 
vukasin did not mention constitutional protections in his 
ruling saying only the ad properly identified its sponsorship 
mickey kantor a lawyer for van de kamp said the commercials 
run was due to end monday

the us embassy said today an 
american linked in testimony to the december coup attempt works for 
the us air force but denies involvement in the bid to topple 
president corazon aquino 
brig gen alejandro galido who the government says infiltrated 
the coup plotters ranks told investigators that harold maglio of 
wrightwood city calif offered to sell weapons to mrs aquinos 
opponents a year ago 
galido says maglio had identified himself as a us air force 
colonel assigned to the defense intelligence agency 
in a statement today the embassy said maglio was a civilian 
quality assurance manager at norton air force base near san 
bernadino calif and that he met with galido during a private 
visit here last year 
mr maglio has never had any connection with the defense 
intelligence agency nor was he ever a colonel in the us air 
force the statement said 
he has no responsibility for policy intelligence or political 
matters within the us government and his work does not involve 
the philippines the embassy said 
after the statement was released presidential press secretary 
tomas gomez said he would not rule out the possibility that maglio 
was an american agent but said he believed the american was 
either a fake or a con man 
i am not discounting that gomez said but it is easier to 
believe that he is just a con man taking advantage of the 
situation we are not giving importance to that issue 
in its statement the embassy said us law enforcement agencies 
investigated maglio at the request of filipino authorities and 
there was no indication mr maglio was actively involved in any 
coup planning or otherwise seeking to destabilize the philippine 
government 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa told reporters 
today the government was aware of maglios activities de villa 
stood by galidos statement and said it was up to our civilian 
superiors to decide whether to take legal action against maglio 
the government has claimed galido was a deep penetration 
agent who infiltrated ranks of military dissidents who launched a 
nineday coup attempt dec 1 in which at least 113 people were 
killed and 600 wounded 
in testimony given jan 23 and released by the department of 
justice last month galido said maglio offered weapons in return 
for 20 million there was no indication the deal was completed 
we were able to talk with an american introduced to me as col 
harold maglio us air force who claimed to be a member of the 
united states defense intelligence agency galido said 
galido quoted maglio as saying he was the dias representative 
in the philippines and favors the overthrow of the aquino 
government 
according to galido maglio claimed links to us ambassador 
nicholas platt and offered to telephone the embassy to authenticate 
his claims platt denies knowing maglio 
galido quoted maglio as saying that their group can promise to 
deliver to our forces if we move against the government shipments 
of firearms ammunition antitank missiles antihelicopter 
missiles and other armaments we will need for the government 
takeover 
us jets flew air cover for government forces during the coup 
attempt embassy spokeswoman victoria middleton said us officials 
were cooperating with filipino authorities in the maglio affair 
galidos testimony has led to charges that washington secretly 
supported the december coup attempt and then doublecrossed the 
mutineers to make the government beholden to the americans 
the united states government does not support any activity 
aimed at destabilizing the philippine government the embassy 
said any representation that there is such official support is 
false 
last week the majority leader of the philippine senate 
teofisto guingona urged the united states to make a full 
disclosure about maglio before talks begin on extending the lease 
on six us military bases in the philippines 
the lease expires in september 1991 and the talks are expected 
to begin next month

the cost of health insurance

a guide who helped lead a deadly climb of 
mount hood said the expedition likely would have ended safely if 
only it had been abandoned sooner in the face of a gathering storm 
ralph summers testified monday in a lawsuit brought by richard 
haeder whose 16yearold son was one of nine people to die in a 
blizzard during the oregon episcopal school trek in may 1986 
haeder has sued the oregon episcopal school and summers a 
parttime assistant for at least 860000 in damages he alleged 
negligence in the planning and carrying out of the climb that led 
to the freezing deaths of seven students and two adults 
summers 34 said all of the group members probably would have 
survived had they stopped climbing and turned around at the 
hogsback area near the summit of the 11237foot peak the 
secondmost climbed mountain in the world behind mount fuji 
instead the group of climbers continued its efforts to reach 
the summit in deteriorating weather and by the time it turned 
around a powerful snowstorm was lashing the mountain he testified 
the weather was worse on the descent summers testified 
the wind was much stronger it was easy to fall over and not know 
if it was because of the terrain or the wind 
the rev thomas goman was leading the climb but summers said he 
takes responsibility for all of the major decisions on the 
expedition he said he and goman had an agreement that if the two 
differed on a question they would follow the more conservative 
approach 
summers said that as the group continued its descent the storm 
grew worse and he and goman decided to build a snow cave to wait 
out the blizzard 
there was a crevasse on one side a drop off on another it 
was dusk and you couldnt navigate he said the decision to 
dig in was pretty easy 
the 13member party crawled into the snow cave and spent a 
harrowing night marked by panic among people who feared they would 
suffocate molly schula 21 one of the survivors of the climb 
testified monday in multnomah county circuit court 
everybody was panicking about air schula said 
another survivor brinton clark 19 testified that as the 
opening of the cave grew narrower as snow built up throughout the 
night many of those inside became convinced they would die 
the next morning summers decided to get help and schula 
volunteered to accompany him 
she said she owes her life to summers 
i said ill go if youll take me she said i couldnt 
have made it down without him 
they made it to safety but the cave wasnt marked and summers 
couldnt find it again once he reached help 
it took rescuers three days to find the cave by then all 
inside were dead except for clark and fellow oregon episcopal 
school student giles thompson

greeks will vote again sunday for the 
third time in a year in hopes of breaking a political deadlock 
that has created compromise governments unable to confront an 
economy in crisis and growing terrorism 
pollsters predict the election will end like those in june and 
november 1989 with no party winning enough seats to control the 
government 
coalitions formed after last years elections took no effective 
action on foreign domestic or economic policy the european 
community has said greece is in danger of bankruptcy and the ec 
will not bail it out because greece violated austerity requirements 
of a 1985 loan 
some greek officials and economists fear the nation may have to 
surrender some of its economic sovereignty and seek help for the 
first time from the international monetary fund 
without a strong government we are heading for economic 
disaster said stelios argyros president of the federation of 
greek industries he said greece needs a government that can make 
the unpopular decisions required 
the political stalemate began after 15 years of stable 
government which followed seven years of military dictatorship 
that ended in 1974 
in june 1989 the conservative new democracy party and 
communists united to oust premier andreas papandreous socialists 
from eight years in power 
a brief coalition of the unlikely allies presided over the 
indictments of papandreou and several of his ministers on 
corruption charges stemming from banking and wiretapping scandals 
no trial dates have been set 
another coalition formed after the november election was unable 
to stem a resurgence of terrorism end labor unrest or resolve the 
problems of rising tensions with turkey and albania rivals of long 
standing 
neither coalition was willing to negotiate a new military bases 
agreement with the united states or answer the us extradition 
request for mohammed rashid a palestinian wanted for the 1982 
bombing of a pan am jetliner that killed one person 
washington later simplified the bases problem by deciding to 
close two of the four 
recent acts of terror have included firebombings by anarchists 
and political killings and bombings by established terror groups 
today at least five bombs exploded in athens and salonica 
ripping through a government building as well as the offices of 
business groups and labor unions police said no injuries were 
reported and that anonymous callers claimed responsibility on 
behalf of two urban guerrilla groups 
november 17th a leftist group claimed responsibility for the 
september murder of conservative lawmaker pavlos bakonvannis 
soninlaw of new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis 
social resistance claimed responsibility for bombings last week 
that destroyed cars of foreign diplomats but caused no injuries 
the coalition government of new democracy communists and 
socialists collapsed in february because of traditional hostilities 
among them 
some political scientists citing generally low turnouts at 
rallies say voters appear indifferent to the current campaign 
voters are apathetic now because they think politicians are 
incapable said one dimitrios katsoudas director of studies at 
the center for political research and information they have lost 
faith in the values of parties and how the political system works 
miltiades evert a conservative former finance minister said 
greece must make headway on its economic problems by the fall or 
turn for help to the international monetary fund which often 
demands austerity in exchange for its aid 
we wont have a greek government well have a foreign 
government he said in an interview the administration will be 
an executive arm of the imf 
inflation is the european community highest 148 percent last 
year and expected to reach 17 percent in 1990 this years budget 
deficit is expected to be 25 trillion drachmas 156 billion 
mihalis hadzipavlou director in athens for the international 
accounting firm of touche ross said foreign investors have not 
rejected greece outright but are slowing investments because of 
the uncertainty 
zenophon zolotas the caretaker premier has said greece needs 
strong clear leadership to restore investor confidence 
if a climate of certainty confidence and above all 
credibility is created then we could be rid of the nightmare in 
1991 he said

communist party chief jiang zemin was named to a 
top military post today giving him one more rung in his tenuous 
climb to power 
the national peoples congress as expected picked jiang as new 
chairman of the state central military commission replacing senior 
leader deng xiaoping the congress chinas parliament last week 
accepted dengs resignation from his last official government post 
jiang the only candidate received 2682 votes in his favor and 
10 votes against him there were 26 abstentions one deputy wrote 
in dengs name and another entered the name of president yang 
shangkun a general with a strong following in the military 
jiang dengs handpicked successor in november succeeded deng 
as head of the party central military commission a key 
policymaking body with nearly the same membership as the state 
group 
the military has played an increasingly important political role 
in china since it was called in to crush the prodemocracy movement 
in beijing last june and jiangs appointment to the two posts is 
crucial to his staying power as a leader 
jiang a relatively unknown party boss in shanghai was named to 
head the 48millionmember communist party last june after zhao 
ziyang was purged for allegedly supporting the prodemocracy 
movement 
jiang 63 has no political power base in beijing and since june 
has loyally supported the hardline policies espoused by retired 
but stillpowerful party elders such as deng 
deng 85 still regarded as chinas most powerful man has 
declared that jiang is the core of nextgeneration leaders and 
has asked the military to give him their full support 
jiang has no experience in military affairs and the peoples 
liberation army remains dominated by old revolutionaries such as 
president yang 82 a general who last november was named first 
vice chairman of the party central military commission 
during the votecounting today in the great hall of the people 
a crowd of deputies gathered around hu qili former member of the 
party politburo standing committee purged along with zhao last june 
for his prostudent leanings 
deputies extended warm greetings to hu asking for his signature 
and posing for pictures with him 
hu like zhao was stripped of all party posts in june but 
escaped official criticism and on a few occasions has been allowed 
to attend public functions 
zhao still a party member and a deputy to the congress has not 
been seen since he went to tiananmen square on may 19 for a tearful 
meeting with student hunger strikers

an arrest warrant was issued last year for the 
owner of the building that housed a club where 87 people died by 
fire but he never was arrested city records show

dilorenzo iii failed to appear for a hearing on fire code 
violations at the illegal social club the new york times reported 
in todays editions 
the warrant for dilorenzo who is an heir to one of the citys 
largest real estate fortunes was low priority and never was 
enforced police said 
we are interested in all warrants said lt raymond 
odonnell a police spokesman but we are more interested in 
going after the guy who has committed a murder over a guy who has 
violations in a building 
of 100000 yearly arrest warrants those for building code 
violations are among the lowest priority odonnell said 
the warrant for dilorenzo was issued feb 3 1989 by bronx 
criminal court judge james e robinson the violations listed in 
the warrant carried a fine of up to 5000 and 90 days in jail

an angry judge criticized police for bungling 
evidence in the raping of a central park jogger and ordered the 
trial indefinitely postponed of three teenagers charged in the 
case 
the judge granted on monday an adjournment that prosecutors had 
asked for while they await dna test results from a newly discovered 
semen stain on the victims sock 
state supreme court justice thomas galligan said he was very 
distressed that the sock had not been tested when the police 
department has had it for almost a year 
its the eve of the trial and its something that should have 
been done a long time ago he said 
it seems to me almost negligence on the part of the police 
jury selection was to begin april 16 for three of the six 
teenagers accused in the april 19 1989 gang rape and beating of 
a female jogger prosecutors said it would take six to 10 weeks for 
the fbi to complete dna testing on the stain 
galligan ordered the lawyers to return may 21 for an update 
the stain was found wednesday when an independent expert 
examined all the clothing said law enforcement sources who spoke 
on condition they not be identified 
the police lab apparently missed it because it was inside the 
joggers white cotton sock the sources said the independent 
expert found the stain because it had discolored with age they 
said 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer sent a 
handdelivered letter to the judge and defense lawyers thursday 
asking for the adjournment

voters have declared this university 
town a zone of reproductive freedom while making it a little 
less free for marijuana smokers 
ann arbor voters approved monday a token 5 fine on abortion 
should state or federal laws ever ban the procedure and boosted 
the citys 18yearold 5 marijuana possession penalty to 25 
both the doctor and the patient would be subject to the abortion 
fine 
the abortion proposal declaring ann arbor a zone of 
reproductive freedom passed 15698 to 8578 the marijuana 
measure passed 12901 to 11419 
sabra briere who gathered petitions in december to put the 
abortion issue on the ballot said the vote reaffirms ann arbors 
reputation as a prochoice city 
i think its marvelous proposal c won briere said once 
again it showed me that this is where i want to live and these are 
the people i want to live with im very proud of ann arbor 
i think its a very clear expression of ann arbor voters 
saying we trust our women to manage their own personal lives more 
than we trust the politicians in lansing said state sen lana 
pollack a democrat from ann arbor 
rae ann houbeck of right to life of washtenaw county said the 
measure would encourage back alley abortions 
the measure trivializes the life of the child and the trauma 
of the woman houbeck said 
the marijuana measure was put on the ballot by the city council 
the 5 fine for possession and sale of marijuana was adopted in 
1972 and reinstated through a voterinitiated city charter 
amendment in 1974 after republicans on the city council repealed it 
opponents of the fine said the minor penalty has created a 
perception of the city as being a haven for drugs the proposal to 
increase the fine to 25 was seen as a compromise between 
conservatives who wanted to treat marijuana possession as a 
criminal offense and those who wanted to retain the token fine 
state law for a first offense of possession of a small amount of 
marijuana carries a maximum penalty of a 100 fine and 90 days in 
jail

a state and cityfunded bailout put 
buffalos transit system back in operation this morning after a 
twoday shutdown that forced thousands of bus and subway riders to 
put on walking shoes or get a lift from friends 
the niagara frontier transportation authority voted unanimously 
monday night to restart service this morning after the bailout 
package was put together it includes a fare increase and taxes 
dedicated to transit 
after the vote nfta chairman robert d gioia pleaded with the 
systems 120000 riders we need you and we need you back 
immediately 
riders many of whom said they had stayed home during the 
shutdown were happy to oblige 
im relieved said accountant connie nicastro i probably 
would have been unemployed if i didnt make it back to work 
today 
people with low incomes need the subway agreed computer 
operator denise matthews i probably would have wound up on 
social services and had the state pay for my living if the 
shutdown had continued 
the transit system consisting of a sixmile subway line and 
1015 miles of bus routes ran out of cash and shut down sunday 
its crisis blamed on rising operating costs falling federal 
subsidies and the erie county legislatures refusal as recently as 
four days earlier to agree on a tax dedicated to the system 
on monday commuters bicycled or walked to work through rain and 
fog or hitched rides with friends 
my sisterinlaw has this old junky piece of car and said we 
could use it if we could find out whats wrong with it said 
tequita craig a nurses aide we dished out 70 for a new 
battery 
everybody was walking together with sneakers on can you 
believe it said tennizee high who walked 1 hours to her job 
police said traffic was near normal and few businesses reported 
any serious absenteeism schools in new yorks secondlargest city 
remained open and buffalos 25000 elementary students rode private 
buses as usual 
but up to 60 percent of buffalos 11000 high school students 
missed classes and many commuters worried about the effects of a 
long shutdown 
its inconveniencing my mother to come down and pick me up 
said bank employee lisa cunningham i hated to ask her but what 
could i do i couldnt have walked 
parts of the bailout are subject to approval by the buffalo 
common council and the county legislature but council approval was 
expected and county lawmakers said they had commitments in writing 
from the 12 members needed to pass the package 
the bailout erased the last 37 million of a 156 million 
funding gap by a combination of accounting changes and grants of 1 
million from the city and 750000 from the state 
fares would rise from 1 to 110 and the county real estate 
transfer tax would more than double a move industry spokesman joe 
mcivor called grossly unfair next year the agency would begin 
receiving a share of county sales tax revenue 
gioia said the package means that buffalos system will for the 
first time be supported by taxes dedicated to it most public 
transportation systems including new york citys are funded that 
way 
we have been trying to find a dedicated stream of revenue for 
this institution for 11 years gioia said the system which 
costs 55 million a year to run had depended on farebox revenue 
and state county and federal grants 
in 1981 federally subsidized bus systems in youngstown ohio 
and birmingham ala failed because they were unable to raise 
taxes but youngstown got an advance on state funding until the 
levy passed and birmingham was revived by a beer tax

a broken pipe sprayed water on 
electrical equipment interrupting testing of the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope and threatening to postpone its launch 
aboard discovery on tuesday nasa says 
the water caused a temporary power outage that knocked out air 
conditioning at part of the kennedy space center the space agency 
said 
the loss of air conditioning forced the shutdown of 
heatsensitive equipment including some computers that in turn 
interrupted testing of the hubble and space shuttle discovery on 
the launch pad awaiting liftoff 
the 25000pound telescope was never in any danger from the 
coolingsystem breakdown said nasa spokesman george diller 
some of the computers were back up early monday evening and 
testing was expected to resume later today 
since the full effect of the loss of the chillers is still 
being determined we dont know whether theres an effect on the 
launch date diller said 
technicians began charging the telescopes batteries again 
monday night and diller said the fact that the charging has 
resumed is a good sign 
nasa on saturday moved up launch from april 12 to april 10 since 
technicians had needed little of the contingency time built into 
the schedule no contingency time was left as of today however 
diller said 
we cant afford even a hiccup if the launch is to be april 
10 he said

the white house has rejected housing secretary 
jack kemps choice of mary k bush to head a new agency created as 
part of the savings and loan bailout the administration said 
today her award of three nobid contracts is under investigation 
ms bush has been serving as acting director of the federal 
housing finance board for seven months awaiting her promised 
appointment as its chairwoman 
but the appointment was put in jeopardy by news accounts of 
three contracts she awarded friends from the reagan administration 
the contracts are being investigated by the department of housing 
and urban developments inspector general with a report expected 
by weeks end 
an administration official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said today that ms bush was no longer under 
consideration for the position 
mary brunette kemps top aide said kemp has offered ms bush a 
fulltime job as director of the agency in that post she would 
not be a voting member of the parttime board but would oversee the 
agencys daytoday activities 
ms bush who is not related to president bush has not 
responded to kemps offer her spokesman joseph slye said today 
that ms bush has not been informed of the administrations 
decision which was first reported today in the washington post 
the federal housing finance board was created as part of the 
savings and loan bailout plan to oversee the 12 regional federal 
home loan banks which must put a percentage of their profits each 
year into affordable housing programs 
the agency is independent of hud but has been under kemps 
control because he is the only member of its board who has been 
named 
ms bush a treasury department official during the reagan 
administration was a vice president of the federal national 
mortgage association before leaving to head the new board last 
september 
publicly kemp aides continued to support ms bush for the job 
even as they were informed monday that the white house would not 
approve her nomination as chairwoman but at least one top kemp 
deputy expressed hope privately as far back as two months ago that 
ms bush would leave the agency which controls millions of dollars 
in new housing funds 
ms bush according to sources disagreed with kemps plans to 
seek a parttime board and also protested when the top kemp deputy 
hud undersecretary alfred a dellibovi forced her to hire a 
consultant she did not want to employ kemps plans still face 
opposition in congress where lawmakers who drafted the legislation 
to create the agency say the board was designed as fulltime 
kemps aides have said that kemp and others at hud were not 
aware until two weeks ago of the nobid contracts one of which was 
awarded to kemps former chief of staff at hud wendell gunn 
gunn however said he personally told kemp of the arrangment in 
november and offered to terminate his contract if kemp wanted him 
to do so and dellibovi in a memo about the housing finance board 
written feb 5 to several top kemp aides twice referred to 
wendell once in a listing of people being paid by the agency

israel today displayed its rocket and 
technological prowess launching the ofek2 communications 
satellite the second in a series of experimental spacecraft 
the satellite is widely viewed in the arab world as a spycraft 
that will allow israel to have immediate intelligence on arab 
military moves 
the launch came one day after iraqi president saddam hussein 
threatened to use chemical weapons against israel if attacked but 
israel space agency head yuvaal neeman denied that the satellite 
had any military purpose or that the longrumored launch was in any 
way a response to the warning 
we dont send satellites because of threats he said 
neeman described the new satellite as experimental and similar 
to the ofek1 launched aboard a gray threestage rocket sept 19 
1988 
the only difference is that we can call the satellite and send 
it messages and receive answers back neeman said adding it 
is not a spy satellite and has no military significance 
witnesses said the rocket lifted off at 302 pm rising slowly 
above a ball of orange flame and leaving a zigzag trail of white 
smoke 
it was launched from an undisclosed site in the center of the 
country and entered orbit 90 minutes later 
the satellites orbit will range from 125 miles at its lowest 
point to 923 miles at its highest according to space agency 
spokesman avi sarhan 
we said at the launch of ofek 1 that there would be a whole 
line of satellites afterwards ofek 2 is just one more step a 
successful step in this program sarhan said 
he said the ofek 2 weighed 374 pounds the same as ofek1 
it is a technological satellite leading to a scientific 
satellite sarhan said there is no equipment on it to examine 
space as nasa has the next ones should have this ability 
analysts have said israel needed its own satellite so as not to 
be dependent on the united states for satellite information 
shimon peres the labor party leader who has been picked to head 
israels new government told reporters the launch proved israels 
scientific ability 
it shows that israel is a highly developed country and we are 
able to defend our lives peres said we are not looking for 
wars but we are looking for security and hopefully for a region 
and a time where nobody will need military equipment 
he said the launch should remind iraqs president that if he 
wants to deal with israel he should look for other means than the 
military one 
gerald steinberg a professor at hebrew university and an expert 
on strategic technology noted israel had launched the rocket 
westward toward the mediterranean sea so as not to alarm its arab 
neighbors 
israel has a policy not to send missiles toward arab 
nations he said adding israel also had a policy of not 
revealing characteristics of the missile to israels arab enemies 
despite the secrecy surrounding the launch civilians including 
a busload of school children stopped to watch the rocket rise on a 
curving arch into the partly cloudy skies 
in launching the first satellite in 1988 israel used a modified 
version of the jericho ii rocket and the liftoff demonstrated 
israels ability to use mediumrange missiles according to foreign 
reports 
the first satellie rose to a height of about 155 miles its 
closest point to earth and reached a distance of about 620 miles 
it burned up in the atmosphere returning to earth on jan 14 1989

gellike fuel creeping down the allegheny 
river today fouled water supplies and stymied steel glass and 
juice factories but the water supplies of pittsburgh and some 
nearby towns appeared to have been spared 
water had to be trucked into one community where intake valves 
were closed monday because of the spill of up to 300000 gallons of 
diesel gasoline and kerosene that leaked after a landslide friday 
ruptured a 10inchwide pipeline near freeport 35 miles north of 
pittsburgh 
but water service to pittsburgh residents continued normally 
today the slick hugged the south bank of the river when it reached 
downtown pittsburgh during the night and missed main water intake 
pipes operated by the pittsburgh water authority which serves 
about 450000 customers authority spokeswoman donna sagmeister 
said 
a number of communities near pittsburgh reopened their intake 
pipes as the fuel passed but still asked customers to use water 
sparingly pittsburgh and suburban water authority officials today 
said they were treating river water with increased amounts of 
chemicals for safety 
weve been able to treat the spill as it has been passing us 
for now ms sagmeister said today there are still pockets of 
oil floating and if one of those pockets should park itself in 
front of our intake valves we could be in trouble but right now 
its moving slowly and in a fashion that we can treat it and not 
shut down 
theres a slight sheen on the river right now but a lot of 
the fuel has evaporated environmental protection agency 
spokeswoman carrie deitzel said late monday 
the spill had threatened the water supplies of up to 1 million 
people 
at least 2500 workers in the industrial valley were told to 
stay home monday although the coast guard by nightfall reopened a 
10mile stretch of the river to barges and other vessels after a 
twoday hiatus 
later monday harrison township the only suburban community to 
lose water service because of the accident was able to resume 
pumping because petroleum concentrations had dropped township 
customers nevertheless should boil their water for drinking and 
cooking the allegheny county health department said 
the national guard had sent 100 water trailers and a brewery 
took bottled water to harrison township where 20000 people were 
without water monday 
factories offices and about 400000 people were advised to 
conserve water as the 20mile spill a mass 5 to 21 feet deep 
oozed into pittsburgh at half a mile an hour or less forcing 
communities to shut their intakes one one by one 
birds carried fuel to at least two nests where eggs were coated 
and can be considered dead said environmental protection 
agency spokeswoman carrie deitzel dead fish are expected to rise 
to the surface later she said 
daily juice products inc in verona suspended production of 
pasteurized juice the plant uses 100000 gallons of water a day 
said plant manager bob rivett five tanker trucks delivered water 
to make nonpasteurized drinks he said 
steelmaker allegheny ludlum inc trucked in water for the 
toilets and other uses at its 2600employee plant in brackenridge 
ppg industries inc halted production of automotive glass at its 
creighton plant which employs 360 people 
plants making made cough syrup steel office furniture and 
electronic circuit boards also either cut production or were closed 
emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a 
45000gallon reservoir at allegheny valley hospital which draws 
its water from the river the hospital used paper plates and cups 
to serve meals to its 225 patients closed its laundry and sent 
dirty linens to another hospital 
at least nine school districts closed monday idling more than 
21000 students 
buckeye pipeline co estimated 75000 gallons of the mixed fuel 
flowed into the river but john kaus of the allegheny county 
emergency management authority and others said the amount was 
closer to 200000 to 300000 gallons 
buckeye permit manager roy haase jr said the company and its 
contractors had recovered 50000 gallons of a fuelandwater 
mixture 
about 100 people worked to collect oil and build a dam below the 
spill site where fuel continued to leach from a quagmire covering 
the pipe 
they are trying to stabilize that soil ms deitzel said 
its a precarious situation because its saturated with fuel 
theyre out there working with lifelines

a draft declaration by us roman catholic 
bishops comes down square on the side of women but backs off from 
pushing for their ordination 
men and women are equal in dignity before god and before one 
another the proposed declaration stresses and incapacity to 
deal with women as equals indicates lack of fitness for the 
priesthood 
women have been slighted by sexist patterns and should have 
more equitable roles in leadership ministry teaching and 
policymaking says the revised draft distributed to bishops on 
monday 
nonetheless it reiterates the churchs stand against admitting 
women to the priesthood and instead calls for more dialogue 
many women regard the ban as excluding them from church 
governance and authoritative teaching the draft said but it 
defended the practice as that of jesus and his apostles 
it is not arbitrary nor is it rooted in a view that women are 
inferior as persons the draft said we pray that disagreement 
will not cause anyone to take leave of the church 
on a related matter the draft urges the vatican to speed up 
study of admitting women to the diaconate historically a 
preliminary step to the priesthood for men and to the lay 
ministries of lectors and readers of scripture at worship 
services 
the vatican should also examine further whether girls can be 
acolytes or altar girls 
the exclusion of women and girls from certain aspects of 
service at the altar seem to contradict our mandate that women 
be more visibly involved the draft said 
we encourage participation by women in all liturgical 
ministries that do not require ordination similarly we support the 
theological preparation of women to preach the gospel and to use 
their gifts as preachers in the church 
a bishops committee authorized by the national conference of 
catholic bishops has been working on the proposed pastoral letter 
on women for about five years 
the 99page second draft 65 pages shorter than a 1988 draft 
was sent to the churchs approximately 350 bishops asking for their 
responses the bishops hold their annual meeting in november 
the draft says numerous church practices have depersonalized 
and depreciated women and left them objects of suspicion 
condemnation condescension or simply ignored 
we intend therefore to ensure that women are empowered to 
assume positions of authority and leadership in church life in a 
wide range of situations and ministries it said 
the document called one in christ jesus a pastoral response 
to the concerns of women for church and society was drawn up by 
a sixbishop committee headed by bishop joseph l imesch of joliet 
ill 
five women served as consultants and 75000 women in 100 
dioceses 25 national womens organizations and 60 college campuses 
sent advice 
the draft calls changes in power structures and lifestyles 
found within our own house that prevent the proper advancement of 
women and asks each diocese to set up a commission to assure 
rights of women 
it endorses sexually inclusive language in church materials 
referring both to people and to god providing expressions that 
respect both the masculine and feminine attributes of god 
christians must reject all prejudicial attitudes that persist 
toward women all structures and stereotypes that sublty or overtly 
perpetuate injustices all practices that make women feel as if 
they are not accepted it said 
the draft touches on various other matters applauding feminists 
for advancing womens rights the value of both single and married 
life church opposition to abortion and extramarital sex and 
prohibition of contraception 
on birth control it says studies suggest a considerable 
degree of noncompliance among catholic women but argues the 
marital act cannot be separated from openness to life

the government began deploying 
heavily armed soldiers and police today after president fw de 
klerk ordered a major crackdown on black factional fighting that 
has claimed hundreds of lives

military officials said combat units were being moved into natal 
and other regions but declined to give numbers or other details 
police in edendale said army troops would set up barricades and 
conduct patrols to stop the fighting 
black leader nelson mandela wrapping up a twoday visit to 
natal said he welcomed the governments concern for restoring 
order but said officials should have talked to local black leaders 
about the move 
unilateral action by the government without consulting 
acknowledged leaders is bound to be ineffective regardless of 
merit said mandela the deputy president of the african national 
congress guerrilla movement 
mandela and president fw de klerk are to meet thursday to 
discuss ways to deal with the worst wave of violence since riots in 
the mid1980s 
mandela defended the ancs decision to pull out of april 11 
peace talks with the government in protest against a recent police 
shooting of black demonstrators at least 11 blacks were killed in 
the march 26 clash at sebokeng a township south of johannesburg 
if whites had been killed white south africa would be 
screaming at the top of its voice mandela said but because 
its blacks whites think it is not important 
the talks were to have focused on removing barriers to 
fullscale talks on extending voting rights to the 28 million black 
majority 
more than 12000 refugees mainly women and children had fled 
their homes in the edendale area and were being sheltered at camps 
police said rival mobs had burned hundreds of houses in the area 
they said 
the proapartheid opposition conservative party which opposes 
de klerks attempts to end apartheid and scrap whiteminority rule 
denounced his moves today it said he was pushing the nation into 
anarchy and chaos 
but reaction to the government moves was generally positive the 
liberal opposition democratic party endorsed the deployment of the 
security forces to end the violence 
de klerk told parliament on monday he had ordered security 
forces to launch a major drive to end unrest in black urban 
townships and rural areas such as natal he said the army had been 
ordered to act immediately firmly and purposefully to end the 
unrest 
south africa has been hit in recent weeks by the worst wave of 
violence since riots in the mid1980s 
de klerk legalized the anc and other outlawed black opposition 
groups in february and released mandela after 27 years in jail the 
president says he wants to share political power with blacks and

an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir urged 
the government today to issue a gas mask to every israeli after 
iraqi president saddam hussein threatened to use binary nerve gas 
against israel 
in iraq saddams ruling baath party held rallies today in 
baghdad and major provincial cities in support of his statement 
monday iraqi officials insisted the threat was meant to deter 
israeli plans to attack 
the people have the right to defend themselves chanted some 
of the demonstrators who waved banners quoting from saddams 
speech 
the speech dominated the israeli news his statement and israeli 
leaders counterthreats led every newspaper and the state broadcast 
stations 
michael dekel an aide to shamir and former deputy defense 
minister said he urged the prime minister to order distribution of 
gas masks now stored in warehouses 
i simply want prime minister shamir to move faster so that 
every israeli citizen will feel safe in his home dekel said 
we need to prepare the civilian population not only with 
practice but with equipment in the case of a surprise attack 
an army spokesman confirmed a newspaper report that the home 
guard in charge of civilian defense has prepared instruction 
videotapes on how to use gas masks for broadcast on national 
television 
foreign minister moshe arens told israel radio saddams past use 
of chemical weapons concerned him 
unconventional weapons in the hands of a man such as hussein 
who has used chemical weapons in a massive way against iran and the 
kurds should be a warning not only to every israeli but to the 
world arens said 
iraq has been accused of using chemical weapons during its 
198088 war with iran and against its kurdish minority an 
allegation iraqi officials deny 
saddam denied iraq was developing nuclear weapons but said iraq 
possessed binary chemical weapons and would use them if israel 
attacked 
i also say that if israel dares to hit even one piece of steel 
on any industrial site we will make the fire eat half of israel 
he said in his monday speech 
israels air force bombed iraqs osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 
while iraq was at war with iran claiming the facility was being 
used to develop atomic weapons iraq denied the charge 
the current issue of newsweek magazine reported israel was 
planning a new jericho iii missile with a 4000mile range easily 
capable of reaching iraq it quoted western experts as saying 
israel possesses at least 100 atomic bombs 
israel has said it would not be the first to introduce nuclear 
weapons into the middle east conflict 
an iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
today his countrys officials believe there is a military 
operation designed by the israelis with the authorization and 
encouragement of the united states of america and britain 
he cited israeli warnings in recent months about iraqs growing 
military strength 
the official termed saddams tough words a clear warning but 
added israel is fully aware that we have no intention to attack 
israel 
in geneva iraq indicated today it will not join a global ban on 
chemical weapons unless it is linked to nuclear disarmament 
while denying again that it sought to obtain triggers for 
nuclear warheads it charged that the rights of developing 
countries are being violated by embargoes on transfer of products 
and knowhow that could be used in the production of chemical 
weapons 
iraq has every right to acquire the means needed to defend 
itself chief delegate abdel rahim al khatal told the geneva 
conference on disarmament 
al khatal said a treaty banning the use production and 
stockpiling of chemical weapons would be widely supported if it 
contains a binding commitment incumbent on nuclear weapon states

consumers could be the losers in the decision by 
the american heart association to drop its seal of approval a 
nutritionist says 
the association announced monday that it would drop its 
heartguide seal program but would continue to work closely with the 
federal government on new food labeling regulations 
the seal a heart with a checkmark inside was to be put on 
foods low in sodium cholesterol and saturated fats if their 
manufacturers paid a fee to the association it was yanked after 
the federal food and drug administration said it would not support 
the program 
the fda has made it clear it is against thirdparty 
endorsements howard lewis director of health and science news 
for the heart association said the governments only concern 
was that they did not like third party organizations entering into 
an area where they had legal responsibility 
the fda sent a letter to the association friday saying it would 
not support the program that followed a warning letter in february 
threatening regulatory action the program was launched in january 
the us department of agriculture also refused to let the seal 
appear on any of the food it regulates which included meat 
poultry and frozen dinners 
consumer groups such as the center for science in the public 
interest had earlier expressed concerns that the heartguide seal 
might lull consumers into thinking they were buying an overall 
health food rather than foods that were considered best only for 
the prevention of heart disease 
the seal of approval was somewhat narrow said bonnie 
liebman director of nutrition for cspi it looked only at 
whether the food was good for your heart foods like vegetable 
oils margarines and some oils theyre low in saturated fat and 
sodium but weve been urged to cut back on all fats not just 
saturated fats to reduce the risk of cancer 
nonetheless she called it a noble attempt to help consumers 
if theres any victim its the befuddled consumer whos still 
trying to make heads or tails out of food labeling im a 
nutritionist and i have trouble figuring out whats what at the 
supermarket she said 
under the heartguide program food companies paid 15000 to 
600000 to submit their products for testing products which met 
heart association guidelines would get the heartguide seal of 
approval for their packaging 
consumer groups also said they were concerned that companies 
that chose not to pay the money would be shunned by shoppers even 
if their products were identical to a product carrying the seal 
the money was to be used for a nutrition hotline and education 
programs as well as the cost of the testing itself 
heart association president myron l weisfeldt of baltimore said 
monday that the association would announce a revamped heartguide 
program this summer focusing on education with added emphasis 
on legislative and regulatory actions for clearer food labeling 
weisfeldt said the heart association was encouraged that the fda 
plans to overhaul the governments labeling program 
ms liebman was skeptical the fda has actually said that it 
plans to improve food labels but that could take another decade or 
two she said

seven policemen were killed in a 24hour 
period in medellin after drug traffickers offered rewards for the 
murder of policemen the national police said today 
police killed seven gunmen in the rash of attacks monday and 
today national police said in the northwestern city that is 
headquarters for the medellin drug cartel 
there was no way to verify if the seven slain officers were 
victims of gunmen seeking the nearly 4300 bounty that authorities 
said the medellin cartel has offered for each policeman killed in 
colombia 
the traffickers also offered 100000 for the murder of each 
member of the antinarcotics strike force of the national police 
the police said last week 
none of the special force numbering about 2000 men has been 
killed yet 
drug barons are seeking to halt the governments policy of 
extraditing traffickers to the united states 
meanwhile a bogota newspaper hardhit by the drug traffickers 
said in todays editions that new threats forced the daily to stop 
publishing editorials supporting government action against drug 
lords 
el espectador said it will suspend such editorials until the 
government could assure the newspaper of safety from traffickers

barbara bush said today that her eyes are 
showing improvement for the first time after radiation treatment 
for irritation resulting from graves disease 
last week was the first week without seeing double she told 
reporters this morning 
she underwent 10 days of radiation treatment in january and 
doctors said it would take several weeks to determine if the 
radiation had worked 
i think the radiation worked thats very good news mrs 
bush said however she said she had not been evaluated recently by 
her medical specialists 
she made the comments after surprising tourists on the first 
floor of the white house by conducting a brief ceremony to receive 
a new historical book on the presidency 
white house staffers gathered about 200 tourists in the main 
foyer of the white house to watch mrs bush formally accept the new 
editions of the presidents of the united states and the first 
ladies from the white house historical association president 
she signed several copies of the books for delighted recipients 
among the tourists she joked that the family dog millie lurking 
shyly in the background doesnt like tourists 
mrs bush was diagnosed early last year with graves disease an 
immune system disorder that initially caused weight loss by 
affecting her thyroid it also caused her eyes to be irritated and 
resulted in double vision especially in the mornings 
treatment with a radioactive liquid cured the thyroid effects 
but the eye irritation persisted even after doctors put mrs bush 
on the steroid prednisone 
the radiation treatments administered on 10 successive days 
were the latest step in her treatment

a pivotal religious party today forged a 
coalition with labor party leader shimon peres who said the move 
gave him the basis for forming a rather solid government 
after signing the accord with the agudat israel faction leaders 
of the leftofcenter labor met in tel aviv to consider requesting 
a parliamentary vote thursday on a new government israel radio 
said 
the accord with the ultraorthodox party created a political 
momentum that gave peres a chance in breaking his 6060 deadlock 
with prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc in parliament 
agudat israel has five seats 
this means that we have closed completely the agreement and 
have established the basis to form a rather solid government 
whether narrow or wide he told reporters in tel aviv after the 
signing 
peres was asked by president chaim herzog to compose a 
government after shamirs likudlabor cabinet was toppled in a 
parliament vote of no confidence march 15 the crisis was triggered 
by a dispute over middle east peace proposals 
agudat israel legislator rabbi menachem porush strongly hinted 
today that two breakaway likud members avraham sharir and yitzhak 
modai were nearing an agreement with peres and that other 
ultraorthodox parties would also join a labor government 
but modai denied he was joining a peres government army radio 
quoted a modai spokesman as saying 
a sticking point in negotiations remained modais demand that 
israel refrain for at least six months from accepting middle east 
peace proposals of us secretary of state james a baker iii army 
radio said 
peres is a strong supporter of bakers ideas for starting 
israelipalestinian peace talks his views and shamirs reluctance 
to accept the proposals brought about the governments fall last 
month 
in his remarks peres reiterated today that the real issue 
today is how to proceed with the peace process 
peres said he made no promises for controversial legislation 
that religious parties have sought in the past such as a who is 
a jew amendment that would effectively outlaw nonorthodox 
conversions to judaism 
on the religious side we didnt sell and we didnt buy 
anything there is a legitimate status quo peres said

the boeing co is investigating an apparent case 
of industrial sabotage after a jetliner failed tests because of 
wires that had been cut 
it clearly seems to have been deliberate t craig martin 
boeing commercial airplane group spokesman said late monday in an 
interview the evidence at this point would suggest it would be 
an employee but we want to find out for sure 
boeings security personnel are investigating the company said 
in a statement 
the boeing 737 was in final assembly and undergoing testing at a 
renton plant when the cut wires were discovered martin said it 
had not been determined in what stage of construction the wires 
were cut he said 
boeing released a statement monday after kirotv reported the 
cut wires the damage was found about two weeks ago 
scores of wires were severed kiro reported it said there 
was a pattern of one or two wires cut in a bundle of wires and the 
broken ends hidden deep inside the bundle to mask the damage 
boeing would not divulge the number of wires severed and martin 
said he did not know the areas of the plane where the damage was 
found the aerospace giant said in its statement that repairs have 
been scheduled on the aircraft 
because of the anomalies noted on this particular airplane it 
will receive an especially intensive examination boeings 
statement said 
the federal aviation administration has asked boeing for 
information on the wirecutting incident and on what the company is 
doing to ensure quality control at the plant kiro reported 
faa spokesman dave duff said it was unlikely that a deliberately 
damaged plane could be certified for flight 
the system is working as it should duff said 
the incident occurred as boeing is laying off some of its 
production workers mostly at its everett plant where it assembles 
widebody 767s and 747s 
tom baker president of machinists union district lodge 751 
said while members are angry at the company as a result of the 
layoffs when they know and i know its not needed i doubt that 
anger would be aimed at any type of sabotage 
there have been no been previous cases of sabotage at boeing 
to our knowledge said boeing spokesman mark hooper he said 
anyone found responsible for sabotage would be fired and possibly 
face criminal charges

manuel noriega says the united states offered to 
drop his drug indictment in exchange for military concessions and 
maintained that offer until it invaded panama according to two 
activists who interviewed him 
the former panamanian leader said an agreement dismissing the 
drug charges had been drawn up but it fell apart when he balked at 
efforts to use us bases in his homeland as a staging area for an 
invasion of nicaragua said gavrielle gemma official of a group 
that opposes the us action in panama 
the panamanian government did not want to invade 
nicaragua she quoted noriega as saying monday the united 
states was interested in continuing to place interventionist troops 
in the american continent that can be mobilized to control south 
america central america and the caribbean 
ms gemma and another official of the independent commission of 
inquiry on the us invasion of panama interviewed noriega at the 
federal courthouse in miami for just over a half hour monday 
noriega told them that despite us refusal to recognize his 
government after an election was invalidated last year 
negotiations continued under both the reagan and bush 
administrations 
two issues using southern command facilities for intervention 
in nicaragua and us pressure to maintain its panamanian bases 
after the year 2000 blocked any agreement ms gemma quoted 
noriega as saying 
she also said noriega told them he was aware the invasion was 
coming two days before the united states launched it on dec 20 
noriega also commented on his relations with us intelligence 
agencies ms gemma said but she said the commission would expand 
on that thursday at a news conference in new york 
she said noriega did not complain of his treatment but was 
concerned about the effects of the invasion on his homeland 
ms gemma and an assistant teresa gutierrez interviewed 
noriega in the presence of his attorneys and federal marshals they 
said 
the commission which includes former us attorney general 
ramsey clark author graham greene and others has issued a report 
opposing the invasion and saying civilian casualties probably 
numbered in the thousands not hundreds as the defense department 
maintained 
noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of 
drug counts in a february 1988 indictment that accused him of 
accepting bribes from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn 
panama into a way station for usbound cocaine the trial is

brent musburger closing out his 15year career at 
cbs on top by doing the playbyplay of the ncaa basketball 
championship bid goodbye to the network but not to sports 
broadcasting 
folks ive had the best seat in the house thanks for sharing 
it ill see you down the road musburger said monday in the 
final moments of cbs broadcast of the university of nevadalas 
vegas 10373 victory over duke 
cbs announced sunday that it wouldnt renew musburgers 2 
millionayear contract after it expires june 30 
musburger cbs signature sports voice for more than a decade 
saved his brief farewell for the end of the game 
as you know this was my last assignment with cbs after 22 
years with the television network radio network and the 
stations musburger said 
i had an opportunity to work with the greatest directors 
producers technicians in the world not to mention analysts like 
my good friend billy packer billy we have shared some great 
memories 
musburger then put his arm around packer his broadcasting 
partner on college basketball 
after the broadcast fans in mcnichols arena shouted 
encouragement to musburger 
youre a pro baby one yelled 
musburger saluted the fans with a thumbsup and raised his index 
finger to signify no 1 his assistant jimmy tubbs said the 
broadcaster would not discuss his departure from cbs while in 
denver but would be available later in the week 
the main issues in musburgers contract dispute apparently were 
money and highprofile assignments cbs said musburger the 
networks most prominent sportscaster wanted more of both than the 
network was willing to give 
musburger is in his sixth season as lead playbyplay man for 
the ncaa basketball tournament and has been host of the nfl 
today since 1975 he also has broadcast college football and was 
anchorman of cbs coverage of the masters golf tournament the nba 
finals the pan american games and us open tennis highlights 
cbs most pressing problem in replacing musburger is finding 
another no 1 baseball broadcaster before airing its first game 
april 14 musburger was to have teamed with tim mccarver on 
baseball telecasts 
he was also in line to be host of the networks coverage of the 
1992 and 1994 winter olympics 
al michaels is considered the top candidate to replace musburger 
if abc lets him out of his contract which runs into 1993 
michaels an experience baseball broadcaster is reportedly feuding 
with abcs sports president 
michaels agent art kaminsky would not speculate about his 
clients chances of switching networks 
another possibility is simply filling musburgers roles with 
other cbs announcers cbs sports president neal pilson wants to 
give younger sportscasters such as jim nantz greg gumbel and james 
brown expanded duties 
hes got a lot of talent there kaminsky said he can take 
care of this internally if he chooses

guards drove back the last group of 
inmates holding a decaying victorian prison and recaptured 
twothirds of it today while negotiators sought a peaceful end to 
the 3dayold siege 
seven officers were injured trying to regain control of 
strangeways prison said ivor serle a prison guard and chairman of 
the local branch of the prison officers association 
there were many broken bones and one officer has a punctured 
lung serle said adding that most of the injuries were caused by 
bricks poles and other objects hurled by prisoners 
there was no word on how many prisoners if any were injured 
the guards advance could not be seen by reporters outside the 
prison 
at a second prison 100 miles south of manchester 33 inmates 
who barricaded part of a building after an attempted breakout ended 
their protest peacefully this morning the home office said no 
injuries were reported 
authorities have said 56 people 37 inmates and 19 guards 
have been injured at strangeways since rioting broke out at a 
chapel service sunday morning 
though press reports have speculated that as many as 30 inmates 
had been killed serle said no bodies had been recovered 
he said it was his gut feeling that there had been some 
deaths but i hope to god im wrong 
thirtyfive prisoners surrendered today leaving 64 behind a 
home office spokeswoman said serle said 84 inmates remained on the 
loose 
twenty inmates who wanted to surrender were physically prevented 
by other prisoners serle said 
we have extended our control prisoners still control about 
onethird of the jail theyre in the upper space serle told 
reporters outside the prison were in control of all lower 
portions of the prison 
in negotiations with prison governor brendan ofriel the 
rebellious inmates had demanded their surrender be witnessed by a 
member of parliament and that they all be photographed to protect 
them from beatings afterwards serle said 
ofriel agreed to a request by some inmates for an independent 
witness to watch the surrender of prisoners who are believed to be 
injured the home office said 
one dejected looking barechested inmate his hands bound in 
front of him was led out on the prison roof this afternoon by a 
masked prisoner carrying a large blade they remained outside in 
nearfreezing weather for only a few minutes 
inmates displayed several banners on the roof of the prison 
including one which said told we will die and another which 
proclaimed total war on ewing the wing where sex offenders 
were held 
it was not immediately clear what prompted the uprising but one 
former inmate said conditions were poor 
its a hole its filthy rotten food is bad it has no 
taste and they treat you like dogs said mike west who said he 
had been held at the prison a dozen times and was released just a 
week ago 
imagine being in a little box two or three men only one 
shower a week west said in an interview outside the prison 
by monday afternoon 1458 inmates had been transferred to other 
prisons and 74 were awaiting transport the home office said 
the strangeways riot began when prisoners at a religious service 
took keys from guards and used them to gain access to large areas 
of the prison 
relatives of inmates also said overcrowding added to tension at 
strangeways where up to three prisoners were housed in cells built 
for one they cited unsanitary conditions and prisoners being 
locked in cells for up to 23 hours a day redbrick strangeways was 
built in 1868 to hold 970 men it had 1648 prisoners on sunday 
it contains inmates of all categories from extremely dangerous 
to low risk 
the home office said trouble at the minimumsecurity long lartin 
prison began late monday when inmates tried to escape guards 
stopped the convicts as they attempted to scale the 15foot wire 
mesh perimeter 
the guards led them back into the building without violence but 
by then inmates in a wing of the lowsecurity prison had begun 
demonstrating forcing guards to retreat 
the home office said nine prisoners were involved in the foiled 
breakout at the prison which holds 430 inmates no injuries were 
reported

restaurateur by any spelling whether 
with an n or without is not a favorite word of keepers of the 
language according to a survey 
but if they have to use the word for keeper of a restaurant 
theyll take it without the n said respondents to the 12th 
english language usage survey by the indiana university school of 
journalism 
many in the survey found it stuffy no matter how it is 
spelled though its use is patently expanding in this country 
professor richard l tobin wrote in the survey released this week 
the 10question survey was mailed to 100 newspaper copy editors 
and 50 magazine editors in the united states and canada and got a 
60 percent return tobin said 
the consensus throughout this years survey was mighty close 
to unanimous in almost every example which just goes to show that 
copyreaders know what theyre doing and do it like the sterling 
languageusage guardians they are put there to be the survey 
said 
nearly all editors agree percent should be one word and not 
two 
most editors agreed the region deep south should be uppercase 
most copydesks caught the misuse of tremblor instead of 
temblor in a line from a maryland newspaper reporting a palm 
springs earthquake 
most changed forego to forgo in the sentence the 
university decided to forego the traditional faculty banquet 
because of the financial situation 
copydesks were asked whether gibe or jibe was correct in 
the following sentence three suspects were taken to police 
headquarters but detectives announced later that their stories 
didnt gibe the verdict was almost unanimous that jibe was 
correct 
complacent was correctly preferred over complaisant in 
an item saying a soccer team had become complaisant after four 
straight victories 
most canadians agree a person of scottish descent is scotch 
rather than scot which is preferred in the homeland 
several respondents in our survey said theyd given up trying 
to substitute scot for scotch and anyway it really didnt 
matter all that much the survey said 
editors chose theretofore over hitherto in the sentence 
in 1864 president lincoln spent the hitherto unheard of sum of 
3000000 on naval construction 
almost no one chose peddle over pedal in the final 
question which came from a florida sports page when youre 
riding a bicycle you use the brake and the peddle with caution on 
todays highways

a bomb believed set by sikh radicals 
exploded in the midst of a hindu celebration tuesday and killed at 
least 33 people police said enraged hindus went on a rampage 
afterward and five police officers were reported injured 
most of the casualties from the bomb blast were hindus but some 
sikhs who had been watching the procession were among the victims 
police said 68 people were injured in the explosion 
the bomb went off as about 100000 hindus celebrating the birth 
of a godking marched through a crowded vegetable market in batala 
the town is 25 miles north of amritsar the holiest sikh city and 
the stronghold of sikh militants fighting for a separate nation in 
punjab state 
senior police superintendent sk goel said the bomb was hidden 
in a scooter parked outside a cigarette kiosk 
goel said 30 of the injured were in serious condition he said 
sikh militants were probably responsible 
the radicals have killed more than 500 people this year in their 
quest for a sikh homeland they are a minority in hindudominated 
india but form the majority in punjab a farming state in northern 
india 
soon after the blast angry hindus went on a rampage hurling 
stones at a police station near the market said a police 
inspector he said five policemen were injured 
officers fired into the air to quell the riot and an indefinite 
curfew was imposed in batala a hindudominated city of about 
120000 people 
the annual procession marked ram navami a hindu holiday 
celebrating the birth of rama rama is extolled in hindu lore as an 
incarnation of vishnu a member of the supreme hindu trinity of 
gods 
food vendor prem nath described the explosion from his hospital 
bed in amritsar there was loud sound then the entire area was 
covered with dark smoke and fire which rose as high as electric 
poles he said 
earlier tuesday a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near 
amritsar killing the driver and one passenger senior police 
superintendent anil sharma said 
police also blamed sikh extremists for that blast both the 
victims were sikhs 
when the sikhs began their fight in 1982 they targeted hindus 
in recent years they have turned their guns on fellow sikhs who do 
not support the separatist cause 
the militants say members of the sikh faith which has roots in 
both islam and hinduism are discriminated against politically and 
culturally by the hindudominated government

attorney thomas root was released on bond 
after pleading innocent to fraud and other charges tuesday in a 
case his attorney said would not be that big a deal for the 
government if root had not gained public attention last summer 
when his airplane plunged into the atlantic ocean 
root was released on 200000 bond ordered to surrender his 
passport and report semiweekly by telephone to a probation officer 
and confined to the continental united states until a trial date is 
set 
us district judge john garrett penn said he will set a trial 
date on april 23 
root was indicted march 22 on 20 counts of wire and mail fraud 
seven counts of filing false legal documents with the federal 
communications commission four counts of using counterfeit and 
altered federal documents and one count each of forgery and 
obstruction of a grand jury investigation 
the charges against the washington attorney arise out of his 
representation of fm radio stations seeking construction permits 
if convicted of all the charges root 37 would face a maximum 
200 years in prison and an 8 million fine 
roots singleengine plane ran out of gasoline and plunged into 
the atlantic off the bahamas last july after a sixhour 800mile 
flight that began near washington he told authorities he was 
unconscious during most of the flight but navy fighter pilots 
flying alongside his plane reported seeing him moving about he 
suffered an unexplained gunshot wound during the trip 
the bond does not require root to put up any cash but his 
property could be forfeited if he violates it assistant us 
attorney david eisenberg sought a more stringent bond requiring 
root to post 10000 
defense attorney eugene propper argued that root should be free 
on his own recognizance saying the charges were a standard white 
collar case and would not be that big a deal for the 
government if the widely publicized plane ditching had not 
occurred 
eisenberg replied it is a big deal for the government not 
because somebody flew off but because it is a lawyer and a case 
of falsifying documents 
the government attorney said that last april 24 officers serving 
a search warrant on root at the nearby manassas va airport found 
numerous firearms a knife handcuffs and a marijuana leaf in and 
around roots airplane he said the weapons were not illegal 
except for one unregistered silencer but indicated that root may 
very well be a danger to himself and possibly even a danger to 
the community 
propper said all of the guns were federally registered and root 
loaned them to the arlington va police for target practice he 
said root kept them at the airport because he has a wife and three 
children at home he said root has since disposed of them 
roots attorney entered his plea for him root did not speak 
except to say that he understood the conditions of his release on 
bond 
propper asked to have the trial set six or seven months from now 
to give the defense time to prepare eisenberg said the government 
is ready to go to trial in 60 days to 90 days 
propper also said he needs time to consider a possible conflict 
of interest that could disqualify him from representing root he 
declined to say what it was 
eisenberg said propper could be subpoeneaed to testify for the 
government because he may have inadvertently witnessed an attempt 
to interfere with justice in connection with the grand jury 
proceedings

subdivision appeared to have slowed said hawaii county civil 
defense spokesman bruce butts 
civil defense officials evacuated 50 homes monday and put all 
remaining residents of kalapana gardens on alert meaning they 
could be ordered within 72 hours to evacuate they would be given 
24 hours to leave 
officials were watching two major flows from the volcano which 
has erupted continually the past seven years 
the flow posing the most immediate danger to the 125home 
subdivision was coming from the west said harry kim hawaii county 
civil defense administrator but a finger from that flow was 
draining into a crater almost 100 feet deep slowing its progress 
he said 
lava continued to pour into the crater early tuesday and butts 
said it was impossible to say when the flow could reach homes as 
long as the diversion drained much of the power from the front of 
the flow 
the second flow from the east was less than threequarters of 
a mile from any residence kim said 
residents told to evacuate were leaving with as many possessions 
as they could take and some hired container trucks to take 
everything they have 
many others were packing in anticipation of an eventual order to 
leave 
i ran into a couple of people who didnt seem too concerned 
about it but most people are concerned and moving whatever they 
can said civil defense spokesman allen parker 
since its latest and longest eruption began in 1983 the volcano 
has destroyed 76 homes and a national park visitor center causing 
20 million in damage

a radical iranian newspaper tuesday 
denied a kuwaiti news report that said the united states and iran 
will normalize relations and that kidnappers in lebanon could free 
their american hostages 
the filthiest accusation against an independent and 
revolutionary government is to charge it with being dependent 
said the editorial in the farsilanguage jomhuri islami 
the islamic republic system in iran has been the constant 
target of propagandistic assaults by the east and the west because 
it never gave in to blackmail of anybody or any power or 
government 
the newspaper was quoted by irans official islamic republic 
news agency in a dispatch monitored in cyprus jomhuri islami is 
aligned with the radical faction that opposes president hashemi 
rafsanjanis efforts to improve relations with the west 
the kuwaiti daily alseyassah quoting reliably informed arab 
sources predicted last wednesday that a deal between iran and the 
united states would be completed by the end of the year including 
freedom for the hostages and a normalization of relations 
like all kuwaiti newspapers alseyassah is independent but 
basically progovernment irna did not name the kuwaiti 
newspaper that published last weeks report but it was 
clearly referring to the alseyassah article 
the revolutionary and moslem nation of iran continues to 
consider the united states as the great satan and rejects any ties 
with washington the iranian newspaper said 
kuwaits alseyassah wrote in its frontpage story that the 
united states already had resumed supplying military aid and 
technicians to iran there has been no us comment on the report 
alseyassah wrote that the hostage issue has now become an 
integral part of a deal the completion of which could take the 
remaining months of the year 
hezbollahs extremely difficult conditions could be nothing 
more than a political cosmetic operation that precedes the 
normalization of iranianus relations and the release of the 
hostages the newspaper said 
hezbollah or party of god is believed to be the umbrella group 
for proiranian shiite moslem groups that hold most of the 18 
western hostages in lebanon 
among the conditions the groups have set are release of 15 
kuwaiti shiite moslems held in kuwait for bombing the us and 
french embassies freedom for hundreds of political prisoners in 
israel a pullout of israel from a southern lebanese border strip 
the hostages are eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an italian and an irishman 
terry anderson 42 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press who was abducted march 16 1985 is the 
longestheld of the hostages most of the other hostages have been 
held at least three years 
the englishlanguage tehran times which is aligned with 
rafsanjani has called for release of the hostages and said 1990 
will be the year they are freed rafsanjani himself has said he 
sees movement toward a solution to the issue of the hostages 
but the radicals for whom opposition to the united states is a 
touchstone of their policy oppose any move toward freedom for the 
captives

a majority of the editors of locally and 
groupowned newspapers say firms that own multiple newspapers are 
more interested in profits than in the communities they serve 
in a survey a majority of editors also agreed that freedom of 
the press is in more jeopardy when the ownership of papers is 
concentrated in fewer hands 
a committee of the american society of newspaper editors took a 
fresh look at a frequently debated question among newspeople 
whether newspapers are likely to get better or worse when a local 
owner sells the paper to a company owning a number of them 
some argue that group ownership brings greater resources to the 
local paper some see homogenization resulting from absentee 
ownership 
the committees report was prepared for the annual asne meeting 
which opens wednesday editors of 234 newspapers half groupowned 
and half independent all with circulations over 10000 returned 
questionnaires 
one historic characteristic of the american press is its local 
nature but local ownership is a disappearing phenomenon fifty 
years ago there were 1559 independent daily newspapers locally 
owned edited and managed and 319 that were part of groups now 
there are 1233 groupowned papers and only 389 independents 
the asne committee quoted one editor david offer of the 
familyowned newport ri daily news who has worked under both 
types of owners as saying the type of ownership is not nearly 
as important as the journalistic commitment of the ownership 
nonetheless the committee reported sharp distinctions based on 
ownership 
groupowned papers it said were likely to offer better 
career opportunities more sharing of ideas less pressure from 
advertisers and special interest groups greater overall financial 
resources and access to outside experts to help solve problems and 
train staff 
independent papers on the other hand were likely to offer 
larger newsroom budgets better understanding of the local 
market more flexibility in making decisions greater involvement 
in the community less turnover of key personnel few levels of 
bureaucracy and a tendency to be peculiar 
in the survey 62 percent of editors of group papers and 91 
percent of editors of independents agreed that the owners of group 
papers are more concerned about profits than what happens to 
individual newspapers or the communities they serve the same 
question was not asked about locally owned papers 
and 69 percent of groups editors and 84 percent of independents 
agreed that freedom of the press stands in greater jeopardy if 
the press is owned by few people than if owned by many 
but the editors parted company on whether newspaper groups if 
left unchecked will stifle competition and exert undue influence 
on the thinking of the whole country 
agreement with that statement came from 73 percent of the 
independent editors but just 37 percent of those on groupowned 
papers 
fortyeight percent of groups editors but only 18 percent of 
independents agreed with this statement the sophistication of 
newspaper groups is a welcome antidote to the provincialism of 
independently owned papers 
david greenfield editor of the charleston wva daily mail 
whose independent paper was purchased by a group thomson 
newspapers told the committee little happened with his paper 
changed hands the new owners said they want the best newspaper 
we can produce he said 
youve got to remember there are a lot of very bad small 
newspapers he said when taken over by a group the bad ones 
often get better right away 
the report noted that both classes of ownerships vary groups 
can be owned by private or public corporations that own as few as 
two papers or as many as the 83 owned by the gannett co inc 
which publishes usa today and 82 local dailies many of the 
surviving independents are owned by families but some are owned by 
trusts foundations local companies or in a few cases their 
employees

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge plunged 10 percent in february its steepest drop in nine 
months the government said tuesday but analysts said the decrease 
was misleading 
the commerce department said tuesday its latest index of leading 
economic indicators designed to forecast economic activity six to 
nine months in advance wiped out three months of increases with 
the largest decline since a 11 percent fall last may 
but analysts said the report was an aberation caused by a record 
25 percent drop in building permits in february from januarys 268 
percent gain as builders took advantage of warm weather and tried 
to beat deadlines for new government regulations 
it would have been down just 02 percent without the 
distorting effect of the building permits said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer in new york 
gilbert benz an economist with the swiss bank corp in new 
york said the gauge would bounce back next month to its levels of 
late 1989 and early 1990 the index rose 01 percent in november 
04 percent in december and 02 percent in january 
nevertheless seven of the 11 statistics in the index were down 
which analysts interpreted as meaning a soft economy particularly 
in the manufacturing sector 
februarys leading indicators show a substantial industrial 
rebound is unlikely to occur in the next six months said william 
k macreynolds forecasting director for the us chamber of 
commerce 
but jones added recent signals suggest that while the 
goodsproducing sector is still flat its not getting any worse 
and theres no evidence that its weakness is spreading to other 
sectors 
according to a recent survey of 51 top economists by blue chip 
economic indicators in sedona ariz the gross national product 
the nations output of goods and services will avoid a recession 
and grow 17 percent in 1990 
but the survey concluded that the economic outlook remains the 
most sluggish since the recession year of 1982 the economy grew 
3 percent last year although it slowed to 11 percent in the final 
quarter 
in addition to building permits other statistics contributing 
to the indexs decline in february were faster business delivery 
times lower stock prices a decline in plant and equipment orders 
a decrease in the price of raw materials a decline in the backlog 
of manufacturers unfilled orders and a drop in an index measuring 
consumer confidence 
three of the components were positive including an increase in 
orders for consumer goods a gain in the money supply and a drop in 
weekly unemployment claims 
one indicator the length of the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1440 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index fell 06 percent from september through 
february after declining 05 percent the previous six months

a group of lithuanian officials met in moscow 
today with a leading aide to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
heralding a bid to ease the tense stalemate between moscow and the 
breakaway baltic republic 
also today a soviet bill on secession cleared one house of 
parliament after heated debate and lawmakers in estonia passed a 
resolution in support of their baltic neighbor 
egidis bickauskas a lithuanian legislator told a moscow news 
conference that three representatives including lithuanian deputy 
premier romualdas ozolas met with alexander n yakovlev considered 
to be one of gorbachevs top advisers 
if there are people who are ready to listen i think it is 
very good bickaukas said no results of the meeting were 
immediately available 
the meeting signified the first highlevel personal contact 
between lithuania and moscow since just after the baltic republic 
declared independence on march 11 
the secession bill was approved by the soviet of nationalities 
one of two houses of the parliament said the official soviet news 
agency tass without giving a vote count it was sent on to the 
second chamber the soviet of the union for possible consideration 
later today 
some deputies to the supreme soviet legislature found the bill 
too harsh while others thought the conditions it set were too 
lenient tass said 
an amendment approved by the soviet of nationalities requires 
any republic leaving the union to pay the costs of citizens who 
want to resettle back in the soviet union lithuania has a large 
russian minority 
legislators in the neighboring baltic republic estonia which 
is taking a more cautious approach to independence approved a 
measuring supporting lithuania and urging gorbachev to open talks 
the estonian supreme soviet expresses full support of their 
strivings pays high tribute to their courage and expresses 
recognition of the independent state organization of lithuania 
the declaration said 
gorbachevs top deputy spoke of friendly ties with lithuania 
and said the kremlin does not question its right to secede as 
long as it adheres to the constitution 
the comments by anatoly i lukyanov chairman of the supreme 
soviet parliament came as lithuanian leaders sought a compromise 
that would allow them to start talks with moscow without giving in 
to demands by gorbachev that they first repeal their march 11 
declaration of independence 
on monday lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said his 
republic intends to move toward independence gradually and through 
negotiations the statement marked something of a retreat from the 
recalcitrance that had characterized the baltic states threeweek 
drive for divorce 
the secession bill would require a twothirds vote in a 
referendum of any republic wishing to leave the soviet union a 
fiveyear transition period would follow during which the republic 
and the kremlin would divide up economic resources and settle any 
disputes in addition moscow would have final say over terms of 
separation 
polands foreign ministry said the soviet government today 
closed the only border crossing between poland and lithuania but 
there was no immediate comment by government officials 
over the weekend soviet soldiers seized lithuanias chief 
prosecutors office in the capital vilnius as well as the baltic 
states main newspaper printing plant foreign reporters were 
ordered to leave sunday 
kremlin strongarm tactics aimed at forcing the lithuanians to 
back down have included sending armored vehicles through vilnius to 
rattle the populace demanding citizens turn in their firearms and 
rounding up at least 23 lithuanians who deserted the red army 
following the independence declaration 
soviet officials say that if lithuania or any other republic 
wants to secede it needs to follow the law gorbachev warned 
saturday that to do otherwise could result in grave consequences 
for all of us 
lithuania and estonia forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 
1940 with fellow baltic republic latvia have declared themselves 
to be under illegal soviet occupation and lithuanian leaders refuse 
to renounce their independence declaration 
however landsbergis said monday that his republic intends to 
consolidate its independence by means of agreements and a 
gradual takeover of certain functions 
in a telegram to gorbachev he invited kremlin officials to 
lithuania to discuss secession 
lukyanov first in line to succeed gorbachev said in remarks 
carried by tass late monday that the kremlin leaderships attitude 
toward lithuania is calm clearcut and rather friendly 
nobody questions the constitutional right of nations and 
peoples to selfdetermination he said only this should be 
done in legal forms so that neither to damage the interests of the 
nation that has decided to gain selfdetermination nor of other 
nations and ethnic groups inhabiting the soviet union 
but lukyanov said lithuanias hasty decision ignored its 
relationship with the rest of the soviet union 
landsbergis told legislators monday that gorbachev probably took 
the tough stance over the weekend because he faces his own 
political difficulties from conservatives and other 
independenceminded republics 
therefore it is essential to look for a way of helping them 
and ourselves landsbergis said gorbachev faces independence 
movements in several of the soviet unions 15 republics 
virginijus razmantas of offical lithuanian radio said the 
republics legislature was today debating whether about 9000 
youths scheduled to report for soviet military service this spring 
should start their service 
all proindependence newspapers were printed in the republics 
main printing plant razmantas said a leader of the minority of 
lithuanian communists who remain loyal to moscow had told plant 
workers monday that the papers would no longer printed there 
in vilnius on monday about 1000 proindependence demonstrators 
rallied outside the chief prosecutors office to protest the soviet 
occupation 
both a prosecutor appointed by lithuanias breakaway government 
and one sent by moscow were working in the building employees 
said they reported a tense atmosphere but no direct conflicts 
between the two

communist party chief jiang zemin was chosen 
tuesday to succeed senior leader deng xiaoping his sponsor in a 
top military post 
the national peoples congress accepted dengs resignation from 
his last official government position last week and had been 
expected to pick jiang for the job 
jiang was the only candidate he received 2682 votes for 
chairman of the government central military commission ten members 
of the parliament voted against him and 26 abstained 
one deputy wrote in dengs name and another entered that of 
president yang shangkun a general with a strong following in the 
military 
deng chose jiang 63 as his successor in november jiang 
replaced him as head of the party central military commission a 
policymaking group with nearly the same membership as the 
government body 
the military has played an increasing political role since june 
1989 when soldiers were called in to crush the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing holding the two military jobs is crucial to 
jiangs leadership position 
jiang a relatively unknown shanghai party boss was named head 
of the 48millionmember communist party in june after the 
dismissal of zhao ziyang who was accused of supporting the 
prodemocracy movement 
he has supported the hardline policies of deng and other party 
elders jiang has no political power base in beijing 
deng 85 still is considered the most powerful man in china he 
has described jiang as the core of nextgeneration leaders and 
asked the military to give the new party chairman their full 
support 
jiang has no experience in military affairs and the peoples 
liberation army remains dominated by such old revolutionaries as 
president yang 82 who was named first vice chairman of the party 
central military commission in november 
during votecounting tuesday in the great hall of the people a 
crowd of deputies gathered around hu qili a former member of the 
party politburo standing committee who was purged along with zhao 
for prostudent leanings 
deputies extended warm greetings to hu asking for his signature 
and posing for pictures with him 
hu like zhao was stripped of all party posts he escaped 
official criticism however and has been allowed to attend a few 
public functions 
zhao still a party member and parliamentary deputy has not 
been seen since he went to tiananmen square on may 19 for a tearful 
meeting with students on hunger strike

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
arrived here today for meetings with top us leaders and said 
honest dialogue is moscows main weapon in dealing with the 
independence crisis in lithuania 
speaking to reporters at andrews air force base shevardnadze 
said his government believes that it is important to maintain the 
integrity of the soviet constitution and soviet laws in the face of 
the challenge represented by the lithuanian independence movement 
declaring that lithuania also approved the soviet constitution 
shevardnadze added we are going to act within the framework of 
our constitution within the basic law of our country 
our main weapon in resolving any issue is dialogue honest 
dialogue he said and added 
and this is the dialogue we are looking forward to with the 
lithuanian people and the lithuanian leadership 
meanwhile state department spokeswoman margaret tutweiler said 
soviet actions in lithuania will be at the top of the agenda 
when shevardnadze meets secretary of state james a baker iii on 
wednesday he is set to see president bush on friday 
baker and shevardnadze also are likely to discuss and perhaps 
announce a date for the next summit meeting between bush and 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
the summit is tentatively planned to be held in washington 
during the second half of june 
meanwhile lithuanias chief diplomat in the united states said 
at a news conference that he would meet shevardnadze any time 
during his us visit 
but stasys lozoraitis jr questioned whether gorbachev is 
calling the shots in lithuania 
maybe the army is very unhappy with the situation in the 
baltic and is doing something in lithuania that he cannot control 
and cannot stop he said 
lozoraitis said that while he believes lithuania will regain its 
independence he is pessimistic now because of a feeling that 
something is being done that cant have any good results 
we will wait it out he said we will have very strong 
nerves we will not do anything violent we will not be provoked 
shevardnadze was to be met at andrews air force base in suburban 
maryland at midday by deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said monday 
that soviet pressure on lithuania to annul its monthold 
declaration of independence will be raised by baker in a lengthy 
initial session on wednesday afternoon 
the issue also is certain to be raised at a meeting between bush 
and shevardnadze on friday 
however a senior us official said the lithuania issue would 
not crowd other important matters from the agenda 
the official who asked not to be identified by name said these 
include strategic and conventional arms control negotiations and 
setting a date for the bushgorbachev summit 
shevardnadzes talks with baker and other state department 
officials will intertwine with the visit this week of west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher whose talks are expected 
to focus on german reunification 
in his meetings with shevardnadze baker is expected to express 
concern over the soviet military buildup in lithuania and such 
actions as the seizure of government and communist party offices in 
vilnius the lithuanian capital and the expulsion of western 
reporters 
ms tutwiler said monday the united states does not believe it 
should attempt to prescribe the precise solution to the 
conflict in lithuania 
she expressed the hope that every peaceful means will be 
explored to resolve the situation and urged that nothing be done by 
either side to preclude a dialogue on lithuanias future 
the united states has repeatedly called on the soviets not to 
use coercion intimidation or military force in lithuania 
shevardnadze assured baker during a meeting in namibia last 
month that the kremlin would do its utmost to avoid using force to 
suppress the independence movement in lithuania 
they want to solve the problem through dialogue baker said 
in describing the soviet attitude then theres no reason that we 
know of not to take him at his word 
we have been on the record as saying that the use of force 
would be counterproductive and have an adverse impact on our 
relations ms tutwiler said 
it is important that the united states continue to call for 
the resolution of this issue through dialogue through negotiations 
in a peaceful manner so that ultimately the people of lithuania can 
indeed enjoy genuine independence she said

tired of seeing the same frowning haglike face 
staring in the mirror every morning plastic surgeons are gathering 
to discuss the latest in lifting sagging lips plumping up puny 
ones and fixing a witchs chin 
thanks to liftandtell celebrities such as cher phyllis diller 
and joan rivers cosmetic surgery is a booming business said dr 
james baker who teaches at the university of central florida at 
orlando 
the demand is growing all the time baker said tuesday at 
the 23rd annual meeting of the the american society for aesthetic 
plastic surgery 
liposuction the fatsucking procedure imported from france is 
the most popular technique with 100000 operations done each year 
breast enlargement is a close second with about 85000 performed 
in 1989 baker said 
softer more lifelike breast implants and details on special 
techniques for giving mammograms to women with implants also are on 
the agenda at this weeks meeting 
despite the costs which range from hundreds to thousands of 
dollars and usually arent covered by health insurance people who 
can afford it will pay to look good he said 
cosmetic or appearance things can significantly affect the way 
people feel about themselves so even though some of these things 
may seem trivial to outside people to somebody who has that it 
can make a big difference said dr joel feldman a harvard 
medical school plastic surgeon who has pioneered a way to fix the 
witchs chin 
the term refers to a protrusion of skin at the chins tip that 
becomes pronounced when a person smiles it is more common in older 
people but feldman said hes treated younger people and even 
teenagers 
i had one patient who said when she was a young girl and 
babysitting one of the kids said to her you look like a witch 
he recalled 
feldmans technique involves removing the soft protruding 
tissue using an incision that is hidden by the shadow of the chin 
previous techniques have tried to correct this problem by 
repositioning the soft tissue he said ive found that 
repositioning is prone to undercorrection or sagging as time goes 
on 
feldman said his procedure is a simpler more lasting solution 
it costs about 2500 
for folks with drooping mouths perpetual frowns also associated 
with aging theres the lip lift 
as people get older the upper lip gets longer and the corners 
of the lip turn down into almost a comma shape said dr 
bernard cohen a university of pittsburgh plastic surgery professor 
it always looks sad no matter what they feel inside cohen 
said 
while more common techniques such as chemical peels have been 
used to fix fine frown lines beside the mouth none addressed 
actually lifting the lips until a few years ago cohen said 
it involves excising a small diamondshaped patch of skin at the 
corners of the mouth the technique draws up the lips into a more 
neutral position 
youre literally elevating the corners of the mouth said 
cohen who estimates he and his former partner have lifted 275 lips 
in recent years 
the procedure is often done in conjunction with total face 
lifts but alone it costs up to 600 he said 
another lip enhancer is billed as a possible permanent solution 
to the problem of thin lips and an alternative to collagen 
injections made famous by actress barbara hershey in the movie 
beaches 
it involves cutting flaps of lip skin from the inside of the 
mouth and lifting them forward to the lip line the procedure 
creates fullness by advancing some of the lining and muscle inside 
the lip according to dr m reza samiian chief of plastic surgery 
at baptist medical center in jacksonville fla 
the results can be considered permanent because the materials 
used to build up the lip are part of its basic structure said 
samiian who is to report on the technique friday

ryan white the teenage aids patient whose 
battle for acceptance won hearts and better understanding of the 
disease across the nation remained in critical condition today on 
a lifesupport system his physician said 
dr martin b kleiman said late this morning that white 18 was 
unconscious and heavily sedated so that lifesupport systems would 
function more efficiently there was no significant change in his 
condition overnight he said 
while agreeing that his condition was critical he called 
reports monday of massive internal bleeding exaggerated and 
obviously in error and said his top concern was treating whites 
respiratory infection 
anybody whos this critically ill nobody can predict from 
moment to moment if he will survive he said 
white who during his fiveyear battle with aids grew from an 
object of scorn in his hometown to an international spokesman for 
aids patients has been hospitalized at riley hospital for children 
since thursday 
whites mother jeanne white and sister andrea slept some 
during the night in a room near him 
on monday carrie van dyke a spokewoman for whites family and 
for the indiana state board of health had said that white was 
not expected to come out of it the hospital was soon inundated 
with calls from wellwishers 
van dyke said this morning that singer elton john visited the 
hospital overnight flying in from los angeles and singer michael 
jackson had called 
she said john spent five hours with the family and just raised 
their spirits tremendously that someone of his stature would care 
so much to drop everything 
when jackson called a speaker phone was brought to whites 
bedside in hopes he would somehow hear jacksons words 
he told ryan he loved him and that god is with him van dyke 
said and he said hang in there buddy and get better 
mary maxwell a spokesman for the hospital said the flood of 
calls has bedlam were getting calls from every small town in 
the united states it hasnt let up callers want mrs white to 
know she has their support and prayers 
president bush who was in indianapolis for a political 
fundraising event had hoped to stop at the hospital to visit the 
family but was not able to work it into his schedule he did plant 
a tree in whites honor in during a ceremony at a downtown park 
ryan has helped us understand the truth about aids and hes 
shown all of us the strength bravery of the human heart bush 
said 
white a hemophiliac who contracted aids from contaminated blood 
products put a youthful face on the aids plight he increased 
awareness of the disease and helped reinforce the message that aids 
cannot be spread through casual contact his struggle was the 
subject of a people magazine cover story and a tv movie 
because of the lack of education on aids discrimination fear 
panic and lies surrounded me white told a teachers convention in 
1988 
i was labeled a troublemaker my mom an unfit mother and i 
was not welcome anywhere even at church people would not 
shake my hand he said 
he urged the teachers to help me beat the odds and together 
lets educate and save the children of the world by proper 
education aids can be a disease not a dirty word 
five years ago white who was diagnosed as having aids at 13 
was barred from school near kokomo by officials who feared aids 
could be transmitted to other students 
even after a judge affirmed whites right to attend school he 
and his family felt ostracized and moved about 20 miles away in 
cicero where they were welcomed by the community 
whites battle with aids sent him to washington to testify 
before congress and to california for starstudded fundraisers he 
gained the support of jackson john and other entertainers 
last week ryan appeared with former president and nancy reagan 
at a preoscar party in los angeles for sick and disadvantaged 
youth sponsored by athletes and entertainers for kids the 
organization has established the ryan white national education 
program for youth an aids education forum 
ryan is a very courageous young man who has a special place in 
our hearts the reagans said in a statement monday 
white has symbolized not just the tragedy of aids but also the 
ignorance of society toward the disease said cleve jones founder 
of the names project the group has sponsored the creation of a 
nationwide aids memorial quilt 
if this is the end for him i hope the people of this country 
derive some lesson from the obstacles he faced and the 
determination that he and his family showed to overcome those 
obstacles that he had to defeat more than an illness jones said 
in a telephone interview from san francisco i think thats 
something this country should be ashamed of 
white had suffered from an inoperable hernia since before 
thanksgiving and stopped attending class at hamilton heights high 
school before christmas 
linda otto who produced the abctv movie based on whites life 
said she has always been touched by his battle for his life and the 
rights of aids patients 
the point i would like to get across is how incredibly ryan 
reached out to other children with this disease otto said he 
was selfless and he really made an effort 
white had a cameo role in the film which was first broadcast in 
january 1989 he portrayed his own friend who later died of aids 
whites parents jeanne and wayne are divorced

when hurricane hugo battered this 
island community it uncovered wellpreserved civil war artifacts 
including smoking pipes leather boots and wooden buttons from a 
union camp officials said 
the site which was kept a secret since the sept 21 storm in an 
effort to keep vandals away was shown to reporters monday as part 
of duke university geologist orrin pilkeys field trip to assess 
damage from the hurricane 
the exceptional thing about the site is the preservation seems 
to be superb we rarely ever get wood said martha zierden 
curator of historical archaeology at the charleston museum 
other artifacts unearthed by the storm included a piece of a 
wooden scrub brush bullets bottles ink wells wooden buttons and 
barrels and salted pork 
these provide insight into daytoday living said gered 
lennon a geologist for south carolina coastal council and folly 
beach resident who discovered the site 
the items had been buried under 2 feet of sand 
lennon said he was concerned about vandals disturbing the site 
and noted that police are checking the area regularly 
the area about 100 yards long likely was used as to store 
union munitions and food lennon said 
excavation of the site is on hold while federal officials review 
a permit application ms zierden said 
thousands of union soldiers used folly beach as a winter 
encampment during the bombardment of fort sumter at the start of 
the civil war and the siege of charleston 
last year relic hunters discovered the vestiges of a longlost 
regimental hospital cemetery during excavation for a road in a 
heavily wooded area of a housing development 
archaeologists from the university of south carolina eventually 
uncovered 19 human skeletons they concluded the men were black 
apparently died of diseases rampant at the time and were members of

divorced people are apparently undeterred by 
their experience heading for the altar at higher rates than single 
folks a new government report says 
there were 807 marriages for every 10000 divorced women in 
1987 the national center for health statistics reported that 
compared to 589 marriages per 10000 single women 
among men the marriage rate was 1157 per 10000 divorced men 
compared to 488 for single ones the center said 
people who do things tend to do them again movers move 
marriers marry barbara foley wilson a population analyst at the 
center said tuesday 
people who are divorced are people who obviously were 
marriageprone to begin with they are used to living in a coupled 
fashion she said 
in addition many divorced women have children and may be 
interested in having help raising them she said 
another factor she added is the possibility that divorced 
people are marrying someone with whom a relationship developed 
before the end of their first marriage 
some people dont remarry following a divorce but for many the 
first marriage was not a totally bad experience and so they look 
for a new spouse she said i think marriage is a hopeful thing 
wilson pointed out that over the years there has been a steady 
growth in what she called partil remarriages in which one 
partner was previously married 
marriages involving single women and divorced men increased from 
69 percent of all marriages in 1970 to 110 percent in 1987 those 
involving single men and previously divorced women rose from 64 
percent to 104 percent of marriages over the same period 
and over that time span marriages involving two previously 
divorced people rose from 107 percent to 191 percent of marriages 
across the country 
the report although for 1987 provides the most current 
detailed information on marriages which declined to just over 240 
million in that year preliminary totals have disclosed a further 
drop to 239 million in 1988 with an apparent leveling off in 1989 
divorced women were the only major segment to show an increase 
in marriage rates from 1986 to 1987 the report said the rate 
increased from 795 to 807 
marriage rates for single and widowed women and for all segments 
of the male population fell the study said the figures were based 
on people aged 15 and over 
in other findings 
for men the median time between divorce and remarriage was 22 
years while divorced women had a median time of 25 years before 
remarriage median means that half married sooner than that and 
half later 
the median age at first marriage was 253 years for men and 
236 years for women the 13th consecutive year of increase 
grooms tended to be older than brides on average except in 
the case of divorced or widowed women who married single men 
couples embarking on their first marriage tended to have 
roughly similar educational backgrounds women averaged 137 years 
of schooling while men had 136 years 
in remarriages men tended to have slightly more education than 
their brides 134 years compared to 131 years 
in those cases said wilson the wives likely married and had 
children while young and were unable to pursue educations thus 
when they divorce and remarry they are likely to have had less 
education that their new husband 
june was the month in which most marriages occur and saturday 
the most popular day 
in most years the last saturday in june is the peak day of the 
year however in in 1987 valentines day feb 14 fell on a 
saturday and was the top day for marriage that year with 46000 
weddings 
the report is based on data provided to the center for health 
statistics by state governments marriage totals cover all states 
however eight states do not provide detailed data on the 
characteristics of people marrying those are arizona arkansas 
nevada new mexico north dakota oklahoma texas and washington

israel sent its second experimental satellite 
into orbit tuesday and showed off its advanced rocket technology at 
a time of rising middle east tensions 
israel denied the ofek2 satellite was part of a program to spy 
on its arab neighbors but israeli leaders boasted that the launch 
showed the countrys scientific and military superiority over arab 
countries 
military analysts have long noted that israels space program 
could give it immediate intelligence on arab military moves and the 
rocket technology involved also could carry more lethal payloads 
witnesses said the rocket that hefted the 352pound satellite 
into space lifted off at 302 pm 802 am edt rising slowly 
above a ball of orange flame and leaving a trail of white smoke 
the ofek2 ofek is hebrew for horizon was launched 
from an undisclosed site in the center of the country and entered 
orbit 90 minutes later 
it was fired westward over the mediterranean to avoid giving 
arab countries a look at the rocket despite the secrecy of the 
launch civilians including a busload of school children stopped to 
watch the rocket arch into partly cloudy skies 
israeli officials refused to discuss the rocket involved in the 
launch 
the satellites orbit will range from 130 miles at its lowest 
point to 923 miles at its highest according to israel aircraft 
industries which developed the satellite 
the launch came a day after president saddam hussein of iraq 
threatened to react to any israeli assault on his country with a 
chemical warfare attack that would make fire eat half of israel 
but israel space agency director yuvaal neeman denied the 
longrumored launch was a response to the iraqi warning 
we dont send satellites because of threats he said 
he described the new satellite as experimental and similar to 
the ofek1 launched aboard a threestage rocket sept 19 1988 
the only difference is that we can call the satellite and send 
it messages and receive answers back neeman said adding it 
is not a spy satellite and has no military significance 
neeman said on israel television that ofek2 would remain in 
orbit for two months adding there is no reason for it to stay 
longer because it has no real purpose 
ofek1 remained four months in orbit although it was scheduled 
to spend only a month in space 
neeman said tuesdays launch was expected to lead to a third 
test launch in 1992 and an eventual communications satellite that 
would remain in space for 10 years 
the purpose of the program is to build a scientific satellite 
to see stars galaxies and black holes with detectors for 
xrays ultraviolet rays said akiva barnun the space agencys 
coordinator 
he and neeman said the advances in ofek2 over the previous 
craft included an improved gyroscope better protection against 
cosmic rays a larger computer memory and the ability to both send 
and receive messages 
while space officials always discuss the ofek program in terms 
of scientific and commericial possibilities israeli politicians 
were quick to point out the political and military significance of 
tuesdays launch 
i think the proof for the high level of technology in israel 
was given today with the launching of ofek2 foreign minister 
moshe arens said on israel television 
i think the israeli public knows that israels security 
technology is on a much higher level than that or iraq added 
arens a former defense minister 
shimon peres the labor party leader who has been picked to form 
israels new government told reporters the launch should remind 
iraqs president that if he wants to deal with israel he should 
look for other means than the military one 
after the launch of the first satellite in 1988 foreign reports 
said israel used a modified version of the jericho ii rocket and 
the liftoff demonstrated israels ability to use mediumrange 
missiles 
ron benishai the military analyst for the daily yediot 
ahronot wrote at the time that putting a satellite in orbit meant 
ability to use the rocket to hit targets on land 
the washington post last year quoted a report from the us 
governments lawrence livermore national laboratory as saying the 
1988 launch provided evidence that israel probably had a 
capability of building a ballistic missile with a range over over 
2800 miles and carrying a payload of over 2200 pounds

vermont gov madeleine kunin announced 
today she will not seek a fourth term as governor 
it is time for me to move on to new challenges the governor 
said this morning fighting back tears as she revealed her closely 
held decision 
in a speech before about 200 cabinet members lawmakers and 
supporters kunin a democrat said she was proud of her record on 
the environment education human services and keeping vermonts 
budgets in balance 
she gave special attention to the progress she said her three 
terms as governor represented for women 
we have made history here in vermont we have shown that women 
are strong and capable leaders we are tough we are 
compassionate and we are fine managers of the public trust kunin 
said to prolonged applause 
the decision immediately gave frontrunner status to former gov 
richard snelling a republican who was kunins predecessor 
snelling served four terms as governor before opting not to run 
in 1984 in that election kunin narrowly defeated thenattorney 
general john easton to become the states first woman governor 
kunin 56 had been unsure whether she would run this year at 
times saying she was leaning in favor of running at times backing 
off from such a statement she was elected to the first of her 
three twoyear terms in 1984 
earlier she had said her decision would come at the end of the 
legislative session which is still several weeks away 
the decision will leave democrats scrambling to find a 
candidate the most likely ones are lt gov howard dean and former 
state sen peter welch a democrat from windsor 
im glad she made the decision because it will be easier for 
somebody else to make a decision at this point said state 
democratic party chairwoman vi coffin adding she was sad and 
disappointed that kunin had decided not to seek reelection 
kunin has had a rough third term with state revenues falling 
and the prospects of deficits rising she has also seen herself 
become the object of attacks from those who feel she has too 
strongly pushed state initiatives 
kunin a onetime journalist and college instructor served five 
years in the state house of representatives in the 1970s from 1979 
to 1982 she was lieutenant governor 
kunin said she planned to write a book and devote more time to 
her personal life away from what she said was an 80 or 
90houraweek job as governor 
i want to write a book i want to develop new ideas and 
strategies on global environmental issues and i want to continue 
to inspire women to reach their full capacity 
she said she agonized over her decision on whether to seek 
another term power is difficult to release voluntarily it is 
also difficult to walk away from a fight

robert alton harris came within 12 hours of 
the gas chamber but said only oh thanks after the us supreme 
court refused to allow californias first execution in 23 years a 
prison spokesman says 
the court monday voted 63 against lifting a stay of execution 
issued by a federal judge last week the ruling sent the double 
murderers case back to the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
which today agreed to a speededup hearing in the case 
his reaction was very calm san quentin prison spokesman lt 
cal white said monday he just said oh thanks and remained 
very calm 
family visiting him jumped up and embraced him some even 
cried white added but he remained very calm throughout the 
whole thing 
harris 37 was sentenced to die for the 1978 kidnap and murder 
of two 16yearolds whose car he stole to use in a 3000 bank 
robbery he would have been the first person put to death in 
california since 1967 and deathpenalty opponents had feared his 
execution would open the floodgates on capital punishment 
the ruling pleased those opponents and frustrated prosecutors 
and relatives of harris victims 
kathryn mayeski sanders the mother of victim john mayeski 
said we see how the justice system works the execution should 
have happened 11 years ago 
everybody protects the criminals but what about us asked 
linda herring of escondido calif sister of victim michael baker 
harris was to have died at 3 am today but federal appeals 
judge john noonan halted the execution on friday citing arguments 
that harris did not get adequate psychiatric help at his trial 
harris claims to have mental disorders stemming from childhood 
abuse 
prosecutors immediately asked the supreme court to lift the stay 
of execution arguing that harris had the help of two distinguished 
psychiatrists 
while the supreme court turned that request down the appeals 
court today granted attorney general john van de kamps request to 
speed up its normal schedule for the case the appeals court 
ordered a hearing may 14 harris lawyers who normally would have 
45 days for their first written arguments must present them by 
april 13 
there is no deadline for the courts ruling however 
gov george deukmejian who as a state senator wrote the death 
penalty law lashed out at an incompetent federal judicial 
system 
but death penalty opponents who had planned a vigil outside the 
prison gates to protest the execution turned the event into a 
celebration about 300 people smiled as they referred to the 
courts decision to spare bobby 
vigil leader stephen souza who spent 33 nights outside the 
prison to protest capital punishment called the courts decision 
a small victory in the struggle for human rights and abolition of 
the death penalty 
i feel for the families of john mayeski and michael baker 
he said i know they are hurting but if we were to execute 
robert harris it would do nothing to bring them back 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and anthony m kennedy voted to let harris die

an annual survey shows a scant increase this 
year in the percentage of american newspaper reporters editors and 
photographers who are members of racial minorities 
the american society of newspaper editors survey made public 
tuesday said members of racial minorities make up 786 percent of 
the newsroom workforce an increase of threetenths of 1 percent 
over last year 
when the asnes annual survey on minority employment started in 
1978 blacks hispanics asians and american indians constituted 
395 percent of the news staffs the figure has risen gradually 
each year 
asne president loren ghiglione editor of the southbridge 
mass news said this years increase actually represented a 
setback since the number of minorities in the overall population 
probably grew at a faster pace 
in these tough economic times perhaps any increase in the 
percentage of people of color should be applauded ghiglione said 
but merv aubespin chairman of the asne minorities committee 
said the slight gain was embarrassing for our industry which 
prides itself on putting the spotlight on the ills of society 
newspapers survival depend on serving a changing 
constituency and minority journalists are essential to that 
effort aubespin said 
asne has adopted a goal of making newsroom staffs equivalent to 
the racial diversity of society as a whole by the year 2000 an 
estimated 16 percent of americans are nonwhite 
an indication that newspapers were trying to close the gap came 
in the surveys finding that 19 percent of entrylevel journalists 
were members of a racial minority last year the figure was 18 
percent 
the survey said minorities make up 46 percent of newsroom 
supervisors 8 percent of copy editors 87 percent of reporters 
and 107 percent of photographers 
all told the nations 1642 dailies employ 4467 members of 
minorities out of a total work force of 56884 
papers with no minority editorial staff members constituted 56 
percent of all dailies in 1987 55 percent in 1988 and 54 percent 
in 1989 and 1990 
most of the newspapers with only whites were smaller papers and 
most were in the midwest where fewer minorities live the survey 
showed they represent only 18 percent of total us newspaper 
circulation 
editors of small papers in parts of the country with few 
minority residents have said they rarely receive applications from 
nonwhites 
nearly half of the participating newspapers agreed to make their 
responses public of those these papers had news staffs of at 
least 20 percent minorities

another survey made public in connection with the societys 
annual meeting said 14 percent of the news sources quoted on the 
front pages of 20 newspapers during one month were women a survey 
of the same papers a year ago found 11 percent of quoted sources 
were women 
the survey on the appearance of women in photos and bylines and 
as news sources on front pages was commissioned by the asne human 
resources committee and the university of south californias media 
watch women and men associated with feminist betty friedan 
it showed that womens bylines appeared on an average of 28 
percent of stories in the 10 large and 10 smaller newspapers in the 
survey last year womens bylines appeared over 27 percent of 
stories 
women were featured in 32 percent of photos this year compared 
with 24 percent last year 
editors of surveyed newspapers were asked to comment 
i am damned if i can see what conclusions should be drawn from 
your findings the wisdom of the ages appears to cry out for 
silence said ben bradlee of the washington post 
janet chusmir executive editor of the miami herald said we 
arent happy with the representation of women in our news pages 
bylines or supervisory positions frankly no newspaper in the 
country should be 
but she added while my fellow editors and i can make changes 
in our staffs our bylines our commitment to pluralistic coverage 
we cant change the gender of the male public figures in this 
country 
tom kelsch surveying the photos on the front pages of his 
paper the sunjournal of lewiston maine expressed gratitude for

soldiers and police in armored 
vehicles patrolled on tuesday in natal province where a week of 
black factional fighting has killed scores of people 
black leader nelson mandela said his supporters doubted the 
neutrality and effectiveness of the security forces 
armored patrols moved through edendale valley in the 
southeastern province where a 4yearold battle for supremacy 
between two rival black groups has grown to virtual civil war 
police said at least 55 people had been killed in the past week 
university of natal researchers put the death toll at 80 and 
accused inkatha a relatively conservative zulu group of a 
systematic coordinated and concerted onslaught 
another police report tuesday said 13 more people had been 
killed most of them in black factional fighting elsewhere in the 
country but gave few details 
the struggle in natal is between inkatha headed by zulu 
homeland leader mangosuthu buthelezi and supporters of mandelas 
african national congress guerrilla movement 
after a twody visit to troubled black townships in natal 
mandela said tuesday it was encouraging to see president fw 
de klerk concerned about the situation 
he added however unilateral action by the government without 
consulting acknowledged black leaders is bound to be ineffective 
regardless of merit 
de klerk and mandela are scheduled to meet thursday about ways 
to stop the worst outbreak of violence in south africa since the 
mid1980s hundreds of people have been killed in the past two 
months 
mandela said many of his supporters believe the police support 
inkatha 
there is a deeply entrenched perception that the police are 
directly involved in the violence that is raging in this 
province he said 
about 4000 people have been killed in natal since 1986 but 
there have been few prosecutions most neutral observers have 
blamed both inkatha and anc supporters for the violence 
the university of natal researchers claimed inkatha was 
responsible for the latest fighting they said more than 2000 
inkatha warriors took part in one attack last week 
mandela defended the anc decision to cancel april 11 peace talks 
with the government the cancellation was to protest the killing of 
at least 11 blacks when police fired on demonstrators march 26 at 
sebokeng a township south of johannesburg 
if whites had been killed white south africa would be 
screaming at the top of its voice but because its blacks whites 
think it is not important he said 
more than 12000 refugees most of them women and children have 
fled the edendale area and are being sheltered in camps police 
reported they said rival mobs had burned hundreds of houses in the 
area 
civil servants continued strikes tuesday in the gazankulu and 
venda black homelands officials in gazankulu said 29 people were 
killed and more than 200 huts burned during unrest last month 
on monday de klerk ordered a major effort by security forces to 
end the violence in natal and elsewhere 
measures include reinforcing army and police units setting up 
roadblocks arresting more people and arranging for extra courts to 
handle cases related to the unrest 
de klerk legalized the anc and other outlawed black opposition 
groups in february and released mandela who had spent 27 years in 
prison

20000 australians will die this year from diseases related to 
smoking an increase of more than 10 percent in three years 
tobacco is the leading addictive substance causing death and 
premature mortality in australia said the study by the health 
department of the state of western australia 
the study was released at the opening of the seventh world 
conference on smoking and health it also said 9652 smokers in 
australia will develop cancer this year and that 100000 others 
will be hospitalized with other health problems 
australians will lose 100000 premature years of life from 
smoking in 1990 alone the study said 
federal health minister dr neal blewett among 800 experts from 
70 countries at the conference said 18000 australians died during 
1987 as a direct result of smoking the figure represents 71 
percent of all drugcaused deaths he said 
in a keynote address at the fourday conference blewett said 
lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking is set to overtake breast 
cancer as the most common form of malignancy among australian women 
by the early 1990s 
he said that while lung cancer mortality rates among men had 
fallen over the last 30 years the death rate among women continued 
to rise 
blewett said australia was at the forefront of the battle 
against tobacco which led the labor government of prime minister 
bob hawke to ban smoking in all federal buildings federally 
controlled hospitals and on domestic flights

lithuanias chief diplomat said tuesday he 
believes the soviet army may have taken the lead role from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in dealing with his countrys 
independence crisis 
stasys lozaraitis jr told a news conference that the soviet 
military show of force in lithuania has made him more pessimistic 
than before about his countrys fate and added 
maybe the army is very unhappy with the situation in the 
baltic and is doing something he cannot control and cannot stop 
lozaraitis said referring to the closing of lithuanias borders 
with poland the seizure of government offices and the buildup of 
troops and armored vehicles 
i dont know if mr gorbachev is really in control of these 
actions he said 
lozaraitis who is lithuanias envoy in the united states has 
been made his countrys ambassadoratlarge he has been authorized 
to act for the lithuanian parliament if it has been silenced 
during a news conference at the former lithuanian embassy here 
lozaraitis said he is disappointed with western europes lukewarm 
support for his countrys declaration of independence 
lozaraitis who returned this week from a trip through both 
western and eastern europe said support for lihuanian independence 
is far greater in the east 
i have the impression that in western europe they were living 
in a very calm pacific period and they were getting rich and 
that these upheavals in eastern europe are worrying them he said 
they think any change in eastern europe is frightfully 
dangerous he said there are sympathetic attitudes but great 
caution 
he called on president bush to indicate more clearly that he 
supports lithuanian independence and to grant formal diplomatic 
recognition 
he said he is ready to discuss lithuanias fate directly with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who is here to hold 
talks with president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
if he wants to see me im here and i will be very glad to 
meet him lozaraitis said 
i am today not so optimistic because i dont understand mr 
gorbachev he said i think he is acting like a man with the 
mentality of the 19th century you dont solve a problem with 
troops and armored cars 
lithuania is ready for a full discussion of all issues with 
moscow but will not renounce independence lozaraitis said 
if we were to renounce independence it would be like saying 
shoot yourself kill yourself and then come to talk to us he 
said and added we cant do that 
he said moscows call on lithuania to follow the new soviet law 
of secession is a trap because of its requirements of a 
twothirds approval vote by lithuanian voters and the soviet 
parliament followed by a fiveyear waiting period 
they ask us why not wait he said we have waited for 
years and years 
if independence were reverse everything we did for the last 
50 years has no significance he said we cant discuss this 
fundamental and essential question 
but he made clear lithuania is willing to slow the process if 
moscow needs time for its own internal political reasons 
if moscow needs time let them sit down and tell us about it 
he said 
in the meantime he said the lithuanian people will exercise 
patience and restraint

the us postal service board of governors 
approved spending 3793 million tuesday on new letter sorting 
machines 
the board meeting in raleigh nc voted to launch the program 
that will lead to barcoding of all mail by 1995 
bar codes are a series of thin lines similar to those used in 
supermarket pricing 
the money approved tuesday will cover purchase of 1349 
automatic barcode reading machines which can sort mail carrying 
the codes it is the first of a threephase program to make the 
coding universal 
bar codes already are being used in sorting much business mail 
and the company sending the mail applies the codes in the lower 
corner of the letter 
the new machines will be able to read a code anywhere on the 
face of the letter an advantage which is expected to encourage 
more businesses to use the codes 
individuals will not be expected to place barcodes on their 
mail however by the mid1990s the postal service will begin 
placing the codes on letters that do not have them to allow the 
material to be sorted by machine

iraqs declaration that it possesses 
advanced chemical weapons is part of the legitimate right of 
selfdefense king hussein said tuesday 
plo chief yasser arafat also supported president saddam hussein 
of iraq who said monday that iraq possessed deadly nerve gas 
weapons and would use them to destroy half of israel if the 
israelis attacked 
saddam said iraq developed the weapons during its eightyear war 
with iran in which a ceasefire was reached in august 1988 but 
did not use them 
it is iraqs legitimate right to defend itself against any 
assault aimed at its existance and its development king hussein 
said in remarks distributed tuesday by petra the official 
jordanian news agency 
president saddam hussein did not direct any threats against 
anybody but he affirmed his capabilities to face any concealed 
aggression said the king who supported iraq in the war with 
iran 
the iraq news agency quoted arafat as saying in tunis where the 
palestine liberation organization has its headquarters we say to 
our brother saddam go ahead god save you we are all with you 
until the palestinian flag flutters above the liberated walls of 
jerusalem 
king hussein and saddam are said to be close and often exchange 
private visits with egypt and north yemen they formed an economic 
alliance in february 1989 called the arab cooperation council 
jordanian television said foreign ministers of the council 
nations would hold an emergency meeting in amman thursday to 
discuss the british campaign against iraq and other threats against 
arab nations 
in his remarks the king criticized israel for not signing the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty unlike iraq which was keen to 
join and endorse the agreement 
despite this he said criticism is directed at iraq instead of 
israel the only nuclear state in the middle east which 
simply means that there are planned hostile intentions behind this 
campaign 
he said the campaign was a result of iraqs victory in 
defending its national soil and the arab regimes 
husseins apparent reference was to british criticism of iraqs 
execution of farzad bazoft an iranianborn british journalist 
convicted last month of spying for britain and israel 
britain also deported an iraqi airlines official accused of 
involvement in an attempt to smuggle trigger devices to iraq that 
could be used in nuclear weapons the alleged smuggling plot was 
uncovered by a joint usbritish operation 
iraq denied it was developing the ability to make nuclear 
weapons

the runoff campaign between two democrats 
vying for governor began with talk of a peace treaty but that 
didnt last long 
heading into the april 10 primary runoff treasurer ann richards 
and attorney general jim mattox have attacked each other on 
personal finances and drug use with only a gaffe by the republican 
candidate to remind them of their common foe 
the two cannot even agree on when to disagree in a debate 
if ann richards is not tough enough to stand up and debate jim 
mattox and to answer the questions that are on the voters minds 
how is she going to be tough enough to stand up to the problems 
facing our state demanded mattox who has accused ms richards 
of refusing to debate him to avoid questions about drugs 
ms richards said she isnt trying to duck anything except the 
mud being thrown by mattox 
this campaign has taken on the predictable form that jim 
mattox campaigns always take whatever trash he can throw to try to 
detract from his poor performance he will do that and i expect it 
to continue until election day she said 
the ugly tone followed a bruising primary in which ms richards 
narrowly edged mattox 39 percent to 37 percent 
the primary dashed the comeback hopes of the thirdplace 
finisher former gov mark white who was so upset he called a news 
conference today to bitterly denounce ms richards he said her 
tactics would make himmler blush alluding to the nazi leader 
heinrich himmler 
i will never endorse ann richards i will never support ann 
richards and i will never vote for ann richards white told a 
capitol news conference 
he stopped short short of endorsing mattox over ms richards in 
the democratic runoff but did say he would be voting in that race 
earlier white met with gop nominee clayton williams he said 
today his pledge not to vote for ms richards would stand if she is 
the nominee in the fall but he declined to specify whether he 
would vote for williams or just sit the election out 
peace talks between the mattox and richards campaigns began 
shortly after the march 13 vote and went well enough that texas 
democratic chairman bob slagle voiced optimism that the runoff 
would be a positive campaign 
but their attacks have grown more bruising 
mattox has accused ms richards of using illegal drugs 10 years 
ago he offered no evidence but said his opponent must address the 
issue 
she doesnt want to give a simple yes or no about cocaine 
about marijuana about other hallucinogens she must answer what 
she used how much for how long and who supplied them he said 
the 56yearold ms richards a recovering alcoholic passed a 
drug test and challenged mattox to do the same 
she also asked mattox to follow her example and disclose his 
income tax returns ms richards said there are tough questions 
that mattox is ducking such as how he could borrow 14 million 
on a 75000 government salary 
neither of the survivors has developed a clear lead heading into 
the runoff 
downplaying the campaigns tone democratic leaders say either 
ms richards or mattox will make a better candidate than williams 
who is trying to escape the fallout from a remark he made march 24 
likening bad weather to rape 
if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it williams said 
during a cattle roundup 
although he apologized a day later womens groups have 
protested and mattox and richards sharply criticized the republican 
clayton williams campfire gaffe is just the tip of the 
iceberg and after his socalled joke people are going to be 
looking very closely at him said ed martin the state democratic 
partys executive director 
it was one of the few things on which the two democratic 
gubernatorial hopefuls agreed

israel is taking seriously iraqi president 
saddam husseins threat to use chemical weapons with some 
officials calling for a gas mask in every house 
but the new middle east tensions are not likely to produce any 
immediate military conflict 
one reason is that the signals coming from israeli officials 
indicate there will be no attempt at this point to launch a 
preemptive strike like the june 1981 air raid on iraqs osirak 
nuclear plant 
i think the message here is cool things down dont get into 
unnecessary escalation and a misreading of intentions said dore 
gold a middle east analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee center 
for strategic studies 
officials in jerusalem have issued statements stressing israel 
has no aggressive intentions and noting a preemptive strike 
would not be riskfree as it was in 1981 because iraq now has 
missiles and warplanes that could reach israel 
also while there is concern about iraqs nuclear program it 
does not seem to be on the verge of producing an atomic weapon as 
israel claimed in 1981 
jaffee center expert joe alpher said iraqs nuclear development 
was five to 10 years away while space agency head yuval neeman 
estimated that it was three to five years in the offing 
israels reaction for now appeared confined to a strong 
showing of its technological superiority the launch of the ofek2 
satellite which required a powerful missile and sophisticated 
electronic capabilities 
analysts in israel believe iraq is also unlikely to initiate a 
military action because it would invite massive israeli retaliation 
i dont think the iraqi motivation for this verbal escalation 
is a desire to fight with israel at this point said alpher 
it seems to us that the iraqis are more concerned with the 
internal situation in iraq he added suggesting the sharpness of 
saddams threat to eat half of israel may have been an attempt 
to divert attention from social unrest at home 
writing in the liberal haaretz newspaper military commentator 
zeev shiff said saddams tough words may have been ill temper over 
the arrest in britain of his agents who were while trying to 
smuggle electronic triggers that could be used for atomic weapons 
alpher said the iraqi presidents record was a reason for 
concern both because he has used chemical weapons in the past and 
because he ignored the high costs in starting a war with iran 
because he is unpredictable and has a record for taking on 
more than he can chew we have to be concerned and be prepared and 
to take him seriously said alpher said 
gold said the iraqi leaders remarks should shift the focus of 
concern away from the palestinian uprising to the overall 
arabisraeli conflict 
saddam hussein has thrust the larger arabisraeli conflict 
back onto the world agenda after the intefadeh palestinian 
uprising seemed to put it into eclipse he said 
it will require reassessment by both the united states and 
israel of how to cope with the security challenge posed by iraq 
he added 
rightwing politicians like foreign minister moshe arens picked 
up on the theme saying the real obstacle to peace was arab 
radicalism and not israeli settlement building in jerusalem and the 
west bank 
where is the obstacle to peace in the middle east arens 
asked a mayors conference is it in jerusalem or is it in 
baghdad when saddam hussein says he has the chemical weaponry to 
wipe half of israel off the earth 
although the threat of military conflict seemed distant a 
variety of officials stressed that israel should step up its 
preparedness 
michael dekel an aide to caretaker prime minister yitzhak 
shamir urged the government to order the immediate disribution of 
gas masks to every home 
for the past two years israel has been holding drills to train 
the 15 million school children about defense against chemical 
weapon attack it issued gas masks throughout two towns on an 
experimental basis 
the israeli army has protective clothing for gas attacks but 
the current instructions for civilians are to remain indoors seal 
a room as much as possible and put on a gas mask 
even new israeli telephone books give instructions on what to do 
in case of a gas attack 
dekel said iraqs threats meant the program should be speeded 
up we need to prepare the civilian population not only with 
practice but with equipment in the case of surprise attack he 
said

wisconsin voters went to the polls 
tuesday to decide whether to limit the governors unusually strong 
veto power and whether a state supreme court justice should be 
replaced by a deaf challenger 
in northern wisconsin state rep jim holperin faced republican 
brian sherren in a recall election stemming from a sometimes 
violent dispute over indians rights to hunt fish and cut timber 
outside their reservations 
on ballots elsewhere were a trash recycling proposal in kansas 
city mo and a plan to increase st louis hotelmotel tax by 35 
percent to help fund a planned 70000seat 250 million domed 
stadium 
in bismarck nd 18yearold high school senior lee palmer was 
among three candidates running for mayor 
in tulsa okla 20 people sought nine city council seats and 
two ran for mayor in a new strong mayorcouncil form of government 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
filed a lawsuit claiming the old commission form of government 
denied blacks a voice in decisionmaking 
wisconsins socalled vanna white veto has allowed gov 
tommy g thompson to rewrite legislation by striking words and even 
letters punctuation and numerals 
foes of the veto power nicknamed for the letterflipping 
hostess of the television game show wheel of fortune said it 
gives legislative power to the executive branch violating the 
constitutional separation of powers 
a constitutional amendment on tuesdays ballot would bar the 
governor from using his veto to strike letters to change the 
meaning of legislation the governor could still strike words 
numerals or entire sentences 
in wisconsins state supreme court race state appeals judge 
richard brown who is deaf challenged justice donald steinmetz for 
a 10year term browns deafness wasnt an issue but the unusually 
hotly contested campaign included sparring over abortion court 
workloads and campaign funding 
in northern wisconsin state rep jim holperin faced republican 
brian sherren in a recall sparked by critics of chippewa 
spearfishing who said holperin had lost touch with his constituents 
over the issue that has caused five years of unrest indian treaty 
rights 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the firstterm republican governor defended his authority to 
selectively eliminate letters and urged voters to retain it 
the state constitution gives the governor the right to veto any 
appropriation bill in part 
thompsons most famous vanna veto was when he reworked a 
bill in 1988 that limited the time a juvenile could be held in 
detention to 48 hours the governor boosted the limit to 10 days by 
crossing out 48 hours and most of the bills next four lines 
leaving intact only the word day and four other strategically 
placed letters ten days 
the governors record 290 partial vetoes in the 198789 state 
budget many of which changed appropriations bills by striking 
numbers and letters or merging words so angered democrats that 
they sued thompson in 1988 they lost in the state supreme court 
supreme court challenger brown a district judge since 1978 
accused incumbent steinmetz 65 of backing out of a televised 
debate because he didnt want to discuss abortion the environment 
and the supreme court workload 
steinmetz said the judicial code of ethics prevented him from 
stating his personal position of issues but he was endorsed by the 
political action committee on wisconsin right to life 
the wisconsin recall was rooted in a 1983 federal court ruling 
that said wisconsins six chippewa bands retained the right to 
fish hunt cut timber and gather food on offreservation public 
lands under 19thcentury treaties that ceded northern wisconsin to 
the us government the ruling is under appeal 
recall organizers primarily stop treaty abusewisconsin were 
especially critical of holperins support last year for a 10year 
multimilliondollar payment to the lac du flambeau chippewa in 
return for the band limiting their exercise of treaty rights the 
tribe rejected the pact 
on march 6 holperin got 69 percent of the vote in winning a 
democratic recall primary afterward holperins defeated opponent 
said people were not as upset about treaty rights as he had thought 
in north dakota palmer entered the race at the urging of his 
bismarck high school journalism class because he was willing to run 
for mayor and met the minimum age requirement

two jurors deliberating irancontra charges 
against john poindexter were contacted by the news media the trial 
judge disclosed today he ordered the jury sequestered because of 
the irresponsible behavior of the press 
us district judge harold greene said the jurors hung up on the 
reporters they were alert and intelligent he said 
greene ruled that the jurors leroy witherspoon and william 
harris would continue to participate in the deliberations which 
began monday poindexters lawyer richard beckler said he had no 
objection 
the judge said that some now might think this contact during 
jury deliberations was an obstruction of justice i will think 
about that 
witherspoon told a hearing today that washington post reporter 
nora boustany telephoned him late monday afternoon just as he 
arrived home from jury deliberations he said she wanted to know 
when the jury would deliver a verdict he hung up on her but she 
called back he hung up again he testified 
greene said he was told the reporter had just come to the united 
states from lebanon and didnt know the ground rules 
greene called that a lame excuse 
i have no confidence that these rules will be obeyed said 
greene i understand the post has many more reporters ready to 
call the jurors said the judge none of us has any confidence 
that these regulations will be observed 
i have decided to sequester the jury greene said the 
irresponsible behavior of the press leaves me no alternative 
asked about boustanys call to the juror bob kaiser the posts 
assistant managing editor for national news said she made a 
mistake 
kaiser said editors instructed boustany to find out how to get 
in touch with witherspoon after the verdict was decided in the 
trial 
she did this by calling him up to ask him said kaiser 
we immediately called judge greens chambers to tell them what 
had happened and to apologize kaiser said 
kaiser said the second juror was not contacted by a post 
reporter 
harris said he hung up on a woman who called monday night 
identifying herself as a reporter it was not immediately known 
what news organization she represented 
the judges order means that jurors will be brought to the us 
courthouse each day by deputy us marshals and will be housed at a 
hotel by the government until they reach a verdict 
jurors deliberated for four hours monday afternoon after 
receiving final instructions about the law from greene 
their first note to the judge requested more than 50 trial 
exhibits admitted into evidence during the threeweek trial as 
well as copies of the judges instructions and the fivecount 
indictment against poindexter 
poindexter who was national security adviser to thenpresident 
reagan from late 1985 to november 1986 is accused of five counts 
of conspiracy to obstruct congress making false statements to 
lawmakers and obstructing congressional inquiries 
the indictment charges that he lied to congressional committees 
by denying in 1986 that white house aide oliver l north was 
orchestrating private military aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
at a time direct us assistance was banned by congress 
after the usiran armsforhostages deals were disclosed in 
the fall of that year poindexter is accused of lying to congress 
by saying he was unaware of a 1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft 
missiles to iran until two months after it occurred 
prosecutors contended that poindexter lied about this shipment 
to conceal the existence of a politically embarrassing document 
signed by reagan that described the arms deal as part of an effort 
to free us hostages believed to be held in lebanon 
the prosecution argued that poindexter tore up the document 
after lying to congress to prevent its disclosure just eight days 
after the president assured the american people he had not traded 
arms for hostages 
beckler argued that poindexter did everything he could to give 
congress the facts it sought denying that his client ever broke 
the law

estonia declared support tuesday for 
the declaration of independence by its baltic neighbor lithuania 
and appealed to mikhail s gorbachev to end military and political 
pressure against lithuania 
the estonian supreme soviet or parliament also elected edgar 
savisaar the chairman of the estonian peoples front as premier 
that effectively put the estonian government in the hands of the 
grassroots political movement that has been pressing for 
independence 
savisaar 40 a former teacher and member of the estonian 
planning commission received 54 votes one more than he needed for 
a majority in the 105member assembly 
savisaar told deputies he would present a list of cabinet 
members next week and pledged cooperation with all ethnic groups 
but sources said the new government is unlikely to include any 
of the 27 legislators representing the nonestonian population 
tensions between ethnic estonians who make up some 60 percent 
of estonias 16 million people and the other nationalities were 
apparent in tuesdays session 
delegations from the northeast city of sillamae a largely 
slavic area said they would not accept a declaration by the 
supreme soviet on friday that estonia is an occupied state they 
also called on gorbachev to protect the rights of all soviet 
citizens 
estonia said it would seek to reestablish independence at the 
end of a stillundefined transition period 
viktor andreyev deputy chairman of the estonian supreme soviet 
said he would demand a referendum if estonia pushes for 
independence 
unlike lithuania the estonians are treading a more careful line 
on secession and have called on moscow to start negotiations 
but they gave their backing to lithuanias march 11 declaration 
of independence they said the realization of independence was not 
a domestic matter of the soviet union but a matter of 
international character 
the estonian supreme soviet urged gorbachev to support 
negotiations on an equal footing between the soviet union and 
the lithuania 
it is necessary to stop without delay the military pressure 
from the soviet side and political provocations the purpose of 
which is to perpetuate the occupation of the lithuanian 
republic the declaration said 
moscow has set armored vehicles rumbling through the lithuanian 
capital vilnius and has arrested a handful of the hundreds of 
lithuanian deserters who have left the soviet military 
the estonian declaration adopted 7122 also offered estonias 
cooperation with lithuania but did not elaborate 
on monday legislators decided not to participate in debate in 
the national supreme soviet parliament in moscow on legislation 
concerning the status of soviet republics and secession 
that would amount to recognition of the illegal annexation of 
the republic of estonia a supreme soviet statement said 
instead the legislature decided to send two observers to the 
talks 
tiit made an independent deputy and leading economic reformer 
said he did not believe moscow would use force to stop the baltic 
drive for independence 
what can they do to us no the tanks wont come made said 
we have put the idea to moscow and now we just have to wait long 
enough for them to think its their own 
the three baltic republics including latvia were independent 
from the end of world war i until josef stalin annexed them in 1940 
savisaar ran unopposed but other candidates would have been 
nominated if he did not receive a majority vote savisaar replaces 
indrik toome elected head of the supreme soviets foreign affairs 
committee on monday

harris county commissioners were considering a 
resolution tuesday to renumber precinct 666 because some residents 
are threatening to boycott elections if the number wasnt changed 
precinct 666 was established jan 1 with about 1500 residents 
who once lived in precinct 470 
some suburban deer park residents view the number as symbolic of 
the antichrist referred to in the bible 
deer park is a fairly conservative religious community and 
its just a stigma they dont want said harvey petree a deer 
park councilman who lives in the precinct 
petree said he has fielded a dozen or so complaints from 
residents who have threatened to stop voting if the number is 
retained 
i dont believe it should be the intention of elected city and 
county officials to discourage voting and thats the effect it has 
had he said

the pentagon on tuesday partially lifted the 
veil of secrecy surrounding the futuristic f117a stealth fighter 
bomber in an attempt to boost confidence in the handling of 
topsecret weapons programs 
with the release of an 8minute videotape a series of 10 
photographs and two fact sheets the pentagon revealed it has spent 
626 billion to develop and build 59 of the dark deltawinged 
aircraft that translates into a 1062 million perplane cost 
although the plane has been flying since 1981 the pentagon 
refused to even acknowledge it existed until november 1988 
the fighter which is about the size of the f15 eagle fighter 
jet was designed to penetrate any radar defense and bomb targets 
before enemy forces can react 
pentagon spokesman pete williams confirmed that three f117as 
have crashed over the years and that two pilots died he declined 
to say what caused the problems 
but he hailed the f117a program as a successful venture that 
demonstrates the pentagon can develop and build reliable hightech 
aircraft in a classified environment 
i think its persuaded us that fullscale development program 
can be used very successfully he said when asked if he meant 
the secret funding programs known as the pentagons black 
budget williams responded yes 
the release of the information comes amid weakening support in 
congress for the air forces b2 stealth bomber program and as the 
service is developing yet another supersecret aircraft the 
supersonic advance tactical fighter 
many in congress expressed sticker shock last year when the 
b2s longclassified figures revealed its 530 million perplane 
price tag raising questions about the pentagons use of such 
black budget programs 
williams defended the pentagons success with the f117a amid 
such controversies 
the f117a program tells us stealth can be developed can be 
used on an operational aircraft is a successful technology that 
it works williams said 
while pointing out that the stealth fighter has a tactical 
mission and the b2 stealth bomber is used for longerrange or 
strategic targets williams argued that the radarevading stealth 
characteristics help to make us one of the most capable air 
forces in the world 
the aircraft got its first combat mission in december two of 
the aircraft bombed a field near a panamanian defense forces 
barracks to stun and confuse the panamanians while us 
paratroopers landed nearby 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee derided the use of the plane as show biz by military 
officers eager to show off their sophisticated weaponry 
lockheed corp won the contract to build 59 of the 
singlepilot twoengine jets in 1978 and the first planes were 
delivered in 1982 the last two jets still under construction will 
be delivered in the fall of 1990 an air force statement said 
although the pentagon had touted its efforts to declassify much 
of the information about the plane williams said he was unable to 
disclose the jets speed exact range weapons payload or just how 
much of the aircraft can be seen on radar 
nor would he say if the plane is capable of carrying nuclear 
weapons 
the spokesman did however describe the jet as being capable of 
flying in the high subsonic range or about 600 mph 
he refused to say whether the jet could carry airtoair 
weaponry but did say it is carries the full range of tactical 
fighter ordnance and is capable of defending itself 
the singlepilot dual engine plane weighs 52500 pounds its 
wingspan is just a little over 43 feet it is just over 65 feet 
long but only 12 feet 5 inches high the pentagon said 
the socalled stealth technology in popular understanding 
refers to design and materials that reduce the ability of enemy 
radar to detect the craft 
this can be achieved by using designs that avoid the direct 
impact of radar and by using composite materials that can absorb 
the radars energy 
the packet distributed to reporters included a series of 
photographs of the plane showing its angled exterior and slim 
profile in flight and on the a desert runway 
because the aircraft are going to be used more openly the air 
force has proposed that the planes be moved from the tonopah test 
range to the air force base at holloman nm where its personnel 
can live nearby and not be flown in by commuter aircraft an air 
force official said

union members were offered companypaid trips 
to washington to oppose provisions of proposed clean air 
legislation that were backed by the united steelworkers union 
officials said tuesday 
about 150 workers many from usx corp facilities attended the 
rally on the capitol steps tuesday as the senate began moving 
toward passage of the legislation 
usx said it paid the expenses of its workers who attended 
we look at this as sponsoring a rally for employees who have 
expressed concern about this legislation and what it might mean for 
them and their families said company spokesman ernie glenn 
the union leadership had tried to persuade members not to join 
the rally 
the steel companies are attempting to take advantage of our 
basic steel local unions by planning an allexpenses companypaid 
rally in washington union president lynn williams said in a memo 
to union directors across the country last week 
it is not a rally which the united steelworkers of america 
supports the steel companies are not themselves opposing the act 
but are using our members to front for them 
charlie grese president of the local at the usx plant in 
clairton pa said in a telephone interview that he changed his 
mind about attending after speaking to williams and other union 
officials 
theres no question we were about ready to come down grese 
said i told the company i would have to take this past the 
international union and would not come down without authorization 
from the international president 
demonstrators at the rally opposed a portion of the legislation 
requiring that people living near steel plant coke ovens not be 
exposed to a cancer risk of more than 1in10000 over 70 years 
they expressed concern that such a guideline was unrealistic 
and could force the mandatory shutdown of dozens of coke ovens 
coke which comes from coal is a raw material of steel coke 
ovens can emit benzene a carcinogen 
while the major steel companies oppose the bill the union says 
the measure provides enough time and leeway for steelmakers to 
avoid hardships 
under the bill steel companies that make extraordinary efforts 
to control leakage from coke ovens would be given until 2020 before 
noncomplying ovens would be closed

sen mark hatfield in an emotional plea for 
increased money for alzheimers research told congress tuesday how 
the disease had affected his powerful father 
television actresses angie dickinson and shelley fabares also 
testified about how alzheimers has hurt their families and urged 
increased spending on research of the disease 
the actresses were upstaged by the oregon republican who drew 
loud applause during a hearing before the house select committee on 
aging and the senate labor and human resources committee 
the panels are considering legislation that would double and 
eventually triple the 148 million a year the government now spends 
on research into alzheimers disease alzheimers is a mental 
disorder which strikes older people medical science has found no 
cure for it 
he was a man of extraordinary strength he was a blacksmith in 
the days of the anvil bellows and hammer said hatfield in 
relating the story of his father who worked 40 years for the 
southern pacific railroad 
he said his father remained active and jogged daily at the age 
of 80 
then one day my mother got a telephone call from a woman who 
said your husband is here and he has lost his way back home 
that was the first indication that something was awry hatfield 
said 
my father insisted on jogging every day and more frequently 
than not my mother would have to pick him up a block from our home 
where he had lost his way he said 
hatfield said he had a difficult time deciding whether to visit 
his father while he spent the last four years of his life in a 
health care facility 
he did not know who i was i tried to decide whether it was 
worth it to see this powerful man reduced to almost nothing a 
vegetable or whether i would feel better if i would just go on 
home 
out of a sense of duty and love i always stopped to see him 
so you could say i speak from experience about alzheimers the 
senator said 
hatfield said the state of oregon is moving toward centralized 
research and services for victims of alzheimers and their families 
last year 29000 taxpayers used a checkoff on their state 
income tax form to donate 140000 in tax refunds for alzheimers 
programs said hatfield 
dickinson an actress who starred in movies as well as the 
longrunning television series police woman said alzheimers 
should be treated like other diseases with government programs and 
insurance coverage 
alzheimers disease has touched my life through my beautiful 
sister mary lou belmont and i have to tell you it has changed my 
life forever she said 
alzheimers is more horrible and horrendous than most of us 
can imagine its victims dont know where they are she said 
dickinison said her sister has an early stage of alzheimers and 
now has daily care but eventually will need roundtheclock care 
fabares costar of the television series coach said she 
and her sister recently made the hardest decision they have ever 
made by placing their mother in a nursing home 
one of the worst memories is of my mother opening her mouth 
hitting her cheeks and pointing desperately at her tongue then 
breaking into tears she could no longer speak she knew in stages 
what was happening to her but she was trapped inside her own 
body fabares said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said a new study indicates the 
disease affects 4 million americans double earlier estimates he 
said by the middle of the next century 14 million americans will 
have the disease 
with alzheimers disease costing society over 88 billion a 
year it is becoming the biggest of the misery diseases plaguing 
and impoverishing older americans and the families who care for 
them said rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the 
committee on aging 
he said a federal commitment to fighting alzheimers is long 
overdue

the soviet government tuesday turned up 
the pressure on independenceminded lithuania by restricting 
traffic at the republics border with poland 
the polish foreign ministry which announced the action said it 
was surprised by the soviet action the polish embassy in moscow 
was told to seek an urgent explanation from the soviets 
the polish foreign ministry reminds that free border traffic 
is regulated by international conventions which should be 
respected it said in a brief statement poland is ready for 
talks on this issue 
poland is the only country bordering lithuania the baltic forms 
a section of the republics western border 
soviet officials informed their polish counterparts that the 
crossing was temporarily closed tuesday morning the polish 
news agency pap said it did not say how long it would remain 
closed 
the agency said soviets and poles could continue crossing the 
border to return home 
the border crossing in the extreme northeast corner of poland 
between the polish town of ogrodniki and the lithuanian town of 
lazdijai can only be used by poles and soviet citizens 
poles sharing centuries of common history with lithuania have 
rejoiced in the republics drive to join poland in shaking off the 
soviet yoke imposed after world war ii 
after the march 11 independence declaration by lithuania polish 
officials offered vigorous support for the republics right to 
selfdetermination 
but the noncommunist polish government did not actually 
recognize the lithuanian government a move that could endanger 
relations with the soviets 
lithuania was the subject of lengthy debate monday in the 
solidarityled cabinet foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski 
reported no change in the polish position that the requirements 
to recognize the vilnius government have not yet been met and we 
recognize the lithuanian right to statehood 
the polish reaction has been complicated by the anxiety that 
surging lithuanian nationalism has caused among the 260000 ethnic 
poles in lithuanias population of 38 million 
poland and lithuania were linked from 1386 when a lithuanian 
ruler married a polish princess until 1795 when the commonwealth 
was broken by russia 
after world war i the newly independent states of poland and 
lithuania argued over vilnius where the population was largely 
polish and jewish poland finally seized vilnius and held it until 
world war ii 
when lithuania and poland fell under soviet domination the 
polish border was moved west and the polish population largely 
uprooted vilnius is now the capital of lithuania 
polish border officials had reported reduced traffic at the 
crossing recently on sunday 4039 people and 810 vehicles used 
the crossing pap said 
the agency also said despite the closing workers with valid 
soviet visas would still be permitted across the border for their 
jobs 
it said cargo transportation and train travel were continuing 
but that bus routes had been halted

imelda marcos attorney contended tuesday that 
george bush urged her husband to invest in us real estate and 
that the cia was aware of every transaction for which she is on 
trial on racketeering charges 
in opening arguments defense attorney gerald spence also said 
he plans to call bush as a witness 
the lawyer said that bush then the vice president was 
concerned about the marcoses negotiating an oil deal with libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi and suggested to marcos during a 1981 
meeting in manila why dont you invest in american properties 
the marcoses who saw themselves as children of america 
took the advice spence said they abandoned any further attempt 
to invest in libya and began to put their money into new york real 
estate 
in washington white house spokesman steve hart had no immediate 
comment on the attorneys statements 
earlier tuesday a prosecutor portrayed mrs marcos as an 
uncontrolled spender who treated the philippine national bank as 
her personal piggy bank 
the former philippines first lady and her late husband 
ferdinand were named in the 1988 indictment that charged them with 
stealing millions of dollars from their homelands treasury to buy 
manhattan real estate jewelry and art marcos died in exile in 
hawaii last september 
on trial with mrs marcos is saudi arms dealer adnan khashoggi 
spence said marcos was warned by the cia that he might not have 
enough money to marshal a force to recapture the philippines if it 
was taken over by the communist insurgency 
without going into specifics spence claimed that the cia was 
worried that the philippines would fall to the communists as cuba 
had been taken over by fidel castro 
the evidence in this case is that the cia was aware of every 
transaction that took place in this case spence said without 
giving details 
prosecutors objected repeatedly as spence gave a rambling 
discourse of philippine history us district judge john f keenan 
sharply rebuked the defense attorney several times 
at one point keenan told spence were not going to go back 
to philippine election campaigns were going to try the case 
before this court 
mrs marcos broke into tears as spence told the jury that she 
was a devoted wife committed to defending the honor of her late 
husband 
this is a woman who lived with her beloved husband for 35 
years she was with him in sickness and in health and when he took 
his last breath spence said it is her position i am going 
to defend my husband 
although spence said he was not going to use an innocentspouse 
defense he claimed mrs marcos 60 did not understand the 
intricacies of finance 
she would say over and over again ferdinand what is 
happening here what are you doing in this situation he said 
assistant us attorney debra livingston however told the 
jurors that the marcoses were partners in crime who had 
exported fraud on a colossal scale to the united states 
livingston said the couple grabbed from a dollarpoor country 
to satisfy imelda marcos voracious appetite for real estate 
jewelry and art 
the prosecutor repeatedly referred to mrs marcos 
multimilliondollar purchases implying greed was the 
motivation for the alleged fraud 
she said mrs marcos treated the new york branch of the 
philippine national bank as her own personal piggy bank every 
time she descended on new york she cracked it open taking 
bundles and bundles of cash 
livingston said the marcoses who earned modest salaries 
amassed great wealth in their homeland through kickbacks bribes 
and outright theft from the philippine treasury 
the money more than 160 million was then placed in secret 
bank accounts around the world before being transferred to shell 
corporations that acted as owners for four manhattan buildings the 
prosecutor charged 
they were not small apartment buildings she said they 
were three huge skyscrapers and a large shopping center one 
building was a gold encrusted skyscraper on fifth avenue 
livingston said the marcoses also defrauded banking institutions 
of 165 million to finance the upkeep of the properties 
the prosecutor said the gigantic web of fraud was held 
together by secrecy and accomplices who acted as fronts for the 
marcoses 
spence countered that argument by saying most people keep their 
business dealings private if everyone concerned with keeping 
their investments private were prosecuted this courthouse would be 
pretty busy he said 
livingston said khashoggi entered the conspiracy after marcos 
was ousted from power in 1986 and the new philippines government 
sued to recover the manhattan real estate 
she said khashoggi helped the marcoses bypass a court order that 
forbade any transfer of their holdings by creating false documents 
to make it appear he owned the four buildings and part of an art 
collection that was purchased with stolen funds 
if convicted of racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail 
fraud and obstruction of justice mrs marcos would face up to 50 
years in prison and a 1 million fine prosecutors also are seeking 
forfeiture of the alleged illegal proceeds 
khashoggi once described as the worlds richest man is being 
tried for mail fraud and obstruction of justice and would face up 
to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine if convicted 
the trial is expected to last three to four months

the house on tuesday voted to spend 6 million 
this year to expand the national registry of bone marrow donors 
the lives of many victims of leukemia aplastic anemia and other 
blood diseases can be saved with marrow transplants but many have 
died because a good match cannot be found in time 
the house by voice vote approved an amendment offered by rep 
bill young rfla to provide money to expand the national marrow 
donor program from its current registry of 90000 donors to about 
150000 
part of the money would go toward expanding the navys 
laboratories so volunteers throughout the military could be typed 
and listed about 45 million would be put toward registering 
other people who would volunteer but cant afford the 75 cost of 
the tests 
harry glenn youngs spokesman said it was estimated the navy 
would add up to 4000 people to the registry and the public effort 
about 60000 
the eventual goal was a registry of 250000 in the united states 
and a system for tying in with overseas lists of donors he said 
the marrow amendment was added to the house version of the 
fiscal 1990 supplemental appropriations bill

faced with congressional pressure attorney 
general dick thornburgh said tuesday he would ask the justice 
departments internal disciplinary unit to review the results of an 
fbi leak investigation 
thornburgh said the office of professional responsiblity would 
review the inconclusive results of an fbi probe of leaks about a 
criminal investigation involving alleged financial irregularities 
in the office of rep william gray iii dpa 
the leak to cbs news while gray was running for house majority 
whip last spring produced a storm of criticism from democrats on 
capitol hill who charged it was politically inspired 
it forced the justice department to take the unusual step of 
saying that gray was not a target of the investigation and was 
cooperating with the fbi 
the extensive leak investigation ordered by thornburgh failed to 
identify the source with certainty 
the attorney generals decision in december not to refer the 
matter to the opr for possible disciplinary action was criticized 
by several lawmakers including sen joseph r biden jr chairman 
of the senate judiciary committee 
at a hearing of the panel tuesday thornburgh told biden that he 
would ask opr to review the report produced by the fbi 
investigation 
i do not believe that the fbis investigation provided any 
basis for disciplinary action thornburgh told biden 
notwithstanding this view i have asked the office of 
professional responsiblity to review the report and to provide me 
with their advice 
at that point i will then assess whether any disciplinary 
action is warranted the attorney general said 
biden made the request during a meeting with the attorney 
general last week according to comments by both the senator and 
thornburgh 
asked after the hearing why he had reversed his previous 
positition thornburgh said there was an apparent 
misunderstanding of what my position was so i thought id better 
clear it up 
the department had stated previously that its regulations did 
not provide for turning over the results of a criminal 
investigation to opr which conducts internal probes of alleged 
impropriety by justice department lawyers 
opr has the power to conduct grand jury investigations of its 
own and to recommend that the attorney general take disciplinary 
action against specific employees 
in a march 7 letter to rep charles schumer dny chairman of 
the house criminal justice subcommittee the justice department 
said that the applicable 1980 regulation does not contemplate the 
referral of investigative findings in a mater appearing to involve 
a violation of law from the criminal division to opr 
the purpose for referring a report to opr is obviously to 
consider whether an individual whose misconduct was not serious 
enough to constitute a violation of law should nevertheless be 
subject to some disciplinary sanction said the letter by bruce 
c navarro acting assistant attorney general in charge of the 
office of legislative affairs 
consequently no further disciplinary investigation could form 
a basis upon which to consider disciplinary action navarro 
wrote forwarding the report of the investigation to opr would 
thus not serve any purpose

fines against fastfood restaurants and other 
businesses are climbing toward the 3 million mark for thousands of 
child labor law violations uncovered in a threeday federal sweep 
officials said tuesday 
one businessman called the effort by the labor department 
nitpicking and a crusade but spokeswoman johanna schneider 
said the departments responsibility is to enforce the letter of 
the law 
she said companies had the right to appeal the fines if they 
thought they were unfair 
the number of violations grew from 7000 to nearly 11000 after 
federal investigators gave the case files further review officials 
said the total is about half the number for all of 1989 
civil fines on the businesses involved are expected to total 
29 million up from the 18 million originally predicted 
following the march 1215 sweep said william brooks an assistant 
secretary of labor 
most of the violations involved teenagers working more hours or 
later hours during the school week than is allowed under federal 
law 
but there were also 1450 youngsters age 1417 who were 
illegally employed in dangerous jobs such as using powerdriven 
meatslicing machinery dough mixers and paperbalers the 
department said 
an arbys fast food restaurant in santa fe nm was fined 
12550 for various violations including some for putting 
youngsters to work in dangerous tasks a similar fine was levied 
against a sizzler steakhouse in omaha neb for the same type of 
violations officials said 
larry pabian who runs four sizzler steakhouses in omaha and one 
in lincoln said most of the violations came from a discrepancy 
between nebraska law and federal law on how late 15yearolds can 
work he said the nebraska law sets a 10 pm limit while federal 
law is more restrictive 
pabian called the federal regulations regarding operating meat 
slicers antiquated because the rules prohibit workers under 18 
from operating the machines 
operating the machine thats a fine and then wiping off the 
machine thats another fine he said 
reams food stores in utah were fined about 20000 for 
violations involving about 80 youngsters general manager dick 
cheney noted that none of the violations involved hazardous jobs 
and instead stemmed from letting youngsters work too long or from 
employing children under 14 
the violations were not flagrant at all in most cases they 
involved kids working 10 minutes beyond their three hours cheney 
said we feel that weve obeyed the spirit of the law and that 
theyre nitpicking theyre on some kind of crusade 
cheney said one store was fined because parents let their 12and 
13yearold children carry inventory sheets at onceayear stock 
counting events 
the businesses identified tuesday involved 170 cases that 
investigators have completed some of the biggest cases are still 
open the agency said 
the stiffest fine so far 29050 was against gff foods 
grocery store in moore okla which was accused of 
hazardousoccupation and recordkeeping violations involving 47 
youngsters the store owner could not immediately be reached for 
comment 
dozens of companies were listed from around the country 
including individual restaurants that are part of the following 
fastfood chains mcdonalds taco bell jack in the box and burger 
king 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said the new findings reinforce 
our belief that the trend toward violations is growing 
nearly half of the fastfood restaurants and other businesses 
targeted in the sweep were found to be employing children 
illegally brooks said of the 3776 firms investigated violations 
were found at 1750 he said 
about 225 youngsters under 14 were found to be illegally 
employed brooks said children under 14 are barred from most jobs 
with a few exceptions such as certain farm work and newspaper 
routes 
federal law forbids 14yearolds and 15yearolds from working 
more than three hours on a school day or 18 hours a week during the 
school year eight hours are permitted on weekend days and 40hour 
weeks are permitted in summer and during vacations 
when last months sweep was announced labor department 
officials said 500 inspectors had visited businesses in all 50 
states most of the violations were at service businesses such as 
restaurants grocery stores pizza and donut shops or dry cleaning 
firms the agency said 
last year the labor departments wage and hour division which 
enforces childlabor provisions of the fair labor standards act 
found 22508 minors to be illegally employed an alltime high

east germanys main political groups agreed 
tuesday to try to form the nations first noncommunist government 
before april 15 and resolve lingering differences over unification 
with west germany 
the conservative alliance for germany winner of the most 
parliament seats in the march 18 elections and closely allied with 
west german chancellor helmut kohl met for formal talks with the 
social democrats who finished second 
party leaders said following the afternoon session they had 
agreed on a framework for talks that they expected would result in 
a governing coalition of this nation of 16 million residents by 
easter sunday april 15 
they agreed too to form smaller groups to discuss the issues 
that divide them particularly the pace of reunification the talks 
are aimed at forging a grand coalition that includes both 
conservatives and liberals 
east germanys disparate political factions had suddenly united 
this week to demand that west germany give 1to1 value to east 
german marks when the nations reunify and the powerful deutsche 
mark becomes the common currency 
unification talks with west germany had been temporarily on hold 
while the newly elected parliament chose a leadership to replace 
the caretaker communist government the caretaker government has 
been running the country since the fall revolution toppled the 
hardline communist regime of erich honecker 
the talks also follow the resignation of the social democrats 
leader ibrahim boehme amid allegations he had links to the hated 
stasi secret police the controversy surrounding boehme had 
hampered negotiations 
social democratic officials met with alliance for germany 
negotiators just hours after the social democrats announced they 
were ready to begin formal talks officials from the tiny free 
democratic party also participated in the meeting 
the alliance for germany is a threeparty coalition that favors 
quick reunification with west germany it received the most votes 
in parliamentary elections march 18 but not enough to form a 
majority in the 400seat parliament 
a twothirds majority is needed to make major decisions for 
rapid unification 
rainer eppelmann leader of democratic awakening one of the 
parties in the alliance for germany said he was hoping for a quick 
agreement so people in east germany know where they stand 
the social democrats and the alliance have already held 
exploratory talks about forming a government but progress was 
hindered by the social democrats insistence that one of the three 
parties within the alliance the ultraconservative german social 
union be excluded from any government 
the social democrats have now dropped that demand but they are 
seeking to limit any cabinet posts the german social union would 
have in a government 
the third party in the alliance is the christian demcratic union 
meckel said a key reason for the social democrats decision to 
enter formal coalition talks is the dispute over introducing west 
germanys mark as east germanys currency 
west germanys central bank has insisted most east german marks 
be exchanged at a 2to1 ratio that has angered many east germans 
who were expecting to benefit from a 1to1 exchange rate 
lothar de maiziere head of the alliance for germany said 
monday he was disappointed with the west german proposal and made 
clear he favors a 1to1 conversion rate 
meckel said de maizieres stand leads social democratic 
officials to believe the two sides could be successful in coalition 
negotiations 
for the first time i have seen that mr de maiziere has 
publicly said something which is seen differently in bonn we see 
this as a sign of hope meckel said 
the social democrats have previously complained that the 
alliance for germany is letting the west german government call too 
many of the shots in drafting plans for german unification 
nonetheless negotiations between the two sides could be tricky 
because the social democrats have opted for a slower pace to german 
unity than the alliance for germany

a united germany must remain a full member of 
nato an organization that will play a vital role in maintaining 
stability in europe a state department official said wednesday 
james f dobbins deputy assistant secretary of state told 
senators nato should not be abolished even though the military 
threat has receded in europe with the disintegration of the warsaw 
pact 
but nato will continue to play an important role he said 
we need nato now for the same reasons nato was created he 
said at a meeting of the helsinki commission nato remains 
necessary for european balance 
it is likely nato will play more of a political than a military 
role in the future dobbins said 
many of the positive changes we are seeing in eastern europe 
are not yet anchored in law and practice he said 
european stability will continue to be best served by the 
maintenance of a multinational defense structure and by a germany 
soundly grounded in western institutions in particular by its 
full membership in nato he said 
nato he said will guard against instability and fragmentation 
in the region and give the americans a place in europe without 
nato us public and congressional support for this engagement 
would be difficult to maintain 
dobbins comments came at a meeting of the commission on 
security and cooperation in europe known as the helsinki 
commission 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the congressional 
csce group said csce a group of 35 nations will play an 
important role in the shape of the new europe

the house public works and transportation 
committee voted 355 tuesday to approve legislation to protect the 
civil rights of millions of disabled americans including those 
infected with the aids virus 
the committee vote is the third out of four needed to bring the 
americans with disabilities act to the house floor the senate 
passed the bill last september by a 768 vote 
the house judiciary committee the final committee is expected 
to take up the bill near the end of this month and a vote by the 
full house could occur in may 
the bill protects disabled people from job discrimination it 
guarantees equal access to public and private transportation as 
well as stores restaurants business and professional services 
the hearing and speechimpaired would be guaranteed access to 
special telephone services 
backers say the law is carefully constructed to avoid undue 
hardships on businesses they say it provides lenient timetables 
for implementation 
critics say the bill is too vague for the ordinary 
businessperson to understand leaving interpretation of the law up 
to activists and judges they also say the bill provides nothing to 
offset the high cost to businesses 
the two previous house committees education and labor and 
energy and commerce also passed the bill by similarly large 
margins 
although the bill does protect people with the aids virus 
against discrimination it does not protect homosexuals and 
bisexuals against discrimination it protects former but not 
current drug users 
aids is known to be spread by certain homosexual contact 
contaminated hypodermic needles and transfusions of infected blood 
a woman who is infected during pregnancy passes the disease to her 
infant 
president bush referred last week to the bill in a speech in 
which he urged congress to get on with the job of passing a law 
to protect people with the virus or with the disease 
bush did not mention however the conflict between the 
administration and congressional supporters over an effort by the 
justice department to change important language dealing with 
employment provisions of the law 
the administration wants to decouple the disabilities bill from 
the 1964 civil rights act the reason is that civil rights 
advocates have introduced an update of the civil rights act that 
would enable people who are intentionally discriminated against to 
sue employers for damages the administration opposes that change 
title vii of the civil rights act which is referred to in the 
disabilities bill currently limits relief to nondamage remedies 
such as back pay and injunctive relief

the national debt on monday totaled more than 
3 trillion for the first time in history the treasury department 
reported tuesday 
thats 3000000000000 count them a three and 12 zeroes 
a person counting a 1000 bill each second would take 133 years 
just to reach 1 trillion 
and when the national debt reached 3 trillion it meant that it 
would cost every man woman and child 12000 to pay it off 
the debt subject to limit did go over 3 trillion on monday 
confirmed peter hollenbach public affairs officer for treasurys 
bureau of public debt 
the actual level of public debt subject to statutory limit at 
the end of the day monday was 3023 trillion thats just 9959 
billion under the statutory limit of 3123 trillion the national 
debt stood at 2989 trillion last friday 
hollenbach said that despite a growing number of income tax 
receipts at this time of year he expected the debt to continue to 
grow as long as the budget is not balanced 
congress enacted the current debt limit last november 
the debt reached 1 billion in 1916 during world war i climbing 
to 278 billion at the end of world war ii 
it reached its first trillion on oct 1 1981 and rose to 2 
trillion on april 3 1986 
the rapid growth in the debt stems from fact that the government 
been running huge deficits for the past decade the inability to 
reduce the federal deficit was considered the major economic 
failure of the reagan administration 
democratic opponents often pointed to the fact that president 
reagan ran up more public debt in this eight years in office than 
all of his predecessors put together 
the federal deficit has continued to grow since then and totaled 
1521 billion during the fiscal year ended last sept 30 
by the end of february the deficit had reached 9752 billion 
just 248 billion less than the grammrudman deficitreduction 
target for the entire year interest on the deficit during february 
totaled 1732 billion and is expected to reach 25485 billion for 
the year 
analysts have said the target for fiscal 1990 has all but been 
abaondoned with some suggesting the actual imbalance for the year 
will total 160 billion to 165 billion

gov madeleine kunin on tuesday opted out 
of seeking a fourth twoyear term becoming the latest of the 
northeasts governors to back out of a troubled economic situation 
it is time for me to move on to new challenges said kunin 
a democrat 
her surprise announcement came two weeks after connecticut gov 
william oneill decided not to run again and a year after 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis kunins closest political 
associate opted against seeking reelection this november 
kunin 56 elected in 1984 as vermonts first female governor 
gave an upbeat review of her years in office 
we have made history here in vermont she said we have 
shown that women are strong and capable leaders 
kunin has built a national reputation as one of the most 
outspoken governors for abortion rights and the environment 
never has vermont stood so proudly both at home and 
throughout the nation as a strong environmental state she said 
her decision not to run gives instant frontrunner status to her 
predecessor former gov richard snelling a fourterm republican 
snelling who did not run in 1984 has said one reason he is 
campaigning this time is deep concern about the states budget woes 
the three bestknown democrats considering running are lt gov 
howard dean former state sen peter welch and former us attorney 
william gray the primary is sept 11 
in vermont sagging state revenues have prompted sharp 
reductions in this years budget and a proposed 12 percent increase 
in the personal income tax for the coming year 
the states situation is not unique a surging economy in the 
1980s yielded huge surpluses for the northeast states and allowed 
the governors many initiatives but a sharp economic downturn 
prompted cutbacks and tax increases and sagging popularity for 
governors 
in connecticut oneill a democrat announced march 20 he would 
not seek a third full term in office he said his decision not to 
run again came after an evaluation of the political realities of 
the day his popularity was at an alltime low after raising 
taxes by nearly 1 billion in 1989 
dukakis whose massachusetts miracle was trumpeted in his 
1988 presidential bid announced more than a year ago he would not 
seek reelection the state now faces a deficit officially pegged 
at 780 million 
in new york democratic gov mario cuomo is facing his third 
straight year of deficit problems and is talking about more than 1 
billion in higher taxes and sharp spending cuts to deal with the 
latest budget crisis 
the regions three republican governors john mckernan of 
maine judd gregg of new hampshire and edward diprete of rhode 
island all are seeking reelection and all are handicapped by 
hard financial times 
maine faces a 210 million shortfall through the end of this 
budget cycle in 1991 and mckernan has gotten a strong challenge 
from democrat joseph e brennan his predecessor who has made the 
budget woes a chief issue 
new hampshire has a 160 million deficit and the states lack 
of a general sales and income tax is bound to be a big issue in 
this years campaign gregg is against such a tax 
eric davis a political science professor a middlebury college 
said the tough economic times have taken the fun out of being 
governor in the northeast 
this is not a good time to be governor he said almost 
all the northeastern governors are facing the same sorts of budget 
problems 
madeleine kunin has spent her whole career talking about what 
government can do for the people it didnt look like fun

house speaker thomas s foley said tuesday 
that if the supreme court throws out the federal law against flag 
burning he will vote against a constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag 
by tradition the speaker of the house rarely votes and foley 
has not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago but foley 
said he would come off the speakers podium and vote no if the 
house considered a constitutional amendment 
foley last year supported passage of the law against flag 
burning but he said amending the constitution and especially the 
first amendment definition of elemental freedoms of this 
country was not justified 
the first amendment is the most sacred part of the 
constitutional document and to amend it for these reasons would be 
extraordinarily unwise foley said i think the judgment of 
history would be unkind on the congress or the state legislatures 
if that were to occur 
the supreme court has scheduled oral arguments for may 14 on 
whether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that the 
flag burning statute passed by congress last year is 
unconstitutional 
foley has promised a house vote on a constitutional amendment 
within 30 days if the court rules against the statute

the us government called tuesday for an end 
to violence in south africa after a week of black factional 
fighting in natal province 
we recognize that the situation in natal is extremely 
serious state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said when 
asked about president f w de klerks increased use of security 
forces to quell the violence 
we understand that the decision taken by president de klerk to 
deploy additional security forces to areas of growing violence in 
south africa was taken to begin the process of restoring order 
ms tutwiler said 
she said it was in the interests of all the people of south 
africa to support efforts for negotiations between the whiteled 
government and the black majority on the countrys future 
at a time when the climate for negotiations is otherwise 
improving it is encumbent upon all parties to exercise 
restraint ms tutwiler said we call for an end to violence 
from all sources and the quickest possible end to the state of 
emergency 
soldiers and police in armored vehicles patrolled in natal 
province on tuesday to head off clashes between inkatha headed by 
zulu homeland leader mangosuthu buthelezi and supporters of the 
african national congress guerrilla movement 
police said at least 55 people had been killed in the past week 
about 4000 people have been killed in natal since 1986 
ms tutwiler commended de klerk for announcing monday that the 
south african government would propose legislation authoritizing 
amnesty for politically motivated criminal acts 
this is another positive move by president de klerk towards 
fostering a climate conducive to beginning the negotiating 
process ms tutwiler said noting that the anc wanted such a law 
to enable its members to return from exile 
the bill when it becomes law apparently will allow the state 
president to grant returning members of the opposition amnesty for 
the full range of their antiapartheid activities ms tutwiler 
said 
she urged the anc to reschedule a meeting for peace talks with 
the government as soon as possible last week the organization 
canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for april 11 
ms tutwiler said the us government applauded anc leader 
nelson mandelas agreement to meet with de klerk on thursday to 
seek ways to end the violence in natal

a senate panel ignoring protests by 
automakers tuesday approved a bill that would require a 40 percent 
improvement in fuel efficiency by 2001 
its so potentially devastating to our industry and to 
consumer choice were concerned that it exists said general 
motors spokesman bill noack its an attempt to legislate the 
family car out of existence 
automakers contend the provisions of the bill would force them 
to stop making all but the smallest vehicles 
however supporters of the bill sponsored by sen richard bryan 
dnev say higher mileage standards are needed to force production 
of more fuelefficient cars and reduce us dependency on foreign 
oil 
the auto industry is lining up a phalanx of lobbyists to 
oppose it bryan said theyll be trying to convince people it 
would be a disaster were going to have a tough battle 
the senate committee on commerce science and transportation 
approved the bill 144 but it is not expected to reach the floor 
until june 
under current law new car fleets all models produced in a 
year by one manufacturer are required to average 275 miles per 
gallon the bryan bill would require manufacturers to improve their 
average fuel economy by 20 percent beginning with the 1995 model 
year and 40 percent by the 2001 model year 
the typical new car fleet would average 344 mpg in 1995 and 
402 mpg by 2001 although some would be higher and some lower 
because the increase would be based on improving the mileage from a 
makers current level 
bryan said the bill would save 491 billion gallons of oil 
between 1995 and 2001 
we are now importing more oil from foreign sources than when 
the arab countries cut us off with their oil embargo in 1973 he 
said 
the bill also would save more than 483 million tons of carbon 
dioxide 20 pounds of which are emitted with each gallon of 
gasoline a car burns he said carbon dioxide is believed to be a 
leading contributor to global warming 
when mileage requirements originally were imposed in the 
mid1970s automakers met them by reducing the average cars weight 
by 1000 pounds said tim mccarthy a lobbyist for the motor 
vehicle manufacturers association the average weight now is 3000 
pounds 
we can make cars right now that meet the bryan standards he 
said but to cut out another 1000 pounds youre looking at the 
honda crx the geo metro i dont see them satisfying all the needs 
of the public either families or business the consumer will not 
be happy

and cultural organization in 1984 accusing the parisbased agency 
of politicization and antiwestern bias 
the time is not right for the united states to reopen the 
question of renewing its membership in unesco said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
the department will submit a full report to congress on april 17 
explaining its reasons she said declining to elaborate further 
about the decision 
after reviewing unescos actions at its recent general 
conference and analyzing the restructuring proposals raised there 
the united states concluded that very little has changed since 
the united states withdrew at the end of 1984 ms tutwiler said 
the united states and britain which also withdrew from unesco 
accounted for some 30 percent of the organizations budget britain 
too reportedly has decided to stay out of unesco 
there had been some speculation the united states would resume 
its membership after unesco got a new director general federico 
mayor of spain mayor visited washington several months ago to 
lobby for the united states return meeting with administration

testing of the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope resumed tuesday after nasa technicians switched 
over to a backup power system to prevent another interruption from 
a power outage 
space shuttle discovery is scheduled for launch april 10 
provided the tests are concluded by thursday and there are no 
further problems said george diller a spokesman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
were on thin ice but its doable diller said 
nasa must complete a 52hour test of the telescopes scientific 
instruments before the shuttle can be launched 
we wont know the condition of the hubble space telescope 
until we get power to it but we have no reason to suspect the 
hubble space telescope suffered any damage from mondays power 
outage said bill taylor the telescopes chief engineer at kennedy 
space center 
the schedule still shows it can be met taylor said of next 
weeks scheduled launch 
technicians were in the middle of the telescope testing monday 
when a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment resulting 
in the temporary power failure the outage knocked out air 
conditioning at the launch control center and elsewhere forcing 
the shutdown of heatsensitive equipment including computers used 
in the test 
a system that backs up power to computers in the launch control 
centers four firing rooms was taken over by a newer system able to 
withstand an outage testing of the telescope resumed shortly 
afterward 
the 25000pound 43footlong telescope the most expensive 
unmanned spacecraft ever built was never in any danger from the 
cooling system breakdown diller said 
technicians began charging the telescopes batteries again 
monday night a positive sign diller said 
on saturday discoverys launch date was moved up from april 12 
to april 10 because technicians believed they needed little of the 
contingency time built into the schedule as of tuesday no 
contingency time was left diller said 
discoverys five astronauts will deploy the hubble on the second 
day of the fiveday mission it will orbit 380 miles high for 15 
years free of atmospheric distortion 
the telescope will be capable of detecting objects 50 times 
fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best 
groundbased observatory 
images radioed from the telescope will enable astronomers to 
study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been 
traveling to earth for 14 billion years

an 11yearold boy whose adoptive parents 
separated him from his brother and sent him to a shelter during the 
thanksgiving season wonders what he did wrong but a judge 
ultimately will decide why things when awry 
theres going to be a lot of fingerpointing said bill 
pierce president of the washington dcbased national committee 
for adoption 
cook county public guardian patrick murphy last week filed a 
lawsuit alleging the adoptive parents separated the two young 
brothers they adopted in 1984 putting the older boy in an group 
home and forbidding him from seeing his 8yearold brother 
the lawsuit filed in circuit court seeks visitation rights for 
the boys and 50000 in damages for the child the couple gave up 
the lawsuit refers to the child as rick not his real name and 
says the parents identified as joseph and pamela doe gave him 
back to the custody of the state because he hadnt bonded well 
with them 
a hearing will be held wednesday in which murphy will ask for a 
ruling on the request for rick to visit his brother murphy said 
its every little boys nightmare murphy said after filing 
the lawsuit ricks parents told him they were going to put him 
into an orphange and they did it its like telling a kid youre 
going to send the bogey man after him and then doing it 
mom and dad were talking about something and they said they 
were going to put me up for adoption the boy said in a tape 
recording made available by murphy i thought they were kidding 
they werent 
the parents put rick in the group home on nov 20 and got 
approval march 9 from circuit court judge walter williams to 
surrender their parental rights to williams 
the parents attorney mary c martin did not return a phone 
call tuesday williams declined to comment on the case 
ron morman of the springfieldbased child care association of 
illinois said the case is particularly troubling because of effects 
of the parents action could have on the child 
we view it with a great deal of concern because the whole 
point of adoption is to help the child find permanence to give 
him some sense of belonging some sense of family morman said 
murphy said rick is now in a temporary foster home and blames 
himself for his new circumstance 
officials at a number of adoption agencies noted that the boys 
in this case were not infants but were older children adopted 
after their biological mother abandoned them they said these 
children come to adoptions with problems and it is important that 
they are matched with parents capable of coping with their 
particular needs 
murphy whose job as public guardian is to act on behalf of 
children such as rick calls the child a normal kid who has 
never been in trouble with the law 
pierce said it would be like malpractice to place a child in 
anything but that type of home that best fits the childs needs 
but matching children to families is an imprecise art he 
said 
agencies under the gun to place children rather than leave them 
in costly foster care arrangements may take risks and place a child 
despite misgivings about the home pierce said adding that they 
also can make mistakes 
a november report by the national committee for adoption said 
us court records showed that 104088 american children and 10019 
foreign children were adopted in the country in 1986 the last year 
such figures are available 
a study done several years ago in five us cities showed a 74 
percent success rate meaning one in four adoptions were later 
dissolved said joyce johnson a spokeswoman for the washington 
dcbased child welfare league of america 
people bring children back johnson said children for 
whatever reason come back into the system and its always a 
horrortype story when it happens

the navy wants to know whether ship 
electronics can survive a nuclear explosion in space and has 
decided a simulator test in the gulf of mexico would have no 
significant impact on the environment 
but the service said one of three alternative sites in the gulf 
has too much air and sea traffic to be appropriate for the tests of 
the electromagnetic pulse radiation environment simulator for ships 
empress ii program 
in a draft environmental impact statement the navy this week 
said the two sites it deemed acceptable both are located southeast 
of mobile ala the unacceptable site is located southwest of 
mobile about 40 nautical miles from the coast 
empress ii is a bargemounted pulser that can simulate the 
electromagnetic field that would be generated on earth by a nuclear 
blast in space the system sends out an electromagnetic pulse emp 
that lasts just 10 billionths of a second but measures 50000 
volts per meter at 100 meters from the barge in all directions 
the navy plans to fire the emp at passing ships to test the 
effectiveness of measures designed to protect electronics systems 
from the emp that would result from a nuclear explosion in space 
critics of the program contend that the emp would endanger 
marine and plant life in the gulf the navy personnel aboard the 
test ship and the electronic systems of airplanes and ships that 
might be in the area 
but in the draft study on the program the navy concluded that no 
such dangers exist 
the collective potential environmental impact of the proposed 
empress ii action is estimated to be minor the navy said 
within this minor category the potential impact is greater on 
the socioeconomic issues and less on both the natural resources and 
the physical site itself 
ships would be barred from passing within two nautical miles of 
the simulator barge in any direction and airplanes would be 
excluded from a zone 6000 feet above the twonauticalmile 
exclusion zone 
plans call for the final environmental impact statement to be 
completed by june 15 clearing the way for a decision by the 
secretary of the navy on whether to permit the testing program to 
begin in the gulf next winter said capt william mahew manger of 
the empress ii program the tests would be conducted up to 10 hours 
a day for no more than 60 days a year between november and april

supporters and opponents of president bushs 
choice as top savings and loan regulator said tuesday the nominees 
admission of past drug use will play little role in the senate 
decision on his confirmation 
senate leaders are aiming for a wednesday vote on the nomination 
of t timothy ryan jr to direct the treasury departments office 
of thrift supervision 
in advance most senators and industry lobbyists are predicting 
he will be confirmed by a narrow margin two democrats joined 
republicans on the senate banking committee to endorse ryan by an 
1110 vote on friday the administration if it holds all 
republican senators would need to attract only three more 
democrats for victory in the full senate 
such an outcome would not necessarily upset democrats according 
to kenneth guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america 
in terms of democratic politics you have someone in office 
who you can point your finger to and say i told you so he 
said 
backers and detractors of the 44yearold attorney say the 
debate will focus on his professional qualifications and not on his 
admission that he tried marijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s 
when he was in law school 
nobody who i talked to on our side thought it was of 
significance said sen jake garn of utah senior republican on 
the senate banking committee 
both democrats and republicans discussed the nomination in 
private luncheons tuesday 
in the democratic caucus according to a source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity there was a lot of loud talk about 
professional qualifications but the expectation was he will get by 
on a tight vote 
republicans were all aware of the cocaine situation and there 
wasnt anyone who spoke who didnt say hey in the context you 
look at it were not troubled by it garn said 
i took it as something that should be looked at i wanted to 
see if it was a pattern of behavior that extended beyond his 
college years i did not find that said sen phil gramm rtexas 
i made my judgment based on the lack of qualification said 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the banking panel 
he and other opponents of ryan point to his lack of experience in 
banking 
ryan served as the top attorney in the labor department early in 
the reagan administration and as a private lawyer has specialized 
in pension and employee benefit law 
i dont think any of you would pick this man to run your own 
bank riegle told bankers attending a trade group meeting 
many savings and loan executives are leery of ryan because at 
his confirmation hearing he said he was unsure if the sampl industry 
should survive however sampl trade groups say theyve been staying 
out of the battle not wanting to campaign against the man likely 
to be the industrys chief regulator 
lincoln savings and loan association owner charles h keating 
jr at the center the nations worst thrift failure and the 
subject of a 11 billion fraud suit filed by regulators wrote 
letters to all senators opposing ryan 
i submit this is hardly the time to shrink from the challenge 
of finding competent people to handle the important affairs of our 
government i fear for the future of the republic he said 
republicans are stressing ryans strength as a manager and his 
role while serving as labor department solicitor in cleaning up 
the teamsters union central states pension fund 
the administration circulated more than a dozen endorsements of 
ryan from prominent republicans and democrats they included frank 
c carlucci former secretary of defense in the reagan 
administration and george d gould former under secretary the 
treasury department under reagan 
among the democrats were hodding carter iii assistant secretary 
of state under jimmy carter and w harrison wellford former 
associate director of the office of management and budget under 
carter 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady continued a telephone 
campaign urging senators to vote for ryan who spent the day 
visiting senators offices he declined comment to reporters who 
spotted him in the corridor of a senate office building

a 20yearold woman married to an 
unemployed oil worker gave birth tuesday to sextuplets and the 
hospital in this western city claimed they were the first ever in 
south america 
all six were reported in satisfactory condition though doctors 
placed them in intensive care because of their low birth weights 
the mother had been pregnant for only 29 weeks 
the father was happy although somewhat disoriented when i 
told him the good news and showed one of the babies said dr 
jaime leon 
a doctor said there are already triplets on both sides of the 
family both have contributed with their genes to this multiple 
delivery said leon 
in addition the mother had been taking fertility drugs 
at a press conference hospital spokesmen said they are the 
first sextuplets in south america dr henry fuenmayor said there 
have been 12 other recorded cases in the world 
the children were born from 630 am to 707 am the heaviest 
weighed 24 pounds and the lightest 18 pounds the paraiso medical 
center announced they were delivered by caesarean section 
the mother and the sextuplets two girls and four boys are 
all in satisfactory condition but at least 48 more hours are 
needed for a firm prognosis on the offsprings said leon 
it was the second delivery for elaine paz de medina the mother 
she is already the mother of a 3yearold boy 
daniel medina the 29yearold father lost his job at a private 
oil company late last year he hopes to find work at one of the 
stateowned oil companies in this oilrich region 
the couple has had a very positive reaction throughout all 
these months leon told the associated press in a telephone 
interview 
ms medina has been hospitalized since january when doctors 
realized the pregnancy was exceptional 
public and private companies in maracaibo have organized a 
foundation to help the sextuplets through their adult life 
had they been born after the 30th week probably they would 
have required less precautions leon said but i think chances 
are good for their survival 
according to the 1989 guinness book of world records the 
highest number of babies reported at a single birth is 10 but it 
said nine was the greatest number medically recorded

about 30 ethnic albanian children in 
kosovo on tuesday were hospitalized claiming symptoms of a 
mysterious poisoning that last month threatened to trigger 
intercommunal clashes in the troubled province 
the state tanjug news agency and sources said the children from 
podujevo 18 miles north of the provincial capital of pristina 
complained of lung and skin irritations and claimed they were 
poisoned 
yugoslav authorities and some western doctors had turned up no 
evidence of an alleged epidemic that hospitalized about 2990 
teenagers most of them ethnic albanians with the same symptoms 
last month in kosovo some doctors suggested a feeling of 
insecurity and public hysteria may have played a part 
ethnic albanians who represent 90 percent of kosovos 
population claimed minority serbs were poisoning them with a 
mysterious gas 
serbs said ethnic albanians stagemanaged the poisoning to drive 
them from kosovo by igniting major ethnic clashes 
at least 60 ethnic albanians have died in clashes with security 
forces in the past 12 months in kosovo after serbia the largest 
yugoslav republic changed its constitution to assume neartotal 
control over its province 
kosovo had enjoyed wide autonomy 
claiming kosovo officials failed to protect serbs from 
harassment by ethnic albanians serbian authorities purged 
albanians from leading police and government functions there 
the borba daily said tuesday that kosovos premier jusuf 
zejnulahu and police chief jusuf karakushi announced their 
resignations

the state legislature passed a largely 
symbolic measure tuesday aimed at ensuring women will be able to 
continue getting legal abortions until the fetus is able to live 
outside the womb 
gov judd gregg said he would veto the bill 
after a brief debate the house voted 200135 for the bill 
passed by the house earlier and amended by the senate the margin 
was shy of the twothirds that would be needed to override greggs 
promised veto the key vote in the senate last week 1410 also 
was short of a twothirds margin 
the bill may not reach gregg until next week but he repeated 
tuesday that hell veto it 
under the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
abortion is legal and widely available in new hampshire despite 
three 19thcentury antiabortion statutes that have not been 
enforced 
the national abortion rights action league considers the bill 
prochoice advocates best chance for abortion rights legislation 
in the country this year 
but peg dobbie the groups new hampshire spokeswoman said it 
would be a long shot for the legislature to override a veto 
though not giving up hope she said prochoice advocates are now 
focusing on the november election 
we plan to go out and elect more prochoice legislators so we 
can be vetoproof she said 
the original house bill called for no restrictions on abortion 
until the 25th week of pregnancy the senate changed that to allow 
unrestricted abortion until the womans doctor determined that the 
fetus could live outside the womb on its own 
both versions would allow abortions after fetal viability to 
protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus has a 
lifethreatening physical or congenital abnormality 
gregg believes the bill would foster doctorshopping because 
doctors will differ on what constitutes viability spokesman brian 
grip said 
gregg reiterated his stand that abortion should be limited to 
instances where the mothers life is in danger there is a serious 
problem with the fetus or the pregnancy stemmed from rape or incest 
state rep thomas gage head of the judiciary committee 
supported the amended bill saying it set a medical standard in 
place of a political one rather than a hard line drawn in 
statute by black letter 
but state rep shawn jasper said the medical community disagrees 
about when a fetus can survive outside a mothers womb and urged 
defeat of the bill 
elsewhere tuesday 
in the nebraska legislature antiabortion lawmakers succeeded 
in keeping alive a proposal that would require a 24hour waiting 
period before a woman has an abortion they moved it to the second 
stage of floor consideration without allowing opportunity for 
amendment 
a louisiana state senator introduced an antiabortion bill that 
provides exceptions for saving the mothers life during birth but 
allows no exceptions for cases of rape or incest just as being 
raped and becoming pregnant is a traumatic experience so is 
aborting a child said state sen mike cross 
in minnesota a second senate committee rejected a measure that 
would prohibit most abortions in the state the 1990 legislative 
session tentatively is scheduled to adjourn next week 
voters in ann arbor mich declared their university town a 
zone of reproductive freedom voters also approved on monday a 
token 5 fine on abortion should state or federal laws ever ban 
the procedure

a study of more than 12800 men at high risk for 
heart disease found the death rate from heart attacks was 24 
percent lower for those who received advice about nutrition or 
other health matters 
about half of the 12860 men studied at 22 clinics nationwide 
received the counseling several times a year the others were 
examined annually and only received additional treatment if needed 
the advice included information about lower cholesterol levels 
counseling on quitting smoking and improved drug therapy to control 
high blood pressure researchers reported in wednesdays journal of 
the american medical association 
the study of men ages 35 to 57 began in 1973 and ended in 1982 
the results reported in jama stem from a followup review in 
december 1985 after the treatment ended said marcus o kjelsberg 
a statistician at the university of minnesotas school of public 
health where the data was analyzed 
initial examinations in 1982 showed no significant differences 
between the two groups which surprised researchers and prompted 
the followup kjelsberg said in a telephone interview tuesday 
but the followup found the death rate from coronary heart 
disease after 1982 was 106 percent lower in men who had received 
the treatment and the overall death rates were 77 percent lower 
the biggest difference was in the death rate from heart attacks 
which killed 106 of those in the special treatment group 24 
percent fewer than the 140 deaths noted in the other group 
the ultimate results were not surprising given the multitude of 
data showing a link between diet smoking and heart disease said 
dr jeremiah stamler a cardiovascular epidemiologist at 
northwestern university and a principal investigator in the study 
everything i know about all of this leads me to the inference 
that this should happen stamler said 
researchers expected to see the results earlier at the end of 
the study but they failed to anticipate several factors that may 
account for the delay stamler said 
one reason may have been that all the volunteers for the study 
were relatively healthy despite facing a higher than normal risk 
for heart disease because they smoked had high blood pressure or 
high cholesterol levels or a combination of the three stamler said 
another reason for the delayed results may have been a change in 
drug treatment for high blood pressure that occurred toward the end 
of the study the later treatment was considered more effective 
kjelsberg said 
researchers did not determine how many of the men who had 
received special treatment continued to seek it after the study 
ended he said but they asssumed that many stuck to their 
healthier lifestyles 
the bottom line in this report is an encouraging one for the 
notion that intervention on these three risk factors does lead to a 
lower risk of death from either all causes or from coronary heart 
diseases kjelsberg said 
the study was funded by the national heart lung and blood 
institute in bethesda md

a former ss captain accused of killing 
thousands of people when he commanded nazi labor camps is expected 
to be extradited from argentina next month to face trial the 
government said tuesday 
argentine authorities approved the extradition last month of 
joseph schwammberger who has reportedly been in ill health since 
his arrest outside the northcentral city of cordoba on nov 13 
1987 he had been living in argentina for decades most of the time 
in la plata near buenos aires 
schwammbergers case proves that even after long years no one 
who has heaped guilt upon himself during the nazi dictatorship is 
safe from justices grip no matter where they are hiding said 
justice minister hans a engelhard 
schwammberger 78 had been a fugitive since he disappeared from 
a train in 1948 while being taken from germany to american military 
authorities in austria for trial he reportedly found a way to 
argentina when it was encouraging immigration of europeans and 
entered the country in about 1950 
prosecutors allege he was responsible for the deaths of up to 
5000 people mostly jews camp survivors who traveled to buenos 
aires in 1988 from miami chicago and toronto testified to court 
authorities that he shot to death starving prisoners or set dogs on 
them 
schwammberger was finally tracked down with the help of famed 
nazi hunter simon wiesenthal 
wiesenthal learned in 1971 that schwammberger was living in la 
plata where he had worked in a factory for years the nazi hunter 
informed stuttgart prosecutors who issued an arrest warrant but 
apparently little action was taken by argentine authorities until 
1987 
schwammbergers name was on a list of 10 mostwanted nazi war 
criminals published in 1987 by the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles 
the list appeared in argentine newspapers which led authorities 
to schwammberger according to wiesenthal 
schwammberger apparently tipped off that police were on his 
trail fled to a germanargentine community outside cordoba where 
argentine police later arrested him without incident 
rabbi marvin hier dean of the wiesenthal center said tuesday 
the extradition comes at a very opportune time because of the 
imminent reunification of germany 
the trial will be an important educational event for east 
germans who have never been exposed to the truth about the final 
solution he said 
i would say this is going to be the last major nazi war 
criminal trial certainly of that proportion in west germany he 
added 
engelhard said all arrangements have been made to pick up 
schwammberger in argentina he said two law officials and an 
attorney will accompany schwammberger on the trip to west germany 
scheduled may 3 
schwammberger will be handed over to justice officials from west 
germanys badenwuerrttemberg state which has jurisdiction in the 
case engelhard said

parliament on tuesday adopted legislation 
for free elections and unanimously voted petar mladenov who 
initiated democratic reforms in bulgaria to a newly created 
presidency 
the ruling communists also renamed their disgraced party the 
bulgarian socialist party in an apparent effort to distance 
themselves from their hardline past and decades of unpopular rule 
in bulgaria 
the legislation for multiparty elections scheduled this june 
sets the terms for the first free balloting in bulgaria since world 
war ii 
the legislation was agreed to last week following three months 
of tough talks between the communists and the opposition and was 
ratified by parliament along with constitutional amendments 
abolishing all references to communist and socialist 
both the communists and the opposition agreed last friday to 
mladenovs election to the new presidency 
mladenov had served as the communist president of the state 
council that was formally dissolved tuesday 
as in neighboring romania and other east european countries the 
state council under the communists acted effectively as the 
legislature in between infrequent sessions of the countries 
rubberstamp parliaments 
mladenov 53 was elected to the new temporary presidency he is 
to be replaced after the newly elected parliament approves a new 
constitution 
elections have been set for june 10 with runoffs scheduled for 
june 17 in his acceptance address mladenov said guaranteeing 
peaceful transition from totalitarianism to democracy is the most 
important and the most complicated task at this stage the state 
bta news agency reported 
he said bulgarias first test of democracy would be the june 
elections 
people should be provided with conditions to have their fair 
and open say proceeding from their own aspirations and acting on 
their own free will on the future they prefer for bulgaria bta 
quoted mladenov as saying 
he also said implementation of a radical economic reform would 
require tremendous efforts 
years of complications strain and difficulties lie ahead but 
there is no other way out we should not delude ourselves with 
false hopes of miracles mladenov was quoted as telling 
parliament in his speech 
mladenov is relatively popular according to recent polls 
because he is considered responsible for ousting longtime hardline 
communist leader todor zhivkov in a leadership reshuffle last 
november when he became party leader he relinquished that party 
post in february 
after taking over the party leadership mladenov elevated 
reformists to top positions and began a dialogue with the 
opposition toward the transition to democracy 
the constitutional amendments that were adopted anchor political 
pluralism in the constitution and describe bulgaria as a 
democratic parliamentary and lawabiding state bta reported 
the constitution was also amended to declare any form of 
censorship illegal 
the partys name change was announced by stefan prodev editor 
of former communist party daily rabotnichesko delo or workers 
affairs which changed its name monday to the duma or the word 
former communist party leader alexander lilov now a socialist 
told a rally in downtown sofia late tuesday that the party was 
breaking with the mistakes the abuses and the crimes of the 
past 
we want radical reforms in everything including the party 
lilov was reported to have said adding certain rightwing 
forces are trying to push the country toward a new 
totalitarianism he did not elaborate 
mladenov served as foreign minister from 1971 when he was 35 
until last nov 10 when zhivkov resigned after 34 years in power 
born into a peasants family in 1936 in a village in 
northwestern bulgaria mladenov studied philosophy at sofia 
univesity and was graduated from the prestigious moscow state 
institute of international relations in 1963 he joined the 
communist party a year later 
a regional party secretary of the vidin county in northwestern 
bulgaria he quickly made his way up through party ranks and became 
a central committee member in 1971 he was appointed a full 
politburo member in 1977

michigans government went to the us 
supreme court in its fight for the right to set up roadblocks to 
nab drunken drivers but michigan lawmakers are moving to ban the 
checkpoints 
the house judiciary committee citing a violation of civil 
liberties associated with randomly pulling over drivers to check 
for illegal activity voted 117 tuesday to prohibit the sobriety 
check lanes 
such a ban if approved by the full house and the senate would 
take effect even if the nations high court rules that the 
checkpoints are constitutional the court heard oral arguments on 
the case last month 
the state is appealing a february 1989 michigan supreme court 
decision that let stand lower court rulings declaring the procedure 
unconstitutional at issue is whether the random stops violate the 
fourth amendments protections against unreasonable searches and 
seizures 
gov james blanchard had issued an executive order in 1986 
directing the department of state police to use roadblocks to 
combat drunken driving 
only one checkpoint was set up before a group of lawmakers won a 
court order blocking the procedure 
i believe that sobriety check lanes are an invasion of the 
constitution an invasion of human and civil rights said the 
bills sponsor state rep morris hood today when we scan the 
globe and see whats taking place in eastern europe in central 
america and hopefully soon in south america we see the cry for 
freedom the cry for democracy the cry for civil rights 
i dont think you give away your liberty and your freedom 
under the guise that it may save some lives 
state rep william van regenmorter said the right not to be 
harmed or killed by a drunken driver also ought to be considered 
he proposed an unsuccessful amendment which would have permitted 
the roadblocks in predesignated highrisk areas during the night 
when most drunken driving incidents occur 
if the democratled house passes the bill it will face a tougher 
hurdle in the republicanled senate

five midwestern senators introduced 
legislation tuesday to include in the 1990 farm bill that they said 
would protect farmers against the rising costs of growing food 
meanwhile a house agriculture subcommittee approved a dairy 
program for the farm bill that revamps price supports in order to 
stop excessive production of butter fat 
the senate bill dubbed the farm income and flexibility act 
will be the basis for the target price section of the massive 
legislation congress writes every five years to set agriculture 
policy said the group of democratic senators 
the legislation is necessary to preserve family farming which 
is the best protection against rising consumer food costs that the 
government can devise said the senators the group includes sens 
robert kerrey and james exon of nebraska tom daschle of south 
dakota tom harkin of iowa and kent conrad of north dakota 
kerrey said the legislation would cost about 12 billion 
annually the bush administration wants to lower the cost of target 
prices and has recommended spending no more than about 10 billion 
next year 
target prices are the amounts the government sets for wheat 
corn cotton soybeans and rice if the market price does not reach 
the amount the government pays the farmer the difference 
under the house dairy program the government would buy up to 7 
billion pounds of milk products at 1060 per hundred pounds if 
they cant be sold on the open market farmers who produce more 
than their share of the governments limit would get a lower amount 
the senate has not approved a dairy plan yet 
kerrey who has led the battle against the administrations 
target price proposals said there are three basic reasons why 
consumers should want the government involved in the farm business 
government management of surpluses protects against unstable 
weather conditions 
us food prices are kept the lowest in the world by a strong 
government program 
the subsidy is a bargain at less than the 1 percent of the 
annual federal budget 
people who live in urban areas have an interest in seeing the 
family farm preserved as a guard against the higher food prices 
likely if farms were consolidated said an aide to daschle 
if agricultural production were in the hands of just a few 
people food prices would also be under their control said mark 
ulven 
if farmers dont have the governments help in covering their 
production costs they might easily go out of business and sell 
their farms to a corporation he said 
us consumers today spend just 104 percent of their 
disposable income on food the lowest level in history and less 
than consumers in any other country said kerrey 
but the producers share of each dollar spent on food has 
dropped to an alltime low he said 
in 1988 according to usda farmers and ranchers received only 
30 cents of each dollar spent on food consumed at home kerrey 
said 
conrad said that once inflation was taken into account net farm 
income in the 1980s was the lowest its been since 1910 when the 
government started keeping records 
we keep hearing from the administration that the farm crisis 
is over and farm income is at record levels said conrad 
thats just a bunch of washington happy talk 
provisions in the senators bill include 
tying target prices to increased production costs 
raising loan rates which help determine market prices by more 
than 20 percent next year and setting a floor on the loan rate for 
corn of 210 and for wheat of 275 
establishing a normal crop acreage base for each farm that is 
the total of the farms current cropspecific bases plus the 
average acreage planted to soybeans during the last five years 
raising income support levels on oilseeds oats and barley to 
levels comparable with wheat and corn

mexico lodged a formal protest with panama on 
tuesday in the latest round of a bitter quarrel over which 
government has the shakiest claim to legitimacy 
mexicos energetic protest followed an assertion by 
president guillermo endara of panama that mexicos governing party 
used electoral fraud to stay in power 
he made the remark after mexico and six other latin american 
nations said panama should hold elections to legitimize his 
government he took power in december during the us invasion that 
ousted dictator manuel antonio noriega 
foreign minister julio linares of panama said mexico and the 
other countries are picking on the wrong guy 
has any of these countries broken relations with the united 
states has any of them retired its ambassador from the united 
states he said in an interview tuesday with notimex the 
official mexican news agency 
its easier to condemn the victim because the united states is 
a powerful country a country with money a strong country 
for 21 years panamas dictators had the blessings of all 
latin america and the united states too he was quoted as saying 
he added however that panama was not considering breaking off 
relations with mexico 
columnists and editorial writers in both capitals have joined 
the fray as have politicians 
mexicos official government newspaper el nacional used the 
words bluster swagger and stupid monday to describe 
endara 
newspapers in panama meanwhile said mexicos party 
dictatorship had been a model for panamas bygone military 
regimes 
what kind of explanation does mexico want panama city 
columnist boris barrios asked tuesday an explanation because 
president endara spoke a truth that bothers them 
but a lawmaker from panamas opposition revolutionary democratic 
party suggested in panama city that endara spoke unwisely 
the presidents advisers are saying he shot off his mouth 
said gerardo gonzalez 
the mexican foreign ministry refused to disclose the text of the 
protest note but said it called on panamanian authorities to 
guarantee the security of mexican diplomats and anyone under 
mexicos diplomatic protection in panama 
the battle began after the rio group mexico colombia 
uruguay argentina venezuela brazil and peru said friday that 
elections should be held in panama 
mexico peru and argentina have refused to send ambassadors to 
endaras government 
the rio groups statement issued in mexico city angered 
endara his ticket easily won a may election in panama according 
to election observers but noriega nullified the results 
on saturday endara issued a retort to the rio groups 
statement he said his own government was legitimized by the 
people at the polls on may 7 
we dont want the legitimization of the mexican government 
because it is a government that came to power through sheer 
electoral fraud he added 
the panamanian president touched a raw nerve in mexico where 
the institutional revolutionary party or pri has been in power 
for 61 years and has often been accused of cheating at the ballot 
box 
unlike panama under noriega or nicaragua under the sandinistas 
mexico has not permitted international observers to monitor its 
elections the outcome of the 1988 presidential race is still 
clouded by accusations the pri resorted to electoral fraud 
the pri on monday acccused endara of presiding over the 
persecution torture jailing and execution of thousands of 
panamanians presumably during the invasion there have been no 
reports of torture or execution 
even the two main opposition parties in mexico which accuse 
pri of cheating at the polls said endara had spoken out of turn 
being sworn in by an invading force is not the best way to to 
demonstrate the independence and sovereignty of panama said luis 
alvarez president of the conservative national action party or pan 
sen cristobal arias solis of the leftist democratic 
revolutionary party described endaras authority as spurious 
because of the way he came to power

an earthquake measuring 65 on the 
richter scale rocked nicaragua and neighboring costa rica on

authorities said they had no reports of casualties 
the quake which began at 557 pm 657 pm edt caused 
damage to a building and pool in the new beach resort of 
montelimar where five central american presidents are holding a 
twoday meeting to negotiate peace in the region 
one of the seven swimming pools and the stillunfinished complex 
center in montelimar sustained serious cracks from the intensity of 
the quake the other pools swayed from the 30second tremor and 
water spilled over the sides in small waves 
the us geological survey earthquake information center in 
golden colo said a preliminary reading showed the earthquake 
occurred off the coast of costa rica near the nicaragua border with 
a magnitude of 65 
the usgs spokesman said the epicenter was about 70 miles south 
of managua and 175 miles northwest of san jose costa rica he said 
the quake was felt throughout most of nicaragua northern costa 
rica and even in san jose 
several aftershocks followed about 15 minutes later 
in managua people fled into the streets in fear and the 
national legislature suspended its session the downtown part of 
the capital was razed and 10000 were killed by an earthquake in 
1972 
there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in costa 
rica 
in montelimar outgoing president daniel ortega and 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro were walking down the 
stairs together from a meeting with the presidents of guatemala 
honduras el salvador and costa rica when the stairway started 
swaying 
the two nicaraguan leaders waited until the earth stopped 
rocking then continued without incident to a hall on the ground 
floor where they planned a news conference with about 100 
journalists 
longdistance telephone operators said the quake was felt as far 
away as corinto in the northwest 
the devastating quake last october in the san francisco bay area

columbia university and two businessmen were 
lastminute additions tuesday to a lawsuit over ownership of gold 
ingots and coins found 1 miles deep on the ocean floor 
us district judge richard b kellam ruled the school and the 
businessmen could intervene in the lawsuit to establish ownership 
of the treasure that went down with the ss central america in 1857 
160 miles off the south carolina coast 
the trial began tuesday with testimony after both sides agreed 
to dispense with opening arguments 
on one side is the columbusamerica discovery group which used 
space age technology to find and recover the treasure on the other 
is a group of insurance companies which paid out claims 132 years 
ago for the insured cargo and argue it still belongs to them 
now attorneys for the new york city school said data provided 
by one of their researchers led the columbusamerica group to the 
site of the shipwreck resting 1 miles deep in the atlantic ocean 
john richardson an attorney for the school said a sonar survey 
by dr william ryan an oceanographer at columbia was done for two 
businessmen in search of the wreck in 1984 richardson said harry 
john who once held 47 percent of the stock in miller brewing co 
and jack grimm a texas oil man funded ryans research 
richardson said ryan later exchanged the data with thomas g 
thompson a president of columbusamerica and that thompson used 
the data to locate the wreck site the university claims 
columbusamerica then misled the public by saying the wreck was 
discovered when it hadnt been based on columbusamerica claims 
ryan informed john and grimm that the search was over and they had 
been beaten 
attorneys for columbusamerica denied the ryan data was of any 
use 
thompson said sonar surveys in 1986 pinpointed one target that 
we felt very good about the ohiobased group recovered 
artifacts from the site consistent with the time period the central 
america sank on the basis of those artifacts kellam gave the 
group exclusive rights in 1987 to the site 
thompson said that while reviewing the 1986 data in preparation 
for a 1988 search experts found a second target that looked even 
better than the first since the second target was on the way to 
the original search site thompson said he decided to test out the 
equipment on the second target 
the new sonar survey show the second site 33 miles from the 
first was most probably the central america further surveys 
showed it was 
richardson argued the second site was one identified by ryan 
and asserted the new york city school had an interest in the gold 
its a lot like an astronomer taking a picture of the sky 
that picture might contain an unknown planet but the astronomer 
never sees it then 30 years later after exhaustive research a 
second astronomer identifies the unknown planet and the first 
tries to claim he found it 30 years earlier said richard t 
robol a norfolk attorney representing columbusamerica 
it was unclear how long the trial might take or when a decision 
could be expected attorneys originally said the case would take at 
least a week to try 
when the central america sank in a hurricane it was loaded with 
passengers and gold from the california gold fields the value of 
the cargo was estimated at 16 million at the time the 
columbusamerica discovery group estimates the current value could 
reach 1 billion 
more than a ton of gold has been recovered columbusamerica 
officials estimate more than 2 tons remain on the oceans floor 
efforts to raise the rest of the treasure are on hold awaiting the 
outcome of the legal battle columbusamerica officials said

british officials trying to limit the upheaval 
caused by its unpopular new local government tax on tuesday 
ordered the 20 highestspending authorities to impose lower taxes 
and cut budgets 
the move came in the aftermath of violence in central london on 
saturday night after a rally against the socalled poll tax turned 
into a mob riot through the capitals west end 
environment secretary chris patten set the topspending 
authorities a 28day deadline to reduce the tax for this fiscal 
year if they refuse patten will impose the cuts 
it is deplorable that local authorities have chosen to budget 
at these levels putting an unacceptable burden on the local 
people patten told the house of commons it is little wonder 
that strong feelings have been expressed up and down the country 
the opposition socialist labor party described the move as a 
final admission of the poll taxs failure 
labor controls 18 of the councils targeted and the other two 
have no party with overall control no council run by prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative party was included in the 
list 
this chargecapping list will be universally regarded as a 
political fix said labors bryan gould who leads the socialist 
partys attack on the tax officially known as the community 
charge 
they the government have given up trying to make the poll 
tax work their sole and squalid aim now is to shift the blame 
for the whole poll tax fiasco for which they alone are 
responsible said gould 
the cuts ordered by patten ranged from 161 lopped off the 691 
tax levied by a west london district hammersmith and fulham to a 
modest 46 off the 733 tax set by st helens in northwest england 
patten said he selected the districts out of more than 400 in 
england in wales because their budgets were the highest above 
government targets 
councilors from the districts singled out described the move as 
vindictive and said they will mount legal challenges some warned 
they would have to cut services ranging from running schools and 
old age homes to garbage collection 
mrs thatchers original aim was to undermine support for 
laborrun councils because they set high tax rates but instead 
both labor and tory councils have set tax levels over the 
government targets and mrs thatcher is being blamed 
the average tax level including in conservativerun districts 
is 592 a person about onethird higher than the government target 
both government and labor lawmakers have condemned saturdays 
riot in which mobs tore though londons west end burning cars 
looting smashing shop windows and terrifying shoppers 
theatergoers and sightseers 
police say the violence which began with an attempt to storm 
mrs thatchers 10 downing street residence was organized by 
extreme leftwing groups and anarchists 
the riot appears likely to benefit mrs thatcher 
you can barely conceal your delight at the diversion the 
uproar provided labor leader neil kinnock declared in angry 
exchanges with mrs thatcher in the commons before pattens 
announcement 
when it comes to extremists the difference is this i fight 
them you need them kinnock added his voice nearly drowned by 
tory lawmakers shouts of protest 
mrs thatcher retorted that kinnock talked nonsense 
she argues that the tax which came into effect april 1 is 
fairer because most of britains 38 million adults are liable 
instead of only property owners under the previous system of local 
taxes 
but the tax has become a major political liability for the 
government now trailing labor by more than 20 points in popularity 
ratings 
most families are paying about onethird more than previously 
but it benefits people who live alone and paid the same as 
neighboring households of three or four adults

the presidents of central america 
on tuesday called for the contra rebels to begin disbanding now and 
surrender their weapons to international monitors 
the arms should be destroyed immediately in the presence of 
observers from the five central america countries the presidents 
said in a joint statement 
foreign minister miguel descoto of nicaragua read the statement 
at a news conference at the close of a twoday meeting on central 
american peace the sessions in montelimar a beach resort 40 miles 
from managua brought together the presidents of nicaragua 
honduras costa rica el salvador and guatemala 
the close of the summit was jarred by a strong earthquake 
measuring 65 on the richter scale that rocked the capital 
managua the pacific coast area and parts of neighboring costa 
rica the resort itself sustained structural damage to a complex 
center building and one of its swimming pools 
contra rebel leaders based in honduras had already announced 
monday they would disband by april 18 a week before conservative 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro takes office in 
nicaragua 
several thousand rebels inside nicaragua are expected to follow 
suit rallying at predetermined safety zones in line with an 
agreement reached by the five presidents at a previous summit 
the demobilization will end nine years of contra war supported 
by the united states against outgoing president daniel ortegas 
leftist sandinista regime mrs chamorro won by a landslide in 
elections feb 25 
according to the presidents agreement announced tuesday the 
demobilization and surrender of the weapons should start 
immediately and end by april 25 at the latest 
all rebel weapons surrendered to the un peacekeepers and other 
international monitors should be destroyed on the spot in the 
presence of representatives from other central american governments 
invited for that purpose the agreement said 
the earthquake began just as ortega and chamorro were walking 
down the stairs together from the meeting hall after the last 
session of the summit 
they both halted and waited until the earth stopped rocking 
then they walked down to a hall on the ground floor where the news 
conference was held with about 100 journalists

colombias cocaine capital of medellin authorities said at least 
nine attackers were reported slain 
gunmen kidnapped a federal senator and a leading bogota 
newspaper left its editorial column blank after threats from the 
traffickers 
the government of president virgilio barco pressed on in its 
usbacked war against the drug dealers it announced it would 
soon extradite three more drug suspects including a congressman 
el tiempo newspaper reported 
last week the traffickers threatened to explode a fiveton bomb 
in bogota for every new extradition 
battles between authorities and cocaine barons intensified over 
the past week after the government renewed its program of 
extraditing drug suspects to the united states in january the 
medellin cocaine cartel had claimed it was defeated and curtailed 
attacks 
the military also announced tuesday the capture of marlon perez 
madrid who allegedly ran the medellin cartels murder squads in 
envigado four miles south of the city 
envigado with 80000 residents is under martial law the 
government disbanded the towns police force last week accusing 
nine of its 27 officers of working for cartel leader pablo escobar

supervisors and outside workers filled in for 
11000 striking workers tuesday at the largest us health 
maintenance organization which said it had potential substitutes 
on standby as far away as oregon 
in the second day of the walkout services were cut and some 
clinics closed by kaiser permanente of southern california which 
has more than 15 million members 
ive cleaned as many toilets in two days as ive ever 
cleaned in my life said elisabeth breegle who usually spends 
her days in meetings at kaiser permanentes largest facility on 
sunset boulevard in los angeles

were working 12hour shifts 
weve all been called weve all been chosen she said 
kaiser permanente like other hmos offers its members medical 
care for a prepaid fixed price rather than on a paypervisit 
basis its emergency services were unaffected but some patients 
had appointments postponed or moved to open clinics officials said 
about 150 kaiser patients had been transferred to community 
hospitals kaiser spokeswoman janice seib said 
no contract talks were scheduled with the striking nurses 
technicians and maintenance workers negotiations with a federal 
mediator ended saturday without agreement between pasadenabased

two idaho state university physicists 
claimed tuesday that they produced a cold fusion reaction with a 
different element than those used in experiments by two chemists 
from utah and england 
physics professor kenneth faler said he and stanley vegors 
produced the reaction march 13 by saturating a small rod of 
titanium metal in a bottle of deuterium gas cooled to minus 300 
degrees fahrenheit 
the device produced bursts of neutrons presumably the fusion 
of two deuterons into as yet undetermined products faler told a 
news conference 
a deuteron is the nucleus of an atom of deuterium an isotope of 
hydrogen in one type of fusion reaction two deuterium nuclei fuse 
to form helium 
this is a physical process in which deuterium gas stored in a 
bottle is absorbed into titanium metal at low temperatures and low 
pressure and as the metal heats up it emits neutrons faler said 
it appears we have produced cold fusion reactions in a 
different way he claimed there are now two techniques 
the two researchers were spurred by reports a year ago that 
chemist b stanley pons of the university of utah and british 
colleague martin fleishmann of the university of southampton had 
achieved sustained nuclear fusion in a seemingly simple experiment 
the ponsfleischmann device consists of a palladium electrode 
wrapped in platinum wire and immersed in deuterium oxide or heavy 
water then charged with electricity 
pons and fleischmanns seeming breakthrough was questioned when 
researchers in other laboratories had trouble duplicating their 
results while many scientists say they doubt cold fusion exists 
experiments continue around the world 
the idaho state researchers observed neutrons using instruments 
at the schools lowenergy accelerator facility laboratory 
the emission of neutrons is generally believed by the 
scientific community to be an almost positive guarantee that 
nuclear reactions have taken place faler said such a 
reaction if it takes place on a large scale might be able to 
produce enormous amounts of energy faler said 
john knox acting director of the idaho state physics 
department said that although the fusion experiments are 
important science requires that results must be repeatable 
im still skeptical about cold fusion in the original sense 
that was talked about a year ago but it appears something is 
happening he said 
the idaho report which has not been published in any scientific 
journals apparently confirms the discovery reported recently by a 
group of italian scientists working at the frascati research 
laboratory near rome faler said 
the isu information was compared with the italians findings in 
a march conference at the national cold fusion institute in utah 
four labs worldwide have seen similar results scientists at the 
los alamos facility in new mexico and the bhabha atomic research 
center near bombay india have viewed neutron bursts under similar 
conditions

portauprince haiti ap a soldier carrying grenades seized 
a new yorkbound jumbo jet at haitis airport and threatened to 
blow it up tuesday if he was not flown to the united states 
a radio report however said the 20yearold soldier let the 
small number of passengers and crew aboard american airlines flight 
658 get off officials confirmed he was alone on board the craft 
pvt pierre gerald an airport security guard boarded the 
airbus a300 on monday afternoon as it was preparing to leave for 
new york said radio haiti inter and an american airlines spokesman 
the radio said the young soldier had grenades when he 
commandeered the plane in an attempt to desert the army after an 
officer reprimanded him for alleged insubordination it said gerald 
had been in the army two years 
us ambassador alvin adams minister of the interior joseph 
maxi and police commissioner jeanclaude duperval went to the 
airport tuesday 
after a popular uprising drove lt gen prosper avril from power 
last month adams reportedly helped persuade the fallen military 
ruler to leave the country haiti now has a civilian government 
the radio said negotiations with military and airport officials 
monday night were fruitless and gerald spent the night alone in the 
aircraft no flights were arriving or taking off from the airport 
tuesday 
on tuesday night it appeared authorities would let gerald sleep 
inside the empty jet a second night no special security measures 
were taken at the airport 
a military expert who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
doubted the soldier could blow up the plane with grenades because 
the engines were turned off and the fuel remained under the wings 
he said seats would probably cushion a grenade explosion and he 
doubted that fragments could reach the fuel tank 
the rev gerard jeanjuste said in a telephone call from the 
haitian capital tuesday that he found out about the incident when 
he went to board a plane tuesday and discovered the airport closed 
according to jeanjuste the soldier had grenades and possibly an 
uzi submachine gun 
gerald gave officials until noon tuesday to fly him to miami a 
few minutes before the deadline he appeared in the planes doorway 
and shot once into the tarmac haiti inter said 
no injuries were reported

president fidel castro of cuba told the united 
states on tuesday not to interfere with his jamming of voice of 
america television broadcasts because it could lead to war 
the hardline communist leader was referring to usfunded 
voice of america programs beamed from miami to cuba the islands 
government has been jamming them since they started march 27 
if the us undertakes a surgical operation against the 
systems of interference of its anticuban television we will try 
and make the surgeon come out of it as badly as possible the 
cuban government news agency prensa latina reported castro as 
saying 
at a news conference he warned that cuba can also carry out 
surgical operations and remarked that such a us action could end 
in war prensa latina said 
the dispatch monitored in mexico city only paraphrased 
castros words it gave no direct quotes 
castro said cuba seeks no military confrontation but he 
said it does not fear the us and is ready to confront them on 
any ground the dispatch added 
in other remarks to an associated press reporter and other 
journalists in havana castro raised the possibility tuesday night 
that his government will retaliate by blocking us radio 
transmissions to the island 
speaking for more than two hours castro assailed the voice of 
america tv project as a gross instrument of subversion 
although he did not announce new responses he said cuba 
reserves the right to exercise that option if this aggression 
continues 
castro left the impression that one of the moves under 
consideration would involve radio marti the 5yearold voice of 
america project that broadcasts news and entertainment to cuban 
listeners 
tv marti can make radio marti surface again castro said 
we cant exclude this possibility this problem is still 
unsettled 
previously castro threatened to retaliating by interfering with 
american broadcast signals in florida 
on monday president bush hailed tv marti as the latest us 
effort to broadcast the truth to communist countries 
the television station is named after jose marti a hero of 
cuban independence 
the cuban dispatch tuesday reported fidel castro said the 
us decision to name its anticuban television channel with the 
name of the national hero jose marti is the same as if he we named 
a garbage can george washington

the white house said tuesday it will not 
nominate housing secretary jack kemps choice to lead a new housing 
agency kemps selection mary k bush is under investigation for 
awarding nobid contracts to friends 
ms bush met kemp later tuesday and accepted his offer to stay 
on as managing director of the new agency the federal housing 
finance board said her spokesman joseph slye 
she will remain in charge of its daytoday activities but 
without a vote on its fivemember board which controls up to 100 
million a year in new housing money 
the administration said ms bush would not be nominated as 
chairwoman because she was seeking a fulltime post and the white 
house has decided the agencys board should serve part time 
the interests were not compatible said white house deputy 
press secretary stephen hart he echoed comments from kemp aides in 
saying the investigation of ms bushs conduct regarding the 
contracts was considered a separate matter from the question of 
her nomination 
ms bush has been serving as acting director of the new agency 
for seven months awaiting her promised nomination as fulltime 
chairwoman during that wait however kemp aides decided to push 
for a parttime board and instead create the fulltime position of 
managing director for ms bush 
as the only named board member kemp has remained in sole 
control of the agency 
kemp asked hud inspector general paul a adams last week to 
review three nobid contracts ms bush awarded during the past 
seven months as part of her effort to get the fledgling agency 
running adams report is expected later this week 
unclear on tuesday was whether the offer of the managing 
director job would be withdrawn if adams criticizes ms bush in his 
report 
several kemp aides did not return telephone messages 
the three contracts were given by ms bush to friends with whom 
she worked in the reagan administration although the housing 
finance board by law does not have to put contracts out for 
competitive bidding kemp aides have criticized ms bush for 
awarding the nobid contracts including one to wendell gunn 
kemps former chief of staff at the department of housing and urban 
development 
kemp aides insist that the housing secretary did not know about 
the nobid contracts until two weeks ago hud undersecretary alfred 
dellibovi also said he first became aware of the contracts two 
weeks ago as did mary brunette kemps closest advisor 
gunn however insists he told kemp in november and offered to 
end the agreement if it bothered kemp and dellibovi in an 
internal memo to ms brunette and five other kemp aides two months 
ago listed wendell among those being paid by the housing 
finance board 
the dellibovi memo obtained by the associated press also 
offers evidence that at least dellibovi at hud wanted ms bush to 
leave the agency as far back as feb 5 despite repeated public 
assertions that she remained kemps choice for the job 
if he goes lets hope he takes mary dellibovi wrote after a 
passage about the plans of wendell to leave the agency 
the housing finance board was created as part of the savings and 
loan industry bailout to oversee the 12 regional federal home loan 
banks and to funnel a percentage of their profits each year into 
affordable housing programs 78 million this year and rising to 
100 million a year 
ms bush according to sources has protested the decision to 
make the board part time she left a vice presidency at the federal 
national mortgage association for the housing board job after being 
lobbied by kemp 
when details of the dellibovi memo were first reported last 
week hud sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
kemp deputies had determined the housing secretary would have more 
influence over a parttime board because of his cabinet ranking 
members of congress who authored the law creating the agency 
said they envisioned a fulltime board but it is unclear whether 
they will resist the administration attempt to name a parttime 
panel

mark white whose gubernatorial comeback 
bid died in the democratic primary accused treasurer ann richards 
on tuesday of dirty politics and likened her behavior to gestapo 
chief heinrich himmlers 
i will never endorse ann richards i will never support ann 
richards and i will never vote for ann richards white told 
reporters 
white stopped short of endorsing state attorney general jim 
mattox over ms richards in the april 10 democratic runoff for 
governor but said he would vote in that race he declined to 
criticize mattoxs tactics during the mudslinging primary 
ive always thought he was one of the toughest campaigners 
ive ever seen white said but what ann richards has done 
would make himmler blush 
mattox said tuesday night that he has signed statements from 
witnesses alleging ms richards has used illegal drugs 
yes i do as a matter of fact mattox told reporters 
questioning him about proof for allegations he has made regarding 
ms richards 
but mattox refused to say who his informants are 
mattox made the comments during a televised halfhour debate 
that ms richards declined to attend citing a previous engagement 
in austin 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic has refused to answer 
directly the question of her alleged drug use saying she has not 
used any moodaltering drugs in 10 years 
my response has been my message to the people out there that 
if you need help you can get help ms richards earlier in march 
ms richards did not immediately answer three messages left on 
an answering machine at her headquarters and calls to ms 
richards press secretary and campaign manager were not immediately 
returned 
before the debate she said i have a big rally in austin that 
we had planned for a very long time the television people knew 
that we told them that i couldnt come 
white said he wouldnt vote for ms richards should she win the 
nomination to challenge republican clayton williams 
if she gets the nomination it will be without my help and i 
think if shes able to be elected shell have it in the same 
fashion white said 
the former governor blasted ms richards for tv commercials and 
speeches in which she alleged he had profited from public service 
and helped his old law firm obtain state bond business while he was 
governor 
i think ive been probably been madder from time to time but 
this one they pretty well ripped their britches with me he 
said saying ms richard had made remarks that were patently 
false maliciously made and she should have had better judgment 
in the primary ms richards captured 39 percent of the vote to 
37 percent for mattox and 19 percent for white who was governor 
from 1983 to 1987 
i feel very badly about any time there is hard feelings ms 
richards said at a campaign stop in mercedes before whites 
comment i feel badly about any personal feelings that ever get 
into a campaign i feel sure that all of those wounds will be 
healed and the democrats will be together in november 
her campaign spokesman monte williams did not immediately 
return calls seeking comment about whites remarks 
white said ms richards deliberately distorted his record and 
ran campaign advertisements that lied about him 
ann richards willfully and knowingly smeared me with false 
accusations that she knew at the time to be untrue she didnt do 
it just once in the heat of an argument she did it with 
inexcusable regularity in the last days of the campaign he said 
he said ms richards ran the dirtiest campaign he ever witnessed 
i know tough politics i have been in some rough campaigns 
in my career and i know how to dish it out and i know how to take 
it he said but there is a difference between negative 
advertising and unfounded vicious personal attacks that are 
outandout lies 
i think she overstepped the bounds of decency by smearing my 
name in such a vicious way he said

teenagers who insist on cruising in the 
city that inspired the film american graffiti risk fines under 
a pair of ordinances that won final approval on tuesday 
under the new rules which take effect may 5 motorists would 
face fines of 75 to 250 for passing a designated checkpoint more 
than once every four hours pedestrians gathered in parking lots 
and along sidewalks would risk equal fines for loitering between 6 
pm and 6 am 
officers will enforce the rules within a marked nocruising zone 
on the popular mchenry avenue when traffic moves slower than 5 mph 
or intersections are blocked 
the ordinances do not affect the annual graffiti night which 
celebrates the cruising tradition in grand proportions with up to 
100000 people in 30000 cars 
the rules were sought by residents and business owners who 
complained that the goodnatured pastime of the 1950s had grown 
unmanageable with the influence of drugs gangs and vandalism 
but the rite of passage was defended by teenagers who grew up 
with the legacy of george lucas 1973 film they argued their 
motives were as innocent as their parents showing off cars and 
meeting dates

a meandering flow of molten lava from 
kilauea volcano had residents of this coastal community packing 
their belongings tuesday and preparing to leave 
a flow from the west the most serious threat advanced within 
50 yards of five homes in the kalapana gardens subdivision 
according to hawaii county civil defense spokesman bruce butts 
the flow moved 200 yards during a 12hour period ending early 
tuesday butts said the flow picked up speed by midmorning 
residents of 50 of the 125 homes in kalapana gardens evacuated 
monday and an order affecting seven more homes was issued later 
tuesday butts said 
many residents were stoic about the encroaching lava drinking 
beer and laughing with friends while watching the molten earth edge 
toward their homes 
morale is really high were just sticking together said 
craig heiser who built his home in 1987 
its a little like a party atmosphere he said you cant 
do anything about it so you might as well enjoy it 
people who live here are emotionally prepared for it but you 
still hope its not going to happen said donna olson whose home 
was destroyed in the 1986 flow and lives with her three children in 
a rented house threatened by the west flow 
what else can you do this is the hawaiian style of doing 
things i just want to get it over with said julie beardsley 
who lives in one of the five homes immediately threatened 
another flow on the eastern side of the community was moving 
toward the subdivision along the path of a 1989 flow and was about 
a halfmile from nearest homes butts said 
some of the residents hired container trucks to carry their 
belongings away many others were packing in anticipation of an 
eventual evacuation order 
i ran into a couple of people who didnt seem too concerned 
about it but most people are concerned and moving whatever they 
can said civil defense spokesman allen parker 
civil defense administrator harry kim also ordered the kalapana 
area closed to tourists and other visitors 
scientists said about 650000 cubic yards of lava was being 
pumped out of the volcanos kupaianaha vent each day 
tom wright chief scientist at the hawaiian volcano observatory 
said the lava began spreading over the slope a week ago 
now it has gathered itself into a couple of significant 
flows he said 
wright said that based on the topography of the area the two 
flows could join and send a single stream of molten lava into 
kalapana gardens 
since the east rift zone eruption began on jan 3 1983 76 
dwellings and a national park visitor center have been destroyed 
causing more than 20 million in damage 
kilauea volcano is near the southeast coast on the island of 
hawaii which is about 200 miles from honolulu on the island of 
oahu

gov mario cuomos administration set 
welfare rates so low that some families were forced into 
homelessness the state court of appeals ruled tuesday 
the high court unanimously reversed a lower court verdict and 
ordered a new trial in the case of barbara jiggetts a new york 
city woman who complained about low welfare rates 
the court agreed with welfare advocates who argued the shelter 
allowance in the states basic welfare grant was set far below 
market rates for even the cheapest housing available 
a schedule establishing assistance levels so low that it 
forces large numbers of families with dependent children into 
homelessness does not meet the statutory standard judge richard 
simons wrote 
state social service commissioner cesar peraes in a prepared 
statement said the state will discuss the welfare rates before a 
lower court 
attorneys for jiggett said they believed the court of appeals 
strong language in the decision would make it hard for a lower 
court not to order increased welfare rates 
its a great decision and its very important for the welfare 
population of new york said allan gropper of the state bar 
associations project for the homeless of the city he said studies 
have shown as many as onethird of new york citys homeless 
population had been evicted from apartments 
jiggetts a single mother of three from the borough of queens 
sued new york city social service officials in 1987 when she was 
being evicted from her apartment she has since found housing but 
other families joined the lawsuit and the jurisdiction was switched 
to the state said matthew diller a lawyer for the new york legal 
aid society 
christopher lamb another legal aid society lawyer said the 
shelter allowance for a family of four in new york city is 312 a 
month however the federal department of housing and urban 
development reports the average market rate for a twobedroom 
apartment for poor people in new york city is 566 
people shouldnt be sent out into the new york city market and 
be told you have to find an apartment for a family of four at 312 
a month lamb said its like hitting your head against the

economy in crisis and growing terrorism 
pollsters predict the election will end like those in june and 
november 1989 with no party winning enough seats to control the 
government 
coalitions formed after last years elections took no effective 
action on foreign domestic or economic policy the european 
community has said greece is in danger of bankruptcy and the ec 
will not bail it out because greece violated austerity requirements 
of a 1985 loan 
some greek officials and economists fear the nation may have to

how fast will global warming raise earths 
temperatures how much will temperatures rise will coastal cities 
be flooded by rising sea levels 
at the center of the stormy debate over the greenhouse effect 
one bright area of calm remains charles keelings curve 
the curve is a record of the slow inexorable climb of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere during the past 30 years 
keeling a chemist at the university of california at san diego 
has made it his lifes work to develop the most detailed and 
accurate measurements possible of carbon dioxide 
carbon dioxide traps the suns heat in the atmosphere and 
keelings curve charting its rise is at the heart of the debate 
over how much the earths temperature is likely to rise and how 
fast 
today this everlengthening record keelings curve provides 
a sort of timelapse xray movie of the workings of the spheres a 
surprising inside view of our planets metabolism says writer 
jonathan weiner 
weiner tells the story of the selfeffacing keeling for the 
first time in a lucid and compelling book the next one hundred 
years keeling weiner says is measuring the breathing of the 
world 
keelings findings are sobering the amount of carbon dioxide in 
the air has increased by 12 percent just since 1958 
thanks to keelings thoroughness that figure is ironclad 
researchers debate the effects of that rise but they dont argue 
with keelings numbers 
for his part keeling sticks to his work he hasnt played a 
large role in the national debate which has grown in intensity as 
the 20th anniversary of earth day approaches april 22 and concern 
over the environment increases 
but he does have words of warning for those who wave off the 
fuss and argue that the earths temperature may not be climbing 
to suppose it isnt going to go up at all would indicate that 
somehow the earth just naturally gets this warm and then stops 
warming keeling said in a telephone interview 
there shouldnt be any reason we know of that the earth 
wouldnt continue to warm up he said furthermore we know 
from geological history that it was warmer once upon a time so 
logic suggests that the greenhouse warming has to take place but 
how much warming and how soon whats demanded now by political 
realities is some fairly hard numbers and those are not 
forthcoming 
the average temperature of the earth is about 60 degrees 
fahrenheit keeling said with no carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
it would be 0 degrees and the earth would be a frozen wasteland 
unable to support human life 
the rise in carbon dioxide is due largely to the increasing use 
of fossil fuels coal and oil during the industrial age keeling 
said as carbon dioxide has risen the production and burning of 
fossil fuels also has increased he said 
in fact the shape of the carbon dioxide curve looks very 
much like the shape of the curve for fossil fuel production 
keeling said 
research also suggests the earths temperature is rising but 
researchers cant be sure despite all the concern about global 
warming no one is making an effort to measure temperatures the way 
keeling measured carbon dioxide 
there is no explicit program to measure air temperatures to 
look for these changes he said airport temperatures are 
distorted because they are taken close to cities 
the way around that is to establish some very good stations 
that are not near cities he said 
a government agricultural weather monitoring network that could 
be adapted for that purpose is being cut back to save money 
keeling said 
theyre compromising the system we already have just at the 
time youd like to know if its getting warmer he said 
keeling now is busy trying to determine how variations in the 
suns heat affect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as always he 
sticks to the data 
i dont think im in a position to make a strong stand on the 
greenhouse warming effect he said 
but he does place himself with those who see danger ahead 
there are people who say the earth is robust and theres a 
technological fix for almost anything he said keeling is not 
among them 
i do subscribe to the position that most of the things we 
would do if we were worried about the greenhouse effect are worth 
doing for instance conserving energy he said 
beyond that keeling wont venture an opinion where he doesnt 
have sound scientific data to back him up 
how much will earths temperatures rise and how fast 
i have personal feelings on it but they tend to change as i 
hear what other people say he said i can be pushed around 
like all the rest of you as new facts come to light

their tongues for one shot then came more interviews some with 
more intense grilling about his 1962 rush to fame as te lawrence 
the sandy mystic warrior dramatized in david leans oscarwinning 
lawrence of arabia 
otoole still so gaunt hed be marked absent if he turned 
sideways was goodnatured and gracious about it all like many 
whove begun on the british stage he realizes publicity is part of 
the actors territory 
but he isnt sure why he became an actor his first desire was 
to fight hitler that would have been difficult though he was 
only 8 when the war began so he did the next best thing 
at 16 he went to work at a newspaper in yorkshire england 
where hed grown up after his family left ireland i did love it 
we shot out four editions a day he says of his days as an 
inkstained wretch 
otoole who still has pals from those days one now the 
assistant editor of the times of london learned all phases of 
newspapering from pressroom to pubcrawling his first big 
interview was with the actress margaret lockwood 
but something happened i dont know what and i joined the 
navy he says he served on a submarine and later a corvette 
the latter the small alwaysrolling ship about which nicholas 
monsarrat wrote in the cruel sea 
my dream when i was 17 was a big one otoole says i 
couldnt make up my mind whether i was to be editor of paris match 
or of life a sigh his eyes twinkle i finished up as a typist 
on a corvette during the cod wars 
that isnt the usual preparation for the royal academy of 
dramatic arts but after leaving the service he attended that 
distinguished school where he began learning his actors craft 
shakespeare and all that 
in time he also learned of the slings and arrows of outrageous 
critics how does he regard critics now he smiles i disregard 
them when youve been punching along in the game as long i have 
you find they go away and die 
beside paying the rent and then some acting has enabled him to 
see the world and meet fascinating people high on his list of 
great characters is huston the late film director whom he calls 
a magnanimous and good friend to me 
he struck wonderful poses john otoole says he smiles at 
the memory of a time he and the director emerged from a london 
studio and found a young man lying on the street a small crowd 
gathered around him 
neither of them knew the man who lay very still not moving a 
muscle 
so john walked up to him otoole imitated the director 
leaning over and examining the fallen with a seemingly professional 
eye and pronounced kurtll be fine kurtll be just fine 
standing in the group was a man who said sir im a doctor 
and otooles voice took on a dramatic edge that young man 
has been dead for 30 minutes 
 
elsewhere in television 
yet another reason to say oh wow nbc on may 6 will show a tv 
movie archie to riverdale and back again based on the 
longrunning cartoon strip archie the strips teenagers who 
include betty veronica and jughead have yet to graduate from 
either high school or innocence 
but in the movie a spokesman says they will be 
thirtysomething facing such woes of the 90s as divorce career 
changes and single parenthood

an unexpected resurrection of nations from 
totalitarianism has swept eastern europe in recent months 
reintroducing longtrampled freedoms and reducing international 
distrust the first story in a fivepart easter series 
resurrection of nations examines the surprising upheaval and 
its religious threads 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a blink the landscape heaved and the world changed people 
could hardly believe it amazed incredulous they saw a new 
reality dawning over the earth surmounting old fears and fatalism 
the grim immutable facts of their existence were suddenly not 
what they had seemed 
that baffled astonishment among eastern europeans at their burst 
from bondage also resonates in the recorded reaction to the 
resurrection of christ and the liberating word of easter 
it has indeed been miraculous a miracle that happened in the 
souls of people said the rev john meyendorff a scholar of the 
russianderived but independent orthodox church in america it 
has been a resurrection from a long deadening of individual 
creativity and the godgiven dignity of being human for millions of 
people 
no one could have predicted its suddenness and sweep he said 
i never thought id live to see it people are finding it hard to 
believe 
an idle tale the apostles scoffed at first reports of 
christs resurrection it made no sense the buried restored to 
life they couldnt conceive of it until it confronted them 
directly and plainly 
likewise it had seemed impossible that half a continent could 
so rapidly be raised from its deep abyss of totalitarian 
repression yet in a swift seismic wave of decisive events the 
whole posture of nations took another form 
in a seeming instant a new era of expanding rights and greater 
international trust yawned wide 
symbolizing the farreaching phenomenon the berlin wall that 
barrier of cold war that for three decades had divided humanity 
literally and figuratively at last came tumbling down nov 9 
among rejoicing throngs an east german friar said with a 
chuckle the iron curtain is not so much iron anymore 
the walls demise and the rest of the whirlwind that freed 
nations and eased superpower antagonisms symbolically reflected a 
scripture passage on christs crucifixion and resurrection 
for he is our peace who has made us both one and has broken 
down the dividing wall of hostility 
the changes came in tidal profusion in the soviet union and its 
satellite countries one after another like some pentup force 
breaking loose uncontainable overflowing toppling tyrants 
unleashing multitudes from their chains 
almost magically the changes came generally without violence 
in socalled soft or velvet revolutions 
not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord of 
hosts the biblical prophet zechariah said 
just as christs resurrection defied logic so on another plane 
did the breakthrough of nations the sweeping transformation of 
1989 contradicted all prior analyses and predictions it went 
against the prognostications of the keenest thinkers and the 
gloomiest doomsayers 
it is difficult to think of any series of developments more 
astonishing said roman catholic historiantheologian richard 
mcbrien 
harvard historian richard pipes wrote the recent events there 
have surpassed the wildest fantasies of any observer of soviet 
affairs who was willing to go on record 
the facts those grim facts of life in the soviet bloc were 
suddenly turned upside down just as christs followers rejoiced 
when he rose from the dead eastern europes long coerced and 
silenced millions lurched forth into the exhilarating yet 
bewilderingly unfamiliar light of new freedom 
we are like children waking from a nightmare in the middle of 
the night emilian mercan a member of the hastily formed 
provisional government of carisova romania said after the 
middecember collapse of the harsh ceausescu regime all we want 
is reassurance that it wont happen again 
gradually the countries of eastern europe are permitting such 
gifts to the spirit as the freedoms to speak out assemble 
organize and vote but the daybreak atmosphere like life itself 
is loaded with risk and uncertainty 
it happened so quickly said petar darliev a bulgarian 
imprisoned for nine years who at 74 is helping plan the countrys 
first multiparty elections in 45 years scheduled for june the 
hard part starts now 
it is a peculiar drama which no earthling could have 
written said previously imprisoned playwright vaclav havel 
chosen to be czechoslovakias president by a new parliament in 
december general elections are set for june 8 
of the times before the crucifixion the apostle paul wrote 
we know that the whole world has been groaning in travail until 
now 
for much of the 20th century the globe has been groaning 
caught in a tightening nuclear stranglehold with no apparent way 
to escape 
but the metamorphosis provided by christ has come in a 
different order for nations writing after christ rose from the 
tomb paul said so then you are no longer strangers and 
sojourners but fellow citizens and members of the household of 
god 
the pace and scope of the changes have left statesmen and 
pundits groping for reasons scrambling to adjust to the 
transfigured scene they came in such a mounting crescendo as to 
seem almost sheer revelation 
one sees evidence of divine providence in human events like 
this said church historian robert t handy who could have 
thought it would happen 
handy historian emeritus of new yorks union theological 
seminary said he was worried about a backlash were still 
dealing with politics but he cited church involvement in eastern 
europes reform movements in saying 
the ferment for freedom has always been very strong in the 
jewishchristian tradition it boils up again and again and has 
throughout history it can be put down but it boils up again 
the hand of god can be seen in these developments handy 
added god does work in history 
so do people what scripture calls gods coworkers jesus in 
giving up his life for a greater one at easter said people would 
have to endure oppression and pain but a better time beckoned 
you will be sorrowful he said before his death at the hands 
of an occupation military regime that dominated a subjugated 
people but your sorrow will turn into joy

all at once democratic processes have come 
alive in the soviet union its monolithic communist system starting 
to crumble after 72 years of regimentation that enormous change at 
the core of communism the soviet union is the focus of the second 
story in a fivepart easter series resurrection of nations

when secretary of state james a baker iii met with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in wyoming last fall they 
exchanged gifts baker gave cowboy boots to shevardnadze who 
presented baker with an enameled picture of jesus teaching the 
people 
you see shevardnadze remarked even we communists are 
changing our world view 
recalling the incident later baker surmised that some innate 
resurgence of faith may have been at the roots of the 
revolutionary changes sweeping eastern europe 
the lightninglike reformation that has flashed over the soviet 
colossus and its peripheries is so striking that it marks the 
beginning of a new era of world affairs president bush said in 
his stateoftheunion address 
it is a kind of metaphor for easter a rebirth of worldly hopes 
a resurrection of regimented millions from capitivity 
it has raised the spirits of oppressed people all over the 
world not only in eastern europe but in south africa and 
elsewhere said the dean of us roman catholic historians 
monsignor john tracy ellis 
the reanimation swelled in the soviet heartland after racing 
around its borders at the end of 1989 the soviet parliament voted 
feb 27 to surrender the communist partys constitutional monopoly 
of power as societys guiding force a step approved last month 
by the 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
this was an historic turning point for soviet communism a 
reversal of a constitutionally enshrined belief that only the party 
controlled the nation 
abandoning that dogma said roman szporiuk russian studies 
director at the university of michigan had seemed as implausible 
as a declaration from the pope in rome that there is no god 
measures also were adopted to create a westernstyle presidency 
and executive branch cabinet 
the congress of peoples deputies a popularly elected body 
established only a year ago includes several church leaders and 
many noncommunists it meets annually and elects the 542member 
standing parliament the supreme soviet the deputies elected 
gorbachev to a fiveyear term as president in 1995 the office 
becomes subject to national voting 
popular elections and other freedoms including approval of 
longbanned individual property rights and budding free enterprise 
have proliferated across that once totalitarian nation 
sergei a kovalev who spent a decade in labor camps said of 
his march victory in the first round of voting for the russian 
republics parliament that he could not previously have imagined 
such change 
an unseen mole of history has been digging he said 
people could not foresee this fast time frame the most 
optimistic of us only could hope for such changes across 100 
years 
communist repressions had weighed for nearly three quarters of 
the 20th century on the soviet union for its satellite nations 
the nazi occupation that began in 193839 gave way to soviet 
domination after world war ii 
tens of thousands of soviet citizens were tortured herded into 
slave labor camps or executed under the ruthless 24year rule of 
joseph stalin he established an absolutist police state that 
controlled every aspect of society the despotism continued with 
varying degrees of severity through stalins successors the party 
was a tiny minority of 19 million in a population of 287 million 
but its bureaucrats kgb agents and informers restricted religion 
muzzled speech print and broadcasts forbade ownership or 
assemblies jailed dissenters and promoted atheism as the state 
religion an official belief of disbelief 
in march 1985 a different kind of communist mikhail s 
gorbachev charismatic and tactically nimble took over the party 
the rigid communist autocracy began loosening its grip 
we need spiritual values we need a revolution of the mind 
gorbachev said on the eve of his unprecedented meeting with pope 
john paul ii last dec 1 at which the soviet leader agreed to end 
45 years of suppressing ukrainian catholicism we have changed 
our attitude about some matters such as religion 
gorbachev himself was baptized in infancy and reared in russian 
orthodoxy by a devout mother 
now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one should 
interfere in matters of individual conscience he said we also 
say that the moral values that religion generated and embodied for 
centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country 
all around gorbachev strains of liberty burst forth in his 
homeland political prisoners went free debate flew wide open 
diversity bloomed the superstructure loosened and private 
initiative took toddling steps 
people emigrated more freely 71196 jews left the soviet union 
in 1989 the most ever and 100000 are expected to do so in 1990 
while regular religious programming began for the first time on 
radio and television 
this is the day of resurrection for our church bishop 
innocent lotocky of chicagos ukrainianrite catholics said of the 
lifted ban on the church in the ukraine our church was crucified 
by the communists and sealed in the tomb but now it lives again 
russian orthodoxy reported the number of its active churches 
increased by almost 3000 in 1989 to a total of 9734 seminaries 
and enrollments multiplied fourfold 
similar expansion occurred among protestant churches baptists 
received permission to open their first seminary churches began 
the previously forbidden religious instruction of children 
soviet policy has shifted in 18 months from tolerance to 
active promotion of churches said philip oke of the 
interdenominational christian peace conference and a frequent 
visitor to eastern europe 
bibles and other religious literature poured into the soviet 
union bible societies formed and the academy of science approved 
a research project on personal values using the ten commandments 
the society for scientific atheism changed its name to the 
society of religion and atheism a baptist choir performed at a 
government cultural center and a usproduced evangelistic movie 
jesus dubbed into russian drew big audiences 
the striking changes were presaged at the 1988 celebration of 
christianitys thousandth anniversary in russia fervent crowds 
the presence of 500 church leaders from around the world and the 
participation of soviet officials as well as gorbachevs wife 
raisa left a lingering influence 
you are entering a new period of history for the nation 
american evangelist billy graham said then 
since then one after another old communist orders have fallen 
gradually in poland and hungry swiftly in east germany 
czechoslovakia and romania 
impulses of independence have flared in some of the 15 soviet 
republics chiefly the baltic states led by mostly catholic 
lithuania

it wills

against formidable odds the people prayed and marched week 
after week they kept at it coolheaded and persevering against 
dangers and initial reprisals church throngs repeatedly poured 
into the night streets of east german cities flickering candles 
aloft 
and they won 
in a steelhanded communist state ruled for 40 years by a 
despotic regime and its dreaded secret police the stasi the 
churches harbored a peaceable but unflinching dynamism that 
overthrew a seemingly immutable system 
everything is new everything is new a young baptist 
minister siegfried rosenmann rejoiced in east berlin after the 
regime collapsed 
the candlelight revolution was one of the strangest of all 
in a year of utterly strange revolutions that unleashed winds of 
democratic rights across eastern europe 
a miraculous experience lutheran theologian jurgen ziemer 
of leipzig said of those tenacious confrontations at which riot 
squads and plainclothes secret police abruptly stopped interfering 
and simply stood by we do not know what held them back 
contrary to engrained practice the enforcers just didnt act 
perhaps something like the benumbed roman guards at jesus tomb in 
a differing sense east germans and others emerged from smothering 
confinement into open air 
crushed human liberties are now alive again said the rev 
leonid kishkovsky president of the us national council of 
churches who recently visited east germany and other soviet bloc 
countries 
i see a miracle rooted in the way of the cross that has been 
lived by these people for decades kishkovsky said despite 
suppression and great difficulties the church has stood for 
another vision of the world in contradiction to totalitarianism 
that vision insists that no worldly authority may violate 
godbestowed rights of individuality and conscience the theme 
reverberates through the bible epitomized in moses demand of 
pharaoh let my people go 
the demonstrations were nurtured by east german churches where 
discussions on peacemaking justice and environmental concerns had 
gone on for years last oct 9 at st nicolas church in leipzig 
monday night services flowed outside drawing a crowd of 100000 
despite arrests and police beatings the weekly services grew 
attracting nonbelievers as well the nov 6 demonstration drew 
480000 by then demonstrations had spread to churches in dresden 
east berlin schwerin halle and wittenberg word had circulated 
on monday night something is happening at the churches 
in the land where 15th century reformer martin luther fired his 
protest against romes ecclesiastical domination the churches 
became havens rallying places and an umbrella for political as 
well as religious voices of reform 
no other social force in the country had independence from the 
state and party and could thus supply space for dialogue and 
inspiration said pastor werner widrat of lutheran gethsemane 
church in east berlin 
bolstering their peaceful tactics the predemonstration 
services often included scripture readings from the beatitudes 
blessed are the peacemakers blessed are those who are 
presecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven 
the churches had adopted the nonviolent tactics of martin 
luther king jr and mohandas gandhi typical of church messages 
issued in the crisis was this from thuringias lutheran bishop 
werner leich 
i beg you no matter what happens do not deviate from the 
principle of nonviolence do not let yourselves be intimidated 
any longer no renewal in the truth can come about unless we 
are willing to be bold and make sacrifices god has given us 
the spirit of strength our present way will not be easy but 
we shall succeed let us stand together 
crowds in bitterfeld and elsewhere sang the american civil 
rights anthem we shall overcome 
communist ruler erick honecker whose ironfisted rule lasted 18 
years was deposed oct 18 the berlin wall was opened nov 9 on 
jan 14 church mediators stopped the storming of east berlins 
secret police headquarters 
church leaders were credited for a pivotal role in the whole 
affair by world leaders including secretary of state james a 
baker iii and former west german chancellor willy brandt 
in ensuing sessions of the caretaker government new forum 
church figures led the transition prior to last months elections 
east berlin lutheran pastor rainer epplemann an early leader in 
church opposition to the regime served as minister without 
portfolio in the interim government he also headed the democratic 
reawakening party allied with the march 18 winning coalition 
favoring reunion with west germany 
at the same time lutheran pastor christian fuehrer of leipzigs 
st nicholas church warned against resurgent nationalism and 
obsession with western riches saying 
the cocacola culture is taking over and people are rushing 
blindly to change one set of chains for another 
and in a gesture of basic christian compassion lutheran bishop 
gottfried forck of berlinbrandenburg temporarily sheltered the 
fallen honecker he and his wife margot were declared 
homeless after a court ruled that the 77yearold dictators 
illness prevented jailing him on charges of high treason 
forck arranged for them to stay in two spare rooms at the home 
of lutheran pastor uwe homer noting that the shelter was offered 
in the spirit of christian mercy to sinners 
the broad turn to democracy started earlier and proceeded more 
gradually in poland and hungary 
in poland visited three times by the pope stubborn strikes and 
demonstrations in 1980 gave birth to the solidarity labor union 
the first in eastern europe the union backed by the church was 
outlawed in 1982 under martial law 
its leader lech walesa was arrested and other union leaders 
were driven underground but the union maintained pressure on the 
government the pressure coupled with a disastrous economy forced 
negotiations last year that led to the june 4 elections when 
solidarity swept into control of parliament 
in may 1988 hungary ousted its puppet party boss janos kadar 
who had ruled for 32 years ever since soviet tanks crushed a 
hungarian uprising in 1956 
a national catharsis came june 16 1989 when bodies of executed 
leaders of the revolt including that of prime minister imre nagy 
were exhumed from unmarked graves and reburied with honors 
in january 1989 hungary cut the electrified barbed wire along 
its border with austria opening it to vacationing east germans and 
others fleeing communist oppression 
all soviet troops are to be withdrawn from hungary by june 30 
1991 and last months multiparty elections were seen as the advent 
of working democracy 
god gives power to the faint wrote the biblical prophet 
isaiah they shall renew their strength they shall mount up with

the rout of communism spread swiftly but 
peaceably to czechoslovakia the fourth story in a fivepart easter 
series resurrection of nations concerns the czech surge to 
freedom and the rise of a wenceslas heritage as well as 
bulgarias repudiation of communism 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he was a beloved king wenceslas sainted and celebrated in song 
and story elevated to czechoslovakias throne in 922 in a popular 
uprising against an antireligious tyrant who had seized power by 
force and murder 
a statue of the good king presides over pragues historic 
gathering place wenceslas square where 10 days of huge protest 
marches culminated nov l7 in the overthrow of another dictatorship 
and the choice of another leader named wenceslas 
that is the latinized form of the czech name vaclav which 
is the first name of vaclav havel the repeatedly imprisoned 
playwright and straighttalking dissenter against authoritarianism 
now the countrys president 
plainly surprised even awestruck at the spontaneous rise of the 
populace against 40 years of sovietarmed communist rule havel 
called it one of those strangely true contradictions the power 
of the powerless 
this is the sort of paradox manifested in the easter events the 
crucifixion of jesus his disciples scattered in hiding but then 
his resurrection in glory 
he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god 
scripture says 
on a temporal level the sweeping overturn of communism across 
eastern europe has brought another kind of rebirth also astounding 
its a spiritual resurrection said olga hruby czechborn 
editor of the us documentary journal religion in communist 
dominated areas freedom had been buried for a long time now 
its alive 
people underwent terrible agonies and suffering now they 
have been restored to citizenship and given back their spiritual 
freedom theyve been resurrected 
in cobblestoned wenceslas square a halfmile long and 200 feet 
wide in the golden city of medieval towers and baroque domes 
havels dec 29 elevation to the presidency was greeted by 
firecracker salutes streamers and an embracing singing throng 
your government my people has been returned to you he 
said in his first televised address to the nation jan l 
paraphrasing a 17th century moravian religious reformer john amios 
comenius 
everywhere in the world people were surprised at how these 
malleable humiliated cynical citizens of czechoslovakia found 
the tremendous strength to cast off a totalitarian system in an 
entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks havel 
said 
we ourselves were surprised at it 
proclaiming amnesty for political prisoners and those convicted 
of nonviolent crimes he urged people to help them in a 
christian spirit to find in themselves what our prisons could 
not instill repentance and a desire to lead a good life 
havel 53 who served five years in prison for criticizing 
repressive rule ascribed the new freedom to the suffering of 
others who had struggled courageously in the soviet union east 
germany hungary poland and elsewhere 
referring to the years of persecutions with many dying in 
prisons many executed and thousands of lives destroyed he said 
it was these great sacrifices which wove the backdrop of our 
newly charged freedom 
all human suffering concerns each human being he said 
this is a biblical principle that humanity is interlinked and 
that abuse of anyone anywhere imperils everyone everywhere 
christianity holds that those who share the cross of christ in 
bearing their own cross for others share ultimately in his triumph 
of resurrection 
upon him was the chastisement that made us whole scripture 
says 
czechoslovakias aging once imprisoned catholic bishop fratisek 
tomacek helped lay the groundwork for upheaval in 1985 gathering 
600000 signatures on petitions demanding religious freedom 
when the november demonstrations prompted beatings and arrests 
tomacek risked new arrest by recalling the previously ignored plea 
and commending this huge protest against injustices committed 
against us for decades 
all around he said countries have broken out of the prison 
of totalitarian systems we must not wait any longer it is 
necessary to act 
such encouragement helped push crowds in wenceslas square to a 
half million despite 20degree weather for the first time we 
arent scared anymore exclaimed martin jestrik a cinema student 
and demonstration organizer 
the undaunted marchers forced out the communist autocrat milos 
jakes and the entire party resigned dec 3 it was replaced by a 
provisional noncommunist coalition civic forum whose initial 
moderator and chief spokesman was he once imprisoned catholic 
priest vaclav maly 
in the prague demonstrations he leaped to the platform and led 
demonstrators in the lords prayer 
freely competing political parties were authorized and a new 
cabinet was installed dec l0 involving several prominent 
christians among them were jan carnogursky a catholic lawyer 
freed from prison in november as deputy premier and czech brethren 
theologian josef hromodka as vice president 
havel seen making the sign of the cross at worship services in 
st vitus cathedral celebrating the downfall of communist rule

i have observed that our revolution thanks to its heavenly 
director has several elements of classical drama and theater of

thirdfloor offices in hardcany castle he grinned puzzling over 
his curious passage from jail to the castle

multiparty elections are set for june 8 havel got the soviets to 
agree to remove their troops by july 31 1991 
concurrent with czechoslovakias renewal presistent 
demonstrations in bulgaria initially crushed forced out the 
communist ruler of 35 years todor shivkov on nov 10 he is in

control in june elections the first in 45 years 
us secretary of state james a baker iii visiting the 
bulgarian capital of sofia on feb 10 told a cheering crowd you

it is all very extraordinary he added 
the only genuine backbone for all our actions if they are to 
be moral is responsibility responsibility to something higher 
than my family my country my firm my success 
if this voice of conscience is put ahead of politics

last years swirl of political change not only 
raised eastern european nations from oppression but also released 
liberating currents elsewhere this is the last story in a 
fivepart easter series resurrection of nations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in opera square in timisoara romania people these afternoons 
place lighted candles before wreaths and wooden portraits of jesus 
then kneel to pray in sorrow for those who died there in hope 
for the future of their nation 
that country where nicolae ceausescu had vowed communism would 
never budge not until pears grow on poplar trees broke free 
in one spontaneous instant when the despot was jeered in public 
forced to flee and four days later executed by a firing squad 
the upheaval which began with a lone pastor in timisoara was 
both tame in origins yet wild unplanned and headlong murderously 
repulsed yet successful fervently keen yet stained with vindictive 
passion a maelstrom producing a democracy 
the events were surprising fantastic and dreadful all at 
the same time the rev wolfgang hermann rehner a romanian 
lutheran pastor told a clergy meeting 
it was the resurrection of a trampled prostrate people an 
easterhued rising from despair 
the romanian orthodox church after its collaborationist leaders 
had resigned said in a message to the worlds christians 
after decades of slavery under the communist dictatorship and 
after immense suffering god has turned his eyes toward our 
people he has raised us from the shadow of death and set us 
free 
romanias rocky stampede to liberty began in middecember in 
timisoara where the softspoken but courageous rev laszlo tokes 
37 had been threatened his church and home raided for 
criticizing the regime he sent his pregnant wife and young son to 
live with relatives 
on dec 15 tokes was served with a courtordered eviction 
notice backed up by his subservient protestant reformed bishop to 
keep their pastor his congregation ringed the church 
by dusk of the next day the crowd had grown to 5000 by then

securitate responded with bullets and the first victims fell

the city center dec 17 most of the killing in timisoara occurred 
that day amid repeated bursts of gunfire and tear gas screams and 
falling bodies punctuated the chaos

reprisals in timisoara slayings continued dec 18 thirty 
youngsters were reportedly mowed down as they stood with candles on

ceausescu 
in a raspy voice the 71yearold dictator railed against 
foreign enemies and terrorist subversives suddenly from 
far back boos sounded like a wave boos and jeers rolled up to 
the balcony 
ceausescu froze and fear crossed his face just before he 
ordered the television cameras cut off when the army refused to 
shoot he and his despised wife elena fled first in a 
helicopter then in a red car

carlo testi remembers when the problem of 
illegal immigration came to his door right on the via de 
calzaioli one of the most fashionable streets in this renaissance 
city 
a few african immigrants spread blankets on the pedestrian mall 
putting out sunglasses and fake louis vuitton bags for sale others 
came and soon there were 400 vendors 
people couldnt pass any more testi said gazing down the 
street from his familys centuryold hat shop to the ponte vecchio 
a 14th century bridge it was a desperate situation 
these days not an african vendor is in sight city hall sent 
hundreds of police to round up illegal immigrants and vendors 
newspapers called it a witchhunt for blacks 
the police sweep which followed a bloody attack by youths on 
african immigrants raised an outcry and made florence the 
birthplace of renaissance humanism the symbol of a national debate 
on immigration and racism 
italy has given the world 26 million emigrants deputy 
premier claudio martelli said is it possible that the fifth or 
sixth industrial power loses its bearings is torn apart or reacts 
with furor and malice before the difficulties and problems raised 
by a few hundred thousand immigrants 
violence against immigrants has been a problem in central and 
northern european countries as they have absorbed citizens of 
former colonies and workers from poorer countries france 
experienced a wave of racist attacks on north africans in recent 
weeks 
florences immigrants are poor africans and latin americans 
attracted to countries in southern europe that have enjoyed 
economic booms but still lack the immigration controls imposed in 
recent years by france britain and scandinavia 
experts say italy with about 100000 illegal immigrants 
arriving each year has become the focal point of the new 
migration it has difficulty absorbing them despite a strong 
economy because of scarce housing and poor public health and 
education systems 
this ethnically homogeneous country has seen ugly racial attacks 
in recent years that many italians had thought occurred only in the 
united states or at least outside italy 
the government now hopes to stem the immigration with an 
amnesty its second in four years 
immigration in the past year has been huge and unforeseen 
said giorgio morales a socialist who was forced to resign as mayor 
of florence after the police sweep 
these new phenomena have come in a short time in florence and 
because of this there has been a reaction of intolerance he said 
estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in italy range 
from 500000 to 15 million 
ugo vittorio saibante of the governments national council of 
the economy and work said he believed the number was about 1 
million up 100 percent from 1985 and that only about half had 
work permits 
authorities say many illegal immigrants take jobs italians no 
longer want particularly in the countryside where they pick 
tomatoes help fishermen or work in small factories 
saibante however spoke of a tendency among people from less 
developed countries to go to the cities where there are many 
fewer possibilities here is where the problems of racism begin 
trouble developed in florence about a year ago as african 
vendors filled the streets around the pinkandgreen duomo 
cathedral and the 14th century city hall the palazzo vecchio 
which attract thousands of tourists daily 
police ignored the newcomers at first but strictly regulated 
souvenir and handicraft vendors were furious shopkeepers also 
complained 
to see all these people here in the center wasnt good for 
tourism testi said the image was ugly 
african vendors say they merely wanted to earn a living while 
looking for steady work and accuse the shopkeepers of racism 
we must sell to pay the hotel said a 26yearold senegalese 
who shares a cheap room with another vendor otherwise we have to 
sleep on the street 
in february about 4000 residents held a march of defenseless 
citizens against a crime wave many people attributed to 
immigrants working for italianrun drug and prostitution rings 
days later dozens of masked young avengers armed with 
baseball bats and iron bars went on a rampage during prelent 
carnival celebrations beating up african immigrants 
in midmarch spurred by citizen complaints authorities ordered 
the largescale police operation to pick up illegal immigrants and 
chase african vendors away the vendors responded with a hunger and 
sitdown strike 
the assault by youths and massive police action shocked 
italians who are proud of their tolerance and have a long emigrant 
tradition other racist attacks have taken place in major cities 
people also yelled crook swindler invader at my father in 
boston monsignor luigi di liego rome director of the charity 
organization caritas said in an interview in the newspaper la 
repubblica 
officials hope to ease tensions with a new amnesty law sponsored 
by deputy premier martelli a socialist 
it would allow foreigners who arrived before dec 31 to get work 
permits and benefits unlike an unsuccessful 1987 amnesty the new 
law imposes heavy penalties on employers who do not legalize their 
workers and establishes strict rules about who can enter the 
country 
critics predict it will not slow the flood of immigrants who 
often come by sea and do not pass through border controls 
with the amnesty italy has sent a message whoever enters 
this country not only will never be thrown out but sooner or later 
will be regularized said giorgio la malfa head of the 
republican party part of the governing coalition his party 
opposed the amnesty measure in parliament

when gen ulysses s grants troops chased 
the confederate government from richmond a slave named james 
wilder hid in a tobacco silo 
he almost suffocated in that silo recalls the slaves 
grandson virginia gov l douglas wilder recounting the story 
passed down through his father 
instead james wilder emerged to find himself suddenly a free 
man and the city which had been bombarded for months wrapped in 
flames 
grant rode on 95 miles to appomattox where gen robert e lee 
surrendered the souths main army seven days later on april 9 
1865 and wilder went on to beget the father of the nations first 
black elected governor 
though 125 years have passed since the end of the civil war it 
still is ingrained in the consciences of many southern natives 
stories about the war are reaching more people than ever through 
a growing number of battle reenactments battlefield tours books 
and specialty magazines and through the celebrated movie 
glory about the unions first black regiment 
there are so many events being reenacted that we cant keep 
track of them said david roth editor of blue and gray a 
magazine with the motto for those who still hear the guns 
the regional and racial divisions exacerbated by the war of 
northern aggression the term still used by some southerners are 
beginning to close and the symbols of the old south are becoming 
more anachronistic 
trucks with confederate flags on the rear windows and bumper 
stickers reading forget hell and the south will rise 
again are becoming endangered species but the ironies of the 
south in transition still pervade richmond the capital of the 
confederacy 
residents celebrate the birthdays of lee gen stonewall jackson 
and martin luther king jr on the same day 
mary sue terry the states first female attorney general is 
fighting a us justice department lawsuit seeking to force 
virginia military institute to admit women vmi cadets fought to 
secede from the federal government and many of the southern 
generals were graduates 
one of only two buildings in richmonds commercial district that 
survived grants 10month siege is a granite structure that housed 
offices of the confederate government occupying the building now 
is the federal court the institution that helped rid the south of 
segregation 
across the martin luther king bridge and a block to the left are 
the museum of the confederacy and the confederate white house now 
surrounded by highrise university buildings 
the museums signin sheet is replete with the names of visitors 
from cities to the north as well as canada and europe 
attendance never has been better spokeswoman barbara hyde said 
there always has been a high interest in the civil war but in 
the past four years it has increased tremendously she said 
on richmonds monument avenue two black women and a white man 
who attend a karate class nearby practice their moves at the base 
of a towering statue of lee on horseback 
in between kick punches carrie britton relates how she cried 
when she saw the movie glory and only then learned there were 
black soldiers who died fighting for the union there was a white 
woman who made a point of holding the door for me when i was 
leaving the theater ms britton said she was touched too 
the provocation for the civil war was at first largely the 
laborintensive souths objection to tariffs favored by the 
industrialized north although the issue of slavery bitterly 
divided the regions only later did the focus shift to the 
constitutional issues of secession and the abolition of slavery 
those issues led to the poignant human drama of brother fighting 
brother father fighting son and friend fighting friend 
particularly in border states 
the cost of the war was tremendous more than 600000 union and 
confederate soldiers died over the fouryear period nearly 
equaling the number of americans killed in all other wars combined 
because of the high number of casualties almost everyone who 
had forebears in america in 1861 can associate with the war said 
ed bearss chief historian of the national park service 
charles bryan director of the virginia historical society said 
he and other civil war scholars on the lecture circuit are being 
asked to explain why people continue to be fascinated by the 
struggle 125 years later 
to answer he pulls a coneshaped rifle bullet from his pocket 
a minie ball recovered at a battlefield outside richmond thats now 
a residential development 
a young boy brought it to the historical society bryan 
said one of the reasons the war is so fascinating is that it 
happened in our own backyard both literally and figuratively 
the war destroyed the economic and social system of the south 
the 12 years of reconstruction that followed a period in which the 
11 secessionist states were regarded as conquered territories 
solidified the regions antagonism toward the north 
i dont think there would have been a solid south had there 
not been what southerners saw as a harsh reconstruction bearss 
said 
the feelings were so visceral that it went past just 
disagreement on political ideologues wilder said rather it 
was almost a lifestyle to be different the only thing that can 
change that is the passage of time 
an increasingly mobile society and the commonality of mass 
communications also are softening the divisions bryan said 
little by little the separate identities of the north and 
south are beginning to change he said 
bryan said the lingering prejudices became apparent to him when 
the topic of a speech he gave on the commemoration of lees 
birthday the 18 native virginians who served as generals in the 
union army was publicized in advance 
i got angry phone calls from people who said how dare you 
talk about yankee generals on general lees birthday he said 
the civil war still lives in the minds of many people it will 
never be forgotten

welcome to historic appomattox where 
our nation reunited 
other than the wooden sign at the side of the highway harry 
lillies civil war souvenir and relic shop adjoining the leegrant 
motel is the only reminder of what happened two miles outside town 
on april 9 1865 
in the victorian parlor of a private home with the 
confederacys main army surrounded and starving gen robert e lee 
surrendered to gen ulysses s grant ending for all intents and 
purposes the war between the states 
on the muddy main road of the tiny village of appomattox court 
house three days later exactly four years after the war started at 
fort sumter sc confederate gen john gordon marched his 28231 
ragged emaciated troops one last time 
as union troops from the 100000strong army of the potomac 
lined the muddy road the rebels stacked their guns hung their 
ammunition pouches on the sights furled their confederate battle 
flags and began the long trek home 
in a reenactment commemorating the 125th anniversary sunday 
the solemn sound of soldiers marching again will be broken by the 
crisp order stack arms but the skirmishes will be 
reenacted 150 miles away in fredericksburg 
neither local residents nor the national park service which 
operates the appomattox court house national historical park 
wanted to restage the battles 
lillie a wellmeaning carpetbagger from new jersey is 
perplexed by what he considers residents apathy about the role 
their county played in american history 
appomattox was big enough to handle the actual battles and 
surrender but is not big enough to handle the reenacted battles 
that ought to tell you something he said 
about 110000 people visit appomattox court house annually but 
few tarry because appomattox has only two small hotels and few 
places to eat said jon montgomery the park superintendent 
in 1865 there were 8900 residents now there are about 12800 
a publicity pamphlet issued by the chamber of commerce describes 
appomattox as an oldfashioned town where progress is slow and 
measured 
but a chain hotel now is under construction across the street 
from lillies and a shopping center historic junction recently 
was completed fastfood restaurants beckon on the main highway 
and there are plans to lure more people into the main part of town 
with its freshly painted centuryold wooden homes and stores 
montgomery and mayor ronnie spiggle said it takes a sense of 
history to understand the reluctance over the years to 
commercialize the park and the decision this year to ignore the 
battles that took place 125 years ago 
spiggle agrees with the shrinelike treatment of the park which 
continues to be surrounded by miles of undeveloped pastures and 
looks nearly identical to what the soldiers saw in 1865 
we dont want to emphasize the battles they were 
insignificant compared to other battles of the war montgomery 
said the story here is the peace that came here 
after the war southern opposition to a park at appomattox kept 
the federal government from establishing one for 75 years a new 
highway skirted the deteriorating village buildings disintegrated 
and burned some were torn down 
in 1940 the national park service acquired the land for the 
park and the main buildings of the village eventually were 
restored or reconstructed in time for the 100th anniversary of the 
surrender 
the 10 historic structures most red brick surround by 
splitrail or white picket fences include the mclean house where 
the terms of surrender were signed the courthouse a tavern a 
jail a general store a tiny law office and several residences 
the southerners wanted to forget what happened here 
montgomery said it marked the end of their hopes of having a 
separate country

graham marshall in his middle years appears to have an enviable 
life important post at a manhattan ad agency wife and home in the 
suburbs 
but on closer examination we see that his job is threatened by a 
younger ruthless executive his wife is a nagging shrew and he is 
drowning in debt 
then one day in the subway a tragedy makes graham realize that 
crimes can go undetected he cooly plans complicated schemes to rid 
himself of his enemies his plot is triggered when he loses a 
muchneeded promotion to the young conniver causing his wifes 
comment i forgive you for your failure 
a shock to the system a wordplay on grahams mode of 
execution might have been minorleague hitchcock but the movie 
bears watching if only to observe a master performer at work 
michael caine is graham marshall and it is a pleasure to see a 
real pro make more of a script than what is on the pages caines 
bland face reflects all the maddening frustrations that drive him 
toward his devilish deeds when he rages against the yuppie who 
usurped his job caine is olympian in his wrath when he cooly 
executes his remotecontrol murders he is as menacing as freddy 
kreuger 
a shock to the system marks a promising entry into feature 
films for jan egleson who has directed prestige films for public 
television he skillfully plays the murderous events against the 
normality of new york high rises and peaceful suburbia 
andrew klavan wrote the script adapting simon bretts novel 
the plot is cleverly devised but its hard to believe that caines 
acts would not attract more police suspicion his only pursuer is a 
suburban detective will patton who seems slow to round up a case 
the film is well cast elizabeth mcgovern is convincingly 
vulnerable as the coworker who becomes caines lover and potential 
victim peter riegert the pickle salesman in crossing delancy 
is ideal as the upwardly mobile ad man john mcmartin has strong 
moments as the executive whose life burns out when he is forced 
into early retirement swoosie kurtz offers a convincing argument

with spring comes baseball and what better way to celebrate 
americas favorite sport than by taking home a few videos 
hollywood once considered baseball movies boxoffice poison 
because movie moguls thought women who constitute a large part of 
filmgoers wouldnt want to see them and foreign audiences simply 
didnt understand the mechanics 
before the late 1980s studio heads may have had a point some 
of the alltime baseball classics though warmly embraced by fans 
did lousy box office such movies as 1942s the pride of the 
yankees starring gary cooper as lou gehrig were big 
disappointments 
however the natural robert redfords allegorical movie in 
1984 about a gifted player and bull durham 1988 an amusing 
and lusty tale of the minor leagues starring kevin costner and 
susan sarandon helped turn things around 
the biggest grossing baseball movie of all time is last years 
field of dreams which had taken in 533 million by august 
bull durham was second with 503 million and the comedy 
smash major league 1989 ran third with 485 million all 
three are on video 
there are other baseball movies hardcore fans might want to 
watch that will even be enjoyed by those whove never downed a hot 
dog at the park

pete thomas and shares the attractions mastery of several 
different styles 
harding doesnt hesitate to take them in all sorts of 
directions affairs of the heart with its accordion and pedal 
steel guitar sounds like french country music 
some of here comes the groom is like get happy with a 
brass section some is clearly folkinfluenced on the devil in 
me about the darker side of human nature its both in the same 
song 
like costello harding has the gift of gab words often pour out 
faster than most human ears can pick up theres little of 
costellos bitterness however as this couplet suggests if 
theres a nuclear winter at least it will snow 
the cassette has 15 songs and many of them are crackling good 
there are slower moments such as the uninspired folkie duet with 
peter case things snowball and other cuts buried on side 2 
but harding has an unexpectedly high batting average on this 
audacious debut

pale columbia toad the wet sprocket 
 
toad the wet sprockets new album pale exemplifies 
everything thats wrong about the wheezing alternative rock scene 
far from the cutting edge the underground scene has too many 
imitators instead of innovators the reigning gods are still 
rem which methodically built a successful career with 
originality and relentless work 
since the early 1980s rem has had more impersonators than 
elvis presley toad the wet sprocket is only the latest to emulate 
the form rather than the substance of rem 
pale is loaded with moody slightly incongruous lyrics the 
guitar rock mixes the jangle and the drone the covers a grainy 
picture of something indistinguishable and the band photo is blurry 
sound familiar 
admittedly the failure of an entire genre is a tough burden to 
place on the shoulders of an unassuming california rock band 
theyre somewhat adept interpreters the sound is more muscular 
than murmur era rem though the songs of course lack 
distinctiveness 
but it would be far better to see bands try to make their mark 
with their own visions rather than someone elses

on her emergence as a film director sondra 
locke makes an observation about gender 
women have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously she 
said from my experience what i had to fight against was my 
association with clint eastwood because it automatically 
disqualified me in some ways as being a separate entity or having 
had to fight on my own i was doing things before i met clint 
you have to fight harder people dont stop and think how long 
you have been around or what you may be on your own there is a 
wall but if you just know who you are and keep plugging along 
sooner or later the little crack in the wall gets bigger pretty 
soon you can put your foot through then you are able to emerge as 
yourself 
with her second film as a director impulse sondra locke 
does emerge as a filmmaker who can be taken seriously unlike her 
first effort the largely unseen ratboy impulse has the 
elements for popular appeal its a cop movie with theresa russell 
as an undercover vice officer who can be as tough as dirty harry 
the comparison to clint eastwood movies is unavoidable but miss 
lockes long professional and personal association with eastwood 
having reached a bitter ending she is making strides in 
establishing her own life and career 
breaking up was hard to do for both parties over 13 years she 
had appeared in six eastwood films from the outlaw josey wales 
to the gauntlet and they were close companions despite her 
marriage to another man they parted amid acrimony in december 
1988 and last april she filed a palimony suit alleging cruel 
treatment by eastwood it is still pending 
locke established her own fame in her first movie the heart 
is a lonely hunter winning a 1968 academy award nomination as 
supporting actress when she was only 17 
her discovery by hollywood is so clicheladen that its hard 
to believe 
its like a movie bigger than life she admitted but 
its actually true i was this girl in shelby tennessee i wanted 
to be an actress but was just out of school and didnt know how to 
go about it 
suddenly warner bros is having this talent search and the 
casting director marion dougherty is going from city to city the 
nearest city was birmingham ala i read about it in the paper i 
auditioned the next thing i knew i was in new york then i was in 
selma ala shooting with alan arkin 
the next thing i knew i was in hollywood and then i was 
nominated for an academy award it was an amazing experience 
enough to confuse the brain 
more films followed run shadow run willard then the 
association with eastwood during those years she remained in the 
shadow of a superstar subordinating her own ambitions how does 
that reconcile with her strong feelings about a womans role in 
society 
ive thought about that a great deal she said we go 
through certain phases in our lives we grow and change and get 
different perspectives for a time i thought that the only thing 
that can be counted on is your work you know exactly what you can 
do and you have control over it to some degree 
thats not right either a relationship is very important 
sometimes that is how we find out about ourselves from the breakup 
of a relationship we find out even more hopefully we can turn 
that into creativity if we try hard 
for a period in my life a relationship was the most important 
thing everything else was just very very secondary theres 
no doubt that professionally i did go into a tunnel then it can be 
exhilarating and challenging and exciting to try to come out of 
it 
at 42 sondra locke has the same willowy blond beauty that she 
displayed as the 14yearold mike kelly in the heart is a lonely 
hunter dont be fooled by her seeming fragility on a movie set 
she can be commanding and decisive for impulse she prowled the 
mean streets of los angeles with a homicide squad to soak up how 
the police operate 
and she scorns any suggestion that women cannot direct action 
the thing that posed the challenge in my mind was not the 
action per se she said when i think about action i only 
think about what happens i see it in my head as a movie i dont 
stop and say ooo this is action if you tell the story of 
whats happening it kind of takes care of itself 
are the wounds of the eastwood affair beginning to heal 
i think ive learned a lot she said hesitantly im proud 
of that i had to be a lot stronger than i ever knew that i could 
be i had to learn to stand up for myself and decide who i am what 
i need and whats right if you look on that as a positive instead 
of a negative then i would say that yes i am healing

nustrah fateh ali khan rocks back 
and forth as he sings in a machine gunlike style the low beat of 
tabla drums provides an eerie backbeat to the staccato rhythms of 
his voice 
six handclappers provide more cadence and two harmoniums flesh 
out the tune as khan stretches his arms to the heavens to receive 
allahs direct message 
the allmale crowd assembled in this village near lahore in 
eastern pakistan rocks to the beat several bearded men wearing 
intricatelycrocheted skull caps sway to the front one collapses 
on the earthen floor twitching in a religious trance 
listeners throw rupee notes on the singer and his band by the 
time the night is through khan has collected 40000 rupees 
2000 
he is one of pakistans great singers he practices an art 
called qawalli part of pakistans rich tradition of classical 
music 
today khans art form is going through a revival of sorts a 
byproduct of the increasing availability of cassette tapes and the 
failure of fundamentalist religious thinkers to impose their strict 
ideas on the masses 
khan and his band came to alama iqbal to commemorate the death 
of the towns largest landlord who died four years ago 
following islamic tradition peasants and workers from a nearby 
scrap metal plant have been invited to the show a huge tent houses 
the guests about 2000 in all 
women are not present strict moslem tradition bans them from 
casual contact with male strangers still several little girls in 
brightly colored shalwar kameez the traditional baggy pants and 
kneelength tunic flit through the crowd clutching their fathers 
hands 
khan comes from a family that has been singing for more than 600 
years from ghazni now part of afghanistan his family went to 
india during the time of the great mogul empire that dominated the 
subcontinent for centuries 
soon khans relatives were singing for the mogul court moslem 
rulers used khans forefathers to spread islam through india 
combining islams tradition of religious poetry with the wild music 
of india 
khans family came to pakistan in 1947 following the partition 
of the subcontinent into a moslem country pakistan and a largely 
hindu nation india 
at that time his father and uncle were the leaders of a famed 
qawalli band and played in mosques and villages throughout punjab 
province 
in the beginning they wanted me to become a doctor because 
classical singing is too hard khan said in an interview at a 
small hotel in the heart of lahore 
but the young boy persevered listening to his father teach 
other pupils from behind a curtain in the familys house 
one day he caught me first he scolded me but then he 
encouraged me he said 
khans training was cut short by his fathers death in 1964 when 
he was 16 a heavy mantle passed to his shoulders 
i remember his first concert said khalid asghar a senior 
music producer at pakistan broadcasting corp he was a little 
roundfaced chap he sang with vigor 
as he grew older khan became enormously fat he now weighes 350 
pounds 
khan is not blessed with a beautiful or melodic voice but it 
has a haunting power and his rhythm a key element of qawalli 
singing is impeccable 
his voice is like an ugly woman who becomes a great actress 
said asghar tghere is so much art in him that you forget about 
the ugliness 
when he sings khan says he forgets who and where he is 
it is a direct message he says pointing to the sky 
in the past few years khan has achieved some international 
stature rock artist peter gabriel released a khan record on his 
realworld label last year he has sung in paris london and at the 
brooklyn academy of music in new york 
over the past few years his music has become increasingly 
popular in pakistan partly a result of its good beat and the 
ambiguity of his lyrics 
your eyes have made me drunk goes one song your 
willingness and your love make me a drunken man 
some would interpret the couplet as a celebration of allah the 
moslem god others imbue it with more earthly charms

when john hanson mitchells marriage 
ended in 1986 he abandoned the modern world and moved alone to a 
cabin in the woods to live like his mentor henry david thoreau 
but during his year without electricity and running water 
mitchell discovered what he calls a timeless truth that may be more 
suited to this generation 
in an upcoming book based on his experiment in the woods 
mitchell decries the materialism of modern times and advocates a 
return to the simpler values of thoreaus mid19th century 
the essence of civilization is not the multiplication of 
wants but the elimination of needs says mitchell 49 standing 
on his land just 16 miles from walden pond 
that sentiment may sound a bit ponderous and pretentious but 
mitchell is not he is the first to tell you that his year in the 
woods titled living at the end of time involved more than 
just giving up a cd player and the cuisinart 
though he continued work as editor of a small magazine mitchell 
returned home to his cabin every night it was there that he gained 
a peace and contentment he says comes from living close to the 
land he calls it a satisfying feeling a comfort that he 
believes is difficult to achieve in the fasttrack world 
but the hardest part came before mitchell even moved into his 
cabin when his wife decided they should separate at the time 
the couple lived in a house on the edge of dense woods in this 
rural suburb 35 miles west of boston 
mitchell moved to a nearby apartment but found he missed his 
land his attachment to the land a squaremile of nearly 
undeveloped woods of which mitchell owns four acres is more than 
sentimental several years ago he chronicled the 15000year 
history of the land called scratch flat in a book 
there does seem to be some sort of draw here some sort of 
historical presence he says this place seems more alive than 
others 
mitchell says he and his wife separated amicably his son and 
daughter often stayed with him in his cabin i look at these 
things as more tribal he says of the split marriages dont 
break up people just move into different huts 
mitchell also had a practical reason for building his oneroom 
gingerbreadstyle cabin he needed some affordable housing 
the gothicstyle cottage was built by mitchell using thoreaus 
shack and the designs of mid19th century architect andrew jackson 
downing for inspiration it was constructed on a ridge hidden 
behind thick woods about 400 yards from his former house and the 
road in the winter mitchell had to ski through the woods to get 
to his house 
in the warm months mitchell often spent hours sitting outside 
his cottage contemplating the surrounding meadows and trees he 
took long walks in the woods and met an assortment of characters a 
family of eastern european refugees who lived on a small farm a 
mysterious man who dressed partly in animal skins and said he lived 
in a cave 
in the winter he stoked his small camp stove for warmth and 
huddled under heavy blankets he reread the classics and read the 
journals kept by thoreau as well as his own father 
most important he said was his feeling of oneness with nature 
a feeling that all the windows and walls separating me had been 
removed 
sometimes i would even go for night walks picking my way 
along the trail by watching the sky the stars had never seemed so 
bright mitchell writes i became acutely conscious of the 
changing position of what quarter the moon was in some nights 
when i was alone in the cottage i wouldnt bother to light the 
lamps i would simply sit there in the dark watching moonlight 
spill in through the windows listening to the sounds around 
me 
mitchells spartan life in the woods was made ironic by the 
construction of a huge digital equipment corp plant nearby 
mitchell grew obsessed with the encroachment of the plant and the 
loyal penitents the programmers and the engineers who worked 
there after weeks of attempts he finally befriended an employee 
who took him on a tour of the plant 
mitchell has since moved to a new house he had built just a few 
yards from the cottage this one has electricity and modern 
comforts but mitchell says he has retained what he learned in his 
one room 
the lesson is you dont have to live in a cottage in the 
woods to strip yourself of a lot of material possessions he 
says there are deeper satisfactions

in linda ronstadts 23year career she has 
changed from a lovesick pop covergirl into a soulful country 
crooner a 1940sstyle torch singer and a caballerooutfitted 
mexican folksinger 
now shes reentered the pop scene and stolen hearts with the 
album cry like a rainstorm howl like the wind the first 
single from the album a duet with aaron neville called i dont 
know much won a grammy award this year for best pop vocal by a 
duo or group 
despite her chameleonlike seemingly whimsical career moves 
theres a method to ronstadts madness she just has to sing no 
matter what the style 
i feel pressure to make order out of chaos and i do this with 
music i mean it that is what i need to do i think that is why 
people make art she said 
if i didnt make a living trying to make order out of chaos 
with my music i would get a job selling hot dogs or whatever else 
i could find that would do it 
ronstadt said the songs on cry like a rainstorm have been 
her friends for years and the time was right to record them 
the same could be said for all the songs shes recorded 
it becomes kind of your best friend and you think about it and 
talk to it every day and then you have to record it she said 
its just those songs became ripe in their way and they became 
current and i needed to sing them 
sitting in the office of her longtime manager and friend peter 
asher ronstadt does not look like a veteran star her face remains 
unlined and she wears playful cowboy boots adorned with 
multicolored designs 
in the two decades shes been in the business shes learned that 
the songs are the important thing not what people think the 
singing that i do with my hands in the dishwater is just as 
meaningful to me and maybe a little bit more than the singing i 
do in front of 40000 people 
her new lp gave ronstadt the opportunity to work with neville 
who is one of her idols 
neville an angelicsounding singer who had a top10 song in 
1967 with tell it like it is is a part of the neville 
brothers a critically acclaimed band known for a contemporary new 
orleans sound 
ronstadt first met neville when she went to the worlds fair in 
new orleans several years ago to perform with nelson riddle the 
members of the orchestra all wanted to see the neville brothers so 
they ventured out to find them 
we found them playing at this club and aaron found out somehow 
i was there and dedicated a song to me ronstadt said i was 
certain i was the only female on the planet and i was sure i was 
the only person in the room listening to him sing just me and him 
it was one of those moments those transcendental moments 
later in the evening ronstadt and neville sang a duet and 
their voices clicked 
i thought well maybe this is really happening she said 
then i thought maybe every singer in the world would just like to 
think their voice sounded good with aarons because aaron sounds 
so good 
for years the two tried to find a project together but the 
opportunity didnt arise until cry like a rainstorm 
ronstadt envisioned the songs on the album as stacked orchestral 
arrangements recorded in a huge naturalsounding studio 
unfortunately she discovered there arent many of those around 
still she refused to give up 
i just kept thinking big i needed a big room because i wanted 
big sound and a big orchestra and a big choir and i wanted big 
voices and i wanted big guitars and big drums 
ronstadt got her wish she recorded the album at skywalker 
ranch a compound in californias marin county owned by filmmaker 
george lucas she also got a 100piece orchestra an authentic 
gospel choir and the haunting voices of neville and former beach 
boy brian wilson 
the cry like a rainstorm album is a definite departure from 
her past work but ronstadt admits shes never been content to sit 
still with her career 
in 1967 ronstadt first surfaced with the group the stone 
ponies a sort of countrypopfolk group that landed their sole hit 
with different drum the stone ponies were the forerunners of 
the laidback southern california sound captured by the eagles 
jackson brown and fleetwood mac 
ronstadt went solo soon thereafter and scored hits with songs 
such as heatwave youre no good and when will i be 
loved she was so well known she sang at the 1977 inauguration of 
president jimmy carter 
then in the early 1980s ronstadt departed from her pop roots and 
took on a role in the musical the pirates of penzance 
though it wasnt much of a leap of faith for fans to accept her 
part in the musical ronstadt then took her craft another step 
beyond and became a 40sstyle torch singer and recorded with the 
nelson riddle orchestra 
the songs the orchestra and the promstyle 40s dresses were 
unexpected but not rejected the album gave her maturing voice a 
new forum and gained new respect from critics who dismissed her in 
the 70s as just another pretty face 
from there she moved into country music with the trio album 
teaming her with emmylou harris and dolly parton and featuring 
17thcentury appalachian folk songs 
she went her own way again and moved into traditional mexican 
folk music with the album canciones de mi padre ronstadt who 
is half german and half mexican said the songs she sang in spanish 
made her feel grounded 
now theres work with neville 
when dolly emmy and i sang together there was that buzz wed 
all sang with other people before but when we sang together the 
three of us we liked it and we felt this is special we have 
to do this i felt the same way about aaron 
ronstadt says shes not an innovator or trendsetter shes a 
singer and thats all she ever wanted to be 
when i was in first grade i flunked arithmetic since then i 
have developed a great awe and appreciation for mathematics but in 
first grade it wasnt happening and i remember looking at my report 
card and thinking it doesnt matter im going to be a singer

clint black has one regret about being 
the hottest emerging country music star of 1990 
i dont get to fish much anymore the 28yearold singer 
says 
theres little time to head for a lake and cast for a big one 
for the past year hes been crisscrossing the country on a 
whirlwind schedule as the most promising country performer since 
randy travis blossomed in 1986 
his debut album killin time sold 1 million copies in nine 
months three cuts from the lp all were no 1 on the country music 
popularity charts a better man killin time and 
nobodys home 
im spoiled rotten he jokes about his quick success 
how is he handling it 
with a bullwhip 
its not just blacks voice that has caught the fancy of country 
fans its also his looks he has a friendly face accented by 
dimples and a mischievous grin and with his omnipresent black 
cowboy hat many people believe he looks like a young roy rogers 
he has the familiar background of a dirttodiamonds country 
singer he was born in long branch nj where his father had a 
temporary job working on a pipe line he grew up in houston where 
he was a frequent sight on the streets riding a skateboard while 
playing a harmonica he first performed for guests at his parents 
backyard barbecues 
he dropped out of high school in houston and toiled as an 
ironworker and fishing guide he sang in nightclubs after sending 
out fliers to advertise his performances he finally drew the 
attention of rca records which signed him to a recording contract 
but he hasnt forgotten his hardscrabble days 
i think about it all the time he said theres always 
something that takes me back to that i used to sing five hours a 
night sometimes seven iron working was hard and dangerous enough 
to run me off but it all shaped my life 
his album which has been no 1 on the country charts is mostly 
wellcrafted country weepers about lost love with a background of 
beers and barrooms the music much of which he wrote himself is 
rooted in the western swing and honkytonk style of texas 
the cut killin time deals with drinking to forget a broken 
romance a better man is about recovering from the pain of 
losing a lover nobodys home is about the emotional letdown 
after failing at love 
the first thing a country music listener latches onto is 
whether the words mean anything to them black says you need 
to be able to say something anybody can relate to 
nobodys home was written after a sevenyear splitup i had 
regrets we got back together and split up again this inspired a 
better man other than that the songs are just somebody elses 
story we took their perspective 
his music and tireless work have paid off rapidly in october 
he won the horizon award from the country music association for 
achievement by a rising performer in january he won an american 
music award for favorite new country artist 
hes performed at carnegie hall in new york city and he was 
especially thrilled to sing for a crowd of 56000 in houston in 
february it was etched in my mind for a long time since it was a 
hometown show and everything he said 
his future schedule is packed hell tape a bob hope tv special 
in acapulco mexico hell be on the road an average of four nights 
a week doing concerts with the superstar group alabama hes 
working on a second album due out this fall 
its satisfying to make it through a crazy week he said 
the only frustration i have is if i cant perform because my 
vocal chords are worn out from too much use 
ive been careful to shape my attitude i travel with my band 
and we hold nothing back if anyone gets out of line we answer to 
each other we pay attention to what we do and how we act 
i dont want to be a temperamental artist the band lets me 
know if im being unreasonable about something i want to make sure 
people are proud to be with me 10 years down the road 
i really have believed in my songs i feel i know when they 
are good or just ok its pretty scary to think that theres got to 
come a time when a song wont be number one its inevitable

shearson lehman hutton holdings inc hopes a 
record wall street loss of around 900 million for the first 
quarter will put the bad days of overexpansion firmly behind it 
the nations second largest securities firm said the stunning 
loss would include 787 million in onetime charges including 
writeoffs of its real estate and junk bond holdings as well as 
provisions for the costs of shutting down scores of offices and 
dismissing 2000 employees 
the red ink also will include a loss of 110 million to 130 
million on operations the company announced late monday 
the steps that shearson lehman hutton is announcing today 
signal the start of a new era for the firm said james d 
robinson iii chairman and chief executive of shearsons parent 
american express co 
much of wall street is struggling to cut costs because of a 
slowdown in trading since the 1987 stock market crash and a big 
decline in securities underwriting and merger activity 
but shearson expanded more rapidly than any firm during the 
gogo 1980s making its current retrenchment more painful and more 
costly than any other firms 
merrill lynch amp co the nations biggest investment firm 
posted the industrys biggest quarterly loss to date only three 
months ago a fourthquarter 1989 loss of 362 million after 
charges for major cutbacks 
shearsons staggering charge was bigger than the 450 million to 
700 million many analysts forecast last month after shearson 
announced plans to close offices cut jobs and write down its real 
estate and junk bond portfolios 
shearson said restructuring charges would amount to about 630 
million that includes 200 million for estimated losses at its 
commercial real estate subsidiary the balcor co 230 million for 
office consolidation and closings worldwide 115 million to cover 
losses on the planned sale of 480 million in junk bonds and 45 
million in employee severance costs 
the securities firm said it would close 67 domestic branch 
offices up from a previously announced target of 50 
in addition shearson said it would take a 157 million charge 
for an accounting change relating to software development expenses 
the change would bring the way shearson accounts for such expenses 
into line with how american express does it 
the total charge would exceed the industry record of 470 
million taken by merrill lynch in the 1989 fourth quarter shearson 
said its actions would reduce annual costs by well in excess of 
400 million 
they seem to be clearing the deck and then will go forward 
from here said perrin long who follows the securities industry 
for lipper analytical services corp 
the charges and cutbacks will help shearson focus on its four 
core businesses of individual investor services investment 
banking capital markets and asset management said howard l clark 
jr a former american express executive who was installed as 
shearsons chairman earlier this year 
shearson cited a marked slowdown in business activity in january 
and february for its expected firstquarter operating loss of 110 
million to 130 million 
overall the firm said it expects to post a loss of 897 million 
to 917 million for the quarter shearson lost 15 million in the 
1989 first quarter 
after shearsons announcement moodys investors service inc 
said it had confirmed its senior debt ratings on about 48 billion 
in shearson debt 
both the special provisions as well as the operating loss were 
consistent with expectations in view of shearsons problem asset 
exposures and depressed conditions in the wholesale and retail 
securities markets moodys said 
it also cited shearsons close relationship with american 
express 
after an initial recapitalization plan to breathe life into 
shearson fell through early this year american express abandoned 
plans to reduce its stake in shearson and decided to take full 
control of its securities unit to avoid a credit downgrading 
last week american express said a previously announced 750 
million capital infusion had been made available to shearson 
american express will have pumped about 135 billion into shearson 
in recent months once the recapitalization plan is completed 
the company also installed clark as shearsons chairman and 
embarked on the costcutting program shearson has excess capacity 
because of its 1988 acquisition of ef hutton amp co and diminished 
stock trading 
shearson with about 33500 employees is the second largest 
wall street firm behind merrill lynch

after defaulting on a bank loan and saying it 
couldnt pay interest on its junk bonds analysts say farley inc 
may be forced to sell more assets if it ever hopes to complete its 
buyout of west pointpepperell inc 
this makes it more difficult said edward johnson of johnson 
redbook service inc a new york research firm 
the rumors are that he might sell off fruit of the loom to get 
his interest out of it johnson said referring to william 
farley chairman of the closely held chicagobased manufacturing 
conglomerate 
a farley division that was created to acquire pepperell said 
monday it had defaulted on a 796 million bank loan and would be 
unable to pay interest owed to holders of 705 million in junk 
bonds 
the announcement increased doubts about farleys ability to 
complete his 3 billion acquisition of the big georgia textile 
maker 
farley officials did not return telephone calls seeking details 
on the moves outlined in the companys threeparagraph statement 
the statement said the farley unit west point acquisition 
corp had offered to give stock to junk bond holders in exchange 
for a delay in making interest payments 
west point acquisition also said it had been negotiating with 
its lenders a consortium of banks led by wells fargo amp co and 
bankers trust co apparently in hopes of restructuring the 796 
million loan they made last year so the farley unit could buy 
pepperell stock 
unless the loan is restructured analysts said farley could be 
forced into bankruptcy proceedings or be obliged to sell assets 
possibly including fruit of the loom inc the countrys biggest 
underwear manufacturer 
west point acquisition said the defaults would not affect west 
pointpepperell which continues to trade as a public company on 
the new york stock exchange even though the farley unit owns about 
95 percent of its stock 
farley who paid 156 billion for its pepperell stock and 
assumed 1 billion of the companys debt still needs about 85 
million to complete his 58ashare acquisition of pepperells 
stock until the deal is concluded he cannot use pepperells cash 
to pay interest on the buyout debt 
pepperells stock fell 125 to 37 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange fruit of the loom traded on the american 
stock exchange fell 25 cents to 1287 
about two weeks ago farley announced a renegotiated 12 
billion loan that gave his manufacturing conglomerate more time to 
complete the pepperell buyout and eliminated the danger of a 
crossdefault by pepperell in case of a default by west point 
acquisition 
two days later farley announced the sale of most of its cluett 
peabody amp co division to the french clothing maker bidermann sa 
for 350 million and a 60 million note however the price was 
about 200 million less than farley had sought 
farley has been stymied by the downturn in the takeover business 
that followed the collapse of the junk bond market last fall 
banks have been extremely cautious about backing acquisitions 
since the failure of campeau corps 67 billion buyout of 
federated department stores inc a deal heavily dependent on junk 
bonds federated and allied stores corp another us retailer 
bought by campeau filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
in january 
farley used junk bonds extensively during the 1980s to finance 
the growth of his holdings which also include the acme boot co

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission criticized proposed changes in state takeover laws like 
those being considered in pennsylvania saying they seek to tilt 
the balance against shareholders 
significant efforts are underway at the state level to shield 
management from shareholder oversight richard c breeden told 
the council of institutional investors a group of pension fund 
managers on monday 
pennsylvania indiana and other states recently have sought to 
tilt the balance of corporate power in favor of corporate 
management and against shareholders by insulating decisions by 
boards of directors from effective review either by the judiciary 
or shareholders he added 
although most proposed legislation is not in its final form 
the us supreme court has indicated clearly that states do have 
the ability to legislate in takeover areas said randall 
schumann a spokesman for the north american securities 
administrators association a nationwide organization of state 
level securities regulators 
supporters of the pending pennsylvania legislation have hailed 
it as the nations toughest antitakeover sanction but critics 
warn it could discourage longterm investment because corporate 
officers would be less accountable for their actions 
breeden said federal regulators were concerned about state 
legislation that would insulate managers and boards from 
shareholders and thus possibly cause institutional investors to 
shift muchneeded capital from securities like stocks to those 
based on debt like junk bonds 
that would make it tougher for us businesses to raise large 
sums of money for longrange goals like plant expansion research 
and development 
who wants to be a longterm captive investor breeden asked 
rhetorically 
the legislation passed by the pennsylvania senate and awaiting 
action in the house would make it more difficult for corporate 
raiders to take over a pennsylvania company or extract 
greenmail abovemarket prices paid by management to buy back 
the companys stock from wouldbe raiders 
the bill also would give corporate boards far more discretion 
than they have now to consider interests other than those of the 
shareholders in making decisions about takeover bids 
breeden said shareholder input in running a company is 
guaranteed under federal law and while we respect states 
rights in matters of corporate governance we will not hesitate 
to seek to enforce federal interests 
breed also said the sec was reviewing the shareholder voting and 
proxy process especially changes recommended by the california 
public employees retirement system and a shareholders rights 
group the united shareholders association a proxy is a 
shareholders absentee ballot for a companys annual meeting

the fourth quarter and a 776 million loss for 1989 
the insurance holding company whose subsidiaries include 
executive life insurance co of los angeles announced in january 
that it anticipated an after tax charge of 515 million to 1989 
earnings due to junk bond losses it said monday the losses were so 
bad it had added another 344 million to the charge 
the huge writeoffs caused revenue to plunge 44 percent for the 
year and left thirdquarter revenue more than a halfbillion 
dollars in the red 
los angelesbased first executive became the second southern 
california institution in as many days to be buried beneath an 
avalanche of losses from junk bonds which pay high rates because 
they fund risky ventures 
on sunday columbia savings amp loan association reported losses 
of 575 million in a fivemonth period due to junk bonds the 
losses rendered columbia insolvent and in danger of seizure by 
federal regulators 
both first executive and columbia were closely allied with 
michael milken the financier who pioneered the use of junk bonds 
in the 1980s while working for the drexel burnham lambert inc 
brokerage 
first executive invested about 65 billion in junk bonds it 
said that as of dec 31 when its fourth quarter and fiscal year 
ended the value of that portfolio had declined about 14 billion 
below face value 
for the fourth quarter first executives 836 million loss the 
equivalent of 998 a share compared to a profit of 48 million 
or 42 cents a share in 1988 revenue plunged far into red ink 
from 552 million in 1988 to a negative 541 million in 1989 
for the year first executives 776 million loss was the 
equivalent of 967 a share and came on revenue of 119 billion 
that compared with a profit of 175 million 151 per share on

7eleven owner southland corp lost 1 billion in 
the fourth quarter of 1989 after a huge takeoverrelated writeoff 
and the company said earnings this year wouldnt meet targets set 
in its bank financing agreements 
the convenience store company said monday it would have to 
restructure its debt or file for bankruptcy protection 
dallasbased southland said a 947 million writeoff wiped its 
books clean of goodwill or the difference between what the 
convenience store company was worth and the 49 billion the 
founding thompson family paid in 1987 to take the company private 
the market values that we established in 1987 are not the same 
as they are two years later said spokeswoman markeeta mcnatt 
its not necessarily that we paid too much but the events since 
then have impaired the value of those assets 
terms of the buyout was announced prior to the oct 19 1987 
stock market crash but the deal was not financed until after the 
crash 
southland has been struggling to meet the payments on the lbo 
debt 
last month it announced a recapitalization plan involving the 
sale of 400 million of southland stock to itoyokado ltd which 
operates 7eleven stores in japan the sale would give itoyokado 
75 percent of the common stock and leave about 15 percent in 
thompson hands 
the deal is contingent on bondholders approving the 
restructuring of some 18 billion in debt and preferred stock 
most analysts have suggested bondholders who would forego about 
14 billion will not agree to the deal 
complete details have yet to be filed with the federal 
securities and exchange commission and ms mcnatt said 
negotiations with bondholders cant begin until those details are 
available 
jay lustig an analyst at drake capital corp in santa monica 
calif said bondholders will not accept the restructuring 
especially if the thompsons continue to run the company 
bondholders no longer want the thompsons running the 
company he said its not their company there is no positive 
net worth this now means the creditors own the company 
lustig said bondholders would prefer southland to declare 
bankruptcy rather than continue under thompson leadership 
for the quarter ended dec 31 southland said it lost 101 
billion or 492 a share on revenues of 21 billion that 
compares with a loss of 37 million or 22 cents a share on 
revenues of 197 billion in the same three months of 1988 
for all of 1989 the company lost 131 billion or 648 a 
share on 835 billion in revenue compared with a 1988 loss of 
2162 million or 122 a share on 799 billion in sales 
southland operates about 6900 7eleven stores in addition to 
five distribution centers that service more than 5900 stores in 
the united states and 21 foreign countries

several regional retailers a french department 
store and real estate tycoon donald trump have made offers for 
bonwit teller department stores but efforts by a former executive 
of the bankrupt chain to make a bid collapsed 
a group that included former chief executive william ruben and 
remington products inc president victor kiam said it was prepared 
to offer 36 million for 13 of bonwits 16 stores if given two more 
days to secure financing 
that would have been the biggest bid of any entered at a 
bankruptcy court hearing monday bonwits creditors refused to 
grant the twoday extension though saying a delay could threaten 
the other firm bids

teller department stores including the chains flagship outlet in 
manhattans glitzy trump tower the other stores covered by the bid 
included bonwit teller properties in boston buffalo and manhasset 
ny and short hills nj 
the group would forgive 269000 in financial obligations on the 
stores in trump tower and short hills and match whatever the final 
bid is for liquidating the inventory at the boston and buffalo 
stores the bonwit teller name would be retained 
the terms of the proposal are similar to ones in a plan 
presented earlier by pyramid cos a syracuse nybased shopping 
mall developer and owner 
pyramid operating as bontel corp is part of the consortium 
but also left its own bid intact the earlier pyramid plan 
submitted to bonwit tellers parent company lj hooker corp on 
march 9 called for buying the same five stores for 165 million 
plus the assumption of some liabilities 
besides bontel and trump equitable fifth ave corp which is 
part of the trump organization the consortium includes prutaub a 
joint venture that operates the short hills mall and pilevsky 
group headed by philip pilevsky a new york real estate owner 
members of the consortium also presented bids for individual 
stores and other potential buyers submitted plans at the hearing 
atlantabased lj hooker has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection from creditors since august after its australian parent 
company hooker corp entered provisional liquidation an 
australian legal proceeding similar to bankruptcy 
since then lj hooker has sold holdings and late last year 
liquidated the b altman amp co department store chain 
the hearing before judge tina brozman was held to consider 
possible alternatives to the pyramid offer 
bidders were obliged to put up 10 percent of their offers 
lawyers for hooker said the company will decide which bid or bids 
are acceptable and make a recommendation on wednesday to the 
judge who must approve any deal 
among offers entered at mondays hearing was one from rh 
acquisition corp on behalf of ralph hibbard a canadian investor 
with past retailing experience hibbard offered more than 7 
million cash for stores in bal harbour and palm beach fla troy 
mich philadelphia and jenkintown pa 
frances brewster inc an upscale florida mens and womens 
apparel retailer offered to pay 22 million for the lease on the 
palm beach bonwit teller plus the liquidation value of the stores 
inventory the company which operates a shop on tony worth avenue 
virtually across the street from the bonwit teller would not 
retain the bonwit teller name 
a french retailer galeries lafayette offered to buy only the 
trump tower store for 4 million the sum essentially would be for 
the inventory the retailer would keep the bonwit teller name for 
135 days and then change it over to its own for the autumn season 
mccurdy amp co a rochester nybased operator of apparel 
retailers in upstate new york offered 15 million for the lease 
equipment and furnishings of the buffalo store it also would pay 
60 percent of the wholesale cost of the retail inventory for a

bonwit name would be retained

trammell crow co the nations largest commercial 
and residential builder has refinanced more than 150 properties 
using 456 million pumped into the company by a large institutional 
investor 
the injection by an arm of equitable life assurance society was 
regarded as a positive move for the company and for the troubled 
real estate market in the southwest where most of the properties 
are located analysts said 
our attorneys tell us that this is one of the largest real 
estate transactions ever done in terms of the number of properties 
involved said robert whitman trammell crows chief financial 
officer it is probably the single largest capital commitment 
made in the southwest recently 
the investment by equitable real estate investment management 
inc comes against a backdrop of rumors of financial trouble for 
dallasbased trammell crow 
i hope this transaction will have a very positive effect on 
the trammell crow co and give the naysayers a new perspective 
said douglas tibbets president of equitable real estate 
i think the whole business is in extremely fragile condition 
right now said richard kateley chief economist at real estate 
research corp in chicago and not just in texas but the whole 
marketplace could react negatively to any bad news from a major 
player like trammell crow 
if this transaction had not closed it would have been a real 
depressing signal he said 
the refinancing includes both performing and nonperforming 
properties centered in texas arizona and colorado about 70 
percent are industrial buildings the warehouses and distribution 
buildings on which trammel crow founded its business more than 40 
years ago 
the majority of it is just good old solid property said 
charles klepfer equitables regional senior vice president 
these underperforming properties are some of our best 
projects said whitman its just that they were built at a 
time when the southwest was depressed and the rental rates were 
down 
we thought that if we could address such a significant portion 
of the companys problem properties in one transaction we could 
get it all behind it whitman said 
we wanted to remove the sword of damocles from hanging over 
us

the love canal buyout in 1978 involved about 19 million to 
purchase 232 homes in times beach about 33 million was spent to 
buy 393 properties 
homeowners in the circle drive area of ponca city had complained 
since 1987 that groundwater laced with hydrocarbons including 
cancercausing banzene seeped into their basements and threatened 
their health some residents camped out at the state capitol for 
weeks in 1988 to get the state to buy their houses 
the protesters said heavy rain two years earlier had unleashed 
toxic reddishorange sludge that bubbled up from cracks in 
sidewalks and black slime that oozed into their basements 
conoco said then the sludge was the result of iron ore and the 
state health department and federal environmental protection agency 
agreed there was no health hazard but residents said they had 
suffered an inordinate rate of cancer deaths and other ailments

is the right thing to do for these residents for ponca city and 
for conoco 
the situation has caused dissension in our community for too 
long its time to put it behind us he said 
anna sue rafferty who spoke on behalf of the plaintiffs 
declined to fix blame

this settlement ms rafferty said id just like to say none

a hearing on the settlement is set for june 5 in federal court 
in oklahoma city 
if approved the settlement of the lawsuit filed in march 1989 
would enable many owners and renters of property to move residents 
of a larger area of the neighborhood could receive payments because 
of their proximity to the groundwater problems and the work needed 
to fix them 
conoco would pay residents the appraised value of their homes 
an above marketvalue premium a moving and household disruption 
bonus and other sums

prices on the tokyo stock exchange rose sharply 
today in nervous rollercoaster trading and the dollar dropped 
against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained a hefty 75765 points 
or 27 percent ending the day at 2875765 in morning trading 
the index first rose more than 500 points then fell below the 
28000point line 
the index rose again in the afternoon as participants decided 
the market had bottomed out in the morning said yoshiro inoue an 
analyst with nomura securities co 
he said market players expect the index will stay above the 
27200point level 30 percent below where it stood at the end of 
last year 
inoue said another encouraging sign was the stability of 
government bond prices which remained relatively steady despite 
mondays heavy losses in the stock market 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 15895 yen down 100 
yen from mondays close of 15995 yen the us currency opened at 
15910 yen and ranged between 15880 yen and 15935 yen 
on monday as the dollar surged to a threeyear high against the 
japanese yen the nikkei index plunged 197838 points or 659 
percent to close at 2800207 in its secondlargest singleday 
decline ever the plunge followed a 104571point or 337 
percent fall in the index last friday 
analysts said both currency and stock markets were shaken monday 
by a report in a leading japanese financial newspaper that major 
life insurers planned to shift funds out of the stock market 
volume on the markets first section today was estimated at 650 
million shares up from 450 million shares on monday 
the price of benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds closed 
at 8644 points up from mondays close at 8602 their yield fell 
to 7260 percent from the previous days 7350 percent 
but inoue said uncertainty remained in the market the index 
has only entered a range that everybody predicted would be the 
markets bottom but there may be further shakeups inoue said 
other traders said it would take time for the market to regain 
its energy and make a stable recovery 
as long as the government differentiates between interest 
rates and the foreign exchange rate and takes two different 
approaches both markets will stabilize and will help the stock 
market recover inoue said 
he said it would not be wise to raise interest rates in order to 
support the yen 
on march 25 the bank of japan raised its official discount rate 
by 1 percentage point to 525 percent in a move widely seen as an 
attempt to bolster the value of the dropping yen 
dealers said the finance ministry on monday bought about 1 
trillion yen 63 billion in government bonds to support their 
price and prevent yields from rising excessively 
meanwhile bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said today the 
decline in japanese stock prices since the beginning of this year 
has been excessive 
the nikkei index has lost more than 10000 points or 26 
percent so far this year 
traders said currency market participants focused on the stock 
market performance in the absence of other marketaffecting news 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities 
co said the yen fell in the morning session as stock prices 
fell but the afternoon rebound in share prices did not boost 
yenbuying incentives 
kanai said market players avoided major moves before the meeting 
among finance ministers from the group of seven industrialized 
nations scheduled for april 7 and the conclusion of ongoing 
usjapan trade talks in washington 
but kanai said the dollar was likely to continue to rise because 
market demand for the us currency remained strong and there was 
little incentive to buy the yen 
he said that after the trade talks and the g7 meetingthe 
dollar will jump over the 160yen level and rise further 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said today he was concerned 
by recent exchange rate movements and hoped stability would return 
to the market soon

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge fell 10 percent in february the commerce department 
reported today but analysts said it would have changed little 
except for a drop in building permits 
the index of leading economic indicators designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance had risen the 
previous three months 
but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the indexs 
building permit component many analysts expressed skepticism in 
advance of the february report 
the analysts said todays index would be lowered by the february 
drop from the unusually large number of permits builders sought in 
january to take advantage of record warm weather and to beat a 
deadline for meeting expensive new building standards 
the standards required by 1989 fair housing legislation are 
designed to make apartment buildings more accessible to the 
handicapped the national association of home builders said the 
standards would add between 3600 and 7200 to the cost of an 
apartment 
according to a survey of 51 top economists published in blue 
chip economic indicators the gross national product the nations 
output of goods and services will grow 17 percent in 1990 
but the survey by eggert economic enterprises of sedona ariz 
says the economic outlook remains the most sluggish since the 
recession year of 1982 
seven of the 11 forwardlooking statistics contributed to the 
decline led by the steep fall in building permits in february 
after a sharp jump in the previous month the warmest january on 
record 
other negatives included faster business delivery times lower 
stock prices a decline in plant and equipment orders a decrease 
in the price of raw materials a decline in the backlog of 
manufacturers unfilled orders and a drop in an index measuring 
consumer confidence 
three of the components were positive including an increase in 
orders for consumer goods a gain in the money supply and a drop in 
weekly unemploylment claims 
one indicator the length of the average workweek was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1440 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index fell 06 percent from september through 
february after declining 05 percent the previous six months 
the january index was revised from unchanged to a 02 percent 
gain because of an increase in new orders for consumer goods 
the december index was revised down from 06 percent to 04 
percent because of a shorter workweek the november index had risen 
01 percent 
the analysts said because so many building permits were issued 
in january there were fewer issued in february causing the number 
to decline a sharp 25 percent economist michael p niemira of 
mitsubishi bank in new york said that drove the overall index down 
if that onetime aberration were not included the index might 
have exceeded its january level niemira said 
michael k evans head of a forecasting organization here wrote 
in the evans report shortly before the index was released that 
except for that one anomaly the index would be up slightly 
excluding the housing permits component the index is expected 
to stand unchanged signifying continuation of restrained economic 
growth samuel d kahan chief economist for fuji securities inc 
of chicago wrote in his organizations weekly perspectives last 
week 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association characterized the economy so far this year as a 
quarter of recovery 
we recovered from the very cold december berson explained 
we recovered from the boeing strike we recovered from the san 
francisco bay area earthquake and the hurricane hugo all of 
which helped depress the fourth quarter

pork ribs for backyard barbecues are costing 
more this spring along with just about everything else thats part 
of a hog 
the agriculture department says hog farmers may increase 
production seasonally later this year but that wont do much to 
cool off prices before this fall 
kevin bost of the departments economic research service said 
last fridays report showing further declines in the us inventory 
of hogs and pigs confirmed our expectations for reduced supplies 
this spring and summer 
as a result he said we should be looking at higher wholesale 
pork prices and higher retail prices in the next few months 
the departments allcut pork price a weighted blend of prices 
paid by consumers at retail stores rose to 197 per pound in 
february bost said monday in a telephone interview that matched 
the alltime high set in the late summer of 1987 
bost said wholesale pork prices have continued to edge higher 
meaning that i wouldnt be surprised to see a new record high 
retail price in march when the labor department releases those 
consumer figures on april 17 
in another report last friday the usda showed the march 
hogcorn feed price ratio at a relatively high 222 bushels up 
from 208 in february and 151 in march 1989 
those numbers represent the bushels of corn equal in value to 
100 pounds of live hog shipped to market other factors are also 
important in the hog business but feed costs are a major item for 
producers thinking about expanding or cutting back their operations 
roughly the higher the number in the hogcorn ratio the 
greater the opportunity for profit 
in general returns to hog producers have been pretty 
favorable since the middle part of last year bost said if 
prices go on good enough for long enough eventually they 
expand 
one question is the corn crop and whether livestock producers 
have ample feed supplies at reasonable prices bost said recent 
moisture conditions sure doesnt hurt those prospects for the 
1990 harvest 
based on the situation as it looks now pork production probably 
will begin to pick up at least seasonally this fall 
were probably looking at larger pork supplies in 1991 bost 
said 
meanwhile bost and his usda colleagues say consumers may see 
some easing of beef prices this summer according to the april 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine but it wont be dramatic 
improved prospects for spring grazing in some areas probably 
will increase retention of females for cattle herd expansion and 
lower slaughter of beef cows and heifers the report said 
as that happens there will be less nonfed beef for 
consumers which affects hamburger prices 
prices of choicegrade fed steers moving to slaughter will 
continue to decline as marketready supplies increase into early 
summer the report said in some markets prices may fall below 
70 per hundredweight perhaps not reaching the mid70s again 
until fall 
at retail choicegrade beef rose to a record level in january 
of 2813 per pound on an allcut basis and edged still higher to 
2815 in february the report said 
broiler prices have been supported by the strength in beef and 
pork with retail prices in the first quarter averaging about the 
same as a year ago despite a production increase of about 8 percent 
from yearearlier levels further increases are expected 
in march the estimated 12city wholesale broiler price was 
about 61 cents per pound up from 5737 cents in february and 517 
cents in january in march 1989 the 12city average was 621 cents 
the wholesale broiler prices in 1990 may average 5157 cents 
per pound compared with 59 for last year the report said

general motors corp president robert c stempel 
who today was named to succeed roger b smith as gm chairman rose 
through the companys product ranks a path decidedly different 
from that of his predecessor 
stempel will take over operation of the worlds largest 
corporation aug 1 the day after smith retires as gms 10th 
chairman and less than three weeks after stempel turns 57 
stempel a big man who peers directly at whomever hes talking 
to has been the companys president and chief operating officer 
since sept 1 1987 during months of speculation about smiths 
successor stempel was given the inside track 
but that wasnt because his background mirrored smiths in auto 
industry parlance stempel is a product guy and smith is a 
bean counter 
stempel received a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering 
from worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts in 1955 and a 
masters degree in business administration from michigan state 
university in 1970 
smith gms chairman since jan 1 1981 received bachelors and 
masters degrees in business administration from the university of 
michigan he joined gm as a senior accounting clerk in detroit 
stempel joined gm as a senior detailer in the chassis design 
department of the companys oldsmobile division in 1958 the same 
year smith became director of the general accounting section in the 
detroit central office 
each man climbed through the ranks in the 1960s with stempel 
concentrating in powertrain design and smith focusing on corporate 
finances 
in 1972 stempel was named assistant chief engineer at 
oldsmobile and smith was named vice president and group executive 
in charge of the nonautomotive and defense group 
stempel joined the legion of nearly four dozen gm vice 
presidents when he became general manager of the companys pontiac 
division in 1978 two years before going to europe to head the 
automakers adam opel ag carmaking operation in west germany 
gms european operations have produced profits that helped the 
giant automaker last year regain the top profit spot it lost to 
ford motor co in 1986 
during the speculation about smiths successor auto analysts 
said among the best things gms board could do to slow or reverse 
the companys slide in us market share is elect someone who could 
apply the lessons learned in europe to the companys worldwide 
operations 
in 1982 stempel returned to the united states to head the 
chevrolet division the companys largest carmaking operation two 
years later he was named executive in charge of the 
buickoldsmobilecadillac group 
in february 1986 stempel joined smith on gms board of 
directors as executive vice president in charge of the worldwide 
truck amp bus group and the overseas group 
nineteen months later he became gms 17th president

a joint venture between japanese and us meat 
dealers will begin selling beef imported from the united states in 
freezerequipped vending machines an official representing the 
japanese company said tuesday 
our aim is to supply imported beef at a cheaper price to 
consumers by reducing the costs of distributionrelated personnel 
required otherwise said naoki sakai spokesman of jackson co a 
japanese meat dealer based in japans western port city of kobe 
sakai said it will be first time in japan that beef is sold in 
vending machines 
jackson co which has specialized in us meat since 1978 and 
hamilton meat co a meat packer based in san diego calif set up 
the joint venture in kobe last month sakai said 
the new firms move followed japans liberalization of imports 
of seasoned beef into japan on sunday the first day of the 
countrys new fiscal year he said under a 1988 bilateral 
agreement between japan and the united states japan has been 
gradually liberalizing beef imports 
under the venture seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be 
processed in the united states before being imported in frozen 
vacuum packages for sale in vending machines in japan sakai said 
vending machines will be set up at 1000 locations mainly near 
railway stations and convenience stores sakai said adding that 
the number of beefselling machines will be increased to a yet 
unspecified figure in the future 
sakai said the new joint company plans to sell a pack containing 
175 ounces of beef for sukiyaki at about 1800 yen or 1130 
about half the retail price of similar but locally produced beef 
we can sell at that price by introducting vending machines in 
place of the more costly workforce sakai said 
each vending machine will be connected to a computer at the 
ventures head office which will monitor the temperature and manage 
inventories within each freezer he said 
the company will install the vending machines starting next 
week and it is anticipating 3 billion yen or 188 million in 
sales in its first year of operation he said 
japan imported 128000 tons of beef from the united states in 
the first 10 months up to january of fiscal 1989 which accounted 
for 41 percent of japans total beef imports in that period 
according to japanese government figures

to succeed the retiring roger b smith as chairman 
smith who officially steps down july 31 at age 65 announced 
stempels selection at a news conference at gm headquarters 
lloyd e reuss a gm executive vice president will succeed 
stempel as president smith said the position of chief operating 
officer also held by stempel was being eliminated 
stempel told reporters at the news conference his first priority 
is increasing gm sales 
one of our major ones challenges is to increase our 
north american market share profitably stempel said there is 
no higher priority in general motors than increasing our market 
share profitably 
gms share of the north american car and truck market has 
dropped to 346 percent last year from 441 percent in 1980 
gms board of directors met monday at the companys sprawling 
car and truckmaking complex in oshawa ontario 
a team of outside directors has been serving as a search 
committee for the chairman of the company that last year made 422 
billion on revenue of 1269 billion 
smith who said he would remain on gms board praised stempel 
for his domestic and international experience 
im leaving general motors on august 1 convinced weve got 
probably the greatest team weve ever had because weve got some 
of the greatest challenges weve ever had the outgoing chairman 
said 
most speculation in recent months has centered on the 
56yearold stempel although the names of two gm executive vice 
presidents f alan smith and john f smith jr also have been 
mentioned as candidates for chairman both smiths no relation to 
roger smith had financial backgrounds 
stempel began his gm career as a senior detailer in the chassis 
design department of the companys oldsmobile division in 1958 
he became general manager of the companys pontiac division in 
1978 and two years later went to europe to head gms adam opel ag 
carmaking operation in west germany 
in 1982 stempel returned to the united states to head the 
chevrolet division and in 1984 was named executive in charge of the 
buickoldsmobilecadillac group 
in february 1986 stempel joined gms board of directors as 
executive vice president in charge of the worldwide truck amp bus 
group and the overseas group 
the following year he became gms president 
reuss 53 has been executive vice president in charge of north 
american passenger car groups and a board member since february 
1986 he was given the additional responsibility of gms truck and 
bus grup in 1987 he started as a gm engineer in 1959 
gm is the second of the big three us automakers to revamp its 
top management for the 1990s 
on march 1 harold poling became ford motor cos chairman 
succeeding donald petersen poling will hold the top job at ford 
for three years before he is expected to give way to allan gilmour 
executive vice president 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacoccas contract with the nations 
no 3 automaker expires late next year 
gm has been wrestling with excess plant capacity as the us 
auto market softens the huge automaker is expected to shutter its 
lakewood car assembly plant in atlanta this summer and half of its 
lordstown ohio plant next year 
since 1987 gm has shut down assembly plants in framingham 
mass kansas city mo and pontiac mich 
balancing plant capacity with a shrinking car and truck market 
is one of the big challenges facing the new gm chairman 
others include managing the launch and growth of gms saturn 
corp which plans to begin making a small importfighting car 
this summer in spring hill tenn and contract negotiations with 
the united auto workers union which has tapped job security as its 
top bargaining priority 
the saturn project originally proposed in 1983 as a 5billion 
program to build 500000 subcompacts a year has been cut nearly in 
half yet with its unique labor agreement and manufacturing 
techniques it is viewed as a laboratory of things to come at gm 
and a key step in the automakers attempt to arrest a decline in 
its market share 
smith repeatedly has vowed to drive the first production car off 
the assembly line now scheduled for about a month before his 
retirement 
but overshadowing all the new product projects are gms labor 
relations with the uaw since the last threeyear contract was 
signed in 1987 thousands of gms union workers have lost jobs and 
watched factories fall idle 
there is speculation the uaw will select gm as its target 
company after talks start this july meaning the union will focus 
its negotiating attention on that automaker the uaws contracts 
with gm ford and chrysler expire sept 14

at least one aspect of trade talks between the 
united states and japan is reassuring in some respects that is 
each nation proposes moves that conceivably could help the other 
why should there be resistance over that maybe there shouldnt 
be but there is trade talks like all internation discussions 
become mixed up in politics not to mention diplomatic nuances 
the japanese would like to see americans cut the budget deficit 
save more raise the skills and overall abilities of workers put 
more effort into longterm research and in general improve the 
quality of products 
media reports suggest other maybe more controversial proposals 
have been made including a reduction in credit cards lower 
corporate bonuses and higher gasoline taxes all ideas with support 
within the united states 
for its part the united states would like to see the japanese 
improve their living standards allow greater consumer access to 
supermarkets and department stores pay lower prices and improve 
their infrastructure 
there are of course many controversial aspects to the trade 
talks but these relatively beneficent issues are among them and 
all have support within the respective countries 
from president bush on down it would seem that most americans 
would be happy with a smaller budget deficit the only major 
controversy appears to be the method by which it is achieved 
proposals to raise the level of us education and skills are 
discussed every day in the united states and a researcher would be 
hard pressed to find anyone with a strong negative view on the 
matter 
within the united states there has been repeated criticism of 
the tendency of some corporate managers to take the shortterm 
view with many of the critics maintaining that the shortterm view 
weakens america competitively 
it didnt take criticism by the japanese to awaken americans to 
an allegedly low savings rate almost everyone agrees that savings 
are good for individuals businesses and country 
on these many japanese and americans see eye to eye 
on the other side of the discussion it is unlikely you would 
find many japanese opposed to better living standards japan is 
rich the worlds no 2 economic power but many of its citizens 
dont know it 
many americans are not familiar with the way the japanese live 
roger a brooks a scholar at the heritage foundation a 
conservative think tank is familiar 
in a position paper for the foundations asian studies center 
of which he is director brooks urges the japanese to say yes 
to opening their markets to imports and for reasons with which 
many japanese might agree 
to wit 
in the absence of imports japan forces its consumers to pay 
eight times what americans pay for rice to live in houses that are 
on average onethird the size of us homes to pay three times the 
world price for fiberoptic cable for japans telephone 
modernization efforts to buy their goods at mom and pop 
operations with huge markups because of the law changed only 
recently outlawing discount stores 
his portrait isnt complete 
japan he says has the worlds largest surplus of foreign 
exchange but it also has the greatest proportion of unpaved 
roads in the developed world and the lowest per capita endowment 
of public facilities such as parks and sporting areas 
among the highly industrialized nations he says japan has 
surely the least materially bountiful life 
reports from trade negotiations suggest a reluctance by each 
nation to make concessions interspersed with occasional 
breakthroughs in all the tone has been less than highly positive 
but with these crosstable suggestions for improvements there 
seems to be at least a basis in good will for an agreement this 
month that much is reassuring

us currency ahead of talks this weekend among the group of seven 
industrial nations 
although dealers said the dollar is supported by worries over 
german unification and questions over the ability of japan to 
support the sagging yen they said that those factors did not 
provoke fresh dollar buying 
most of what we saw to day was purely intraday said a 
senior corporate dealer at a large french bank i dont think 
many people are taking a mediumterm or longterm outlook right 
now

us and japanese negotiators resumed 
discussions today on one of the thorniest trade disputes between 
the two nations an effort to attack the underlying causes of 
americas 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
both sides reported good progress had been made after the first 
day of talks monday behind closed doors at the state department 
however the head of a major manufacturers lobbying group today 
raised questions over whether the us side was demanding enough 
concessions from the japanese to lower americas trade deficit by 
any significant degree 
i think it is still up in the air whether these talks will 
yield any meaningful results said jerry jasinowski president of 
the national association of manufacturers 
the bush administration launched the talks known as the 
structural impediments initiative last july seeking to force the 
japanese to remove barriers that prevent the sale of american 
products and services in japan 
the administration is demanding a halt to cozy japanese business 
practices that exclude foreign companies as well as tougher 
enforcement of laws prohibiting bidrigging and pricefixing 
stration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
japanese foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told 
reporters the japanese initiatives were designed to ward off 
protectionist pressures in america and to benefit japan 
this is not being done for the sake of pleasing others but to 
improve the quality of life for japanese consumers watanabe said 
he refused to discuss details of the japanese package however 
published reports said japanese negotiators proposed among other 
things making it easier for large american retailers to open 
stores in japan 
the japanese negotiators also reportedly proposed increased 
penalties for violations of antimonopoly laws and laid out plans 
for increased spending on public works projects two demands of 
us negotiators 
watanabe said the japanese actions were not being taken under 
threat of us retaliation but he said the japanese side felt it 
was important to show it had made the utmost effort to resolve 
the disputes 
the administration is reviewing barriers against us products 
with a congressionally imposed april 30 deadline to target 
countries with the most onerous barriers for intensive negotiations 
last year the japanese were targeted for barriers against the 
sale of us supercomputers satellites and wood products in 
recent days negotiators have reached agreements in principle to 
resolve the satellite and supercomputer issues and will meet later 
this month in an effort to expand the japanese market for american 
lumber

at least five shots struck a 
southeastern trailways bus today as it traveled along a greyhound 
route from nashville to louisville state police said 
neither the driver nor the only passenger aboard was injured 
the incident happened just two days after another southeastern 
trailways bus on a route usually traveled by strikeplagued 
greyhound was hit and the driver seriously wounded 
kentucky state police trooper eddie lair said todays shooting 
was reported about 1015 am edt and occurred somewhere on 
interstate 65 near sonora about 55 miles south of louisville 
all five shots hit the bus on the drivers side but none of 
them penetrated he said the driver who was not identified could 
not say from which direction the shots were fired lair said 
officials believe a 22caliber rifle was used 
on saturday southeastern trailways driver david e bryant was 
wounded in the arm by a shot fired from a pickup that pulled 
alongside as in todays shooting the southeastern trailways bus 
was following a greyhound route under a pool arrangement 
bryant 58 of cincinnati was reported in fair condition today 
at vanderbilt university medical center in nashville a hospital 
spokesman jim keeley said fears that bryants badly wounded arm 
would have to be amputated had eased 
none of bryants 46 passengers was wounded 
there have been reports of sporadic violence and other shootings 
since greyhound drivers went on strike march 2 the company blames 
the union and says there will be no contract talks until a week 
goes by with no violence 
on monday the head of greyhounds drivers union suggested the 
companys refusal to negotiate is partly to blame for the violence 
reaching an agreement through bargaining would leave the 
crazies without any incentive to violence union president 
edward strait said monday in a letter to greyhound executive vice 
president p anthony lannie 
talks were to have resumed monday until the company called them 
off in the wake of continuing violence 
lannie dismissed as total nonsense any suggestion that 
americas only nationwide bus system is reponsible for violence by 
refusing to negotiate 
the walkout by 6300 drivers and some 3000 office and 
maintenance workers began over wages and job security march 2 on 
monday greyhound said there had been 29 shootings including 24 in 
which buses were the target 
the union says there have been more than 60 incidents of 
violence against pickets 
as of monday the company said it had 1519 permanent 
replacements behind the wheel plus 480 union members who crossed 
picket lines 
lannie said the company anticipates having 3200 drivers at work

the first commercially available optical disc 
recorder that can erase stored images and record over them will 
give broadcasters a better tool than videotape for showing video 
replays panasonic said 
the new device would allow television stations to more easily 
replay a sports highlight for example than conventional videotape 
technology the japanese company said monday it also can store 
more minutes of video and provides better picture quality than 
videotape 
the recorder can find an individual frame of recorded video 
within one second the company said thats much quicker than 
videotape machines in which the tape must be rewound to the exact 
spot 
panasonic also said the machine could be used for interactive 
training programs to store criminal records in police departments 
and for sales and marketing uses such as recording videotapes of 
homes to show to prospective buyers 
eventually similar devices could be made for home use said 
edward rothchild a san franciscobased consultant on optical 
storage devices he calls such recordable laser video disc players 
the next mass consumer products which could supplant vcrs and 
videotapes much as compact discs are replacing phonograph records 
the current generation of home laser video disc machines can 
only play prerecorded discs they have failed to become a major 
market in part because they cannot record tv shows 
optical storage devices have been around for years but most of 
them cannot be erased once the original recording is made they are 
used primarily for longterm storage of computer data such as 
invoices or bank statements 
panasonics device works on the magnetooptical principal in 
which a magnetic field is used to magnetize certain portions of the 
optical disc a laser beam reads these magnetized portions and 
converts them into a picture unlike a compact disc it stores the 
information in conventional analog form instead of in the computer 
language of digital storage 
jay bretzmann an analyst for international data corp said the 
devices major advantage over videotape is its ease of locating 
certain portions of stored video he also said it could be reused 
many more times than videotape which tends to degrade in quality 
over time 
i think it will expand the market for these devices he said 
he said panasonic is leveraging the expertise of its parent 
matsushita electric industrial co of japan in optical storage 
devices 
rothchild said other japanese companies have demonstrated 
similar machines but that panasonic is the first to the market 
in addition to their appeal to tv stations he said they also 
should prove popular with movie studios which already are using 
nonerasable optical discs to edit film erasable discs would be a 
great costsavings he said 
panasonic did not disclose the price of the recorder it plans 
to begin shipments in the fourth quarter

investor harold simmons has ended his 11 billion 
tender offer for georgia gulf corp deciding instead to back the 
chemical companys recapitalization plan at its april 19 annual 
meeting 
however simmons nl industries inc which owns almost 10 
percent of georgia gulfs stock left open monday the possibility 
of another tender offer if shareholders reject the recapitalization 
plan 
in january georgia gulf which is based in atlanta proposed 
the debtfinanced recapitalization to boost the price of its stock 
and fend off an earlier offer from simmons 
simmons countered with another tender offer in a move analysts 
said was designed to pressure georgia gulf to complete the 
recapitalization as proposed 
since georgia gulf amended its original plan two weeks ago its 
stock has traded close to the 45 a share offered by simmons in a 
statement nl industries said it was not willing to increase its 
bid at this time and would instead support the georgia gulf plan 
nl said it was also ending a planned proxy fight for control of 
georgia gulfs board 
georgia gulf stock was trading at 4387 a share on the new 
york stock exchange tuesday 
georgia gulf has promised shareholders 30 a share in cash plus 
850 a share in notes and stock the company has valued at 11 a 
share the original proposal promised stock and 38 a share in 
cash but analysts were concerned that the company would be unable 
to sell the 200 million in junk bonds needed to finance the offer 
while they are offering less cash it is a more doable 
transaction said michael snetzer a simmons strategist 
if shareholders approve georgia gulfs recapitalization plan nl 
could walk away from its investment with about 15 million in 
profits based on a 45ashare value for the proposal 
if shareholders do not approve the plan nl said it might 
consider another tender offer for the company

pessimism about the economy and outcome of trade 
talks with the united states have helped spur the protracted slide 
in japans stock market analysts said tuesday 
traders said many investors are concerned the the trade 
negotiations in washington could affect the structural causes of 
japans 49 billion trade surplus with the united states and lead 
to wrenching changes in an exportoriented economy that is largely 
responsible for the nations stunning growth 
in the talks called the structural impediments initiative the 
united states has pressured japan to boost public works spending 
simplify its complex distribution system ease the way for large 
retailers to open stores and tighten enforcement of its 
antimonopoly law 
japan will have to make a series of changes in the structural 
talks and will have to forget about the old structures that 
supported our stock market boom and the strong yen in the past 
said kenji maeshiro a stock analyst with yamaichi securities co 
what we need now is to have a new approach to stock investment 
in order to cope with the new economic structures and policies 
he said 
so far this year the tokyo stock exchanges nikkei stock 
average has fallen more than 10000 points or 26 percent from a 
record 3891578 at the end of 1989 
the markets total value also has dropped quickly at the close 
of trading on tuesday it stood at 4568 trillion yen or 287 
trillion down from 61115 trillion yen or 384 trillion at the 
end of last year 
the recent string of stock market plunges was topped by mondays 
drop of 197838 points or 659 percent in the nikkeis 
secondlargest singleday dive ever as the dollar surged to a 
threeyear high against the yen 
the only larger singleday loss was during the black monday 
global stock crash on oct 20 1987 when the nikkei shed 383648 
points or 149 percent to close at 2191008 
as the market has continued its steep declines securities 
dealers and analysts have repeatedly lowered their predictions for 
the nikkeis bottom with most estimates now near the 27000level 
following the 75765point or 27 percent rebound tuesday 
traders predictions were divided some said the market had 
bottomed out while others said market nervousness and pessimism 
would persist in coming weeks 
josen takahashi chief economist at the mitsubishi research 
institute said the market plunges reflected fear of higher 
inflation in japan 
due partly to the yens weakness wholesale prices rose a 
relatively high 38 percent in the second 10 days of march from a 
year earlier in another sign of the declining currency japan 
reported a 4907 billion overall trade surplus in february down 
324 percent from a year earlier 
takahashi said inflationary pressures began forming last year 
when market participants disregarded rising shortterm interest 
rates and continued to push up stock prices ordinarily when 
interest rates rise stocks fall 
the bank of japan plunged in by boosting its key official 
discount rate three times from 25 percent to 425 percent 
followed by an additional 1 percentage point hike on march 25 this 
year to 525 percent the objective was to discourage borrowing 
cool inflation and stabilize the yen 
market players had expected the most recent discountrate 
increase to come shortly after parliamentary elections on feb 18 
and blamed the extended delay with further destabilizing stock 
prices and the yen 
despite its recent heavy market intervention the bank of japan 
the nations central bank has failed to halt the yens decline 
because of the intervention japans foreign currency and gold 
reserves suffered the largest fall ever in march dropping 6947 
billion to 73496 billion the finance ministry reported monday 
the tumble was the third consecutive monthly decline 
takahashi said stocks will continue to fall unless underlying 
problems a mix of higher interest rates the weaker yen and 
higher consumer prices show signs of improvement 
the yen is unlikely to strengthen under japans current 
political and economic conditions he said 
japan has became more isolated and its relative importance has 
declined as hopes about reforms in eastern europe and uncertainties 
over the usjapan trade talks have grown he said 
a leading japanese economic newspaper the nihon keizai shimbun 
called tuesday on political leaders to take action to improve the 
economic climate 
unless japans political world can satisfy the markets in 
reforming the countrys structural problems there will be no 
chance of the yens recovery and no bottom for the stock market 
it said

japans leading banks which bumped us 
competitors from the worlds top 10 list in the 1980s are finding 
themselves squeezed by higher costs reduced business and the tokyo 
stock markets slide 
the advantage japanese banks used to enjoy has been largely 
eradicated the whole perspective of international banking is 
considerably changed said david threadgold an analyst with 
county natwest securities 
paul heaton senior analyst at wi carr securities predicts 
that profits at the 13 leading commercial banks dropped 11 percent 
for the fiscal year ended march 31 in the previous year profits 
rose 25 percent 
leaving out income from equities sales earnings from banking 
business may be down by 50 percent from fiscal 1988 threadgold 
said 
in addition the fall of the yen and japans stock market have 
imperiled the banks plans to raise their capital levels to meet 
international standards set for 1993 
management at top banks feel we have entered a very difficult 
period but we are not going to see any bankruptcies said 
teruyuki takahashi a senior manager at the japanese federation of 
bankers associations 
the worlds 10 biggest banks in assets are japanese sheer size 
will keep them there but they will become weaker competitors 
abroad as their source of cheap funds dries up threadgold said 
rising interest rates have made it more expensive for banks to 
acquire funds for lending banks now are paying holders of money 
market certificates 58 percent interest compared with the 075 
percent paid on ordinary bank accounts 
furthermore more customers now can buy money market 
certificates because the minimum purchase has been cut from 62500 
to 6250 
meanwhile business from incomeproducing loans has been chilled 
by higher interest rates and by government efforts to cool the 
feverish property market 
japans central bank has raised its key rate for loans to 
commercial banks from 25 percent to 525 percent in the past 10 
months in turn commercial banks prime lending rates jumped from 
about 55 percent to around 72 percent 
the speed of change is too fast takahashi said 
at the same time the bank of japan has instructed banks to keep 
property loan growth in line with the industrys overall loan 
growth instead of their recent pace of double the overall rate 
the move is aimed at helping cool property prices that have jumped 
50 percent to 90 percent annually in tokyo and other major cities 
since the mid1980s 
banks have been dealt a double blow by the rapid change they 
are paying higher rates on customer certificates but are earning 
relatively low interest on longterm past loans anticipating 
higher rates many companies rushed to take out longterm loans 
over the past year heaton said 
furthermore loan volume is slumping said yoshiaki takanashi 
chief of research at yasuda trust bank businesses are raising more 
of their funds from other sources or simply putting off capital 
spending he said 
heaton said loan growth which had been expanding at 12 percent 
to 14 percent a year now was less than 10 percent 
meanwhile the rapid fall of the yen and the stock market has 
hurt the banks attempt to meet international capital adequacy 
standards said takanashi at yasuda trust 
major economic powers acting through the swissbased bank for 
international settlements have set a march 1993 deadline for banks 
to hold capital equal to at least 8 percent of their loans and 
other assets japanese banks used to maintain only about half that 
and have been relying heavily on the equities market to raise the 
needed capital through new share and covertible bond offerings 
the stock markets more than 25 percent loss this year has 
drained the value of banks shareholdings and made it difficult to 
raise new capital in the market takanashi said 
additionally the yens fall of about 10 percent against the 
us dollar this year has raised the value of dollardenominated 
loans overseas he said these inflated loan values comprising 
roughly 40 percent of the city banks assets require more capital 
in reserve

the worlds two most powerful economies have

never mind trade tensions at sam kusumotos 
company a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in 
usjapan relations 
there wasnt an argument or even a minor contretemps at the 
affair many of the american employees just didnt show up it 
seems they didnt know about it in time explains kusumoto 
president of minolta usa in suburban ramsey nj 
at japanese companies we have very nice horizontal 
communication he says everybody listens to what the other guy 
is talking about over the phone after office hours we associate 
so plans for just about everything spread chattily through the 
ranks in japanese of course formal notice americanstyle is 
almost an afterthought 
the americans didnt hear about the party kusumoto says 
and when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got 
upset 
a simple miscue but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding 
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of usjapan amity and 
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century japan 
under american prodding cast off its feudal kosode robes 
today more than ever the worlds two most powerful economies 
have become inextricably wedded but too often the relationship 
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and 
little in common apart from money 
the tensions have appeared in numerous forms despite the best 
efforts of both sides to avoid them in charges of discrimination 
by american employees of japanese companies in a hardhearted new 
appraisal by washington of its onetime protege and vice versa 
and not least in an undercurrent of racism 
the racism often surfaces subtly when japanese companies 
purchasedsuch american corporate icons as columbia pictures and new 
yorks rockefeller center last year the headlines often read the 
japanese buy as if the entire nation were bent 
samurailike on the takeover 
in contrast other major foreign purchasers british canadian 
dutch have been described more accurately as individual companies 
part of it is the sheer cultural impact of japans new wealth 
an economic sea change that made japan the worlds largest creditor 
by the end of the 1980s and its former patron the united states 
the largest debtor 
its the japanese rate of buying thats frightening says 
marlene rossman a new yorkbased consultant to new york companies 
japan is now second only to great britain in us investments 
from may 1987 to last may the number of us factories with at 
least partial japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1043 
according to the japan external trade organization 
japans total investment in us real estate corporations and 
subsidiaries soared from 47 billion in 1980 to 534 billion in 
1988 according to the most recent commerce department figures 
japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real 
estate in downtown los angeles more than 20 prime properties in 
manhattan including tiffanys and substantial holdings in 
washington 
it is not over the issue of washington real estate however but 
closer to the heart of the nations capital that usjapanese 
tensions have perhaps cut deepest 
particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in 
february the united states enjoyed a 15 billion surplus with the 
12nation european community a sharp turnaround from a 92 
billion deficit in 1988 but with japan despite a sharp decline in 
the dollar engineered to help us exports the deficit was a 
stubborn 49 billion 
that was no appreciable improvement from the previous years 
518 billion deficit with japan even with an 18 percent increase 
in us export sales says j michael farren undersecretary for 
international trade in the commerce department 
the trade frictions are aggravated by what many in congress and 
the bush administration see as the japanese governments xenophobic 
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade 
as economic warfare 
the fallacy in asking the japanese to open their markets is 
they havent got the foggiest idea what an open market is says 
clyde prestowitz a former commerce department negotiator whose 
influential 1988 book trading places portrayed japan as 
having carefully planned its exportfueled ascendancy 
in tokyo foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said us 
analysts were wrong in arguing that japans culture was an 
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market on march 22 
us and japanese trade negotiators reported a breakthrough over 
the key issue of opening supercomputer exports to japan 
in addition experts point out japan has been moving from an 
exportbased to a domestic marketbased economy 
japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas watanabe 
said and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so 
one reason however is that the japanese are not as keen on 
foreign ideas these days an attitude born of japans pride in its 
postwar miracle and a growing contempt for the united states 
persistent problems

according to a business week poll released dec 7 pearl harbor 
day more than half of the japanese dont have much or any 
admiration for the united states its economic success or its 
people 
a recent book published in japanese a japan that can say 
no stunned washington when word trickled back of its harsh view 
of the united states but in japan it has ruffled few feathers 
because much of its content has been expressed privately by 
japanese journalists and businessmen who deal with america 
taro kimura a former anchorman for japan broadcasting corp 
commented in a newspaper column 
one of the books authors shintaro ishihara a rightwing 
former cabinet minister went beyond the usual criticisms of us 
corporate shortsightedness and product quality he wrote that 
racial prejudice is at the base of usjapan frictions american 
whites realizing their culture is declining fear losing 
leadership to the yellowrace japanese he said 
but ishiharas outspokenness still represents an extreme the 
irony of usjapan frictions is that both sides the japanese in 
particular seem to try so hard to avoid misunderstanding 
many americans even president bush say they welcome japanese 
investment here and no one denies that many japanese are still 
more mad for the west than mad at it japanese companies still pay 
out monstrous fees for endorsements by such american celebrities as 
michael jackson who are rarely if ever seen in us ads most 
japanese cigarettes and many other products bear english names like 
peace and seven stars giving them the kind of cachet that 
frenchsounding brands once had for americans earlier in the 
century 
in february japanese foreign minister taro nakayama in an 
apparent reference to recent polls worried that some americans 
are expressing the view that the economic threat from japan is more 
serious than the military threat from the soviet union 
the big problem underlying such a fear he said is that 
it is impossible to guess where japans huge economic power is 
headed and under what philosophy or principles 
what we need is to make further efforts to convey our views 
and way of thinking clearly to americans 
accordingly kokusaika or internationalization has become 
the official rage in japan the government for example has 
proposed tax breaks for companies that increase imports to japan or 
make donations in the united states 
most japanese companies have rooted themselves in america as 
successfully as their products and more successfully than their 
european competitors according to a survey released last year by 
columbia universitys school of business 
the study found that on average japanese firms in the united 
states have outperformed european competitors in terms of low 
absentee rates low manager turnover and high product quality 
among other criteria 
in addition recent polls have found that while mistrust is on 
the rise a majority of americans still have favorable feelings 
toward japan 
so trade frictions aside whats wrong 
for one thing many japan observers contend that at the level of 
top management at least americanization of japaneseowned 
firms in the united states is just window dressing a commercial 
ploy like the marketing of christmas in tokyo department stores 
where few shoppers are christian 
while japans famed workerparticipation techniques such as 
quality circles may work on the factory floor american managers 
of japanese subsidiaries are still under the yoke of a shadow 
system of command from tokyo some experts say 
according to the first systematic survey of american managers in 
japanese corporations released last fall by the university of 
michigan most are excluded from planning and decisionmaking 
inside the companies and have little access to strategic 
information 
under the twotiered japanese employment system japanese 
managers do a three to fiveyear rotation abroad when they return 
to japan they are typically replaced by another japanese executive 
from overseas rather than the americans who have worked alongside 
them this has led to resentment among many american managers 
in addition the michigan study found that women and minorities 
still suffer widespread discrimination by japanese companies 
minoltas kusumoto who has been in the united states more than 
20 years and recently published a book on his experiences my 
bridge to america asks that americans be patient and recognize 
that japans tightly knit society can unravel itself only so fast 
many japanese are hesitant to disclose secrets to americans 
he says we came from companies with socalled lifetime 
employment we have complete trust in an employee because we know 
hes going to stay but here many people come and go and we think 
maybe hell give secrets to a competitor 
kusumoto says that only recently have he and other japanese 
executives felt strongly enough of the loyalty of longstanding 
american employees to promote them to top positions 
its not racial he says its a matter of trust

anger over the us trade deficit is fed by a 
growing belief in washington that japan once seen as a junior 
partner recreated in our image after world war ii has been playing 
by its own rules 
in his muchdiscussed 1988 book trading places clyde 
prestowitz a japan expert and former commerce department trade 
negotiator contends the japanese have always identified national 
security with economic security 
while america has been preoccupied fighting the cold war to 
the benefit of allies such as japan japan has taken our trusting 
freetraders for a ride prestowitz says 
unlike us policymakers hostile to direct government support 
of business japans powerful bureaucracy has generously subsidized 
its key industries in an exportatallcosts drive for global 
supremacy in consumer electronics automobiles and other important 
industries 
unlike us policymakers concerned mostly about keeping 
consumer prices low and thus markets open resourcepoor japan 
has subtly but effectively closed many of its markets to foreign 
imports how else but through waves of unanswered exports could the 
japanese pay for their raw materials 
the familiar pattern the prestowitz school says was to force 
leading us companies to license their technology to japan by 
refusing them initial market entry there then using the 
technology they built japanese counterparts while protracting 
openmarket negotiations in the timehonored japanese manner 
prestowitz notes that in other countries particularly in 
europe trade restrictions are also the norm something thats all 
the more forbidding considering the consolidation of the 320 
millionconsumer market of the european community planned for 1992 
with the prospects of eastern europe joining in 
american leaders show an amazing myopia prestowitz said in 
a recent interview at the moment in our dealing with japan and 
rest of the world our objective is to obtain some kind of utopian 
free trade to achieve that we effectively insist that everyone 
change their societies to become like ours when we were the big 
guy on the block accounting for half the worlds gnp we had a big 
stick 
these days we have a begging cup in our hand and people dont 
really need to pay attention to us 
prestowitzs answer and that of a growing number of supporters 
is if you cant beat em join em they say the government needs 
to manage trade in technologies critical to the sources of 
waning us strength such as semiconductors and to adopt 
industrial policies to bolster them as an example prestowitz 
points to the strict tabs kept on international airline service and 
banking 
to bush administration officials however prestowitzs 
conclusion smacks of heresy raising the bugaboo of protectionism 
their response is to lay on more openmarket pressure 
the administration is absolutely committed to the freetrade 
principles weve followed for the last 40 years says j michael 
farren undersecretary for international trade in the commerce 
department moving toward managed trade will undermine the 
entire world trading system as we know it 
but farren concedes that other countries are looking to japans 
model 
japan is running the risk of spreading the contagion of closed 
markets to the rest of world he says

if dealmaking really is art then the bidding 
for bonwit teller was the aesthetic equivalent of finger painting 
a bankruptcy court hearing monday turned into a corporate casbah 
as attorneys frantically arranged offers for the failed department 
store chain not over the typical wall street power lunch but 
within earshot of a federal judge 
deals came together fell apart and came together again bidders 
changed sides a dramatic 11thhour proposal by a wouldbe savior 
failed a lawyer played auctioneer as two sides upped offers 1 
million at a pop waiting for the opposition to crumble 
i need 250 thousand from each of you and i need it now 
implored donald n david a lawyer representing dealmaster donald 
trump to members of a group bidding on five of the 16 bonwit 
department stores 
david got an icy stare from one participant who refused to 
raise his ante a representative of trump whose eponymous gold 
tower on fifth avenue houses bonwits flagship store and two 
other groups contributed the difference the deal lived 
bankruptcy court is becoming a home away from home for american 
big business in the 1990s as companies stumble under the weight of 
junk bonds and other takeover and expasionrelated problems in the 
1980s the decade of debt a new era of restructuring means more 
unusual proceedings like the one monday in which about 200 people 
mostly lawyers crammed into a steamy bankruptcy courtroom 
overlooking new york harbor 
amid shouting cajoling the toot of the staten island ferry and 
pounding of a jackhammer six floors below bonwits was carved into 
pieces lawyers constantly pleaded for another minute as they 
huddled to cut a deal 
most unusual was that the nearly 10hour ordeal took place in 
open court where judges rarely tolerate more than one person 
speaking at a time always deferentially let alone protests and 
open outcry bidding 
ive never seen anything like it before david of the new 
york firm dreyer amp traub said tuesday i think if it werent for 
that informality they wouldnt have raised anywhere near the amount 
of money they did for the estate 
lj hooker corp bonwits atlantabased parent held the 
auction to boost the liquidation value of the upscale store chain 
it bought three years ago hooker had received just one bid for 
five stores prior to the auction 
on monday the take for hooker creditors rose by millions also 
some of the stores may survive 
a first round of bidding included offers from a french retailer 
a florida department store a buffalo chain a canadian investor 
and a group that included trump and the womens apparel store the 
limited 
as the second round began the trump group booted the limited 
and embraced pyramid cos a syracuse nybased shopping mall 
developer and owner that already had made the preauction 
fivestore bid 
when it became apparent the group needed to raise its 2025 
million offer or lose out to a possible combination of other bids 
the haggling intensified david an energetic bearded man with a 
thick new york accent hustled about a station of about 15 lawyers 
and businessmen seeking more money 
he got it in 20 minutes the bid rose by 15 million 
collapsing once in the process 
meantime the court looked more like sothebys when two bidders 
battled for a bonwit store in exclusive palm beach fla lawyers 
for frances brewster inc a florida retailer and ralph hibbard a 
canadian investor called bids from opposite sides of the 
courtroom raising the price to 22 million from 16 million 
sounds like an auction bankruptcy judge tina brozman said 
to laughter 
after the hibbard group conceded hooker lawyer sheldon hirshon 
serving as impromptu auctioneer said going once going 
twice 
the final drama was provided by the days hopedfor white 
knight hooker lawyers had wanted to preserve the bonwits chain 
in the morning they announced that a group led by bonwits exceo 
william ruben was planning a bid for 13 stores in the 
midafternoon they said the deal was off 
around 630 pm lawyers told the judge it was on again ruben 
showed up in court and told reporters his 36 million bid could 
make bonwit viable again all he needed was one day to arrange 
financing 
furious david said reopening the bidding would violate an 
agreement and make a fool out of everybody here hooker 
attorneys eventually acquiesced fearing they could lose all bids 
if the ruben group collapsed 
attorney alan hyman said hooker decided to resort to the heady 
and cerebral theory that a bird in the hand was worth two in the 
bush david an hour after pacing angrily and saying its 
off gave associates two thumbs up

opec nations held oil production steady 
in march but remained more than a million barrels a day above their 
selfimposed supply cap according to estimates released tuesday 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries pumped a total 
of about 237 million barrels a day in march the same as in the 
previous month according to the parisbased international energy 
agency 
sales of opec crude oil in march were believed to be lower than 
production due to apparent excess supply of heavy sour grades and 
weaker than expected demand from refiners the group stated 
private analysts predicted the cartel would increase output even 
more this month 
it seems it will go up in april maybe to as much as 24 
million barrels a day said pierre terzian editor of the 
parisbased newsletter petrostrategies 
leading the surge in last months production were saudi arabia 
kuwait the united arab emirates and nigeria according to the 
international energy agencys monthly oil market report all were 
estimated to be above the individual quotas the cartel set for each 
country last year and reaffirmed at a recent meeting in vienna 
the organization imposed a cartelwide ceiling of 221 million 
barrels a day for production in the first half of 1990 to help 
support a price of 18 a barrel but members led by kuwait and the 
united arab emirates have been cheating on their quotas 
oil prices soared in early january but have been gradually 
slipping since then falling in early march below 18 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the 
agency was 1733 a barrel in the last week of march down from 
1747 the previous week 
prices of west texas intermediate the key american grade have 
ranged from 20 to 22 a barrel during that time 
in an effort to keep prices firm opec oil ministers met last 
month and issued a fresh call for restraint by all nations in the 
normally weak apriljune quarter 
analysts say that if the cartel keeps production high prices 
will weaken in the coming months 
demand for crude normally slumps in the second quarter when 
spring weather warms the united states and other consuming nations 
the international energy agency predicted demand for opec oil at 
204 million barrels a day in the current quarter 
analysts argue that some of the producers particularly kuwait 
want prices to stay at the 18 level so the cartel does not lose 
market share to other oilproducing nations high prices will 
prompt other suppliers to pump more 
according to the oil market report saudi arabia the worlds 
no 1 oil exporter pumped 56 million barrels a day in march 
above its quota of 54 million barrels 
iran and iraq were about at their quotas of 31 million barrels 
a day 
the united arab emirates produced some 2 million barrels a day 
about double its supply cap kuwaits output was estimated at 18 
million barrels a day above its limit of 15 million barrels 
nigeria supplied about 18 million barrels a day up from its 
quota of 16 million barrels 
other production estimates for march were libya 13 million 
barrels a day algeria 800000 barrels gabon 300000 barrels 
venezuela 19 million barrels ecuador 300000 barrels and 
indonesia 13 million barrels 
the international energy agency is an arm of the organization 
for economic cooperation and development made up of two dozen 
industrialized nations

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
mostly higher tuesday on the chicago board of trade amid 
speculative buying centered in the corn and wheat markets 
the late rally in the grains spilled over into soybean trading 
reversing a slide that had threatened to extend the sharp losses 
posted monday when soybean futures plunged as much as 11 cents a 
bushel 
brokerage houses and independent floor traders did most of the 
buying while commercial grain dealers were net sellers on the day 
said victor lespinasse a floor trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
he linked the rally to rumors of new soviet purchases of us 
corn and to expectations for a seasonal advance in prices as the 
1990 growing season begins 
grain and soybean futures typically rise early in the growing 
season as traders focus on weather conditions and the potential for 
crop damage 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 5 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in may at 361 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with may at 266 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cent higher with may at 152 a 
bushel soybeans were cent to 2 cents higher with may at 585 
a bushel

the heads of the big three tv networks complained 
tuesday that cable television had several profitable advantages 
over them although the chief of thirdplace cbs said his company 
had no plans to develop cable ventures as the other two had 
chief executive officers thomas murphy of abc laurence tisch of 
cbs and robert wright of nbc each told the national association of 
broadcasters that one expensive factor affecting the networks was 
regulations enabling them to lock up shows for only four years 
after the fouryear period the networks end up paying huge sums 
to production studios to retain shows that had become hits 
nbc just bought a seventh year of the cosby show at a 
reported 50 million the most expensive renewal in tv history 
were in the worst of all worlds tisch said we are 
allowed to lose money if it doesnt work but not allowed to make 
any money if it does work 
with network costs soaring and advertising revenue sluggish 
while competing cable channels are reaping revenue from advertising 
and subscriber fees we have to develop other revenue streams 
wright said 
he said ratings indicate the majority of tv viewers still are 
watching the big three networks but theyre nevertheless paying 
for cable tv none of us get any of that money wright said 
broadcasters are asking congress to make cable companies pay for 
carrying broadcast television programming 
abc and nbc are in the cable tv business abc by ownership of 
espn and lifetime and nbc with its cnbc cable channel but cbs 
has no such ventures 
i think we missed the boat perhaps tisch said maybe we 
should have been in the business 10 or 12 years ago 
but i cant picture cbs developing a cable network that could 
be profitable and im not in the mood to bang my head against the 
wall for 10 years the only thing a new toy would do is assure 
that we stay in third place forever if were going to succeed 
well succeed as free broadcasters 
murphy said abc was fortunate that its cable ventures 
particularly espn were well established 
cbs meanwhile has spent billions of dollars for network sports 
programming including new contracts with major league baseball and 
the national football league 
financially its not a gamble tisch said we need the 
sports support i think the advertisers will be there 
murphy said abc did not give up on sports we got outbid we 
decided wed rather put our money on series programming 
in response to questioning tisch said there was no instability 
at cbs sports despite the sudden sacking of top sportscaster brent 
musburger on sunday 
the dumping of musburger and his reported 2 million salary by 
thirdplace cbs wasnt a message tisch said it was an 
individual negotiation which didnt work out 
earlier tuesday federal communications commission chairman 
alfred sikes told the broadcasters he supports selfregulation of 
radio and television but he pledged not to permit regulatory 
neglect when rules and practices hamper competition 
getting agreement on standards of broadcast content will be 
difficult he said but the public will demand them and the 
question is who will act to set them

gold futures prices rose sharply tuesday in a burst of middle 
eastern buying possibly by some of the same investors whose sale 
last week of at least a million ounces of the metal triggered a 
collapse in prices to 4month lows 
on other commodity markets copper futures climbed strongly 
cocoa futures surged grains and soybeans advanced oil futures 
were mixed and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 550 to 590 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 
37530 a troy ounce silver futures finished 6 cents to 64 cents 
higher with april at 5007 a troy ounce 
analysts said heavy buying of gold bullion occurred overnight in 
tokyo and london sparking rumors that saudi investors were buying 
back at a profit some of the gold they were believed to have sold 
on march 26 for british pounds 
observers were divided on how much gold was purchased but they 
agreed that it appeared to be less than the huge amount sold last 
week when investors around the world jumped on the bandwagon and 
dumped an estimated 2 million ounces of bullion onto the market 
analyst james steel of refco inc in new york said the saudis 
may have bought only 25000 ounces and appeared to have sold no 
british pounds which cast doubt on speculation that a reversal of 
last weeks move was in the works 
but george millingstanley first vice president in charge of 
bullion sales for shearson lehman hutton inc said the parties who 
started last weeks selloff had reversed a good chunk of their 
sales what had not occurred he said was followthrough buying 
tuesday by us and far eastern investors 
analysts agreed the market was likely to remain jittery and that 
a rally back above 400 an ounce was unlikely without substantial 
buying by the japanese who have been largely absent from the gold 
market for the past two months 
its going to take some volume buying by somebody or other and 
it could very well be the asians said millingstanley 
copper futures surged late in the session on sketchy reports of 
a mudslide in chile one of the worlds largest copperproducing 
countries 
copper settled 25 cents to 385 cents higher on the commodity 
exchange with april at 1274 a troy ounce 
cocoa futures leaped as much as 52 a ton on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange on technically inspired buying after two 
days of lower prices 
cocoa settled 48 to 52 higher with may at 1215 per ton 
most grain and soybean futures rose on the chicago board of 
trade amid speculative buying centered in the corn and wheat 
markets 
the late rally in the grains spilled over into soybean trading 
reversing a slide that had threatened to extend the sharp losses 
posted monday when soybean futures plunged as much as 11 cents a 
bushel 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 5 cents higher with may 
at 361 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 
266 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cent higher with may at 
152 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with may 
at 586 a bushel 
energy futures mostly declined on the new york mercantile 
exchange ahead of the american petroleum institutes weekly 
inventories report the report showed a greaterthanexpected 
increase of 43 million barrels of us crudeoil stocks last week 
a largerthanexpected decline of 71 million barrels of gasoline

cable television pioneer ted turner on tuesday 
said cable tvs competitors and not cable subscribers are 
responsible for rallying efforts to impose more regulations on the 
cable industry 
the chairman and president of turner broadcasting system inc 
also said he opposed the heavy investment being made in developing 
expensive high definition television while half the world still 
doesnt have television at all 
before the rich world pigs out on a 3000 television set that 
is only slightly better maybe we ought to furnish the people in the 
world with black and white sets turner said 
he also said his companys talks on possible ventures with cbs 
inc have run into blind alleys but are continuing 
addressing the annual conference of the advertising research 
foundation turner was asked whether he thought customer complaints 
about price increases or service were driving recent proposals to 
reregulate the cable tv industry 
turner said it was neither and said surveys have shown the 
vast majority of cable subscribers are perfectly happy with their 
cable service 
he said broadcasters the motion picture industry and 
independent television are whipping washington into a frenzy 
because they are really scared to death of cable now i think 
thats most of it 
turners atlantabased company produces the cable news network 
headline news and turner network television as well as the 
superstation wtbs its owners include some of the major cable tv 
system operators 
in his speech to the researchers turner said the globalization 
of communications has contributed to efforts to outlaw most 
whaling save the african elephants and tear down the iron curtain 
in eastern europe 
he said that in 10 years there would not be a single 
dictatorship or totalitarian state in the world 
in a question and answer session he was asked about the 
development of hdtv a technology that will make television 
pictures much sharper 
turner said he was against it because half the people in the 
world dont have a television set half the people in the world 
dont have electricity 
he said hdtv would also make the trade deficit with japan larger 
because they will be made in japan you wait and see all of 
them 
turner was asked about reports that he is trying to reach a 
cooperation agreement with cbs inc the operator of the cbs 
television network and a company he once tried to acquire 
he noted cbs and his company already have reached a deal on 
providing coverage of the winter olympics 
we may do something else one of these days but its not 
easy turner said he said the cbs news department is not too 
enthusiastic about doing anything with us but top management i 
think is 
we are exploring a number of things but we have run into a 
number of blind alleys so far we are having fun and we are 
talking he said

groups votes against the companys reorganization plan 
the company said monday it had received the necessary twothirds 
majority vote from all classes of its creditors and shareholders 
except the senior secured bank class and the senior unsecured class 
the vote fell short in those categories because of negative 
votes cast by japonica partners and its affiliates allegheny

japonica partners is competing with allegheny internationals 
management to take over the pittsburghbased company 
the company said it will file suit in us bankruptcy court to 
disallow the votes of japonica and its affiliates saying it 
questions their motives in rejecting the plan 
ai is pressing forward to have its plan of reorganization 
confirmed chairman oliver s travers said 
japonica responded with a statement saying we believe there 
is no basis whatsoever for excluding the votes of any allegheny 
constituent who voted against managements plan and that any 
attempt by management to resuscitate its failed plan will not 
be successful 
management reorganization plan is worth about 687 million and 
would pay off creditors and shareholders with stock in a

carl icahn said tuesday his plan to break up 
usx corp into separate energy and steel businesses would be worth 
a third more than the companys current market value 
in a letter to other usx investors a shareholders committee led 
by the new york investor estimated the value of the plan at 48 a 
share including 39 a share for usxs marathon oil co subsidiary 
and 9 a share for its us steel unit 
usx stock closed at 3712 tuesday up 150 a share on the new 
york stock exchange icahn claimed his plan would boost shareholder 
value by 35 percent based on mondays closing stock price of 
3562 a share 
icahn who owns 1329 percent of usx or about 34 million 
shares has asked the companys 144000 shareholders to approve a 
plan to spin off at least 80 percent of us steel to existing 
shareholders with the remaining 20 percent going to new investors 
the spinoff company would assume no more than 15 billion of the 
steel divisions longterm debt 
usx management has opposed the plan saying it would make 
marathon and us steel more vulnerable to slumps in either the 
energy or steel industries usx bought marathon in the early 1980s 
as a cushion against cyclical swings in the steel business 
usx has said 65 percent of its revenues come from marathon 
while 31 percent come from steel operations 
icahn said in the letter that usx could properly structure the 
breakup to make it essentially taxfree to the company and its 
stockholders the plan would preserve net operating losses of usx 
he said 
usx chairman charles corry recently told wall street analysts 
that icahns plan would cause tax difficulties because the company 
could lose tax credits resulting from steel losses in the early 
1980s 
the stockholders will cast nonbinding votes on icahns proposal 
may 7 at marathon oils headquarters in findlay ohio 
icahn the chairman of trans world airlines inc is joined on 
his stockholders committee by twa vice chairman alfred kingsley and 
mcdep associates inc chairman kurt wulff 
icahn said he based the 48ashare figure on analyses by the 
committee and by mcdep

mca inc film chief thomas pollock was given 
mca stock worth 57 million in 1989 and stock options worth 78 
million when issued last august according to proxy material 
shareholders received this week 
pollock also was paid a base salary of 627000 last year 
bringing his total compensation to more than 14 million his 
salary was raised to 850000 this year 
sidney sheinberg president of the universal citybased movie 
tv music and theme park giant was issued stock worth 72 million 
last year and his salary jumps to 900000 this year from 729000 
in 1989 mca chairman lew wassermans salary also jumps to 900000 
from 559000 
the figures were contained in proxy material sent out in advance 
of the companys annual meeting may 8 in chicago among other 
things the material asks shareholders to approve a new stock 
option plan under which pollock was given his options 
the plan authorizes the issuance of 5 million new shares 
600000 of which would become available to pollock at 55 a share 
over the next five years he may exercise 20 percent of the options 
once a year beginning this july 
mcas stock was trading at 68 a share when they were awarded 
last august it has since fallen in value closing at 5050 on the 
new york stock exchange tuesday at that level pollock would lose 
money by exercising his options 
mcas last stock option plan was approved in 1968 but never 
exercised the company said the new plan was needed to provide 
competitive compensation for mca executives 
that was a reference to outfits like walt disney co whose 
chairman president frank wells made 724 million on the sale of 
stock bought through options in 1989 
also in the material mca urged a no vote on a shareholders 
proposal calling for no more mca productions such as last years 
martin scorsese movie the last temptation of christ 
some religious groups objected that the movie depicted jesus as 
weak confused and lustful 
the supporting statement for the proposal says jesus is shown as 
a disturbed man who frequents brothels hallucinates seeing 
snakes vows that he always tells lies and acts only as a result of 
fear says that he sins a lot and asks forgiveness from a 
prostitute and feels tormented by god 
the proposal made by dean shahinian of alexandria va calls 
for all shareholders to censure mca for antichristian effects 
we urge management to establish a corporate policy not to use 
corporate assets to falsely defame jesus christ or other major 
religious leaders it says 
in opposing the proposal mca said censoring a film because it 
contains an unconventional religious viewpoint could stifle 
religious and creative expression 
noting that scorsese won a best director oscar nomination for 
temptation mca said the film was scorseses interpretation of 
a novel not the companys view of christ 
the democratic way is to discuss to debate mca said

dallas two newspapers went to court tuesday in a 
fight over syndicated comic strips and columns the latest twist in 
a bitter competition between the two dailies that cover the 
nations eighth largest city 
the dallas times herald is seeking at least 33 million in 
actual damages for what it considers a grab for monopoly by the 
dallas morning news and its parent ah belo corp 
the purchase of the syndicated features is not something done 
in an open competitive way times herald attorney frank jones 
told jurors during opening statements we think it was done in a 
way to destroy newspaper competition in dallas texas we think 
this is a case of preserving competition of newspapers in dallas 
county 
we think the evidence will show total arrogance and disregard 
by the dallas morning news jones said 
lawyers for the morning news countered that the paper was just 
competing and was willing to pay more for the contested features 
the only thing is we went out and competed with them for 
these features and paid a better price said harry reasoner an 
attorney for belo did we go out and pay a better price you 
betcha did we tortiously interfere and violate the law no 
at issue is a joint venture belo formed last year with universal 
press syndicate inc to develop syndicate features for television 
use 
part of their agreement was that universal press invoke a clause 
in its contract with the times herald allowing it to break off 
service the times herald lost 26 features distributed by universal 
press including dear abby erma bombeck and doonesbury 
the times herald contends the deal violates antitrust laws the 
morning news maintains its just fair competition 
testimony was scheduled to begin wednesday and the trial is 
expected to last more than a month 
in addition to actual damages the times herald is seeking 
unspecified punitive damages from its larger rival 
times herald attorney wayne fisher told prospective jurors that 
anticompetitive practices in the dallas media market threatened to 
drive the times herald out of business and could inflate the value 
of the morning news by as much as 500 million 
the morning news attracts about 60 percent of newspaper 
advertising and circulation in dallas court documents show 
its important to see if the dallas morning news can get away 
with the conduct theyve been getting away with over the past 
year fisher said if they do the dangerous possibility is the 
dallas times herald will not survive or the dallas morning news may 
get what the law calls monopoly power 
what the times herald is telling you is they would not like 
the morning news to compete for these features countered william 
sims an attorney for the morning news they dont want to up the 
ante and thats not what competition is all about we have the 
right to compete for these features 
the lawsuit is the latest legal salvo in the papers prolonged 
battle which in the past focused on challenging circulation 
features 
as a result of the universal belo joint venture the times 
herald also is asking the federal communications commission to 
revoke the license of belos wfaatv the toprated television 
station in dallas
