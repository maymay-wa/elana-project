the national peoples congress on saturday named 
as premier li peng a cautious reformer whose foster father held 
the post for 27 years and gave its approval to a program to cut 
bureaucracy 
li 59 has been acting premier since november when zhao ziyang 
gave up the post to become communist party chief 
on sunday members of an advisory body elected outgoing 
president li xiannian to its largely ceremonial post of chairman 
li 78 succeeds deng yingchao the 84yearold widow of premier 
chou enlai as head of the chinese peoples political consultative 
conference other past conference chairmen were mao tsetung chou 
and senior leader deng xiaoping 
the former president the only candidate was elected by 1839 
members attending the final day of the conferences annual session 
held in conjunction with the national peoples congress 
li peng was the only congress candidate for premier but 
delegates were told they could write in their own choice on the 
ballots there were no reports of how many did if any 
the premier is responsible for the daytoday operations of the 
government while the party leader controls the direction of 
government policies 
li is the adopted son of chou one of chinas most beloved 
communist officials a moscoweducated technocrat li has 
previously been vice premier and minister of education and industry 
during the voting delegates rushed to take pictures of each 
other depositing the pink and orange ballots into large ballot 
boxes set up throughout the main conference hall 
one delegate voted against the reorganization of state 
ministries and toplevel commissions which was approved by a show 
of hands of the 2877 delegates in the great hall of the people 
two delegates abstained 
a key part of the reorganization plan the merger of chinas 
railway and communications ministries and national airline was 
abruptly dropped before the vote officials said some delegates had 
objected to it but gave no details 
the delegates also cast ballots for vice chairmen of the state 
central military commission and top judicial posts 
there was no sign of chinas senior leader the 84yearold 
deng who is a delegate and appeared at fridays session no 
official explanation was given 
ninetytwo ordinary delegates were also absent 
the government permitted foreign reporters to watch the voting 
from a balcony but asked them to leave before the results were 
announced 
the congress on friday elected gen yang shangkun president and 
former vice premier wan li to head the congress standing committee 
in five months as acting premier li peng has indicated he 
favors moving cautiously in introducing marketstyle economic 
reforms zhao in contrast has emphasized quick implementation 
in his speech to the congress when its session opened march 25 
li strongly endorsed the reform goals of deng and zhao but warned 
against rushing headlong into mass action or being too 
impatient for quick results 
in other voting zhao was elected vice chairman of the state 
central military commission under deng as chairman yang shangkun 
stayed on as permanent vice chairman 
zhao has no military experience and the post is seen as an 
opportunity for him to gain the support in the military he will 
need if he is to succeed deng as chinas top leader 
six members of the military commission also were elected 
including qin jiwei head of the beijing military command who is 
expected to be named defense minister 
ren jianxin vice president of the supreme peoples court was 
promoted to president replacing zheng tianxiang 
liu fuzhi 71 a former minister of justice and minister of 
public security was elected the nations top prosecutor 
the government reorganization approved saturday calls for 
splitting several existing ministries and combining others 
reducing the total number from 45 to 41 among the major changes 
the current planning and economic commissions will be merged into a 
powerful body directing chinas economic and social development 
strategies 
the cancellation of plans to merge the railways and civil 
aviation administration of china the national flag carrier came 
as a suprise not only because of its abruptness but because te 
railways ministry was regarded as a prime target of reform 
the train system chinas main means of longdistance travel 
has failed to expand as quickly as demand and has been criticized 
for chronic mismanagement and sloppy operating procedures four 
fatal train accidents this year claiming a total of 168 lives 
created a clamor for improved safety measures 
the congress is expected next week to approve ministerial 
appointments and vote on several key laws including one that would 
guarantee business people more freedom from government interference 
it also is expected to approve a constitutional amendment 
legitimizing chinas small but growing private sector

the hijackers of a kuwaiti jumbo jet with 
53 people aboard threw the body of one captive from the plane 
saturday and threatened to kill more unless the plane was refueled 
government officials said 
the hijackers later freed a sick passenger the 58th person 
released from the 112 who were aboard when the plane was seized 
tuesday there are believed to be at least six hijackers 
in a statement sunday the hijackers threatened a slow and 
quiet massacre if their demands for refueling and the release of 
17 terrorists from kuwait were not met one of the hijackers 
radioed that they plan to take the jet to kuwait according to 
airport officials 
and if kuwait refuses us a crash landing will take place on 
the princes palace one hijacker radioed the control tower 
referring to the ruling emir of the oilrich state 
the hijacker said the jet must be refueled sunday 
a senior palestine liberation organization official met four 
times with the hijackers saturday raising hopes of a breakthrough 
in the deadlocked negotiations 
the kuwait airways boeing 747 was hijacked on a flight from 
bangkok to kuwait and forced to land in mashhad in northeastern 
iran where 57 people were released it left iran friday and landed 
in larnaca after being refused permission to land in lebanon and 
syria 
cypriot officials identified the slain man as a security guard 
on the airliner but the kuwait news agency said the victim was one 
of three military men returning from a vacation in thailand 
the agency quoted unidentified officials as saying the released 
man is a 32yearold kuwaiti shiite moslem named fadel 
abdelrassoul leeri a kuwaiti of that name was listed as a 
passenger 
cypriot government spokesman akis fantis said the mans release 
was a sign of goodwill by the hijackers 
soon after his release officials at the airport near larnaca 
said the hijackers radioed the tower with an english statement 
reiterating their demand that kuwait free 17 proiran terrorists 
all but one a shiite moslem convicted there for a chain of 
bombings in 1983 
the remaining passengers are believed to be arabs including 
three members of kuwaits extensive royal family 
cypriot officials said negotiations between the hijackers and 
the kuwaitis had stalemated saturday with the hijackers 
demanding fuel so they can leave and the kuwaitis insisting this 
must not happen 
but about three hours after the killing the plos deputy 
director in cyprus malaz abdo and two cypriot officials were 
driven to the plane parked at the eastern end of the beachside 
runway they held a series of talks with the hijackers but no 
details of the negotiations were released 
cyprus television reported that the hijackers first proposed 
releasing five passengers in exchange for fuel and the aircrafts 
departure then proposed releasing half the passengers for about 
half the 17 terrorists held in kuwait 
it said the hijackers later offered to release half the 
passengers in exchange for the three terrorists facing death 
sentences in kuwait with the remaining passengers to be freed when 
the release of the terrorists was confirmed cypriot authorities 
at the insistence of kuwaiti officials rejected the proposals 
according to the television report 
in london the sunday telegraph quoted military sources as 
saying a 35member special british military unit was flown to 
cyprus friday night to support a possible cypriotled rescue 
mission londons sunday express reported britain flew in special 
surveillance equipment to monitor activity aboard the jet 
britians foreign office only would say it was in touch with 
authorities in cyprus and cypriot officials stressed that the 
government has not requested british military assistance 
at a news conference in moscow plo chief yasser arafat said he 
would try to help resolve the crisis at the request of kuwait but 
he added the policy of the plo is completely against these kinds 
of events no palestinian has been involved in this 
the plo is fighting for a palestinian homeland in the middle 
east 
saturdays slaying the first in the fiveday ordeal came two 
minutes after a deadline set by the hijackers for the cypriots to 
provide fuel 
the mans body his hands tied was tossed out of the airplane 
door onto the tarmac an ambulance drove to the plane medics put 
the body on a stretcher and it drove away 
a government spokesman said the man was shot three times in the 
head and had a broken neck it was not clear if the neck injury 
resulted from the fall 
the shooting came a few hours after the pilot reported that the 
hijackers began beating passengers because the cypriots had not 
given them fuel 
the hijackers told the larnaca tower earlier saturday that six 
of their captives aboard were sick they did not elaborate 
it was not known exactly how many hijackers there are 
a palestinian stewardess released by the hijackers said saturday 
she thinks there were seven air pirates all with blond hair and 
fair skin and speaking arabic with a lebanese accent commenting at 
cairo international airport she said each hijacker was armed with 
a pistol and the apparent leader had at least one hand grenade 
he threatened to blow up the airplane if anyone resisted she 
said 
passengers released in iran tuesday and wednesday told officials 
in kuwait there were as many as 10 
the identities and nationalities of the hijackers are not known

vehicle traffic linking japans four main islands by bridge and 
tunnel for the first time 
prime minister noboru takeshita called the longawaited opening 
of the 786mile bridge a proud achievement 
because support columns for the bridge sit on five small islands 
it is difficult to compare the seto ohashi with other bridges the

world is huey p long bridge in metairie la the railroad section 
is 435 miles long

californian symbol 
the seto ohashi cost 9 billion and took 10 years to build 
yasutoshi kunisue spokesman of the governmentowned 
honshushikoku bridge authority said about 60 trains and 25000 
cars were expected to cross the bridge daily 
kunisue said the minimum toll for passenger cars of 44 each way 
would enable authorities to recover the cost of the bridge in 30 
years 
takeshita told about 800 officials at the opening ceremony that 
we can proud of this achievement for future genrations 
honshu was connected with the northernmost main island of 
hokkaido last month when the 346mile seikan undersea tunnel

southernmost main island of kyushu since 1942

right to express their view 
the reporter said the protesters were just sitting there 
quietly with a small sign in chinese and english saying we want 
more money for education 
the sitin began at about 1 pm and ended about 230 pm when 
the group apparently left on its own he said it attracted only a 
small crowd in the huge square jammed with chinese enjoying the 
warm weather and flying kites 
the protest capped a week of complaints from students that the 
government is not investing enough money in education 
both the nonpolitical tone of the protests and the mild 
official response is in sharp contrast to the nationwide student 
protests in the winter of 198687 when students issued sweeping 
calls for democracy and the state responded by jailing student 
leaders 
in a rare report of dissent in china the official xinhua news 
agency mentioned the student sitin but specified that the demands 
were in line with comments made in the past two weeks by delegates 
to the national peoples congress and chinese peoples political 
consultative conference 
the national peoples congress chinas legislature and the 
consultative conference an advisory body are holding their annual 
sessions in beijing 
delegates at both have stressed the need for more attention to 
education and for higher salaries for teachers and other 
intellectuals who generally are paid less than factory workers 
xinhua said the sitin participants came from beijing 
university qinghua university and beijing teachers university 
the xinhua report quoted officials as saying funds for education 
would increase 122 percent this year over last and that the state 
had made a big effort to budget money for education at a time 
when the country has many financial difficulties 
the 1988 budget report to the national peoples congress said 
the state would spend 12 billion on education culture science 
and public health but did not give a separate education figure 
spending for the four areas would amount to 17 percent of the total 
712 billion budget

katutura southwest africa ap archbishop desmond tutu 
preached sunday in the territorys largest black township derided 
its multiracial government and renewed his call for independence 
from south africa 
tutu gave his sermon to about 1500 people many in the red 
green and blue colors of the southwest africa peoples 
organization a guerrilla group fighting for independence 
the congregation had gathered to hear tutu the first black 
leader of the anglican church in southern africa in a church near 
windhoek capital of the territory commonly known as namibia 
god is here with you in namibia he suffers with you said 
tutu he says it is going to be all right because i am the god 
of justice i am the god of liberation 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize lamented last weeks 
moves by south african president pw botha to broaden power of his 
countrys chief representative in namibia 
botha said administratorgeneral louis pienaar will be empowered 
to act against subversive media arrange for regional or 
racially based elections and refer certain major court rulings to 
south africas appellate court 
the archbishop spurned the territorys multiracial interim 
government as echoes of their masters voice 
he was joined at the church sunday by 18 anglican bishops who 
serve under him they included the bishop of namibia who wore a 
leopardskin mitre and bishops from nearby swaziland lesotho and 
neighboring south africa 
women ululated and held their children above their heads for a 
glimpse of tutu the service was held at a roman catholic church 
the largest place of worship in the township of 60000 people 
namibias 13 million people are 88 percent black the rest are 
divided about equally between whites who dominate the economy and 
people of mixed race 
the rebels in the territory have waged a 22yearold largely 
ineffectual war of independence 
on sunday tutu blamed south africas apartheid system for the 
violence 
tutu won his nobel prize for his fight against apartheid which 
establishes a racially segregated society in which south africas 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
we are opposed to all violence especially the violence of the 
evil system of apartheid however it may be disguised by cosmetic 
adjustments tutu said sunday it can survive only because it 
uses evil and immoral methods to defend it 
a sheet of hymns distributed at the church sunday showed 
pictures of detained activists 
but tutu said he opposed violence by both guerrillas and the 
military and he rejected communism as a goal for namibia 
the best defense against communism is a free and contented 
people he said south africa does not want namibia to be 
free 
tutu appealed for pretoria to observe a un resolution calling 
for a south african withdrawal and unsupervised independence 
elections in namibia 
but south africa says it will stay as long as cuban troops 
remain in neighboring angola where they are helping the marxist 
government battle combined forces of south africa and a rebel 
movement

chinas outgoing president li xiannian on sunday 
was elected chairman of the chinese peoples political consultative 
conference an advisory body that functions much like a council of 
elders 
li 78 succeeds deng yingchao the 84yearold widow of premier 
chou enlai other former chairmen are mao tsetung chou and 
current senior leader deng xiaoping 
li the only candidate was elected by the 1839 members 
attending the final day of the bodys annual session 
the conference holds its plenary session parallel with the 
national peoples congress chinas legislature on friday the 
national peoples congress named yang shangkun 81 a general with 
close ties to senior leader deng to succeed li as president 
li is believed to be in frail health and as head of the largely 
powerless advisory body he will be freed from demanding government 
duties while being honored for his long years of service 
li was less enthusiastic about economic reforms than deng or 
communist party chief zhao ziyang the appointment of yang to 
replace him is regarded as further aiding zhaos push to open china 
to the west 
li has spent more than six decades fighting for the chinese 
revolution 
as a teenager he led a peasant uprising against local 
landlords and in 1927 he joined mao tsetungs communist forces 
he was a veteran of the long march the red armys 193435 
epic escape from nationalist troops and later commanded 60000 
soldiers as they fought invading japanese forces

native hubei province before being named vice premier and finance 
minister in 1954 he remained finance minister for the next 25 
years during the 196676 cultural revolution he was criticized 
but unlike most of chinas leaders today escaped being purged or 
persecuted 
he was named chinas president in 1983 
the consultative conference is made up mainly of intellectuals 
and members of approved noncommunist parties its main function is 
to offer advice to the party and the legislature on various 
scientific economic and social issues 
in a closing speech li urged that the conference be given a 
larger role in formulating government policies and that people in 
all walks of life be encouraged to air their views frankly 
he also urged taiwans anticommunist nationalist government to 
take steps toward reuniting the island with mainland china 
the nationalists set up a rival government on taiwan a province 
of china in 1949 after being defeated by the communists in a civil 
war 
taiwan began last year to allow its residents to visit the 
mainland for the first time since 1949 but still refuses to 
discuss reunification 
in addition to li the consulative conference also elected 28 
vice chairmen of the 28 12 are aged 80 or above

after years of silence and antisemitism 
poland is reevaluating its relationship to the jews once the 
countrys largest minority and now mostly a memory in abandoned 
synagogues and forsaken graveyards 
on april 14 poles will begin a weeklong observance of the 45th 
anniversary of the heroic rising of warsaw jews against the nazi 
occupiers 
the commemoration which will bring the largest delegation ever 
from israel follows a rare public selfcriticism issued last month 
by polands communist party about antisemitic purges 20 years ago 
both the warsaw anniversary and the partys selfcriticism have 
rekindled a simmering debate about whether jews and poles who 
lived side by side for most of polands 1000 years of recorded 
history will ever be able to repair their sundered relationship 
poland once was known for its tolerant attitude to the jews 
from the middle ages to the 19th century it guaranteed jews 
legal privileges and limited selfgovernment the polish king was 
regularly prayed for in synagogues around the world 
by the beginning of world war ii polands 35 million jews 
comprised 10 percent of the population the backbone of its middle 
class about 40 percent of warsaw was jewish 
but as a result of the nazi holocaust and subsequent waves of 
emigration the number of jews living in poland today has fallen to 
about 10000 out of a population of 375 million 
a visit to warsaws only synagogue on a saturday morning shows 
just 40 worshipers mostly elderly men there are no rabbis in 
poland 
the 45th anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising the 
monthlong resistance to the nazi drive to liquidate the ghettos 
last 70000 inhabitants is being treated by the government as an 
opportunity to honor polish jews and stress the mutual suffering of 
poles and jews under the nazis 
but the official apology for the 1968 purges is a reminder of 
the persistent strains of antisemitism that have marred 
polishjewish relations through the centuries 
in march trybuna ludu the official newspaper of the polish 
united workers communist party for the first time acknowledged 
that antisemitism was a decisive factor in the 1968 purge and that 
innocent people were harmed 
government spokesman jerzy urban himself of jewish descent 
said in an interview after the party statement that antisemitism 
no longer exists in public life and among the younger generation 
it is practically nonexistent 
but warsaw psychologist kostek gebert a member of a budding 
movement of jews who in recent years have returned to their 
ancestors faith said the official view is too rosy 
polish culture the polish identity is permeated with 
antisemitism and i cant see any imaginable way of this fact being 
corrected gebert said 
the point is that in poland a respectable person can be 
antisemitic he said in other countries he said antisemitism 
is like syphilis you can have it but a gentleman doesnt show it 
off 
during world war ii nearly 3 million polish jews were killed by 
the nazis the death camps of auschwitzbirkenau treblinka 
majdanek belzec chelmo and sobibor were all on what is now polish 
territory 
but although poland was the site of much of the killing most 
poles bridle at the view common outside poland and reflected in 
the french documentary film shoah that poles to some degree 
were accomplices in the holocaust 
the dominant viewpoint here is that both poles and jews were 
victims of the nazis and that poles did what was within their 
power to thwart the tragedy 
indeed of the gentiles honored by israel as righteous among 
nations for assisting jews during the war 1700 were poles more 
than in other country and it was the polish underground that 
smuggled evidence of the existence of the death camps to london 
during the war 
but for all the examples of poles coming to the aid of jews 
examples can be found in recent history of polish cruelty to jews 
europes last pogrom claimed dozens of jewish lives in the 
southern polish city of kielce in 1946 the 1968 purges forced 
13000 jews from the country during the 198081 solidarity labor 
upheaval antisemitic charges were leveled against union activists 
nevertheless there are signs that poland is trying to put away 
its antisemitic legacy 
for the april 19 anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising the 
government is creating a memorial route 
the government is also sprucing up jewish monuments and 
cemeteries around the country and establishing a kosher kitchen for 
the 4500 foreign visitors principally from israel and the united 
states expected for the warsaw anniversary 
reflecting a desire to clarify attitudes about jews in polish 
history about 100 polish scholars attended a meeting of historians 
in jerusalem in early february on the holocaust 
the polish side presented the view that we had not done 
enough and that we must admit that we are guilty of at least the 
sin of indifference towards those who had been condemned said 
historian krystyna kersten describing the conference in the 
underground newspaper tygodnik mazowsze

a washington lawyers legal battles 
for the sandinista government have garnered him a place in 
nicaraguas history his signature on the ceasefire plan to end 
its bloody 6yearold civil war 
paul reichler called the march 23 agreement between the 
government and contra rebels a dream come true and he is 
certain it will meet its goal 
its going to lead to a permanent and lasting peace in 
nicaragua and further democratization of the country he said in 
a weekend interview 
reichlers involvement with the peace process started last 
december when he negotiated for the leftist government in indirect 
talks with the ussupported contra rebels 
the talks complied with the regional peace plan signed last 
august by the presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala 
costa rica and honduras 
president daniel ortega later named reichler a 40yearold 
harvard graduate to help represent the government in unprecedented 
facetoface talks with the contras 
reichler said that by march 23 the third day of the talks at 
the southern border town of sapoa it became obvious an agreement 
would be reached to end the war that has killed more than 40000 
people 
the magic hit we were all caught up in this whirlwind of 
history he said it was like we were being propelled forward 
by a force 
just before midnight on march 23 the armistice was read ortega 
and the sandinista delegation shared a makeshift platform with 
contra leaders and they sang the national anthem 
you had to be a mannequin not to have chills reichler 
recalled it was the kind of thing i dreamed about 
he said he did not know that his name would be on the final 
document and the event was something that choked him up 
i tried to keep a cool head and keep emotions out of it for 
three days and i did but i actually had a hard time writing my 
name i had trouble controlling my hand 
he said he hoped his signature was something his 3yearold 
adopted daughter jessica danielle would treasure she is 
nicaraguan and named in honor of the president 
after the solemn public ceremony the two sides met behind 
closed doors to share congratulations and drinks reichler said 
i remember embracing contra leader alfredo cesar he said 
and if the scene of the stage was dreamlike the scene inside 
drinking and toasting was beyond dreams 
reichler started working as a lawyer for the sandinistas shortly 
after they came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war he spent his 
early months trying to recover assets from ousted president 
anastasio somoza 
reichler argued and won a landmark decision before the 
international court of justice in 1986 for the sandinistas the 
world court whose decisions are nonbinding found the united 
states guilty of violating international law by waging war on 
nicaragua 
he called the decision extremely gratifying but was 
frustrated that it did not stop the war 
reichler said the sandinistas are not totalitarians seeking to 
export a communist revolution as the reagan administration 
maintains 
president reagan does not know daniel ortega i do reichler 
said 
i have never heard marxistleninist rhetoric from them they 
are principled principles not rooted in any ideology they want 
social justice 
asked if he could have been duped by the sandinistas reichler 
responded i have no doubt in my mind that one they are 
prepared to have a democratic system in nicaragua and that they 
not only want normal but friendly relations with the united 
states

supporters of tennis star ivan lendl will try 
to convince congress this month to expedite us citizenship for 
the native of czechoslovakia so he can represent his adopted 
homeland in the summer olympics and other international competition 
congressional aides say chances for lifting the mandatory 
fiveyear waiting period for lendl are slim despite the tennis 
players personal lobbying effort including discussions with vice 
president george bush and sen edward m kennedy dmass 
but supporters say a special bill for a 21yearold 
canadianborn swimmer now living in texas which was pushed through 
congress recently by two texas democrats house speaker jim wright 
and sen lloyd bentsen opens the door for lendl who lives in 
greenwich conn 
both kennedy chairman of the senate judiciary immigration 
subcommittee and his house counterpart rep romano l mazzoli 
dky routinely oppose private bills giving special treatment to 
olympic athletes seeking us citizenship 
if you start down the slippery slope of granting what most 
americans would say is a great right and start making it 
available on demand i think youve eroded a terribly important 
right and obligation and cherished thing under our law said 
jerry tinker a top aide on kennedys subcommittee 
the house subcommittee issued a rule last year warning lawmakers 
against filing a plethora of olympictied immigration bills saying 
that the bills are an extraordinary remedy available only to 
aliens with extreme hardship 
but rep bruce a morrison dconn who has taken up the lendl 
bill following the death of rep stewart b mckinney rconn said 
the door to athletic exemptions has been opened by legislation for 
tracey mcfarlane a university of texas swimmer 
i took the position that i would not ask the subcommittee to 
break the rule it established said morrison a member of the 
panel but fair is fair weve already made an exception on 
behalf of someone sponsored by the speaker ivan lendls case is 
at least as meritorious and ought to receive equal treatment 
the mcfarlane bill has passed the house and senate and is 
expected to be signed by the president soon a bentsen aide said 
like lendl miss mcfarlane has obtained her permanentresident 
status but has not completed the fiveyear waiting period required 
for citizenship 
after sending letters to the authors of several olympictied 
immigration bills earlier this year indicating the measures had no 
chance mazzoli scheduled a hearing april 20 on the lendl measure 
and ones for several other potential olympians lendl is not 
expected to attend the hearing since under the panels rules he 
cannot testify for himself 
if you start doing it for athletes why not do it for 
artistic ability or for people who are nuclear physicists tinker 
asked immigration exemptions he said are for people who are 
literally falling through the cracks some urgent humanitarian 
family or other compelling reason if we start doing it for 
personal convenience wed be swamped 
but a professional tennis players playing lifespan is 
short countered kim elliott an aide to sen lowell p weicker 
jr rconn he said hed like to wear the us colors while hes 
still at the peak instead of the end of his career tennis will 
be an olympic event for the first time this september in seoul 
morrison argued that the legislation would benefit the united 
states more than lendl 
ivan lendl doesnt need this hes very successful this isnt 
going to change his living circumstances or his tax status or his 
income in any way morrison said while this is a personal 
benefit to him it is actually a greater benefit to the united 
states and the promotion of tennis in the olympics 
lendl however is not expected to be at the hearing said his 
attorney william bricker of new york under subcommittee rules he 
cannot testify on his own behalf 
several other private immigration bills are expected to be 
discussed at the hearing including the case of dan iuga coach of 
the us olympic pistol team who defected from romania and is 
living in colorado and jenspeter burntd an east german swimmer 
who defected in 1985 and is living in alabama

it was bad enough when they convicted 
kermits police chief for selling drugs and the fire chief for 
setting fires along with other members of their clan then the 
former county sheriff admitted he sold his job to the highest 
bidder 
and last week a special grand jury returned indictments 
charging 16 of mingo countys most prominent politicians 
including state legislators a prosecutor and the mayor of the 
county seat with bribery and conspiracy to subvert free elections 
in mingo county 
the grand jury one of three convened as part of a special state 
and federal task force investigating corruption in the county is 
not yet finished circuit judge dan ohanlon brought in from 
another county says the grand jury will remain empaneled through 
july and will be in session on election day to hear any complaints 
of vote fraud 
in all some 60 people from mingo county have been convicted on 
state or federal charges in the past two years the investigations 
started separately with the federal government breaking a drug and 
arson ring that operated openly in the tiny town of kermit at the 
other end of the county the state tackled allegations of vote 
fraud in gilberts municipal elections 
investigators started bumping into one another the deeper they 
looked the more pervasive the corruption seemed mingo countys 
elections became the joke of the day in west virginia what do 
you call a voter in mingo county an unindicted coconspirator 
other west virginians have long liked to poke fun at mingo 
county which dubs itself the heart of the billiondollar 
coalfield far from being central to the state however its 
location on the southwestern border with kentucky is isolated deep 
in the heart of appalachia and although mining has scarred the 
landscape it remains a land of narrow winding valleys separated 
by steep wooded ridges 
the isolation has had its darker side and the region was known 
for years as bloody mingo it first hit newspaper front pages 
in the 19th century when the hatfield clan feuded in pitched 
battles with the mccoy clan from across the border in kentucky 
these days the boom and bust cycles of the coalfield economy 
still dominate most lives in mingo and the economy has been bust 
since the early 1980s 
the areas poverty and isolation allowed corruption to flourish 
according to assistant us attorney joe savage who heads the 
federal side of the investigation 
savage points out that of the countys 36000 residents only 
8700 have jobs and of those 8700 jobs he says more than 2600 
are controlled by politicians the school board the county 
commission the antipoverty agencies as a result he says many 
people feel they must vote the way theyre told by the politicians 
who control their livelihood 
you cant assess fault on the people of mingo county says 
savage people anywhere could find themselves in this situation 
if conditions were right 
the linchpin to the latest indictments was johnie owens a 
former county democratic chairman and onetime sheriff he said he 
accepted a 20000 downpayment on a 100000 bribe from the current 
sheriff charles e eddie hilbert then persuaded the three 
county commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint hilbert 
in exchange for half the bribe 
those county commissioners one of whom is now a state senator 
were among those indicted last week the grand jury also accused 15 
politicians of conspiring with owens as democratic chairman to 
improperly influence elections and buy votes 
hilbert is scheduled to enter a plea in federal court april 18 
he was indicted in january on 13 counts including allegations that 
he protected the drug and arson ring in kermit in exchange for 
illegal campaign contributions 
that ring showed that while the days of the hatfields and mccoys 
are long over clans still play a role in the region 
among those from kermit who were sentenced to lengthy prison 
terms were fire chief wilburn wig preece his wife six of 
their 14 children and their soninlaw police chief david ramey

the tunes may be different but the 
harmonies will be the same when barbershop singing groups gather 
monday around the world to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
organization that promotes them 
the society for the preservation and encouragement of barber 
shop quartet singing in america or the spebsqua has about 38000 
members in 825 chapters 
but ray heller the organizations manager of communications 
says that because that name does not spring as easily from the lips 
as does the music its members sing it is known informally as the 
the barber shop harmony society 
each chapter is to gather monday at 10 pm and sing a few songs 
to commemorate the anniversary 
the group despite its formal name promotes fourpart harmony 
among choruses ranging in size from 20 to 150 people as well as 
among the traditional quartet 
it is more demanding to participate in a quartet and some 
people who like fourpart harmony get a boot out of singing in 
larger groups instead heller said 
in the quartets one person sings the lead or melody line a 
tenor sings above the melody and a baritone usually below with the 
bass welding the sound of the other three together 
competitions are held in each of the groups 16 north american 
districts twice a year for both the quartets and choruses and an 
international champion is crowned once each year 
the international competition this year will be held july 310 
at san antonio texas when about 12000 people will gather at the 
groups annual convention 
the society was formed in 1938 at tulsa okla by a group of 
businessmen who liked fourpart harmony 
one of the district competitions is scheduled monday at tulsa 
and a plaque is to be dedicated there at the site of one of the 
groups early meeting places 
there were 480 chartered chapters in the united states and 
canada by 1948 and heller said there are now national groups in 
great britain sweden and new zealand and local groups in other 
parts of the world 
heller said the society bought a mansion at kenosha in 1957 and 
turned it into the groups international headquarters known as 
harmony hall 
it was located at kenosha because of the citys central 
geographic location and because a larger concentration of the 
members live in the center of the country heller said 
the society now employs 44 people he said producing a bimonthy 
newsletter and organizing the annual meetings as well as other 
activities to encourage barbershop singing 
we arrange music in barbership style sell sheet music and 
hold clinics heller said 
heller said membership in the society has held steady for about 
the last 10 years there are more retired people involved but 
also more high school quartets he said

the acquittals of white supremacist 
leaders accused of plotting to overthrow the government poses a 
dilemma for them and their followers how to justify their 
opposition to a government that treated them fairly 
some of those familiar with the movement say that thursdays 
verdict acquitting all 13 defendants of sedition and other charges 
effectively neutralized the supremacists whereas conviction would 
have only made them martyrs 
but others fear the verdicts by the allwhite federal jury will 
only encourage the extremists in their campaign of violence aimed 
particularly against blacks and jews 
they were protesting about the federal government and now 
theyve been treated fairly by the federal government said 
television producer peter lake who testified about his experiences 
as an undercover reporter at an aryan nations compound in idaho 
thats going to have a telling effect 
kirk lyons a houston attorney who represented defendant louis 
ray beam jr agreed the supremacists view of conviction would be 
that they were shanghaied he said but the outcome proves 
they got a fair trial in an american court which they had 
labeled impossible 
former us attorney asa hutchinson who won racketeering 
convictions against leaders of an arkansasbased supremacist group 
called the covenant the sword and the arm of the lord was not as 
optimistic that the movement would lose credibility because of that 
contradiction 
i always said that a conviction would pretty much put an end 
to violence by these hate groups he said im afraid some of 
them will look at this acquittal as a license to their hate and 
violence 
nine defendants including beam were found innocent of plotting 
to overthrow the federal government by force to set up an allwhite 
nation in the pacific northwest 
five defendants were acquitted of charges they conspired to kill 
a federal judge and an fbi agent and two were acquitted of charges 
they transported stolen money across state lines 
the government said the supremacists robbed banks and armored 
trucks of 41 million including about 1 million still missing 
to finance their activities 
one juror at the sevenweek trial indicated that jurors did not 
believe the prosecutions witnesses a key witness for the 
government was a former supremacist leader serving 20 years in 
prison for racketeering 
six of the defendants are also serving prison terms for a 
variety of other offenses including murder 
in atlanta eva sears of the center for democratic renewal said 
the far right would view that acquittal as a green light they 
are going to step up their activity so it is very very important 
that those of us who love democracy become more vigilant and get 
involved in community activities that resist supremacists 
and not just the target groups the blacks and jews but 
everybodys got to get involved she said 
urban league president john jacobs also was fearful of the 
verdicts impact 
we are seeing a climate that is permissive of racist 
behavior he said people have become comfortable in engaging 
in this climate every time something like this happens it sets 
back the whole movement for fairness equality and justice you can 
be a racist and get away with it and that is a very disturbing 
message 
the trial did take a toll on the white supremacists time 
energy and finances and that will help speed a shakeup among 
leaders of the movement lake said the movements style and 
paraphernalia will change he predicted 
were not going to see the old signs like the nazi swastika 
or the burning cross any more he said the government repeatedly 
referred to the use of such items in the trial 
some of the older leaders told me that they were going to get 
out of the business in essence lake said theyre going to go 
home and write books pass their churches on to someone else 
defendant richard g butler of hayden lake idaho is 70 and 
underwent a quadruple bypass heart operation last year butler is 
pastor of the church of jesus christ christian at hayden lake and 
founder of the aryan nations 
robert e miles 63 pastor of the mountain church of jesus 
christ at cohoctah mich said he and butler are not likely to 
remain leaders much longer 
but he said its hard to predict their successors because the 
next leadership level consists of splintered chieftains of 
relatively small clans with a c

education officials are urging congress to 
give them more time to rid the nations public and private schools 
of cancercausing asbestos 
the officials say there is insufficient money and trained 
manpower to meet this octobers asbestosinspection deadline set 
in 1986 by a congress upset with the slow pace of the battle 
against the deadly substance 
but groups representing teachers parents and school employees 
are opposing a deadline extension arguing that such a step is 
unwarranted and would prolong longterm health threats faced by 
millions of schoolchildren 
so far the reagan administration is staying officially neutral 
in a growing debate that finds both sides saying their main concern 
is the safety of children attending an estimated 31000 public 
schools believed to contain asbestos 
once a common building material asbestos is dangerous when it 
becomes friable or crumbly friable asbestos releases the fibers 
that can cause a variety of respiratory ailments including lung 
cancer the fibers pose more threat to a childs lungs than to an 
adults 
in 1986 congress ended a struggle with the administration by 
passing legislation requiring school districts to inspect for 
friable asbestos and to render it harmless either by removing it 
or stabilizing it 
the law was a response to hitandmiss abatement efforts by the 
environmental protection agency which in the 1970s began a 
voluntary program against asbestos in schools 
in 1982 the epa issued a regulation requiring every school 
district to inspect for the substance by january 1984 and to notify 
school employees and parents if friable asbestos were found 
there was no requirement that any other action be taken six 
months after the deadline only 11 percent of the districts had 
complied completely with the regulation which had been broadly 
attacked as too weak 
even worse the epa itself acknowledged that where school 
districts took action against friable asbestos much of the removal 
work was performed by unqualified ripandskip contractors who 
filled the air with fibers 
under the 1986 law school districts have until this october to 
carry out a new round of inspections and prepare plans to abate 
friable asbestos and until july 1989 to begin carrying out those 
plans 
many local public school districts are incapable of 
compliance a hearing by two senate environment subcommittees was 
told recently by robert anderson representing the national school 
boards association 
the association joined by groups like the american association 
of school administrators and the council for american private 
education has written lawmakers asking for a deadline extension 
their argument is that because the epa didnt issue regulations 
implementing the 1986 law until last october there is insufficient 
time to comply 
first they say there arent enough trained people to inspect 
schools and draft abatement plans the 1986 law limits this work to 
people certified as qualified by the epa which set forth training 
requirements in last years regulation 
the school officials also say there is a shortage of accredited 
laboratories to test the asbestos samples some states havent had 
a chance to repeal antiasbestos laws that conflict with the 
federal law and some districts lack inspection and abatement funds 
john moore head of epas office of pesticide and toxic 
substances said training courses are turning out 2000 certified 
asbestos inspectors a month and that there should be enough to meet 
the october deadline although there could be shortages in some 
states 
moore told the hearing that while the administration has no 
position on the deadline question his personal view is that an 
extension should not be done lightly 
pressed by sen frank lautenberg dnj about the prospects 
for compliance with the 1986 law moore said i think the vast 
majority of school districts can meet the deadline 
rep michael oxley rohio and nearly 100 house colleagues are 
sponsoring a bill to push the deadlines back a year 
oxley says one problem is that school districts are getting 
widely different bids from contractors to perform inspections and 
draft plans lima ohio got bids ranging from about 63000 to 
over 142000 for its 17 school buildings according to oxley 
the possibility that some unscrupulous firms might be taking 
advantage of school districts under the gun to meet the deadline 
should not be dismissed lightly oxley recently told a house 
hearing 
not only are the tight deadlines forcing some schools to pay 
inflated prices in some cases the tight deadlines are compromising 
the health of our children by helping cause shoddy inspections and 
insufficient management plans oxley said 
paul spell of the texas association of school boards said that 
keeping the current deadlines may result in hasty unsound and 
inefficient compliance actions that could jeopardize the health and 
safety of millions of public school children and school employees 
these views are not shared by groups representing school 
employees and the parents and teachers of the children 
by extending the deadlines congress will be sending a message 
to school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore or 
delay action on this serious health issue says ann lynch first 
vice president of the national pta 
keith geiger vice president of the national education 
association a teachers group says that if school boards had 
taken immediate steps to comply with the law the overwhelming 
majority would be in a position to complete the inspection and plan 
development requirements on time

hunters estimate that 500000 texas diamondback 
rattlesnakes were harvested last year fetching about 50 apiece 
but naturalists say the booming business in rodenteating snakes is 
leading to an environmental bust 
rattlesnakes are a natural part of the ecology its not like 
the communists let them go to terrorize texans said david 
barker a dallas herpetologist or one who studies reptiles 
theyve been there for a million years 
the snakes are in great demand for medical research and 
commercial products ranging from exotic trinkets earrings belts 
and paperweights to 10perpound snakeburgers and 40 snakeskin 
caps 
those cashing in on the snake trade are mainly smalltime 
operators whose numbers have swelled to several thousand since the 
urban cowboy craze popularized snakeskin attire in the early 
1980s 
more recently the oil bust has made snakehunting an attractive 
source of supplemental income about 5000 a year for the most 
enterprising 
cowboys oil wells and snakes are related to texas thats 
what people up north think said george wills who calls himself 
the worlds largest manufacturer of rattlesnake products 
he employs 28 people at a rattlesnake slaughterhouse in brady 
where diamondbacks are killed in a miniature guillotine processed 
and turned into offbeat products 
wills said his best customers are retailers in new york 
pennsylvania and other eastern states 
praise the lord for yankees or we couldnt be in the snake 
business he told the dallas morning news 
but naturalists are warning that the business could be a 
disaster for the delicate balance of nature 
a decrease in their number could lead to an explosion of 
diseasecarrying rodents and rabbits that cost millions of dollars 
in crop damage said jeffrey black a professor of biology at 
oklahoma baptist university 
a decline in the rattlesnake population could cause a general 
collapse of an ecosystem barker said 
bill ransberger a sweetwater snake hunter and handler has 
survived 40 rattlesnake bites but he says he steers clear of 
those environmentalists 
you have to be careful with them he said you dont 
argue you just walk away 
its hard to get favorable publicity for rattlesnakes said 
jim seippel an austin engineer who serves as chairman of the legal 
affairs committee for the greater san antonio herpetological 
society 
nonetheless environmentalists have gone on the offensive last 
month 26 texas animal rights and environmental groups banded 
together for the first time to protest a rattlesnake hunt at taylor 
two protesters dramatized their concerns by chaining themselves 
to a fence police responded by throwing a tarp over the 
protesters who soon unchained themselves and went home 
the consortium of groups is organizing a nationwide 
letterwriting campaign directed at the texas parks and wildlife 
department the groups goal seippel said is to encourage the 
department to regulate the number of snakes killed and outlaw the 
practice of pouring gasoline into logs and animal holes to force 
snakes out into the open 
snake hunters say they are rendering a service ridding the 
state of the dangerous reptile educating crowds who gather at the 
roundups and promoting safety

an outspoken soviet economist says mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform effort is being jeopardized by hostile local 
officials and suspicious consumers who fear theyll suffer for any 
progress 
nikolai shmelev wrote in the april edition of the literary 
journal novy mir that key agricultural reforms have completely 
failed he also criticized some of gorbachevs initiatives 
he said the soviet leaders antidrinking campaign has done 
little but make moonshiners rich and that officials are misguided 
in trying to restructure the economy and accelerate growth at the 
same time 
shmelev proposed a deeper reform of farming an increase in 
imported food and consumer goods and better use of soviet 
financial reserves 
the criticism in the article and shmelevs previous scathing 
attack on the soviet economy published in last junes novy mir 
are among the sharpest made publicly by a soviet economist 
it is impossible not to see that a hidden opposition to 
perestroika restructuring is growing in the regions from the side 
of many local party government and economic officials shmelev 
said 
the economist said that while they pay lip service to 
gorbachevs reforms a silent conspiracy against him could be 
developing or may already have developed among local officials and 
bureaucrats in moscow 
gorbachev needs some successes in the near future to show that 
his program is working but his rural opponents have paralyzed the 
system shmelev charged 
in rallying support for his reforms gorbachev has put pressure 
on local and central bureacrats and blamed them for slowing the 
progress of his restructuring effort 
but gorbachev also has noted that soviets still have seen little 
improvement in the quality or supply of food or consumer goods 
shmelev said promises that food prices will go up have 
frightened many soviets into thinking the reforms will hurt them 
he said that fear results from the way government agencies have 
operated in the past 
officials who have promised that they will increase benefits 
and wages to match price increases must make an allout effort to 
convince honest workers the elderly and those with low incomes 
that they have nothing to fear from the reforms he said 
shemelev said efforts to open more private garden plots and 
allow collective and state farms to sell some of their produce on 
the open market have failed because of local bureaucracy and the 
central governments own demands for food 
in his article last year shmelev urged that farms be allowed to 
decide for themselves how much and what kind of goods they would 
grow without any interference of state planning officials 
he said the disastrous situation of soviet agriculture is a 
result of the unlimited power that administrative layers have 
held all these decades over everything that lives in the villages 
shmelev said the effort to combat alcoholism gorbachevs first 
major initiative upon taking power in 1985 had done little but 
send millions of rubles of government income from vodka sales into 
the hands of moonshiners the soviet unions serious drinking 
problem will not be solved until consumers are offered something 
else to buy with their money he said 
gorbachev has called for increasing the quality and quantity of 
industrial and food production but shmelev said neither has 
increased and that planners were unrealistic to expected increased 
production while they were trying to restructure the foundations of 
the economy 
soviet officials have been cutting back on some imported goods 
such as coffee and tea but could make a quick improvement in 
supplies to consumers by sharply increasing such imports he said 
the soviet union could pay for such imports and strengthen 
itself economically by learning to make better use of credit 
shareholding and foreign loans and by providing better terms for 
joint ventures he said

finance officials from 151 nations begin a 
week of closeddoor sessions monday continuing the search for ways 
to cut the third worlds trilliondollar debt 
the annual sessions at the headquarters of the world bank and 
the international monetary fund likely will include discussions of 
a number of proposals to deal with the huge debt of the third world 
countries including one that would create about 295 billion in 
new money 
officials agree that the third world needs more money to 
increase production of goods and provide more jobs so that its 
people will have the money to buy the goods and improve their lives 
but there are many opinions among world bankers and officials 
about how the needy countries should get the money what proportion 
should come from government grants from private investment from 
new loans by commercial banks or other lending institutions or 
from direct or indirect forgiveness of old debts 
treasury secretary james a baker iii has been pushing a 
menu of choices for commercial banks which are owed about 75 
percent of the debt growing fear that the loans will never be 
fully repaid has spurred the banks to take new tacks 
the menu includes many items that would reduce the face value of 
the debts owed to the banks one is a debtequity swap in which 
a bank exchanges the money owed to it and gets shares in the debtor 
countrys industry this has been done most extensively in chile 
other proposals are variations of a mexican plan that swaps old 
debt of doubtful value for a smaller amount of new debt backed by 
the us treasury 
in a confidential memo to world bank officials and member 
countries bank president barber conable suggested more menu items 
one would have banks simply waive part of the interest owed them a 
waiver of 2 percentage points would provide the 17 most heavily 
indebted countries with 56 billion the first year he calculated 
the institute of international finance speaking for 165 banks 
in 38 countries has asked the imf to create the 295 billion in 
new money that would help the debtors keep up with old loans and 
borrow more it is about the same amount that baker asked from the 
world bank and private banks more than two years ago for 15 
countries heavily in debt 
third world countries have repeatedly asked the fund to issue 
more money in recent years but the idea has been opposed in the 
united states japan and west germany us officials have said it 
would foster inflation 
one critic richard feinberg vice president of the overseas 
development council said the banks suggestion would mostly help 
the banks the council is a private group that studies third world 
issues 
conable will present a report to the two institutions joint 
development committee on friday that says rich countries 
increasingly are seeing poorer countries debt as a threat to their 
own growth 
the more poor nations have to pay on past loans the less money 
they have to buy what the rich nations have to sell notes the 
world bank president who is a former republican congressman from 
new york 
the world bank and the imf are owned by the same 151 countries 
the washington meetings are one of two major gatherings held 
annually the other will be in berlin at the end of september 
representatives of third world countries will meet among 
themselves and with those from industrial countries during the 
week the wealthier countries have their own sessions with 
officials from central banks like the us federal reserve system 
participating 
the two world financial organizations are led by the united 
states and other noncommunist governments china poland hungary 
and a few others also belong the soviet union is not a member 
although there have been reports that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev would like it to join 
a session is planned at the us treasury on wednesday among 
baker and his counterparts from japan west germany france 
britain italy and canada 
this group of seven known as g7 has set up about 10 
indicators of how their countries work including such 
statistics as inflation and the size of the governments surplus or 
deficit compared to the countrys total production the complete 
list of indicators has not been made public 
baker is trying to get one included that will use the price of 
gold among the prices of other commodities this is being resisted 
by some officials who see it as a step toward return to the gold 
standard for currencies 
the seven will review what has happened in each country with 
relation to these indicators in the hope that the record will give 
each some hints on what course future policies should take

hollywood outsider despite his oscar nomination for best supporting 
actor in the untouchables 
well first of all i am british the actor who first 
achieved fame as the dashing spy james bond said in an interview 
in the chicago tribune 
second i havent done mainstream hollywood pictures i 
havent socialized with the in crowd and even with the bond 
films i was completely cut out of any involvement in them by the 
producers 
connery 57 who plays veteran irish street cop jimmy malone in 
the big screen adaptation of federal agent eliot ness pursuit of 
gangster al capone said his penchant for suing when he feels he 
has been denied a fair share of a movies profits also hasnt 
endeared him to the industry 
connery has his mind very much on mondays oscar ceremony 
but the closer it gets the more you begin to realize that 
there is going to be only one winner he said and that is a 
bit sobering and so i dont expect to jump up and down if my 
name is called im not going to react as if i had just won the

the cabinet on sunday condemned the killing of a 
hostage on the hijacked kuwaiti jetliner and newspapers accused 
iran of backing the hijackers 
minister of state for cabinet affairs rashid abdelaziz alrashid 
branded the shooting of a 24yearold kuwaiti a hideous crime 
the kuwait news agency reported 
he said the cabinet thanked cyprus for allowing the plane to 
land friday after the plane left iran the beirut and damascus 
airports refused to let it land and the the pilot radioed that the 
plane was running out fuel 
the cabinet also said it appreciated cypriot efforts to 
negotiate for the release of captives aboard the airliner 
but he said the ministers were firmly determined to uphold the 
firm principles which kuwait has always pursued 
that was seen as a reiteration of kuwaits refusal to give in to 
the hijackers demand for the release of 17 terrorists imprisoned 
in kuwait 
the news agency reported the cabinet began its regular weekly 
meeting sunday with a reading from the koran the moslem holy book 
in mourning for the martyrdom of the member of the border guards 
force mohammed abdallah habab shabib alkhalidi who was 
assassinated by the criminal hijackers 
the independent alanbaa daily said the iranian government tried 
to conceal the wave of the wolf with a lambs veil by 
pretending to negotiate when the plane landed in iran 
the iranian rulers managed to concoct the play of 
negotiations with the hijackers but in reality they were colluding 
with them and they even masterminded the operation wrote the 
paper in its main editorial 
it was the first outright accusation in kuwait of iranian 
government involvement in the hijacking of the kuwait airways 
boeing 747 
the hijackers are demanding the release of 17 men jailed in 
kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies there in 1983 
the plane which was parked at the airport in larnaca cyprus 
on sunday was first hijacked to iran after it left bangkok 
thailand for kuwait iranian authorities condemned the air piracy 
and said they were doing everything to try to end the passengers 
ordeal 
kuwait has accused the iranian government of conspiring with the 
moslem shiite terrorists who pirated another kuwaiti jetliner in 
december 1984 two americans were killed 
that ordeal ended with the iranians storming the plane after six 
days at tehrans airport the fate of the four hijackers has 
remained unknown 
the independent daily alqabas said that at least certain 
political circles in iran were involved in the latest hijacking 
quoting an unidentified western diplomatic source alqabas

the lush pastures of illinois horse 
country may seem an unlikely setting for a psychic healer with a 
crystal wand but some of the horsey set swear by her special knack 
with their prized thoroughbreds 
zandee zbella her first name rhymes with hay combines 
conventional massage techniques with unconventional specialties 
like japanese acupressure and psychic readings to treat her equine 
clients 
the psychic horse therapist demonstrated her methods in a recent 
session with st james a foxhunting thoroughbred stabled at 
tempel farms in this northern illinois town 
firmly but gently she moved her fingertips across the horses 
forehead rubbing her knuckles along his neck and shoulder 
he can be tense so we work to get the tension out she said 
its not the pressure ms zbella said of her technique 
its more of a mental communication 
st james treatment didnt call for the wand equipped with a 
crystal from south america that ms zbella says she uses to attract 
and direct positive energies 
horses are a life force just like we are she said they 
are a mass of energy in that sense you can treat them using 
psychic techniques 
im impressed said laren hasler of lake forest who owns 
st james and two other horses she does wonderful things 
locating muscle problems and straightening them out 
i dont fully understand what she does but i have a healthy 
respect for it

the du pont cos call for an eventual end to 
production of ozonedestroying chemicals has other producers 
scrambling to decide what they should do a competitor says 
only one of six other companies in the field in the united 
states is following du pont so far 
pennwalt corp announced an identical position to du ponts on 
the same day largely overlooked in the attention devoted to giant 
du ponts announcement that it believes that chlorofluorocarbon 
compounds cfcs and related compounds should be phased out soon 
at the other end of the spectrum is great lakes chemical corp 
which says spokesman gregory j griffiths believes there is no 
reason to go beyond the international agreement of last fall to cut 
production of these chemicals 
at various positions in between are ici americas corp a 
subsidiary of britains giant ici corp the racon subsidiary of 
essex chemical corp great lakes chemical corp alliedsignal 
corp and kaiser chemical corp 
du pont pennwalt racon alliedsignal and kaiser make cfcs 
used in the united states for refrigeration fluids cleaning 
solvents in electronics manufacture and foam blowing agents 
overseas cfcs are also used as aerosol propellants 
du pont ici americas and great lakes make related 
bromofluorocarbon compounds called halons used for firefighting 
the effect of the halons on ozone is far more uncertain than the 
effect of cfcs but some theoretical studies indicate they also 
could be powerful destruction agents 
the march 25 statements from du pont the worlds largest cfc 
producer and pennwalt were the first from any company to go beyond 
the treaty endorsed by 31 nations in montreal last fall so far 
ratified only by the united states and mexico the treaty calls for 
a 50 percent cut in cfc production by 1998 and a freeze on halons 
in 1992 
the conclusions of the two companies were prompted by a march 15 
report from a scientific panel organized by the national 
aeronautics and space administration that cfcs appear to have 
caused an average 23 percent decline in the earths protective 
ozone layer at northern midlatitudes between 1969 and 1986 
the ozone layer protects life on the ground from ultraviolet 
rays from the sun the environmental protection agency has 
estimated that a 1 percent decline in ozone means an eventual 48 
percent to 75 percent increase in the most common skin cancers 
so far nasa has released only a summary of the work of the 
panel a call friday to spokesmen for information on further 
release plans was not returned 
we are waiting for the data said bill corcoran of 
alliedsignal in morristown nj we asked for it the day after 
the summary was released 
once the complete report is at hand the companys decision and 
those of others will probably be pretty quick corcoran said 
everybody is scurrying around trying to figure out what the 
right thing to do is he said 
du ponts statement was unqualified saying the company sets 
as its goal an orderly transition to the total phaseout of fully 
halogenated chloroflurocarbon production 
fully halogenated means containing no hydrogen hydrogen 
makes the molecule break down before it can attack ozone 
mike harris development manager for the chemicals in question 
at ici americas in wilmington del said he had to reserve more 
indepth comment until we see the full report 
ici ranks just behind du pont as a cfc supplier overseas like 
du pont it will urge governments everywhere it operates to ratify 
the montreal agreement quickly harris said 
griffiths of great lakes said in west lafayette ind our 
position is consistent with where we were before du ponts 
statement we support the montreal protocol 
at kaiser in cleveland richard watts general manager for 
fluorocarbons said were not fully sure what du pont said 
asked if kaiser agreed that cfcs should be phased out watts said 
we support the montreal protocol 
at pennwalt in philadelphia lawrence j woodward said we 
believe as du pont does that production of fully halogenated cfcs 
should be terminated as soon as practicable but the world cant 
do it tomorrow afternoon 
du pont has said it may take five years before the paths to 
replacement chemicals and agreed international action become clear

thousands of foreign nurses recruited to ease 
the us nursing shortage will be forced to return home because 
federal immigration officials refuse to extend their temporary 
visas a newspaper reported sunday 
the foreignborn nurses were admitted to the united states under 
h1 visas at the request of employers because of the dire need for 
their skills the new york times reported 
the labor department officially certified the nursing shortage 
the times said and the american nurses association says about 
300000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide with hospital nursing 
vacancies approaching 20 percent 
but last year the immigration service ruled that such temporary 
work visas would be limited to five years with a oneyear 
extension possible the newspaper said 
were simply trying to make the actual practice fit the 
requirement of the law which is that these people are here on a 
temporary basis and are not supposed to stay indefinitely or become 
permanent verne jervis a spokesman for the immigration and 
naturalization service in washington said 
new york and california will be especially hard hit the 
newspaper reported 
about 4000 nurses are affected in the new york metropolitan 
area alone and the first group of fiveyear visas involving more 
than 1000 nurses statewide expires this year the newspaper said 
in california the number has got to be in the ball park with 
new york maybe higher said arthur a sponseller vice 
president of the southern california hospital council 
it remains to be seen how strictly immigration officials will 
enforce the law nurses who fail to leave do not incur any 
financial or criminal penalties but they can be deported the times 
said but employers face sanctions for having workers who overstay 
their visas and who were hired after nov 6 1986 and nurses in 
that category are expected to be let go the newspaper said

soft support has been the achilles heel of gov 
michael dukakis presidential campaign but a poll of new york 
voters indicates that the commitment of his backers may be 
solidifying in the state 
the development if confirmed in other polls as the april 19 
primary draws near could improve dukakis showing but that is not 
assured the poll also said dukakis backers remained less committed 
than jesse jacksons 
in a lowturnout situation that favors jackson because his 
supporters are more intensely committed said pollster lee 
miringoff but the dukakis support is starting to solidify more 
so its a mixed situation 
the poll by the marist college institute for public opinion 
released friday said dukakis had the support of 47 percent of 
likely democratic voters in the state jackson 31 percent and sen 
albert gore jr 6 percent 
the backing for dukakis was up 10 points from his standing in 
midmarch while jacksons was up 3 points 
as important miringoff noted is that 53 percent of dukakis 
backers said they supported him strongly up from 37 percent in 
midmarch jacksons strong support declined a bit but remained 
high at 67 percent down from 73 
clearly theres more intensity among jacksons people 
miringoff said if the more intense voters turn out thats one 
factor that would make this thing get a little closer 
while committed voters are more likely to go to the polls that 
factor is not necessarily decisive in last weeks wisconsin 
primary a cbc newsnew york times exit poll said 45 percent of 
dukakis supporters were strongly for him while as many 44 percent 
had reservations 
jacksons support was much more committed 60 percent strong to 
31 percent with reservations but it was not sufficient in the high 
turnout to counter dukakis wider if weaker popularity and dukakis 
won the race by 20 points 
miringoff said the marist poll indicates that weak support may 
be less of a potential problem for dukakis the process is 
further along theres fewer candidates the republican thing is 
wrapped up so the attention is being focused on this race he 
said people are picking sides 
in earlier races another important factor has been the large 
number of undecided voters selecting their candidate in the final 
days the latest marist poll however found only 6 percent 
undecided the poll had a margin of error of 5 points 
miringoff noted that much can change in the new york race the 
new marist poll was conducted tuesday and wednesday before the 
three candidates began campaigning actively in the state 
a critical factor the pollster said is to what extent gore can 
cut into dukakis support gores task may be difficult the poll 
said fewer of his supporters were strongly committed 40 percent 
and another 27 percent said they might change their minds and vote 
for someone else 
just 13 percent of dukakis supporters said they might change 
their minds and only 7 percent of jacksons backers said so 
still for jackson the slight dip in strong support may mean 
that after winning the michigan caucuses he was really peaking 
good and has slipped since miringoff said the jackson thing 
sort of crested a little bit thats what we have to watch for 
he said 
for dukakis he added the direction is good if he can 
maintain that path hell be in very good shape

former new york rep richard ottinger said 
sunday he will suspend his efforts to draft gov mario cuomo for 
the democratic presidential nomination in deference to the 
governors wishes 
i say suspend because should it appear that there will be no 
convincing front runner at the democratic convention i am sure 
that all the new york delegates joined by hundreds of other states 
across the land will seek to obtain the nomination for gov 
cuomo ottinger said and i shall be among the foremost 
hopefully with the governors approval 
the former congressman a leader in the draft cuomo movement 
said he was responding to a letter he received sunday morning from 
the governor 
on saturday cuomo said ive ruled out a draft but refused 
to clarify the statement 
cuomo made his statements on the draft effort as he released the 
letter he was sending to ottinger asking the westchester county 
lawyer not to go forward with your intention to encourage a 
draft 
although ottinger said he will comply with the governors 
wishes he still will run as an uncommitted delegate in the new 
york democratic primary on april 19 some of those delegates had 
been organized to assist in the draft cuomo movement

financier felix rohatyn added his voice sunday 
to those criticizing mayor edward i koch for saying jews would be 
crazy to vote for jesse jackson 
i found it very unfortunate said rohatyn chairman of the 
citys municipal assistance corp which was created to bail the 
city out of its fiscal crisis in the 1970s he spoke on the wcbstv 
program newsmakers 
im a jew i lived under the nazis so i dont need lessons in 
antisemitism he added 
rohatyn said there are legitimate policy reasons to vote against 
jackson who is seeking the democratic presidential nomination but 
he said koch takes away from the validity of whatever his 
criticism of jesse jackson is by wrapping it into this issue of 
religious and racial antagonism 
im not at all sure that reverend jackson is an antisemite 
said rohatyn he may be but im perfectly happy to give him the 
benefit of the doubt because he says he isnt 
and i think its as inappropriate to say that jews are crazy 
to vote for jackson as to say that blacks would be crazy to vote 
for koch i dont think that helps anybody 
although rohatyn said he admired jackson and had met with him to 
discuss economic policies he believes that his economic program 
clearly cant deal with the situation that we have

eastern orthodox churches organized mainly along national 
lines do not recognize the roman catholic popes authority over

1054 when many churches in the eastern half of the old roman

churches hierarchy

a bitter dispute between a freshman and an 
english teacher at georgia southwestern college has galvanized 
black students who plan to use the controversy over an alleged 
racial remark to zero in on other issues troubling them 
ginezra dennis 18 a black psychology major from atlanta has 
accused the white professor alan towery of referring to her 
obscenely on march 7 when she tried to withdraw from one of his 
classes 
towery said ms dennis accused him of being a racist when he 
refused to let her withdraw with a passing grade instead of the 
f that she had earned 
since the incident black students have held three rallies and 
the us justice department has sent a representative to assess the 
situation and consider the possibility of future mediation 
towery who has taught at the college for 18 years was 
suspended with pay while a committee of three professors 
investigated the panel submitted its report to gsw president 
william capitan on friday and he planned to study the 
recommendations over the weekend 
college spokeswoman patty plotnick said capitan planned to 
announce his decision monday 
if the panel recommended towerys dismissal and the president 
agrees it would mean the initiation of a lengthy process 
including hearings aimed at protecting the tenured professors 
rights 
this is not our favorite moment in time capitan said in a 
recent interview these are things we must work through and we 
will work through 
georgia southwestern one of 34 colleges in the university 
system of georgia offers fouryear degrees in psychology geology 
nursing business administration and several other fields 
capitan said the college attracts students from all over the 
state who are interested in professional training and are looking 
for the supportive environment that a small campus can provide 
about 20 percent of the schools 2100 students are black 
kevin brown 20 a leader of a recently formed group called 
concerned student affairs said the groups immediate goal is to 
force towerys dismissal 
later the group plans to push for more black professors and 
staff and for policies aimed at promoting racial harmony at the 
college brown a junior political science major said 
brown and other csa leaders said the students want the college 
to hire more black counselors and stop assigning dormitory rooms by 
race the students said the school has just one black counselor 
both contentions were disputed by the college 
you dont feel comfortable talking to a white counselor about 
a black experience he said 
ms plotnick said five of the colleges nine counselors are 
black and she denied that dormitory rooms are assigned by race 
forms that students fill out for room assignments do not refer to 
race and once they get a room students have the option of 
requesting a change she said 
capitan said he sensed some discontent among the black students 
before the purported incident members of his staff used to meet 
regularly with black student representatives but the meetings were 
dropped when the students seemed to lose interest he added 
rona branson 21 a white student from americus said the towery 
incident has unleashed much black frustration 
the black students seem to have a lot of pentup feelings that 
they dont know how to deal with she said i feel like they 
need some way to focus on something positive and ways to overcome 
the racism theyre facing 
hulen brown leader of a campus black group known as sabu said 
black students are concerned about promoting racial harmony but 
that white students do not mingle and do not appear to be care 
about better race relations 
the schools are supposed to be integrated but in essence 
theyre segregated she said i see it in my swimming class 
the blacks sit at one end of the pool and the whites sit at the 
other end

jewish settlers sunday demanded the army chief 
of staff resign over an army report that a 15yearold israeli girl 
was killed accidentally by a settlers gun they insisted she was 
shot by an arab 
the settlers and rightwing legislators including some from 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc condemned the army for 
leaking details before the probe of wednesdays clash was finished 
they demanded tough sanctions on palestinian rioters including 
the expulsion of stonethrowers from israel and called for the 
destruction of every home in beita the west bank village where 
15yearold tirza porat was killed during a holiday outing last 
wednesday 
ms porat was killed during a clash between arabs and jews 
outside the town two arabs also died in the melee and 15 people 
including 13 jewish teenagers and two arabs were wounded 
israels supreme court barred the army from destroying any more 
homes in beita pending an appeal from a civil rights group the 
army says it already has destroyed 13 homes belonging to people it 
says incited last weeks clash 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told a weekly cabinet session 
sunday that an army autopsy showed ms porat was apparently killed 
by a shot from the m16 rifle of romem al dubi a jewish settler 
accompanying the teenagers on their hike israel radio said 
israeli media quoted the unpublished report as saying al dudi 
may have fired the fatal bullet accidentally as he struggled with 
the rioters 
a senior military official confirmed the fatal bullet came from 
al dubis weapon but the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the army had not yet determined who fired the shot 
outraged settlers and rightwing legislators challenged the 
armys findings sunday and accused the military of acting on 
political motives 
geula cohen a legislator from the nationalist tehiya party 
demanded chief of staff lt gen dan shomron resign she contended 
he based statements about the clash on arab reports and not on 
interviews with teenagers who had accompanied ms porat 
teenagers who went on the hike said ms porat was killed not by 
al dubis gun but by an arab who shot her with a sovietmade 
kalachnikov rifle from a rooftop 
according to an israel television account of the army findings 
the events leading to ms porats death began when the 16 hikers 
from the elon moreh settlement stopped at a dry riverbed near 
beita 10 miles south of nablus to eat breakfast 
there the group was attacked from above by stonethrowing 
youths from beita and al dubi fired into the air with his m16 
the tv account said 
at that point menachem ilan the group guide told al dubi 
there was no need to fire but al dubi said shut up and 
continued firing killing one beita youth the report said 
the israelis continued on a route leading them to beita the 
account said 
when the group got to the village according to the tv account 
an arab tried to mediate and asked al dubi to surrender his gun 
but the settler refused 
soon after the mother and daughter of the arab killed earlier 
hit al dubi with a huge rock on the head causing him to lose 
consciousness and fire in all directions killing a second arab 
and wounding two others the account said 
the tv account did not say how ms porat was killed but noted 
she was struck by an m16 bullet 
rami hoffman a 17yearold settler and other hikers denied the 
tv account 
hoffman said al dubi only fired near the river bed when he was 
jumped by an arab who tried to take his weapon he and other hikers 
told reporters the arab was only slightly wounded they could not 
account for either of the arab deaths 
hoffman said the group was then surrounded by about 400 arab 
youths armed with knives and axes who forced them to the village 
ariel avivi another hiker said he believed that ms porat was 
shot by an arab in the village 
i looked up and saw an arab man with a masked face shooting a 
kalachnikov from a rooftop avivi told the associated press i 
was in front of tirza when i looked down she was lying there 
bleeding from the head 
hoffman said group members were never questioned by military 
officials about the clash other elon moreh residents however

a federal judge dealing a major blow to lyndon 
larouche has barred the political extremists attorneys from 
arguing that larouche and top aides followed cia orders in plotting 
to obstruct a grand jury investigation 
in an extensive ruling issued friday us district judge robert 
e keeton also restricted the scope of testimony the defense will 
be allowed to present regarding alleged fbi harassment and 
infiltration of larouche groups 
the judge also denied several requests to dismiss the case 
ruling that defense lawyers failed to show that a prosecutor had 
deliberately misled defense lawyers about government infiltration 
of larouche groups 
keeton however did find that assistant us attorney john 
markham violated an agreement with defense lawyers by not giving 
them information about a former larouche consultants dealings with 
the fbi keeton said he would conduct additional hearings to decide 
whether the withholding affected the defense 
larouche six aides and five of his political groups are on 
trial on charges they conspired to obstruct a federal grand jury 
investigation into allegations larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign raised more than 2 million through credit card and loan 
fraud four of the organizations are charged with fraud 
larouche a fringe candidate for the 1988 democratic 
presidential nomination allegedly ordered three boston area 
fundraisers suspected of fraud to flee the country he also 
allegedly ordered other supporters to burn incriminating records 
and refuse to cooperate with investigators 
attempts to stymie the grand jury investigation are detailed in 
scores of notebooks seized from larouche aides and introduced as 
evidence at the trial of roy frankhauser the former larouche 
security consultant was convicted in december of plotting to 
obstruct the investigation prosecutors plan to offer the notebooks 
as evidence at the current trial 
defense lawyers have argued that frankhauser and others in the 
larouche organization were working for the cia and told larouche 
the agency considered it vital to national security that the 
investigation be blocked so that larouche would not be indicted 
larouche aides then wrote what they believed to be cia instructions 
in their notebooks the defense attorneys contend 
frankhauser and an associate forrest lee fick both of reading 
pa are prosecution witnesses expected to be called in the next 
month defense lawyers had planned to raise the socalled cia 
defense during their testimony 
keeton ruled that even if the defense could prove frankhauser 
and fick worked for the cia and ordered the alleged obstruction 
defense lawyers could not argue that larouche and followers were 
protected from prosecution because they were following cia orders 
the cia lacked authority to authorize an act of obstruction of 
justice keeton said this defense contention lacks merit as a 
matter of law 
keeton also served notice that he would not allow the defense to 
present testimony about alleged fbi harassment of larouche and his 
followers unless it was directly related to the charges in the case 
testimony in the trial has been halted for most of the past 
month while keeton considered defense allegations that prosecutors 
withheld a variety of documents supporting defense theories that 
evidence of the obstruction was fabricated by cia and fbi 
operatives planted in larouche organizations 
the hearings began last month after defense attorneys were given 
an fbi document that quoted three intelligence operatives as saying 
they had been asked by top fbi and cia officials to infiltrate 
larouche organizations 
larouche lawyers sought to have the case dismissed because they 
were not given the documents prior to trial but keeton ruled 
friday that prosecutors were not required to produce it because the 
operatives are not listed as government witnesses he also said 
defense lawyers presented no evidence to counter markhams 
assertion that the men were lying

richard m nixon predicts that likely 
republican presidential nominee george bush will edge the 
democratic candidate in a november election that will be close 
despite peace and prosperity 
the former president in an nbctv meet the press interview 
taped saturday and broadcast sunday said a sound economy and a 
nation at peace normally means a landslide victory for the 
political party in power but as historian alexis de toqueville 
noted one characteristic of american democracy is restlessness 
amid prosperity according to nixon 
i think we have some of that today i think thats one of the 
reasons jesse jackson has such appeal nixon said hes 
appealing to those who are restless despite prosperity and that 
is what george bush must overcome and thats why i think its 
going to be a close election rather than a landslide 
bush who holds a commanding lead in the national delegate 
count is expected to win the gop nomination easily jackson and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis are the frontrunning candidates 
for the democratic nomination 
nixon asked if dukakis was too dull to be an effective nominee 
responded ive often said that the best politics is poetry 
rather than prose jesse jackson is a poet new york gov mario 
cuomo is a poet and dukakis is a word processor thats what it 
gets down to 
on the other hand hes cool hes intelligent hes tough 
hes good in debates hes going to be a very formidable 
candidate nixon said 
the former president has said jackson is the best candidate in 
either party but if he were white he would be out of the race 
according to nixon 
what you have here is a situation where it isnt really the 
messenger the fact that he is black but its the message he is 
far to the left of the democrats and they are already very far to 
the left with dukakis nixon said so under the circumstances 
if he were white he would have been out already as being too 
extreme to have a chance to win 
nixon suggested that if dukakis gets the nomination he should 
look south for a running mate and consider either georgia sen sam 
nunn or presidential rival albert gore jr of tennessee 
dukakis cant win unless he goes south his first choice 
should be nunn nixon said nunn will help him not only in the 
south but also on the issue hes weak on defense and his second 
choice should be gore 
the former president advised fellow republican bush to put aside 
his personal feelings particularly his disagreements with kansas 
sen bob dole in choosing a vice president 
i am not saying that he ought to take bob dole but hes got 
to remember that one place hes weak is in the farm states nixon 
said bob dole won iowa he bush lost it he won minnesota he 
won south dakota he would hold nebraska he would hold kansas 
so as he considers who to take hes got to remember that it 
isnt a question of whether you get along with the person because 
believe me if they win they will be bosom buddies thereafter he 
said 
nixon has scheduled a series of television interviews prior to 
the release of his book 1999 victory without war it is the 
sixth he has written since he resigned in 1974 in the wake of the 
watergate scandal 
in the onehour nbc interview he said the book is not a 
harbinger of a nixon political comeback 
my purpose at the present time is frankly to get the message 
across he said i have some very strong feelings about foreign 
policy ive had a lot of experience not just in sovietamerican 
relations but in chineseamerican relations in the mideast in 
latin america africa et cetera europe i feel i want to pass on 
that experience before im too old to be able to do so to 
articulate it 
as far as restoring making a comeback what am i going to 
come back to we already have a very good mayor in saddle river 
nj nixons home and we have a very good governor in the 
state of new jersey it isnt a comeback he said

fallen evangelist jimmy swaggart led the 
choir but stayed away from the pulpit during sunday services at his 
church two days after separating from the assemblies of god 
swaggart announced friday he was resigning from the assemblies 
of god the nations largest pentecostal denomination shortly 
after the church said it was defrocking him in the aftermath of his 
confession to a moral failure 
give the lord a hand of praise swaggart shouted while 
prancing on the stage as he led the choir in a rendition of he 
set me free 
the 13member executive presbytery of the assemblies based in 
springfield mo ordered swaggart last month to submit to a 
twoyear rehabilitation plan which included a oneyear suspension 
from preaching a harsher punishment than originally ordered by 
louisiana church elders 
swaggart said separating from the church was necessary to save 
his bible college and 140 million worldwide ministry his lawyer 
william treeby said the organization is in a precarious position 
but would not fail financially 
we believe that to stay out of the pulpit for a year would 
totally destroy the television ministry and greatly adversely 
impact the college swaggart said friday 
soon after the presbytery ordered the oneyear suspension 
treeby announced that swaggart would return to the pulpit on may 
22 coinciding with the end of the threemonth suspension first 
ordered by louisiana church leaders 
the rev al trotter a guest preacher at sundays services made 
a brief reference to swaggart 
just one thing is agitating me and just one thing is filling 
me with nervous anticipation thats for sunday may 22 to roll 
around and for the bishop to take the pulpit again trotter said 
swaggarts punishment was handed down after he publicly 
confessed to unspecified sin on feb 21 a selfdescribed 
prostitute said swaggart paid her to pose nude for him in new 
orleans 
another defrocked assemblies of god minister marvin gorman of 
suburban new orleans reportedly hired men who photographed 
swaggart with the woman outside a motel 
according to new ratings swaggarts television ministry was in 
decline even before his confession 
swaggarts weekly program remained no 1 among religious 
broadcasts but viewership fell from 2161 million households in 
february 1987 to 1961 million in february this year arbitron said 
in a report released saturday 
nearly three weeks of the february sweeps period had passed when 
swaggarts scandal surfaced 
his daily program a study in the word fell from 410000 
households to 323000 households according to arbitron it is 
rated 10th in religious programming according to arbitron 
swaggarts audience fell by 200000 households or 10 percent 
during the year for the weekly program and by 87000 households or 
22 percent on a daily basis according to arbitron 
the television ratings to be taken in may which would be 
released during the summer will most accurately gauge whether 
swaggarts broadcast influence is languishing because of his 
separation from the pentecostal denomination 
the rev jerry falwells show dropped 40 percent during the 
year the ptl program once hosted by defrocked assemblies of god 
minister jim bakker and his wife tammy did not crack the top 20 
it had been rated no 18 in november 1987 when the last ratings 
were taken 
three cable networks that carry christianoriented programs have 
threatened to cancel swaggarts shows cutting him off from 68 
million potential viewers 
in midmarch swaggarts wife frances and son donnie hosted a 
weeklong telethon during which they begged viewers to send money 
or use their credit cards to make donations to keep the ministry 
alive

doctors and pharmacists said sunday a 
lack of dollars caused by us economic sanctions is causing a 
shortage of medicines and broad cuts in hospital services 
an opposition party leader meanwhile said the foreign leaders 
who asked the roman catholic church to mediate panamas political 
crisis should consider organizing an international boycott to oust 
the nations strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
by doing the first asking for the mediation there is an 
implicit responsibility to do the second ricardo arias calderon 
president of the christian democrat party told journalists late 
saturday 
monsignor marcos gregorio mcgrath the catholic archbishop of 
panama city attempted to bring the government and opposition to 
mediation at the urging of several latin american and european 
leaders but he announced late last week the effort had been 
suspended 
arias calderon said he did not favor us military intervention 
to oust noriega but added the general might try to provoke an 
armed intervention that will let him play the role of nationalist 
and military hero 
noriega as head of the 15000member defense forces is the 
power behind the civilian government last february a federal 
grand jury in florida indicted noriega on drug trafficking charges 
the united states imposed economic sanctions against panama after 
noriega rejected washingtons demands that he resign and leave the 
country 
problems resulting from the american pressure are mounting 
pharmacies and hospitals said they are cutting services running 
short of some medicines and have stopped elective surgery xrays 
and laboratory tests 
a pharmacist who spoke with condition he not be identified 
said he could not reorder medicine because pharmaceutical companies 
want to be paid in dollars and the banks are closed 
he said pharmacists could not get credit and he was out of many 
medicines including some antibiotics and heart drugs 
doctors on duty at the bella vista clinic said the staff has 
been reduced from 92 to 30 and there were only two aides on duty in 
the operating room instead of the usual six 
state television on sunday showed the arrival of 800 pounds of 
medicine sent by cuba as a move of solidarity with the panamanian 
people 
arias caldron told reporters what has happened is that an 
economy in process of development is regressing to a subsistence 
economy 
people are leaving the country and say they are not coming 
back companies are being forced into bankruptcy semesters of 
school are being lost semesters that cannot be recuperated 
panama uses the american dollar as its currency and us 
sanctions include freezing panamas dollar deposits in us banks 
withholding payments to the panama canal commision and most 
recently prohibiting american companies and citizens from paying 
taxes to the panamanian government 
the taxes are to be paid instead to an account opened for 
deposed president eric arturo delvalle ousted by the national 
legislature on feb 26 the day after he tried to get rid of 
noriega 
arias calderon said the latest us sanctions are within the 
framework of the boycott he advocates but said it needs to be 
multinational 
a foreign businessman who spoke on condition he not be 
identifed by either name or country for fear of reprisals said 
commercial activity appears to be 20 percent to 30 percent of 
normal 
some american businessmen have said they can be fined and jailed 
in the united states for paying taxes to the government and be 
closed down by the government if they dont 
i think were going to see a lot of closings of american 
companies in panama the businessman said 
a statement broadcast on government television sunday said we 
are paying for the intolerable crime of defending our independence 
and wanting to resolve our problems among panamanians 
it referred to a blockade against the people who have never 
been an enemy of the united states

a team of tough competitors from a school in one 
of the citys toughest neighborhoods got their bags together sunday 
to fly to the soviet union for two weeks of playing chess 
well all happy that were going to be representing the united 
states 15yearold jose tavarez of east harlem said shortly 
before the sunday evening flight weve very excited 
in the last few weeks jose and 11 of his classmates at junior 
high school 99 have been learning a few essential russian words 
including hello goodbye thank you and checkmate 
they are members of the royal knights a nationally recognized 
chess team 
the students will pair up with soviet chess players for matches 
pitting sovietamerican teams against each other rather than 
direct competition between nations the idea is to stress 
international cooperation not competition said the royal knights 
teacher and coach william hall 
hall introduced chess to the school as a tool to teach english 
to his students many of whom come from latin america and asia the 
students learned english and fell in love with chess 
during a tournament at the manhattan chess club last fall the 
students met the reigning womens chess champion maya 
chiburdanidze of the soviet union and she suggested they visit her 
country where chess is a national pastime 
while in the soviet union the royal knights will visit moscow 
leningrad and the resort of ezheri on the black sea hall said 
in may a group of teenage dancers from the soviet city of 
tbilisi will visit the east harlem group during a trip to the 
united states according to david kelley cofounder of project

these are troubled times for am radio 
consider that only three of every 10 radio listeners tune in to 
the am band and that 1987 local and national advertising sales 
were about 2 billion for am stations compared with 49 billion 
for fm 
and consider that 85 percent of am stations held steady or 
dropped in value in the last three years and that three out of four 
largecity stations and about half of those in smaller markets make 
no money 
indeed the best price fetched by an am station sold last year 
was 20 million for wnbc in new york the countrys biggest media 
market that was far exceeded by kvil a dallas fm station that 
changed hands for 82 million 
its going to be an irreversible trend if we dont move to 
find out how it can be turned around soon bill moyes chairman 
of the research group in seattle said in an interview at the 
national association of broadcasters annual convention here the 
fourday conference started saturday 
a number of stations have accepted the challenge and are 
experimenting with formats that target specialized audiences 
wfan in new york city broadcasts sports interviews 
commentaries analysis and playbyplay of games 24 hours a day 
updating scores every 15 minutes 
kpal in little rock ark won a peabody award last week for 
its daily mixture of music information trivia quizzes and callin 
features aimed at children ages 512 
wnn in pompano beach fla calls its format all 
motivation featuring taped excerpts of talks by wellknown 
selfimprovement and inspirational authors its logo is were up 
when you need to be 
kmny in los angeles airs financial news around the clock with 
reports on stock and commodities markets and the latest mergers and 
acquisitions 
though traditional am stations still thrive in some rural areas 
lacking fm competition and in some big cities the am audience 
generally has eroded steadily for the past two decades as the 
higher fidelity fm band has grown in popularity 
just 15 years ago nearly threequarters of the radio audience 
was listening to am in big cities across the country the no 1 
stations were am and they were playing music 
but in the late 1960s fm then the lowbudget stepchild where 
people turned mostly for classical music began testing new 
musical formats from easy listening to rock with its deeper 
tone and richer sound it soon found an audience 
fm has captured a whole generation of young people who hardly 
know what am is fm now is the band most people tune in when they 
want to listen to music am has become the band for news talk and 
information since the spoken voice sounds about the same on am as 
fm 
music for all intents and purposes has all but abandoned the 
am spectrum said david parnigoni senior vice president of radio 
for the national association of broadcasters 
people identify am with news and information and talk and a 
lot of younger people dont listen to that he said as the 
population gets older youre seeing fewer people who want to 
listen to am 
nostalgia formats that play big band music most of which was 
recorded in mono and appeals to the older audience are generally 
the only successful musicbased formats on am radio these days 
programming is only one of am radios problems though the band 
is plagued by technological troubles as well and the industry is 
working on improving the quality of the am signal 
many in the industry say the federal communications commission 
missed an opportunity to give the band a boost five years ago when 
it declined to set a single standard for am stereo transmission 
the fcc said the market should decide 
today only about 10 percent to 15 percent of the stations have 
adopted one of the two remaining am stereo systems still fighting 
for a piece of the market motorola incs cquam system the most 
popular so far and one by kahn communications inc 
another technical problem is interference which worsened as 
more stations were crowded into the am band there are now 4912 
stations on the am band and 4058 on the fm band but the technical 
nature of the two differ making interference a bigger problem for 
the am stations 
some in the industry worry an fcc proposal to expand the am band 
to include the frequencies from 1605 to 1705 will increase 
competition in an already fragile industry 
despite the problems however am radio broadcasting never seems 
to lack for people willing to risk a new idea for keeping a station 
on the air said james duncan jr publisher of duncans radio 
market guide 
there are always folks out there willing to take a shot he 
said

democrat jesse jackson said sunday that as 
president he would not sit down with yasser arafat leader of the 
palestine liberation organization to discuss an end to fighting 
between israel and the palestinians 
while rejecting direct talks with arafat jackson said the 
united states should talk with palestinians in the search for a 
peace in the region 
campaigning in new york which holds its democratic presidential 
primary on april 19 jackson has come under criticism from jewish 
leaders for his past meeting with the plo leader mayor edward koch 
of new york said jews who cared about israel would be crazy to 
vote for jackson in the primary 
about one quarter of the new york democratic primary vote is 
expected to be jewish 
asked about the criticism on cbstvs face the nation 
jackson said i met with arafat after i had met with the late 
egyptian president anwar sadat for the sole purpose of 
challenging him to change his posture and move toward a mutual 
recognition policy with israel as opposed to an elimination of 
israel posture 
jackson said tough leadership must challenge the palestinians 
to recognize israels right to exist and vice versa 
pressed on whether if elected president he would sit down with 
arafat jackson said i would not it is not necessary to do 
that 
he said it was a mistake to equate arafat and the plo with the 
palestinians 
in the final analysis it is not arafat versus israel it is 
israel versus the palestinians he said 
if we cannot talk with israels enemy we cannot neutralize 
israels enemy and thereby increase israels security jackson 
said 
gore for his part praised jackson for saying he would not meet 
with the plo chief 
the statement jesse jackson made this morning was very 
constructive that he would not meet with arafat thats a change 
in his position i believe gore said as he campaigned in 
brooklyn 
gore was asked if he would characterize it as a flipflop 
he said no candidates ought to have a right to grow and 
evolve 
in september 1979 jackson went on an 11day trip in the mideast 
and created a furor among jewish groups when he met with the plo 
leader and called for an independent palestinian state he also 
said at the time that the united states should recognize the plo 
and engage in open discussion with the group 
during his mideast trip jackson urged the palestinians to take 
the black struggle for civil rights in the united states as a model 
for efforts to set up a palestinian homeland 
we became disciplined and determined nothing could stop us 
from achieving what was ours our human rights and our place in the 
sun and selfdetermination he told the palestinians 
you are very close to your goal of selfdetermination and a 
homeland he said do not allow acts of terrorism to divert you 
from a homeland or from peace and justice 
four years later with no abatement in criticism of jacksons 
mideast stand from jewish groups the former civil rights leader 
said he suffered from a misperception of his mideast positions 
i support without equivocation israels right to exist 
jackson said but added i do support a state of palestinian 
people the more that they wander aimless as nomads the more 
dangerous and desperate they become 
when we met with arafat we did not endorse him or his 
tactics we challenged him to recognize israels right to exist 
we need to be looking at a mutual recognition policy he said 
in november 1983 
jackson on sunday endorsed the recent meeting secretary of state 
george p shultz had with two arabamericans who are members of the 
plo national council 
the democratic presidential candidate said the united states 
should take the initiative to challenge the plo to amend its 
charter to remove the provision calling for the destruction of the 
state of israel 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin said any meting 
with arafat would have to be based on a prerequisite of the plo 
recognizing israels right to exist 
austin reiterated that jackson has no plans to meet with any 
jewish leaders and talk about their specific concerns about his 
campaign 
were not going to let this campaign become a oneissue 
campaign austin said

government officials and legal historians from 
around the world gathered sunday to urge continued international 
support for the prosecution of nazi war criminals and for war 
crimes legislation 
there is a continued need to be vigilant said elizabeth 
holtzman of new york the brooklyn district attorney and former 
member of congress who wrote a 1978 amendment barring nazis from 
entering the united states and allowing for their deportation we 
cant assume that governments will do the right thing all the 
time 
jurists from australia canada west germany france israel 
the netherlands and the united kingdom joined american officials as 
speakers at the third international conference on holocaust and 
human rights law 
the waldheim affair the demjanjuk trial in israel and the 
barbie trial in france have all three contributed to a renewed 
discussion everywhere in the world and have rekindled the fire of 
peoples emotions paul m brilman of the war crimes section of 
the state attorneys office in the netherlands wrote in a speech 
prepared for the conference 
bruce einhorn an attorney with the us justice departments 
office of special investigations said i dont think people will 
ever forget i think theres a strong sense of doing justice 
but he noted that time left to take action on war crimes is 
limited because both the perpetrators and the survivors of the 
holocaust are getting old 
conference participants said that the sense that time is 
dwindling prompted the canadian and australian governments to 
establish antinazi war crimes investigative units for the first 
time last year 
in canada a report on the need for war crimes legislation by 
conference participant jules deschenes a judge on the superior 
court of quebec acted as a catalyst for change 
the government just didnt want to do anything for 42 years 
said david matas former chairman of the canadian jewish congress 
legal committee on war crimes but theres a sense of a deadline 
that if we dont do something soon the accused will be dead and 
the damage done by the justice system will be irreparable 
robert greenwood director of war criminals investigation for 
the australian attorney general said his countrys search for 
nazis is still in the early days yet but its alleged we have a 
number of war criminals 
matas said increased pressure to find and prosecute war 
criminals is needed because of a recent flareup of holocaust 
denial 
its a form of neonazism said matas when we ignore the 
holocaust by denying it we add fuel to the fire of neonazis 
the conference was sponsored by the boston college law school 
holocausthuman rights research project and the antidefamation 
league of bnai brithrena herstein of warsaw memorial fund

more than twothirds of pilots responding to a 
survey said flying has become more dangerous in the 10 years since 
deregulation began but many stressed they continue to regard it as 
the safest way to travel 
the survey of 1360 pilots with air transport certificates was 
taken by the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution which 
published the results in the newspapers combined sunday editions 
sixtyeight percent of the pilots said they considered air 
travel less safe since the government began deregulating the 
airline industry in 1978 two said air travel is safer now and 29 
percent found no change 
but 82 percent said they never had been pressured to fly a 
mechanically unsound plane and 77 percent rated maintenance as 
good or excellent sixteen percent said they had been pressured to 
fly unsafe planes 19 percent rated maintenance as fair or poor 
the survey also found 47 percent said air travel is just as safe 
now as before the 1981 firings of striking air traffic controllers 
and 11 percent said it is safer thirtynine percent said safety 
has declined since the strike 
more than half the pilots added written comments the newspapers 
said and many of them said air travel is still essentially safe 
the press is not giving the airlines a fair shake the us 
airline system is far and away the safest in the world said a 
pilot for trans world airlines 
many pilots criticized the department of transportations 
6monthold practice of releasing figures on airlines flight 
delays and customer complaints many said their airlines were 
distorting the statistics 
the governments efforts to reduce delays by keepings 
statistics is merely a publicity stunt the transportation 
department has undertaken to make the general public believe 
something is being done when they are actually doing nothing to 
solve the problem a usair pilot wrote 
about twothirds of the pilots responding to the survey work for 
passenger airlines or private charters the others work for 
corporations overnight package or freight services or identified 
themselves as general aviation pilots 
the survey was conducted by mailing questionnaires to 2200 
pilots with commercial licenses of those questionnaires 875 were 
returned pollsters then telephoned a random sample of those who 
did not respond to ensure the survey was unbiased a total of 485 
pilots were telephoned 
in theory the newspaper said the study has a margin of error 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points

the close fight for the democratic presidential 
nomination will help the party in the general election while vice 
president george bush is starved for media attention democratic 
party chief paul kirk said sunday 
democratic national committee chairman kirk said the battle 
between massachusetts gov michael dukakis jesse jackson and 
tennessee sen albert gore is the partys strength not its 
weakness 
on the republican side kirk said bush has had little media 
exposure since early march when his nearsweep on super tuesday 
all but wrapped up the nomination for him 
i missed the republican debate about pedigree family fortunes 
and blind trusts kirk said as he attended a 500perplate 
luncheon to raise funds for the final election this fall 
earlier in the gop campaign sen bob dole needled bush for his 
silverspoon background and the bush campaign raised questions 
about the handling of doles wife elizabeths blind trust 
it was not really a debate about the future of our country 
kirk said 
many democrats have expressed concern that a protracted 
nomination fight would allow bush to gather strength while the 
democrats attack one another 
but kirk said every one of these candidates has said 
privately and publicly that if they dont get the nomination 
theyll be supportive of whoever is 
dukakis has a slight lead over jackson in the latest ap delegate 
count 745 to 708 kirk said it was unlikely any candidate would 
emerge at the end of the primary season with the 2082 delegates 
necessary to clinch the nomination 
but he said there would likely be a winner on the first ballot 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
a mathematical majority may not come until the roll is 
called kirk said selecting a nominee without any destructive 
infighting at the convention is crucial to victory in november he 
said 
we have the opportunity to go to a convention and demonstrate 
that by conducting our own business properly this party is ready 
to go on and lead the country he said as long as everyone is 
treated fairly and everyone plays by the rules and doesnt try to 
change the rules in the ninth inning 
the latter portion of his remark apparently referred to jesse 
jacksons vocal dissatisfaction with party rules in 1984 
sundays fundraiser was slated to raise more than 250000 for 
the partys presidential victory fund the party has raised 3 
million to date this year toward a goal of more than 8 million 
the federal limit for a national committee to spend toward the 
final election 
party spokeswoman julie anbender said the party is already ahead 
of its 1984 fundraising performance of 23 million

former vice presidential candidate geraldine 
ferraro says she partly blames herself and her candidacy for her 
sons cocaine conviction because it made him a target and says 
the family will appeal the verdict to the vermont supreme court 
we still believe he was set up said ferraro of her 
24yearold son john zaccaro jr but she acknowledged that he had 
possessed cocaine and said his legal troubles showed him the 
horrors of drugs 
a vermont district court jury deliberated for slightly more than 
two hours saturday before finding zaccaro guilty of selling 
onequarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while 
he was a senior at middlebury college two years ago 
no sentencing date was set and an appeal could take two years 
the felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
jail and a 10000 fine 
in a statement after the verdict ferraro blamed her son for 
possessing cocaine as well as herself and my candidacy for 
making my son a target ferraro ran on the democratic ticket with 
walter mondale in 1984 
we are a concerned family who has lived through a very 
difficult two years she said we love our son we do not 
minimize in any way his use of drugs at middlebury college or the 
fact that middlebury college is the place where drugs was available 
to so many students and continues to be so it was wrong 
there are four people who are guilty in this whole episode 
ferraro said john for possession we are grateful that god has 
chosen this way to show him the horrors of drugs me and my 
candidacy for making my son a target 
ferraros statement went on to name former middlebury police 
sgt david wemette for setting my son up and addison county 
states attorney john quinn for prolonging the agony for two 
years by rejecting a plea bargain 
we as his parents would not allow him to plead guilty to 
the felony charge of selling cocaine ferraro said the family had 
asked prosecutors to allow zaccaro to plead guilty to a lesser 
charge of possession of cocaine 
but quinn would not accept a plea for less than a felony 
if she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge 
thats her prerogative i didnt feel there was any justification 
for reducing the charge quinn said there was plenty of 
evidence he was selling i never considered a possession case and 
they know that he added 
ferraro pointed to several drug cases recently heard in vermont 
in which plea bargains were arranged easily and light sentences 
were given to defendants accused of selling larger quantities of 
drugs 
that may or may not be true i know there are some cases like 
that it depends on the particular prosecutor it depends on the 
particular circumstances of the case quinn said 
i recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37 
marijuana plants perhaps in some counties they might have reduced 
that but as time goes on i feel more strongly about drug cases i 
just think its becoming more of a problem in the country and we 
need to deter that quinn said 
the defense also had raised the argument that zaccaro was 
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his 
mother but the vermont supreme court refused to overturn the 
charges on that basis 
jury selection lasted four days prolonged by wide publicity the 
case had gained but the verdict came only one day after the trial 
itself began 
opening arguments and testimony began friday with the defense 
claiming zaccaro was entrapped by a young inexperienced 
attractive undercover police officer this is a case of improper 
and overzealous police conduct zaccaros lawyer charles 
tetzlaff argued 
he called no witnesses instead basing his defense on attacks on 
the prosecution witnesses and attempting to show the police 
investigation was based purely on rumor and that the undercover buy 
was poorly executed 
but quinn said zaccaro was a wellorganized drug dealer he 
described the deal with undercover officer laura manning as just 
another sale 
when he takes a packet off the tray he opens it up being the 
good merchant that he is looks at it wraps it up and gives 
it to manning quinn said 
mannings drug buy came feb 20 1986 quinn said it was 
arranged after an anonymous note was left on wemettes desk in the 
fall of 1985 with zaccaros name address car registration and the 
words the pharmacist police and prosecutors said zaccaro had 
earned the nickname because of his reputation as a drug dealer 
wemette testified he first heard rumors of zaccaros drug 
dealing in 1984 but did not pursue them because zaccaro left 
college to help his mothers campaign 
most middlebury students questioned about the case said the 
outcome did not concern them my sophomore year it was more 
interesting but now half the people on campus werent even 
here said bob woithe a senior from palm island fla 
the college had reacted to the arrest by forming a task force 
that made 20 recommendations to address student drug abuse most of 
which have been adopted they include the hiring of a health 
educator publication of a drug brochure additional security 
staff and improved relations with the middlebury police

black students at penn state 
university who were arrested after a 15hour sitin gathered at a 
local church sunday and said they still hope to meet with the 
university president 
as long as we have one voice and stay consistent we can 
pretty much have the university do what they say they want to do 
robert blair a student leader told a group of 100 protesters and 
supporters 
blair and other student leaders have said penn state has failed 
to live up to promises to adequately increase black enrollment and 
faculty and give blacks equal opportunity 
last fall penn state failed to reach a courtmandated goal of 5 
percent minority enrollment penn state has 2424 blacks or 36 
percent of its student body of about 67000 
we addressed the same problems 20 years ago as we do today we 
dont want to have to address the problems in the 90s said 
robert e ross an alumnus who is an officer with division 851 of 
the brotherhood of locomotive engineers in philadelphia 
ross said he had been contacting fellow alumni to try to get 
support and possibly legal representatation for the students 
students who had occupied a university building and their 
supporters gathered to map strategy before a service at the united 
black fellowship community church a halfmile from the campus 
student leaders said they still wanted to meet with university 
president bryce jordan and senior administrators to discuss 
minority concerns 
more than 150 students most of them black began their 
occupation of the universitys telecommunications building friday 
afternoon when jordan did not show up for a scheduled meeting with 
black student leaders 
police ended the sitin saturday morning by arresting 91 
students for trespassing or disorderly conduct other students 
participating had already left 
jordan in a statement issued saturday night said a meeting 
remained possible with the black student leaders 
we wish to discuss their concerns under mutually agreeable 
conditions so that the universitys affirmative action program can 
move forward with the support of the entire penn state community 
jordan said 
bill mahon a penn state spokesman said jordan and other top 
administrators didnt attend fridays meeting because the 
administration couldnt reach student leaders to discuss the 
meetings ground rules

union bargainers preparing to represent chrysler 
corp employees at national contract negotiations say they will be 
demanding job protections that workers earned through years of 
sacrifices 
united auto workers vice president marc stepp who took charge 
of the unions chrysler department in 1977 first led national 
negotiations with the automaker in 1979 this years talks 
covering 59500 active and 8000 laidoff workers will be his last 
before he retires stepp said he wants to finish bringing 
chrysler workers back on par with their counterparts at the top two 
automakers general motors corp and ford motor co 
the uaw signed contracts with ford and gm last fall that forbade 
layoffs for any reason except slow sales job security is just as 
big an issue at chrysler which has pushed constantly to 
outsource or move work to lowercost outside suppliers 
the bargainers say they need protection from moves such as 
chryslers recent attempt to sell its 28000worker acustar inc 
parts subsidiary that plan which chrysler backed down from last 
month caused such bitterness that labor and management decided to 
start negotiations early instead of waiting to begin talks in 
midjuly chryslers contract expires sept 14 
chrysler vice president anthony st john has acknowledged that 
chrysler will work within the pattern established with ford and gm 
he has said that chrysler wants to reach an early settlement to end 
the strife with its workers 
part of stepps goal in this years talks is a twoyear 
contract so that all big three contracts will expire together in 
1990 for the first time since 1979 
that year the unions chrysler council and all local uaw 
officials about 1400 delegates met in kansas city mo and 
approved deep sacrifices to save the ailing no 3 automaker 
the uaw eventually gave nearly 2 billion in concessions while 
helping win support in congress for 12 billion in federal loan 
guarantees to rescue chrysler which began operating in the black 
again in 1982 
more than 140 chrysler council delegates returned to kansas city 
last week for a strategy session before returning to the table 
april 18 
stepp instructed bargainers not to speak to reporters and those 
delegates who would talk refused to be quoted by name but almost 
with one voice they insisted that workers shared the credit with 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca for turning the company around 
we were a family a team lee iacocca was just a guy whod 
been fired by ford said one delegate 
in a debate over whether to include about 1000 former american 
motors corp uaw workers from kenosha wis under the chrysler 
contract several opponents used the same argument that they 
didnt live through the cuts 
the kenosha workers eventually were admitted last week but with 
limits on how their seniority would transfer into other chrysler 
plants chrysler bought amc last august leaving 1000 workers at 
two kenosha installations to either bargain with chrysler on their 
own or come under the national contract

many cypriot families spent the greek 
orthodox easter watching events in the kuwaiti airliner hijack 
drama at larnacas beachside airport which continued to operate 
more than a dozen cars and motorbikes lined a road beside the 
airport people sat atop sandy knolls nearby to watch the 
blueandwhite kuwait airways jumbo jet through binoculars 
with the airport functioning normally tension was not evident 
police officers armed with automatic rifles stayed well away 
from the plane 
few people were allowed to approach the boeing 747 which was 
hijacked tuesday on a flight from thailand to kuwait by at least 
six gunmen portable generators used to power air conditioning and 
lights occasionally were changed as they ran out of fuel on the 
tarmac beneath the plane 
food and supplies were pulled up by rope after breakfast was 
provided saturday the hijackers said passengers were asking for 
cigarettes 
the hijackers obviously were well informed about the plane when 
told that the food was still frozen they said they already had 
turned on the microwave ovens 
and when a spare air conditioner was taken aboard they said they 
didnt need instructions on how to install it 
at one point two hijackers wearing blue hoods appeared in the 
planes doorway and threw a huge bag onto the tarmac 
it contained the emergency chutes that had been ripped out to 
block any possible escape attempt by the passengers 
what about the chutes you threw out of the aircraft the 
control tower asked by radio 
well take it away it belongs to kuwait airways the 
hijacker who has served as the planes spokesman replied in broken 
english 
there was a request from the plane for the times of sunrise and 
sunset in cyprus indicating the moslem hijackers wanted to know 
the proper time to kneel and pray facing the holy city of mecca in 
saudi arabia 
for other sections of the small airport which has only four 
departure gates it was business as usual as the summer tourist 
business began to slowly increase 
airliners flew in and out past the kuwaiti jetliner parked at 
the end of a runway beside the mediterranean 
journalists set up shop in a secondfloor conference room they 
were silent when a radio monitor set to the frequency of 
communications between the plane and the control tower began 
broadcasting 
conversations between negotiators and hijackers were 
surprisingly polite and calm even when the gunmen said they had 
killed a passengers and a coffin was needed 
but the hijackers warned officials against stalling when they 
were told that no one could be found to refuel the jet because of 
the holiday other planes were taking on fuel within sight of the 
hijackers

cannons boomed and church bells tolled 
sunday for the 129 men who died a quarter of a century ago aboard 
the uss thresher in the nations worst submarine disaster 
a memorial service at 275yearold north church drew more than 
800 relatives of the men who died aboard the thresher and people 
associated with the nearby portsmouth naval shipyard 
the thresher the most advanced sub of its time left the 
shipyard for a routine cruise developed problems with its nuclear 
reactor and failed to resurface from a dive in the atlantic 220 
miles off the new england coast eventually water pressure crushed 
its hull killing all aboard 
the subs pieces remain on the ocean bottom 
no scar was visible to show where she sank lawrence 
shoberg a navy chaplain said at the service but there would be 
scars scars on the hearts of parents without children wives 
without husbands children without fathers 
retired rear adm dean axene a former commander of the thresher 
who shared the task of breaking news of the deaths to the families 
on april 10 1963 said sunday that the thresher in his mind 
remains a mighty ship manned by a mighty crew still sailing the 
sea 
she was intended to reach a new peak of perfection and she 
did but the price was very high axene said 
when the twohour memorial ended the marines performed a 21gun 
salute outside the church while the shipyard sounded a 21cannon 
salute and area churches tolled their bells 
while attending such services is more pain than some can bear 
neil collier believes he must remember 
collier 4 when his father merrill died spent three years on 
a sub and is an instructor at a navy training center in saratoga 
springs ny 
the memorial service is a big deal to me every year 
collier said but from my point of view the thresher incident 
and what impact it had on national defense is really why its 
important 
collier said the inquiry into the thresher disaster led to safer 
submarine design 
many many lives have been saved because those guys gave their 
lives collier said 
a navy board concluded the threshers problems probably started 
with a leak in the saltwater piping the board said water had 
shorted out electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor 
leaving the submarine powerless 
the navy developed a submarine safety program based on the 
boards findings that included stricter construction methods and 
testing for saltwater piping more initial shallowwater sea trials 
and design improvements

president reagan said sunday the expected 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan was a major 
contribution to improving eastwest relations and pledged 
continued us military aid to the afghan rebels 
differences over us and soviet aid to rival factions in 
afghanistan had been a major obstacle to negotiations in geneva on 
a settlement of the eightyear war and the withdrawal of an 
estimated 115000 soviet troops 
however the two sides appear to have agreed on a compromise 
under which the soviets will continue providing aid to the marxist 
government while the united states gives assistance to the 
anticommunist insurgents 
reagan in a speech to the annual convention of the national 
association of broadcasters at a downtown hotel said he 
anticipated an agreement would be signed in geneva in the very 
near future for a soviet withdrawal 
the pact negotiated under the auspices of the united nations 
is expected to be signed this week with the soviet union and the 
united states guaranteeing a settlement of the war 
if that accord is complied with and the soviets withdraw 
irrevocably from that longsuffering country this will be a great 
victory for its heroic people whom we shall continue to support 
reagan said 
it will also be a major contribution to the improvement of 
eastwest relations the president added 
the united states had offered to cut off aid to the afghan 
rebels but insisted that the soviets stop supplying the afghan 
government the kremlin balked saying it was obligated by treaty 
to aid the kabul regime 
offering a compromise the united states suggested a policy of 
symmetry allowing the two sides to give assistance to rival 
factions 
arriving in las vegas reagan was asked if a deal had been 
struck on afghanistan were very optimistic but nothings been 
signed yet he said 
the president got a warm reception for his speech from the 
audience of several thousand broadcasters 
reagan stopped in las vegas briefly before flying back to 
washington sunday night after a 10day vacation at his mountaintop 
ranch near santa barbara calif 
the speech was the first in a series of foreign policy addresses 
reagan will make before he visits moscow may 29june 2 for his 
fourth summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan specifically said he will be talking about human rights 
and regional conflicts in the coming weeks 
reagan said us foreign policy toward the soviet union has 
changed from containment the mere defense of our interests to 
a strategy based upon the expansion of freedom 
nowhere has the world movement toward freedom and democracy 
been more in evidence than in what might be called the outposts of 
soviet expansionism reagan said 
for in afghanistan cambodia africa and yes nicaragua we 
see domestic insurgencies directed against communist tyrants 
reagan said and it has been a central part of our new strategy 
part of our new commitment to the expansion of freedom to help 
them 
referring to nicaragua reagan said its no secret that i 
believe congress should have done more much more to aid the 
freedom fighters however he said a humanitarian aid package 
signed into law early this month will do much good 
reagan also used the speech to comment on conditions in the 
soviet union saying it was a country that could not feed itself 
and consider this endless shortages and long lines force the 
average soviet family to spend two hours shopping every day just to 
obtain the necessities of life 
reagan challenged gorbachev to tear down a grim invisible 
wall of oppression that blocks the free flow of information and 
ideas to sovietbloc nations 
it is the wall that prevents the communist world from joining 
the west in this new age this dazzling new age of prosperity 
and creativity reagan said 
specifically he called on gorbachev to open the soviet union to 
western newspapers and journals permit western broadcasts to go 
unjammed and to permit access to all books 
here i have a specific first step to suggest reagan said 
mr gorbachev open the soviet union to the works of a great man 
and an historic author open the soviet union to the works of 
alexander solzhenitsyn 
solzhenitsyn one of the soviet unions most famous dissidents 
and writers lives in exile in the united states

dallas cowboys running back herschel 
walker best known for his blistering speed and bruising bursts 
through defensive lines made his ballet debut sunday to the cheers 
of a fanfilled crowd 
about 1300 people attended the season finale of the fort worth 
ballets story series well above the usual numbers for a 
sunday afternoon performance officials said 
the heisman trophy winner took part in webern pieces a 
modern ballet performed with the fort worth companys principal 
dancers maria terezia balogh and joseph malbrough 
the muscular walker said tackling the dance moves was not easy 
when you play football you have a helmet to hide behind and 
nobody can see your eyes but its a lot different out there on the 
stage walker said in football you can improvise if you make 
a mistake but if you do it here everyone knows it 
the audience broke into laughter and applause when walker and 
malbrough ended their piece in the threepoint stance walker uses 
while in the cowboys backfield 
however most were more impressed with walkers being on stage 
than with the dance moves of a running back who took a single 
college ballet course 
i kind of wish he wouldve danced a little more but i do 
admire him for making that kind of contribution dlana anderson 
of fort worth said of walkers slowpaced moves 
during the 25minute performance the 223pound walker 
appearing shirtless often stood still or slowly walked through a 
series of moves with ms balogh once lifting her 115pound body 
above his head and gently passing her over his back 
the ballet depends upon extraordinary physical beings but 
this is even more extraordinary than one should expect poet and 
author william burford of fort worth said of walkers 50inch chest 
and 19inch neck its certainly not a ballet dancers 
physique 
the crowd however was filled with many who said they had never 
attended a ballet including many young boys who came to see their 
football hero several rushed down darkened aisles toward the stage 
when walker first appeared and a crowd of children seeking 
autographs crowded stage doors after the show 
this was a wonderful gesture on mr walkers part and he was 
successful in bringing people out here today who wouldnt have 
otherwise come to the ballet artistic director paul mejia said 
it was exactly what i wanted and more he said im very 
proud of herschel for what hes done here 
performing with a football player was not a new experience for 
mejia and the two dancers all three were involved in the same 
performance at the chicago city ballet with chicago bears wide 
receiver willie gault

families fell ill from eating cucumbers contaminated by aldicarb 
an illegal pesticide authorities said cucumbers with the 
pesticide may have been shipped to four states they said 
one case was reported in the seattle area and one in the renton 
area south of seattle state department of social and health 
services spokesman frank mendizabal said saturday the day the 
alert was issued he had no detail on the exact number of people 
involved 
roger lowell district director for the federal food and drug 
administration in seattle said it is illegal to use aldicarb on 
growing food products but its effect on health is generally 
temporary he said sunday 
the thin cucumbers 12 to 18 inches long and about 1 inches in 
diameter were grown in hothouses in northern california by barnard 
hydroponic of redding and distributed by blue anchor inc of 
sacramento lowell said 
they were distributed by wholesale channels to both independent 
and chain grocers in washington and oregon and maybe in northern 
california and idaho lowell said 
one familys illness was reported about a week ago but couldnt 
be traced to the cucumbers lowell said the second family fell ill 
thursday and laboratory tests confirmed high levels of 
contamination with aldicarb he said 
in oregon there were no reports of illness but state officials 
also issued a public health alert saturday it warned that possibly 
contaminated cucumbers had been distributed to groceries and 
restaurants throughout the state by united grocers inc and pacific 
coast fruit co said dalton hobbs public information officer for 
the state agriculture department 
bruce barnard an owner of barnard hydroponic said sunday that 
he would not comment on the situation until he had had a chance to 
talk with fda officials there was no answer at blue anchor on 
sunday 
symptoms of ingestion of aldicarb include nausea vomiting and 
diarrhea within one hour of eating lowell said other symptoms can 
include blurred vision excessive sweating and muscle twitching 
lowell said sunday that officials are unaware of any permanent 
health damage adding that the symptoms pass quickly like the flu 
in fact he said many people who may have gotten sick in the last 
week may have thought they were suffering from the flu 
aldicarb is a treatment for soil before crops are grown and is 
used mostly for nonfood crops such as cotton lowell said aldicarb 
is the same pesticide that contaminated watermelons distributed 
along the west coast two years ago

the hijackers of a kuwaiti jumbo jet 
offered to trade passengers for fuel sunday and threatened to crash 
the aircraft into kuwaits royal palace they also warned of a 
slow and quiet massacre of their hostages if their demands were 
not met 
a flight engineer said the hijackers who are demanding the 
release of 17 proiranian terrorists imprisoned in kuwait had 
started to hurt one of the passengers 
it is believed there are still 53 people aboard the kuwait 
airways boeing 747 including three members of kuwaits ruling 
alsabah family and at least six hijackers 
in lebanon a proiranian group threatened to kill kidnapped 
american and french hostages if any attempt was made to storm the 
plane 
a statement from the islamic jihad terrorist group was delivered 
to the reuters news agency in west beirut along with photographs 
of journalists terry a anderson an american and jeanpaul 
kauffmann of france 
to the families of the hostages we declare that we shall 
execute the western captives in lebanon if the plane and holy 
warriors hijackers aboard are subjected to any military 
foolhardiness the statement said 
in cyprus the arab hijackers who have killed one passenger 
since seizing the plane tuesday threatened to kill their captives 
but a noon deadline passed without any additional slayings 
one minute before a second deadline expired four hours later 
the engineer relaying the hijackers messages to larnaca airport 
control tower said theyve already started to hurt one of the 
passengers he gave no details 
later the hijackers offered to free 20 of the passengers in 
return for fuel but that was rejected at kuwaits insistence 
negotiators talked with the hijackers for 20 minutes late sunday 
and cypriot government spokesman akis fantis said there was an 
important contact right now and by tomorrow morning we shall know 
the result that we would hope to be what we wish to have 
its the same offer always the release of the hostages for 
fuel he said there is no change in the offer we want the 
hostages to be released then we refuel but there is a new 
element not changing the offer but maybe changing their 
attitudes the element is good and gives a certain hope and thats 
all 
fantis did not elaborate and when asked about the mood of the 
hijackers he said they wished us a good night he then was 
asked about the possibility of police action and he replied no 
comment 
in a morning statement one of the hijackers told the control 
tower we hereby reannounce our refueling request due to our 
intention to go to kuwait the concerned country and if kuwait 
refuses us a crash landing will take place on the princes 
palace 
speaking in broken english he urged cypriot authorities to send 
fuel to prevent the slow and quiet massacre taking place in this 
country 
sunday night the hijackers put on the radio a man they said was 
fadel khaled alsabah a member of kuwaits extensive ruling 
family in a faint voice the man recited a verse from the koran 
islams holy book saying we depend on god for our fate 
the tower asked is that it one of the hijackers replied 
yes thats it because hes sick 
the hijacker said the man could not hold down food and was 
vomiting asked if a doctor was needed the hijacker said he would 
advise the tower monday morning 
senior palestine liberation organization officials in cyprus met 
with the hijackers four times sunday the plo is believed to be a 
key factor in negotiations 
the plane landed in larnaca on friday flight 422 was 
commandeered tuesday en route to kuwait from bangkok with 112 
people aboard and forced to land in mashhad in northeastern iran 
where 57 people were released 
the jet left iran and landed in larnaca after being refused 
permission to land in lebanon and syria another captive an ailing 
32yearold kuwaiti was freed in larnaca apparently after plo 
intervention 
on saturday the hijackers killed a 24yearold kuwaiti police 
border guard aboard the plane his body was tossed onto the tarmac 
after the cypriots refused to refuel the jet 
fantis said sunday that marks on the mans body indicated he had 
been badly beaten 18 to 24 hours before his death 
between meetings with plo officials several hijackers wearing 
blue hoods ripped out inflatable orange escape chutes inside the 
jet and dumped them on the tarmac 
then they demanded that ground staff remove the chutes so they 
would not obstruct the plane 
at 3 pm the engineer radioed the tower if the hijackers 
dont get a positive response in one hour and 15 minutes regarding 
fuel and services they will start hurting occupants of the 
aircraft 
when the tower urged the hijackers to free sick passengers the 
engineer replied negative 
one of the hijackers said they would release their captives 
immediately if the 17 proiranian extremists convicted in kuwait 
for bombing the us and french embassies there in december 1983 
were freed cypriot officials said the kuwaitis refused 
the nationalities and identities of the hijackers have not been 
disclosed released passengers said they spoke arabic with a 
lebanese accent 
but their demand for the release of the 17 men all but one 
shiite moslems imprisoned in kuwait is identical to that made by 
shiite extremists holding two americans and at least three 
frenchmen hostage in lebanon 
the american hostages are anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press and thomas sutherland 56 
acting dean of agriculture at the american university of beirut 
both were kidnapped in 1985 by the islamic jihad 
the islamic jihad or islamic holy war is linked to lebanons 
hezbollah or party of god the plo is allied in lebanon with 
hezbollah a fundamentalist shiite movement with strong links to 
irans revolutionary government

the acquittals of white supremacist 
leaders accused of plotting to overthrow the government poses a 
dilemma for them and their followers how to justify their 
opposition to a government that treated them fairly 
some of those familiar with the movement say that thursdays 
verdict acquitting all 13 defendants of sedition and other charges 
effectively neutralized the supremacists whereas conviction would 
have only made them martyrs 
but others fear the verdicts by the allwhite federal jury will 
only encourage the extremists in their campaign of violence aimed 
particularly against blacks and jews

an advertising agency lost a longtime job 
creating ads for a cookie and candy company last week apparently 
because it made a commercial for another clients new nosmoking 
policy that angered the cookiemakers bosses who also make 
cigarettes 
officials at both the ad agency saatchi amp saatchi dfs inc and 
the food and tobacco company rjr nabisco inc declined repeated 
requests last week to discuss what led to the blowup which ended 
an 18year relationship 
rjr attributed the dismissal to philosophical differences 
saatchi said it was very saddened and disappointed by the 
decision 
but reports on the situation captivated both advertising 
executives and those who follow the business for days 
some said the firing was unwarranted others called it an 
understandable emotional reaction by a company facing growing 
pressures from groups who want to outlaw some of its profitable 
products 
if i was rjr i would have done the same thing said george 
lois chairman of lois pitts gershon ponggk in new york 
rjr lives breathes and exists on cigarettes here is an 
agency that does a commercial that shows planeload of people 
embarrassing a cigarette smoker i can see the emotional reaction 
that rjr had and i dont think its an irrational reaction thats 
how rjr exists he said 
the commercial at issue was an ad for northwest airlines that 
showed passengers standing to applaud when informed that the 
airline soon would ban smoking on nearly all its domestic flights 
others say the agency may have saved itself a lot of trouble if 
only it had informed the tobacco company in advance of the 
campaign rjr nabisco reportedly was upset partly because it wasnt 
told about the imminent antismoking ads 
one saatchi executive insisting on anonymity said the agency 
should have thought it through more and informed rjr about its 
involvement once the ads started running but he indicated that 
because the agency was admaker only for rjr nabiscos cookie and 
candy businesses not its tobacco products the logic of that 
approach wasnt apparent at the time 
it is not the first time an agency has upset one client by 
taking on an assignment in an apparently unrelated area 
hallmark cards inc for instance changed ad agencies in 1984 
after its old agency won the assignment of making commercials for a 
longdistance telephone service the kansas citybased greeting 
card maker felt the sentimental approach it took in selling its 
cards was too similar to that taken by the phone company in selling 
calls to family and friends 
we were uncomfortable with a single agency doing both pieces 
of work said steven doyal a spokesman for hallmark we were 
not certain the agency could maintain the level of consistent 
advertising excellence that both companies would want with the same 
style of advertising 
one of the ironies in the rjrsaatchi case is that the agency 
did no cigarette advertising for rjr in fact saatchi creates 
commercials for true cigarettes which are made by rjr rival 
lorillard inc 
we dont like that northwest ad at all and we told them 
so said sara ridgway a spokeswoman for lorillard but we did 
not fire them we didnt think it warranted firing them 
she said lorillard has had a good relationship with the agency 
since hiring it in 1980 the company thought about changing 
agencies last year and invited several others to compete for the 
true account but ultimately decided that saatchis work was the 
best one for our product 
steven a greyser professor of marketing at the harvard 
business school said that is the way businesses should make 
decisions 
he said saatchis longevity in creating ads for rjrs life 
savers candy for 18 years and its nabisco cookies for 12 years 
indicates the agency must have been doing its job 
i see this as an inherently kneejerk reaction by some people 
who dont understand why they hired an advertising agency in the 
first place to provide excellent advertising and good service 
greyser said 
it was not a very smart thing to do he said

patrick reynolds grandson of tobacco magnate 
rj reynolds is pouring his antismoking fervor into a 
behaviormodification kit to help people kick the habit 
reynolds said in an interview saturday he has set up 
headquarters in chicago for his business the reynolds stop smoking 
program which sells kits bearing the same name 
the kit being testmarketed in 20 cities contains audio 
cassettes a workbook and a 30day supply of beta carotene a 
naturally occurring nutrient that some studies have suggested may 
reduce lung cancer risk he said 
the kit is just the latest effort by reynolds 39 who has 
become an increasingly active antismoking campaigner since he gave 
up cigarettes four years ago he has promoted his message in 
television talk show appearances letters to the president and in 
congressional testimony 
his efforts attracted the attention of the world health 
organization which honored reynolds at a washington ceremony 
friday along with other activists including victoria brynner 
daughter of lung cancer victim yul brynner actor larry hagman and 
former president jimmy carter 
reynolds motive is a very personal one 
my grandfather rj reynolds helped popularize smoking in 
america and i want to do everything i can now that we know how 
dangerous it is to help people stop he said saturday 
reynolds said his only memories of his father rj reynolds 
jr are of a man lying down gasping for breath 
he died of emphysema at 58 caused by his cigarette habit 
when i was 15 
though reynolds took up the habit four years later for the 
usual reasons wanting to attract older girls and so on he 
stopped in 1984 and became increasingly disturbed about what was 
going on 
and i found that cigarettes for example were the most 
heavily advertised products in all of america tobacco companies 
were spending over 2 billion a year advertising cigarettes that 
amounts to 8 a year for every man woman and child in this 
country 
believing cigarette companies target their ads at the young 
reynolds testified in 1986 before congress in favor of a ban on all 
cigarette advertising 
he said he also has pushed for raising cigarette taxes banning 
smoking on airplanes and enacting tough clean indoor air laws and 
has endorsed a project to support product liability lawsuits 
against tobacco companies 
calls to the tobacco institute in washington on sunday were not 
answered the tobacco industry claims no link between smoking and 
disease has ever been proven 
reynolds activities have drawn criticism from his siblings who 
have claimed his campaign is a publicity stunt the tobacco heir 
has just completed a book about his family due out next year with 
the tentative title the gilded leaf three generations of the 
rj reynolds tobacco company and fortune 
but reynolds said he has given up his acting career which 
included a number of television appearances and the lead role in 
the science fiction movie eliminators to devote all of his 
time to antismoking activities 
in his new venture he said he has sold about 11000 of his 
behaviormodification kits at 1988 each since he began marketing 
them last christmas through a tollfree telephone number advertised 
on television he also plans to market the kits to corporations and 
hospitals 
the man who inherited 25 million from his grandfather when he 
turned 21 but later sold his stock in rjr nabisco inc the 
conglomerate that runs the family tobacco company said he plans to 
donate a substantial portion of the profit from the kits to the 
american lung association american cancer society and other 
antismoking groups 
reynolds serves as a roving ambassador for the american lung 
association spokeswoman elaine chapnick said sunday 
but she said reynolds stopsmoking kit has not been evaluated 
by the association which sells its own kit containing a videotape 
audiotape and workbook for 5995 through local lung associations

nothing burns in its 10 fireplaces no glasses 
clink at any of its five bars and its dog shower goes unoccupied 
in fact all 23000 square feet of the newly completed 85 
million north dallas mansion are empty and unused except for an 
occasional party designed to show the house off to prospective 
buyers 
the mansion on 15 acres in the prestigious preston hollow area 
is believed to be the largest most expensive ever built on 
speculation in dallas it was completed last month but still does 
not have an owner 
but builder john needham who began the house more than two 
years ago when the citys housing economy was near its peak says 
he believes there is a market for his sevenbedroom creation 
there is an intense amount of interest in it but its 
hard to say with a house of this magnitude needham said 
the house does have magnitude 
needham was interviewed at a recent landscape lighting party 
intended to highlight the five gardens around the mansions 
olympicsize swimming pool and reflecting ponds 
the largest of the seven bedrooms practically is a house in 
itself its a twolevel 3800 squarefoot master suite with its 
own small kitchen his and hers bathrooms a whirlpool a sitting 
area and dressing rooms upstairs is room for a desk plus several 
sofas 
the threestory building also includes a twostory library 
complete with a bar reading rooms and a wine rack a billiard room 
and an exercise room both accessible by elevator 
of course the servants quarters has its own staircase in back 
so the help do not interrupt family suppers in the banquet hall or 
a party centered around the grand saloon 
the sixcar garage has its own car wash so the chauffeur doesnt 
have to wait in line at the car wash on a hot summer day 
and then theres the doggy shower it was included in the 
large laundry room because theres never any place to wash the dog 
in a house explained rona victorson the real estate agent 
attempting to sell the mansion 
despite its price tag and size ms victorson and needham say 
the mansion is attracting prospective buyers 
weve had people from out of town and dallasites interested 
ms victorson said i feel the large properties are now beginning 
to sell 
when needham began the house the dallas housing market was 
riding a booming regional economy that was buoyed by sturdy oil 
prices several large multimilliondollar homes were sold before 
they were completed including the pink house down the street owned 
by cosmetics magnate mary kay ash 
although the subsequent oil slump hammered the real estate 
market needham said the dallas market is improving and at least 
two other houses in a similar price range are being built 
we feel very comfortable that the house is going to sell 
needham said in light of todays market we had to go ahead and 
get it finished first if the market had been better we could have 
sold it with just the framing 
the house originally cost 75 million but the price tag was 
raised to 85 million after needham decided to complete the house 
dr barbara reagan an economist at southern methodist 
university said a house that expensive would be more difficult to 
sell but not impossible in the improving area housing market 
its very locationspecific but its perking up a little 
bit she said of the market some areas are holding up better 
than others were kind of just bumping along 
ms victorson said she never thought the dallas housing market 
was doing as poorly as some people perceived but she acknowledged 
interest in the house hasnt been as great as it might have been 
several years ago 
weve had certainly a sluggish economy she said but a 
lot of the dallas players that may have dropped out are back in 
it

hoping the american taste for the curve ball 
and the drop kick survives longer than it did for singles bars and 
discos marriott corp is spreading the sports bar theme at its 
hotels and resorts 
a new licensing agreement with champions a sportsoriented 
restaurant and lounge chain will bring the chain into as many as 
18 marriott hotels and resorts nationwide in 1988 according to 
bethesda mdbased marriott 
the agreement was made after a pilot test in marriotts copley 
place in boston turned out to be a rousing success 
were doing double the business we did there before said 
karl kilburg marriott senior vice president of food and beverage 
operations it exceeded all our projectionswere very very 
satisfied and we have great hopes for the future 
champions sports inc now a publiclyheld corporation began in 
1983 as a sports bar in the affluent georgetown section of 
washington owner michael oharo had successfully operated a 
singles bar in the late 1960s and a disco in the mid70s but 
decided to strive for something that could stand the test of time 
we looked all over and came to the conclusion that americans 
are interested in two things religion and sports oharo said 
i couldnt see building a bar around religion and to many sports 
is religion 
oharo aiming for more than just an establishment with a few 
posters and a bigscreen tv decked the bar with sports 
memorabilia including a car that ran in the 1933 indianapolis 500 
various team jerseys and thousands of baseball cards 
from day one the bar has been has been a killer success he 
claimed 
oharo opened a similar bar in suburban falls church va and 
in 1986 an outside group of investors joined him to license the 
champions name they say they hit the jackpot with marriott 
i never thought it would get this big oharo said it 
just happened and the key was marriott that just set us apart 
that they would pick us from all the other sports bars in the 
country 
marriott liked the theme and was convinced such establishments 
would attract local sports fans as well as travelers 
the whole concept is another way of meeting the needs and 
expectations of our clients said marriott spokesman nick hill 
instead of ordering room service and sitting in front of the 
tv a traveler can go down and enjoy a drink and something to eat 
without having to tolerate bright swirling lights and loud 
music hill said 
also sports bars attract patrons of both sexes contrary to 
stereotypes that might indicate otherwise said andrew oehmann 
chief executive of champions 
we have found that we get a lot of women in here he said 
i think its because its not threatening it is not your typical 
singles bar 
marriott will pay champions a fee of between 30000 and 45000 
for each of the champions restaurants it opens plus a percentage 
of the restaurants sales 
champions helps design each new restaurant provides up to 600 
pieces of memorabilia from its stock of 8000 items sets up the 
floor plan and trains the staff 
construction already is underway to build a champions at the 
marriott in tampa fla and kilburg said officials are pondering 
champions in los angeles san diego and portland ore 
if we continue to do well we could continue to roll them 
out kilburg said major cities or small towns it doesnt 
matter 
kilburg thinks the format will be a lasting one 
the decor is timeless he said it seems that mixing 
sports food and drink is the right thing and i think it will 
still be the right thing 10 years down the road
