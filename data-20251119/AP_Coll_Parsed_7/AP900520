mississippi

wheat thats gone in the flooded areas said larry michaud of 
the state agriculture department there will be extensive damage 
to the cotton in the area 
the red river was returning to its banks in arkansas but 
preliminary damage estimates were rising

livingston dam on the trinity river in southeastern texas and flew 
over flooded areas downstream on the river northeast of houston 
this is remarkable bush told polk county judge wayne baker 
i remember it was fairly dry here not too many years ago 
the federal emergency management agency announced saturday that 
three more texas counties were declared disaster areas due to 
spring flooding bringing the total to 41 of the states 254 
counties 
flood crests moving down the trinity had forced managers of the 
livingston dam to release water through the spillways at the rate 
of 100800 cubic feet per second or 756000 gallons a second since 
thursday morning

done most of its damage but forecasters warned farmers and 
riverfront businesses along the upper mississippi river to prepare 
for high water from storms in the midwest 
the red was expected to crest at 40 feet eight above flood 
stage sunday at alexandria in central louisiana but levees and 
floodgates protect most of area between alexandria and avoyelles 
parish where the red meets the bigger atchafalaya river officials 
said 
at least 90000 acres about 140 square miles of farmland has 
been flooded in louisiana government officials said 
the army corps of engineers had predicted that 350000 acres of 
farmland and about an equal amount of forest land would be flooded 
however corps hydrologist frankie griggs said those estimates had 
not been revised to take into account flood crests a foot lower 
than originally expected 
in western iowa more than 200 people living along perry creek 
in sioux city including 77 from a nursing home were evacuated 
early saturday because of a flash flood but were able to return 
home after sunrise the flood followed as much as 45 inches of 
rain overnight 
southern illinois braced for more storms and the prospect of 
flash flooding saturday as rivers strained to handle the runoff of

romanians went to the polls sunday in 
their first free elections in more than 50 years after a violent 
campaign that polarized and politicized this former hardline 
communist country 
some 12400 polling places opened throughout the country at 6 
am as voters turned out to choose a president and members of a 
506seat twochamber parliament 
these elections are a step toward democracy said alexandru 
georgescu who cast his ballot for the national peasants party one 
of romanias old parties which was dissolved by the communists in 
1947 
georgescu who also was supervising voting at the dorobanti 
polling station in downtown bucharest said some 45 out of 3600 
registered voters in the district cast ballots in the first half 
hour after the polls opened 
were voting for our future and happiness we hope to get 
higher pensions and more medicines vasile asafiei a pensioner 
told the associated press 
the elections drew about 500 foreign observers and the attention 
of a world eager to see whether romania is truly on the road to 
democracy government officials promised that it would be a clean 
election 
some feared romanias history of election fraud and intimidation 
would be repeated including protesters who have a held a fourweek 
demonstration against the interim government and blocked the citys 
main thoroughfare 
but others said the secret balloting for president and a 
twochamber parliament will be fair 
the world is watching and that has a cooling effect on those 
with hot heads and it gives a powerful push for those people who 
want tolerance and fair elections said one observer jim king 
senior vice president of northeastern university in boston 
gen corneliu diamandescu first deputy interior minister told 
the daily tineretul liber saturday that 40000 police and army 
troops would be deployed at polling centers to prevent or 
neutralize manifestations of disorder acts of hooliganism 
violence or rumors which could provoke panic 
the first preliminary results were not expected until monday 
and the final official tally is due to be released friday 
staterun television devoted its entire evening news program 
saturday to coverage of the election and promises by officials that 
they would be fair 
a government statement exhorted the more than 16 million 
eligible voters to turn out for the first democratic election since 
1937 
one american observer professor radu florescu read a statement 
on tv by sen edward m kennedy dmass promising that the united 
states would restore romanias mostfavorednation trading status 
if the elections were clean 
romania lost the preferential status in 1988 because of human 
rights abuses by the regime of nicolae ceausescu who was toppled 
in decembers popular revolution and executed 
the latest opinion poll published saturday gave interim 
president ion iliescu and his national salvation front which took 
power during the revolution an overwhelming 70 percent of the vote 
in the threeway presidential race 
radu campeanu of the national liberal party had 11 percent 
followed by ion ratiu of the national peasants party with 7 percent 
the nationwide poll of 2250 people was conducted may 11 to 18 
by what the state rompres news agency described as the 
nongovernment and apolitical organization dacia 
the front a loose grouping of former communists workers and 
technocrats says it favors a gradual move toward a free market 
economy to avoid high unemployment the liberals and peasants 
backed by young people and intellectuals favor a more rapid move 
to westernstyle capitalist economy 
seventy parties across the political spectrum fielded candidates 
for parliament but only half a dozen had a chance of winning seats 
romania was the only east european country to break violently 
with its communist past and its election campaign has been marred 
by violence several opposition party workers were reported killed 
and ratiu and campeanu narrowly escaped being mobbed and lynched 
opposition parties have accused the iliescu government of 
maintaining control over radio television and newsprint thereby 
denying them unrestricted access to the voters 
king said he believed the government had not done enough to stop 
harassment and intimidation he said he had seen policemen stand 
and watch as people were beaten at rallies 
the romanian society is not a tolerant society said king 
one of 60 observers sponsored by the us democratic and republican 
parties it has no history of democracy and it relies in many 
key areas on the government to set the tone and the direction for 
conduct 
campaigning officially ended thursday night and as of saturday 
night no further violence had been reported 
only the anticommunist demonstrators in central bucharests 
university square ignored the ban on political campaigning 
repeatedly denouncing iliescu and the front as neocommunists 
many of the 700 protesters in the square on saturday said they 
feared the elections will be rigged 
they will fiddle with the votes in the computers and we are 
scared of the outcome said beatrice andrei 23 who has spent 20 
days sleeping in the tentcamp in the square 
the government saturday night appealed to the demonstrators to 
leave the main thoroughfare they have blocked for 28 days to allow 
traffic through during voting hours 
protest leader dumitru dinca said friday the demonstrators would 
remain until romania has a democratic government untainted by links 
to ceausescu

a major earthquake rocked southern sudan 
early sunday near the wartorn regions largest city which is 
crammed with refugees 
there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries but 
experts said widespread destruction was virtually certain given the 
magnitude of the quake 
scientists said the quakes epicenter was only 60 miles 
northeast of the city of juba whose normal population of 125000 
has more than doubled with people fleeing the countrys civil war 
the epicenter was near the nile river about 700 miles south of 
khartoum the capital of the african country 
most of southern sudan is controlled by the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army western relief workers are posted in juba and 
other major cities still controlled by the government 
the quake registering 75 on the richter scale occurred at 
422 am said geologist rashad m kebeasy president of egypts 
national research institute of astronomy and geophysics 
the quake was registered by egypts two principal seismic 
monitoring stations kebeasy said 
pat jorgenson a spokeswoman for the us geological survey in 
menlo park calif reported identical data 
its such a big quake that the monitoring stations are 
saturated with data so its difficult to get everything precise 
right now kebeasy said this is an extremely dangerous 
earthquake it is the first time that such a quake has struck this 
area 
kebeasy an expert on earthquakes in northeast africa said the 
epicenter lies just west of the great african rift an earthquake 
zone stretching 4000 miles from mozambique through the red sea to 
lebanon 
its proximity to the rift accounts for the quakes ferocity 
kebeasy said 
warn people to beware he said we can expect large and 
very dangerous aftershocks for the next two days he said 
the sudan peoples liberation army launched its rebellion in 
1983 demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms for the 
countrys three southern provinces whose population is mostly 
animist or christian the rest of the country is predominantly 
moslem 
hundreds of thousands of people mainly civilians have died 
either from the fighting or the famine it has caused 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
every increase of one number say from magnitude 55 to 
magnitude 65 means that the ground motion is 10 times greater 
magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage magnitude 8 is a great earthquake 
capable of tremendous damage the october 17 1989 earthquake near 
san francisco measured 71 on the richter scale

a former israeli soldier armed 
with an assault rifle killed seven palestinian laborers and wounded 
11 on sunday the unprovoked attack caused widespread rioting in 
the occupied territories that left at least five more arabs dead 
and hundreds injured 
the assailant dressed in army pants and a black jacket 
confronted the laborers ordered them to sit in a line then opened 
fire police said the victims apparently followed his orders 
because they mistook him for a soldier 
the army called up reinforcements and imposed curfews on the 
entire gaza strip and half a dozen refugee camps and cities in the 
west bank confining more than a million people to their homes 
but palestinians wild with anger over the assault on the 
laborers outside rishon letzion near tel aviv defied the 
stayathome orders and attacked army outposts stoned passing 
israeli cars and blocked roads arab reports said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir went on israel radio to condemn 
the attack on the laborers and called on palestinians to ignore 
agitators who sought to incite riots in the occupied lands already 
torn by the 29monthold uprising 
we were all disgusted by the terrible crime that happened 
today it is a cruel crime without any justification shamir said 
police and witnesses said up to 50 laborers were present during 
the attack and that seven were killed and 11 wounded five 
seriously an earlier police report had said that eight 
palestinians died in the attack 
police said the shooting of the unarmed palestinian laborers at 
a busy road junction was the gravest incident of its kind in memory 
they arrested a 21yearold former soldier who was recently 
discharged from the military after serving a jail term for defying 
his commander 
arab reporters said five palestinians were killed in gaza and 
two in the west bank in rioting that followed the assault on the 
laborers arab hospitals and united nations clinics in gaza 
reported more than 400 injuries from live ammunition rubber and 
plastic bullets beatings and tear gas inhalation 
the army said at least five palestinians were killed in rioting 
there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries among israeli 
soldiers 
in all it was one of the bloodiest days since the palestinian 
uprising began and could rekindle the violence that had been 
declining in the occupied territories in recent months before 
sundays violence 688 palestinians and 43 israelis had died in the 
unrest 
police said the former soldier who carried out the attack took 
his brothers israelimade galil assault rifle 
they said he hid in the underbrush near rishon letzion a town 
five miles south of tel aviv emerging shortly after dawn to 
confront a group of day laborers he ordered to sit in a line 
khalil abu amsha 30 a worker wounded in the left arm and leg 
said he was in a car that was flagged down by the gunman survivors 
said they thought the gunman was a soldier because he wore army 
pants 
we thought he wanted to check the car said abu amsha 
noting that 20 palestinians were already seated on the ground when 
the car pulled up 
he said sit by your friends we sat he said take out your 
magnetic identity cards he said do you know why i stopped 
you we said no he said good that you dont know 
then he opened fire 
abu amsha said he managed to roll into a ditch after being hit 
the attack occurred about 100 yards from the busy roses 
junction an intersection outside rishon lezion arab laborers from 
the gaza strip gather daily about dawn in a field near the 
intersection to be picked up for construction work and other day 
jobs jobs in israel 
police said the assailant gave himself up at the home of a 
friend police said the man gave a motive of unrequited love as the 
reason for his attack 
in interrogation he sounded very relaxed he didnt express 
regret he sat calmly and explained things said haim klein 
police commander of the southern district he spoke of personal 
motives that brought him to do this i dont know if that is 
accurate 
speaking on israel army radio klein said the suspect did not 
mention political motives but the question arises if they were 
personal motives then why did he attack arabs and not jews 
palestinian leaders blamed shamirs rightwing government for 
creating an antiarab atmosphere that encouraged extremist acts 
against arabs 
faisal husseini a prominent proplo activist said shamir and 
his allies had created a climate for antiarab actions 
even if this man is mentally sick the atmosphere created by 
such a government is responsible he told the associated press

sterilization law for the mentally retarded performed 5500 
operations in the 14 months after the law took effect an official 
report said sunday 
officials in the northwestern province of gansu said their goal 
was to sterilize most of gansus 260000 mentally retarded 
residents by the end of next year the peoples daily newspaper 
said 
since the law was enacted in january 1989 gansu has set up a 
diagnostic network and required examination for all couples 
planning to marry it also has sent teams to villages with large 
numbers of mentally retarded to do ideological work among the 
relatives and guardians 
arid remote gansu one of chinas poorest regions has several 
large concentrations of mentally and physically handicapped people 
due in part to inbreeding in isolated villages 
the peoples daily said one county had more than 700 mentally 
handicapped people but that medical teams had sterilized 516 
china has said it is drafting a national eugenics law to reduce 
the births of inferior and abnormal children to a minimum 
according to the official china daily newspaper 
the paper said the national law also would bar the mentally 
retarded or people with hereditary diseases from marrying without 
first being sterilized 
the government says there are 50 million physically or mentally 
handicapped people nationwide out of a population of more than 1 
billion 
china does not regard childbirth as a private matter healthy 
parents in most areas of the country are restricted to one child 
with the timing of the birth decided by local authorities or ones

the government rescinded a decree banning 
male hairdressers from working in beauty parlors after a court 
ruled the order was unconstitutional an interior ministry official 
said sunday 
the ban has been withdrawn and things will go back to what 
they were before in a few days the official said in an interview 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
ministry moved after the supreme court ruled last week the ban was 
illegal a violation of constitutional provisions which 
stipulate equal rights for men and women 
the ministry said may 6 it would no longer issue permits for 
male ownership of beauty parlors and that male hairdressers could 
no longer work in beauty shops 
the court also overturned the ownership provision of the decree 
and it also was rescinded by the government 
the decree against men associated with beauty parlors was the 
result of pressure by islamic groups especially the influential 
moslem brotherhood movement which has the largest bloc in jordans 
80seat parliament islamic tradition says men and women must not 
mingle in public and women are supposed to keep their hair covered 
in the presence of strange men 
but the ministry ban raised protests from moderate groups labor 
unions womens organizations and human rights activists also 
lobbied against the ban 
prime minister mudar badrans government had earlier bowed to 
demands by islamic groups that included banning alcohol on royal 
jordanian airlines flights to arab and islamic countries but he 
rejected calls to close down bars and nightclubs in this 
predominantly moslem country of 31 million people 
the moslem brotherhood emerged as the strongest party in 
parliament when it won almost two dozen seats in last novembers 
elections the first in more than 22 years another dozen 
independent islamic activists were also elected 
the brotherhood pledged to introduce stricter islamic laws ban 
lewd tv programs and limit womens freedom including prohibiting 
women from working

police prevented a mass suicide by more than 100 
followers of a peasant woman preacher who said the world was coming 
to an end and promised salvation an official report said sunday 
the workers daily said the followers all residents of a 
central china village were prepared to drink poisoned liquor and 
pesticides on the orders of xiong chenhua 
the paper said the incident occurred in october in henan 
provinces tongbo mountain district chinese newspapers often 
report events weeks or months after they occur being concerned 
less with news than with teaching a lesson 
more than 20 women were kneeling on the ground in yellow 
clothing with red insignia waiting for xiong to return from a 
meeting with jesus when more than 10 police descended from the 
sky the newspaper said sarcastically the other followers were 
waiting for the women to call them when it was time to take the 
poison it said

appeared to blend elements of christianity with superstition it 
said she had been enlisted in 1985 by an older preacher identified

go with her to heaven if they cultivated more believers

us corporations are paying higher taxes 
since the 1986 tax overhaul but many profitable companies still pay 
less than 10 percent of their earnings to the federal government 
congressional auditors have found 
the average effective us tax rate for 220 large companies rose 
from 186 percent in 1986 to 278 percent a year later the general 
accounting office estimated 
the increases seem consistent with the intent of the 
changes introduced by the tax reform act of 1986 which reduced 
or eliminated several corporate deductions in exchange for lower 
tax rates gao said last week 
reps donald pease dohio and byron dorgan dnd who had 
requested the gao report hailed the findings 
were not prepared to make sweeping conclusions at this point 
but based on this report from the first year after tax reform 
were encouraged that tax reform is having the effect we 
intended the lawmakers said in a statement 
the report found a narrowing of the wide disparities among how 
much different industries pay in federal income taxes but the gap 
still exists 
for example the soap and cosmetics industry paid an effective 
tax taxes paid divided by taxable income of 458 percent of 
us income the rubber industry 19 percent computers 124 
percent and automobile manufacturers 39 percent 
the effective rates paid by individual companies within an 
industry group also vary widely due not only to a companys 
performance in a given year but bookkeeping methods as well 
chrysler corp for example reported a 1987 pretax profit of 
18 billion and paid us income tax of 118 percent ford had 
nearly 53 billion in profits and paid 24 percent general motors 
reported 13 billion profit but because of expenditures for 
equipment showed a negative tax rate of 999 percent 
a negative tax rate occurred when 1987 earnings were exceeded by 
expenses in such a case a corporation could receive a refund of 
taxes paid in some prior year 
gm had a refund of 1303800000 which is stated as a 
negative number in calculating the effective tax rate dividing the 
refund by gms earnings 1304700000 equals negative 999 
percent 
among oil companies exxon paid 235 percent tax on a 24 
billion profit amoco paid 307 percent on profits of 12 billion 
and texaco whose pretax income was shown as a 65 billion loss 
because of litigation growing from a takeover battle paid a 
negative tax rate of 35 percent 
overall gao found that 41 of the 220 companies had effective 
us tax rates in 1987 of less than 10 percent they included 
warner communications 22 percent rockwell international 67 
percent international business machines 03 percent and merrill 
lynch amp co 01 percent 
on the other hand 44 companies reported effective rates above 
the 40 percent statutory rate that was in effect in 1987 among 
them jc penney co 475 percent sara lee corp 507 percent 
and general dynamics 1064 percent 
by comparison the internal revenue service estimates an 
individual with income in the 25000to30000 range paid an 
effective rate of 10 percent in 1987 those with incomes above 1 
million paid an average 287 percent 
the gao report dealt only with how the new law affected 
individual corporations and industry groups it did not address 
whether corporations share of all federal taxes is rising or 
falling 
a major goal of the 1986 law was to shift about 24 billion a 
year of tax burden from individuals to corporations other 
government reports indicate the shift has been considerably less 
than that due in part to lowerthanexpected corporate profits 
the failure of corporate taxes to meet forecasts is a key reason 
that the budget deficit is worsening

police drastically increased security overnight 
and set up roadblocks but the chinese capital was calm on the 
first anniversary of the declaration of martial law that preceded 
last years crackdown 
the government imposed martial law in beijing on may 20 last 
year just five weeks after students began the massive 
prodemocracy movement that drew hundreds of thousands of chinese 
into the streets 
premier li peng appeared on nationwide television then saying 
the anarchic situation is going from bad to worse and we are 
forced to take resolute and decisive measures to put an end to the 
turmoil 
the military crushed the prodemocracy movement june 34 when 
soldiers drove protesters from tiananmen square hundreds perhaps 
thousands of people were killed and thousands more wounded 
until martial law was lifted on jan 11 soldiers or police 
armed with semiautomatic rifles were stationed at key intersections 
and bridges throughout the capital 
unlike april 15 when armed police ringed tiananmen square on 
the anniversary of the start of the prodemocracy movement the 
plaza was open sunday and full of people enjoying their day off 
under sunny skies 
the scene was very different overnight however at midnight 
saturday police set up at least 14 checkpoints at major 
intersections along beijings main thoroughfare changan avenue 
and along a major road that circles central beijing 
the police a few carrying semiautomatic rifles or pistols 
stopped bicyclists and cars demanding identification papers and 
sometimes searching cars and trunks 
at one checkpoint police emptied a van carrying about six 
people and thoroughly searched the passengers luggage 
three roadblocks were set up near the train station a police 
officer there shook his head when asked if the increased security 
was because of the martial law anniversary he refused to answer 
other questions 
at another checkpoint a police officer insisted this is 
normal when asked about the extra security 
in the university district in western beijing there was no 
visible security presence students sat at roadside food stalls 
outside the gate of peoples university eating midnight snacks and 
the gate to beijing university remained open

secretary of state james a baker iii brought 
home from moscow the ingredients of a successful washington summit 
meeting but he almost flopped on limiting longrange nuclear 
missiles 
according to a senior us official a cruise deal baker had 
struck with mikhail s gorbachev on friday morning began to unravel 
only a few hours after the soviet president had said agreed 
by splitting the differences on air and sealaunched cruise 
missiles baker thought he had resolved one of the toughest 
problems standing in the way of a summit declaration to cut 
strategic nuclear weapons 
he had accepted a soviet proposal to limit airborne cruises with 
a range above 375 miles and settled on 880 as the number of 
sealaunched weapons to be revealed to the other side 
the soviets had taken a stricter line than the united states in 
the negotiations baker met them halfway in return for excluding a 
new us airtosurface missile called the tacit rainbow from any 
limitations 
the upshot removal of the elusive missiles as an obstacle in 
the way of strategic arms reduction treaty 
although the treaty will not be ready for president bush and 
gorbachev to sign at their may 31june 3 summit a declaration on 
key issues might be initialed 
but the package that we thought had been put together began to 
unravel the official told reporters on bakers flight home 
saturday night 
the soviets were trying to impose restrictions on the tacit 
rainbow what had loomed as a success was now in doubt we 
genuinely didnt know if we were going to get there said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
baker who had practiced law in houston before turning to 
politics decided the solution was to write a letter it would 
assure the soviets that the tacit rainbow carried conventional or 
nonnuclear warheads and should not be restricted under a start 
treaty even though its range will be above 375 miles 
he telephoned foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze his main 
bargaining partner through four days of tough talks to describe 
the letter and also to say if the soviets tried to limit the tacit 
rainbow the united states would not accept the 375mile treaty 
range 
shevardnadze called back after receiving the letter and said 
this is fine the senior official related the deal was back on 
track 
the problem apparently was persuading the soviet military to 
allow the tacit rainbow to be excluded 
baker went on to meet with the foreign minister on saturday and 
then to announce at a news conference before flying home 
i think our discussions have resulted in some real 
accomplishments the progress we have made here makes me optimistic 
that we will have a productive summit in washington 
us and soviet negotiators will go back to the bargaining table 
in geneva this week to try to resolve some of the halfdozen 
remaining start problems 
these include the limits to be placed on ballistic missiles with 
multiple warheads and the method of verifying compliance with a 
start treaty 
at the same time a group of soviet weapons experts will be here 
at midweek to conduct parallel negotiations in washington 
a trailblazing accord to end chemical weapons production 
meanwhile is ready to sign at the summit without further ado 
bush provided the impetus last week by offering to end 
production of binary weapons two chemicals that are deadly when 
mixed 
the soviets met his two conditions in moscow 
they agreed to produce a schedule for the destruction of their 
chemical weapons stockpiles and they accepted bushs demand that 
the two superpowers maintain small arsenals of the deadly weapons 
until 40 nations negotiating in geneva conclude a treaty to end 
production and implement it 
some 24 nations are believed to either have poison gas or the 
capacity to produce it the ussoviet accord baker said 
provides a real pathway toward a global ban on horrific weapons 
that we already know from bitter experience actually get used 
on another front however a stalemate is developing 
baker failed to speed up a treaty to cut us and soviet troops 
tanks and other nonnuclear arms in europe 
bush had predicted a year ago that it would take from six months 
to a year to wind it up 
but the soviets evidently are reluctant to trim their forces in 
central europe to 195000 men unless the german army is sharply 
reduced as well 
the impending merger of east and west germany is causing anxiety 
in moscow memories of the loss of 20 million to 26 million people 
in world war ii linger on

lithuanian lawmakers rejected soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs demand that the republic suspend its 
declaration of independence but planned to offer a compromise 
spokesmen said sunday 
in estonia antiindependence forces planned strikes at major 
governmentowned enterprises on monday but it was not clear how 
much support they could muster similiar strike calls last summer 
interrupted work at only a few dozen businesses in the estonian 
capital of tallinn 
opponents of independence in latvia the third baltic republic 
met in riga the capital to form an alliance the soviet army 
newspaper red star said the group included communists loyal to 
moscow military representatives and law enforcement organizations 
all three baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union 50 years ago and now are in various stages of trying to break 
free of moscows control 
gorbachev says the baltic moves toward independence violate the 
soviet constitution lithuania has pushed the hardest and he has 
halted oil and natural gas shipments to that republic as part of an 
economic embargo 
lithuanian legislators agreed late saturday to reject 
gorbachevs demand that they suspend their march 11 independence 
declaration because it would mean accepting soviet control over 
lithuania legislator zigmas vaisvilas said sunday 
no formal vote was taken on the issue and the lawmakers planned 
to reconvene monday to draft a counterproposal said victoras 
balmusas a parliamentary spokesman 
during the debate communist legislator eduardas vilkas proposed 
offering gorbachev a deal that would suspend or cancel the march 11 
declaration of independence in exchange for an end to moscows 
economic blockade of lithuania a promise not to use force and 
removal of some soviet troops vaisvilas said 
but most lawmakers agreed that tampering with the declaration 
would be wrong vaisvilas said that was in line with the advice of 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene who met with 
gorbachev on thursday night in moscow 
parliament ordered a committee to work out other compromise 
proposals to offer moscow vaisvilas said 
gorbachevs had refused for two months to meet with lithuanian 
leaders but he relented after the republic offered to suspend some 
measures relating to the implementation of independence not the 
actual declaration in exchange for negotiations 
lithuanian leaders said gorbachevs decision to see mrs 
prunskiene may have been influenced by the fact that she was 
meeting the following day with secretary of state james a baker 
iii baker was in moscow to settle the agenda for the superpower 
summit at the end of may in washington 
its very clear gorbachev wanted to show president bush before 
the summit that he has started negotiations and he is not demanding 
the same things as in the beginning vailvilas said 
baker told a news conference saturday night that the united 
states was encouraged by the fact that the two met but said 
results remain to be seen 
in the lithuanian capital vilnius independence supporters kept 
a vigil outside the parliament building through the weekend to 
guard it from prosoviet demonstrators reports said sunday 
lithuanian radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp 
said the activists sought to prevent a repeat of incidents in 
latvia and estonia where opponents of independence tried to storm 
government buildings last week 
in another development the estonian news agency eta said sunday 
that lithuanian latvia czechoslovak and polish lawmakers met near 
tallinn the estonian capital and recommended that the baltic 
states be added to the 35nation of conference on security and 
cooperation in europe which produced the helsinki accords in 1975 
however the delegates were not formally representing their 
respective governments so the move was mainly symbolic 
we are not against the soviet union but it must admit the 
right to selfdetermination for everybody eta quoted polish 
senator tadeusz klopotowski as saying

house leaders hope for swift passage of a 
farreaching clean air bill this week but only after a likely 
showdown over whether to make automakers produce nongasoline cars 
for smogtroubled cities 
floor debate was scheduled to begin monday we would like to 
get done before the memorial day break house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo told his colleagues last week 
the senate in april approved a similar bill calling for steep 
cuts in acid rain pollutants and new controls on urban smog and 
toxic industrial emissions both versions would cost the economy 
about 21 billion a year when the new controls go fully into effect 
a concerted effort to toughen the law for the first time in 13 
years began in 1989 when president bush reversed a decade of white 
house opposition and announced his support for a comprehensive 
package of new controls 
the powerful house energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich has blocked clean air 
legislation in years past approved a bipartisan agreement on a 
broadreaching antipollution bill in april 
the bill calls for large reductions in tailpipe pollutants but 
is still slightly less stringent than the senate version in 
imposing new costs on the auto industry 
it is expected to stay generally intact during the upcoming 
floor debate which will include a dozen amendments likely to be 
voted on wednesday and thursday according to several congressmen 
and congressional staffers 
were pretty well where were going to stay rep terry 
bruce dill said of most of the major components of the package 
including provisions that will force coalburning electric 
utilities to reduce their annual acid rain emissions by 10 million 
tons 
bruce and other midwest congressmen had fought the acid rain 
portion of the bill during the committees debate but gained only 
small concessions 
key congressmen and staff members met much of last week and 
through the weekend in an attempt to work out differences on some 
of proposed amendments and avert contentious floor fights 
the discussions produced a tentative agreement on a proposal 
that would require use of a cleaner fuel in dozens of cities to 
curb urban smog and a measure forcing a broader phaseout of 
ozonedamaging chemicals 
but participants in the talks said some issues including an 
amendment by rep henry waxman dcalif to require automakers to 
build 1 million alternative fuel cars will likely have to be 
fought out on the house floor 
waxmans measure would establish such strict smogpollution 
controls that automakers could not comply without providing cars 
capable of burning fuels other than gasoline in nine of the most 
polluted cities 
arguing it shouldnt have to build such cars because consumers 
may not want to buy them the auto industry overpowered 
environmentalists in persuading the senate to reject a similar 
provision 
the fate of alternative fuel vehicles hinges on consumer 
acceptance and consumers are flashing a yellow warning light

association

israeli officials condemned the attack on 
unarmed arab workers sunday and appealed for calm but palestinian 
leaders said the incident would revive the flagging 29monthold 
revolt against israeli occupation 
palestinian activists said the assault in which seven gaza 
laborers were killed and 11 wounded by a lone israeli gunman 
resulted from the antiarab climate created by israels rightwing 
prime minister yitzhak shamir 
what happened today is a turning point and there will be more 
violence if there is no political solution we palestinians will 
not allow this to be a forgotten incident said faisal husseini 
a prominent proplo activist 
he said shamirs policy of building more israeli settlements and 
a harsh policy in the occupied lands and a lack of response to us 
proposals for israelipalestinian talks were conducive to acts by 
extremists 
even if this man is mentally sick the atmosphere created by 
such a government is responsible husseini said 
the killings which police said were motivated by personal 
rather than political reasons triggered rioting that left seven 
palestinians dead and hundreds wounded in the occupied gaza strip 
and west bank 
the casualties marked one of the uprisings bloodiest days and 
israeli officials expressed concern over the prospect of a new 
outburst in the rebellion which had been losing momentum in recent 
months before sundays violence 688 palestinians and 43 israelis 
had died in the unrest 
an army spokesman who demanded anonymity said the sheer scope 
and intensity of the rioting has not been seen in at least the past 
six months 
the protests have been declining for months and one recent army 
statement spoke of an increasingly weary population which is only 
able to give passive support to hardcore activists 
according to betzelem an israeli human rights group army 
gunfire killed 39 palestinians in the first four months of 1990 
compared with 91 in the first four months of 1989 figures also 
showed that for the first time the number of palestinians killed by 
other arabs 37 exceeded the number killed by israelis 30 in the 
first three months of 1990 the palestinians killed by fellow arabs 
were accused of collaborating with israeli officials 
israel television quoted an unidentified defense ministry 
official as saying sundays violence is just what the 
palestinians needed to bring the uprising back to the headlines 
military governors in the occupied areas met with prominent 
palestinians and the west banks army commander maj gen yitzhak 
mordechai spoke in an arabiclanguage broadcast they appealed for 
calm and stressed the slayings were the act of a deranged 
individual 
shamir said he was disgusted by the terrible crime and the 
slayings were condemned by president chaim herzog and many other 
israeli politicians 
many warned however that the attack would escalate the 
intefadeh or uprising recalling the dec 8 1987 traffic 
accident that gave birth to it four gaza workers were killed in a 
collision with an israeli truck and palestinians viewed the crash 
as intentional 
deddy zucker a liberal member of parliament and a paratrooper 
in the army reserves said i think today is the turning point in 
the uprising from the point of view of the price we will all pay 
we have risen to a new point in the uprising a new stage 
in an apparent effort to create new momentum in the rebellion 
husseini and other leaders called a hunger strike demanding a 
united nations security council meeting and an international 
investigation 
this incident is similar to the days when intefadeh started 
to change it into a stronger intefadeh is mainly dependent on us 
he said in an interview 
a statement by husseini and the other 11 hunger strikers also 
called for an international peace force to protect the 
palestinians until the establishment of a palestinian state

asked about the study last october the justice departments 
executive office of us attorneys released its own data for 1988 
showing that los angeles percentage had increased to 26 from 22 
the year before 
in the justice data for 1988 four of the 10 areas ranked ahead 
of los angeles brooklyn with 52 percent manhattan 48 detroit 
39 and baltimore 37 
in that data hartford chicago boston and philadelphia had 25 
percent newark 23 percent and san francisco 18 percent 
recommended by thornburgh for two presidential nominations to 
the federal court and to head dea bonner has followed some of the 
same paths thornburgh traveled when he was a us attorney in 
pittsburgh in the early 1970s 
early in bonners tenure he mounted an unsuccessful move to take 
control of the departments independent organized crime strike 
force in los angeles thornburgh waged a similar battle in 
pittsburgh 
later when thornburgh rejoined the justice department as 
attorney general he renewed his own decadesold battle to put the 
strike forces under us attorneys all over the country 
thornburghs aides recruited bonner to sing the praises of the idea 
to reporters 
thornburghs success in doing that led to the resignation of 
nearly onefourth of the governments top organized crime 
prosecutors

the return of wolves running wild through 
yellowstone national park would add to the enjoyment of tourists 
and restore a missing link in the parks ecosystem experts say 
but ranchers fearful of livestock losses oppose reintroducing 
the predators 81000 of which were killed between 1883 and 1918 in 
state and federal extermination programs 
now a 600page study to be presented to congress this week 
predicts little harm to wildlife or livestock near the park if 
wolves are returned according to those familiar with it 
more important say the experts its time to move beyond 
speculation of how wolves would act in yellowstone 
all of the studies currently going on will not absolve the 
need to introduce wolves and let them tell us what to do said 
james peek a university of idaho researcher 
durward allen a purdue university researcher who has studied 
wolves on minnesotas isle royale for 20 years says the government 
is obligated to reestablish the gray wolf because it was part of 
the aboriginal fauna that we are committed to preserving as nearly 
as possible in its primitive configuration 
rupert cutler president of defenders of wildlife the most 
visible proponent of wolves in yellowstone hopes the latest study 
ends the political debate over wolves that has kept the federal 
government studying the predators 
the government studies show we can meet the needs of ranchers 
and outfitters while meeting the desire of millions of americans to 
see wolves restored to our nations bestknown national park 
apart from their aesthetic value the wolves would rein in an 
outofcontrol elk population that is slowly denuding the parks 
northern range cutler said 
in lobbying for wolf restoration defenders magazine surveyed 16 
north american wolf experts who overwhelmingly called for 
implementation of the plan 
peek told the magazine that yellowstone is a place where 
natural dynamic processes are allowed to be restored and 
perpetuated and the predation process is incomplete without the 
wolf 
in the latest study park service and fish and wildlife service 
researchers examined how 100 to 150 wolves might interact with 
grizzly bears and yellowstones ungulate populations such as the 
elk and bison they also analyzed control methods and wolves 
impact on wildlife in wyoming montana and idaho outside the park 
members of the interagency grizzly bear committee predicted 
there would be little if any overall effect either on grizzly or 
wolf populations although some individual bears could be harmed 
the study also is expected to conclude that over a 20 to 
30year period there could be a 10 percent to 25 percent reduction 
in yellowstones elk herds which contain an estimated 31000 
animals and a 20 percent reduction in bison which now number 
2000 
however the research also notes that the action of predators 
increases the general physiology of prey resulting in increased 
reproduction 
as for hunters in the forests surrounding yellowstone the study 
says sport hunting would not have to be eliminated for any herd or 
species in the yellowstone ecosystem 
how wolves outside the park affect livestock depends on how 
stringently wolves are controlled according to the study there 
are an estimated 10000 cows and 5000 sheep in the immediate area 
of the park 
controls currently used in minnesota and canada range from traps 
to poison and in montana wolves that preyed on livestock have been 
killed by fish and wildlife service biologists 
a key to the controls is whether wolves are returned under an 
experimental status as suggested by previous studies or on their 
own according to steve fritts a montanabased fish and wildlife 
service biologist who helped coordinate the study 
if wolves returned on their own they would fall under the 
endangered species act which bans killing of listed animals by the 
general public and restricts federal agents to hunt only problem 
animals 
under an experimental designation fritts said more lenient 
rules pertaining to the killing of wolves that leave yellowstone 
could be instituted 
regardless of how wolves get to yellowstone they belong there 
according to dave mech a wildlife biologist who has studied 
minnesotas wolves since 1969 for the fish and wildlife service 
yellowstone park is a place that literally begs to have 
wolves he told defenders magazine its teeming with prey 
wolves would add an element to the ecosystem that would help 
restore it to a more natural state that would allow the public to 
better enjoy the park

public televisions the macneillehrer 
newshour features more whites and males and is more 
governmentoriented and conservative than abcs nightline says 
a group that studied both shows 
the assertion was made by a liberal media watchdog group 
fairness amp accuracy in reporting in a study released sunday fair 
president jeff cohen said that the pbs show has a narrow 
proestablishment guest list that mocks the original mandate of 
public television to provide diversity 
newshour executive producer les crystal said the news 
program agrees that diversity is important and we clearly feel we 
can and should do better in that regard 
but he disputed what he called fairs contention that the show 
doesnt criticize the government much and asks onesided questions 
thats just not true he said friday we look for 
differing points of view and have them on almost all the time 
the fair study of newshour broadcasts from feb 6 to aug 4 
1989 was conducted by boston college sociologists william hoynes 
and david croteau who made a study critical of nightline last 
year 
the nightline report examining 40 months of the abc 
program from 1985 to 1988 found that 89 percent of its guests were 
men 92 percent were white and that conservative leaders were the 
shows most frequent guests 
fairs new study entitled all the usual suspects 
macneillehrer and nightline also compared abcs program with 
newshour during the same sixmonth period the latter was 
studied 
the two professors making the study found that abcs show has 
slightly broadened its guest list since the original study but 
that our hopes for significant change were not met 
their newshour study found that of us citizens appearing 
as guests 90 percent of them were white and 87 percent were male 
the figures rose on programs about international politics it said 
with 94 percent of us citizens appearing to discuss world 
politics were both white and male 
the study offered no racial or gender percentages for guests who 
were not us citizens 
it characterized as more representative the guests invited 
when the shows topic was domestic politics it said that 26 
percent of them were women but gave no figures on the race of 
female guests 
fairs study said the shows guest list was dominated by two 
conservative washington think tanks with a total of 14 guests 
provided by the center for strategic and international studies and 
the american enterprise institute

an updated version of the 
centuriesold passion play premiered sunday and for the first time 
a married woman was allowed to portray the virgin mary 
in another modern touch christs betrayer judas is portrayed 
as a confused and troubled man rather than simply a greeddriven 
mercenary 
the daylong play which depicts the suffering and resurrection 
of jesus was also revised to make changes in its portrayal of 
jews many jewish organizations had complained for decades that it 
was antisemitic 
under new casting rules elisabeth petre a 37yearold mother 
of two is one of two actresses alternating this year in the role 
of the virgin mary 
half a million visitors including 200000 americans are 
expected to flock to this bavarian alpine village 50 miles south of 
munich for the production which runs through sept 30 
the play is just beautiful the acting was excellent and i 
loved the way the stage extends outside said terry blankenship 
35 a physical therapist from fayetteville nc 
the audience sits inside the theater but the stage extends 
beyond the roof under the open sky with a mountain backdrop 
some playgoers were returning to oberammergau for the second 
time 
i saw the passion play here six years ago and it was the most 
glorious experience said beverly seamans 61 a sculptress from 
marblehead mass 
the last performance a special jubilee presentation in 1984 
attracted 470000 spectators about half of them americans 
seeing it is a way of gaining more cultural insight said 
lewis snyder 40 of mason mich who works for a rhode 
islandbased travel agency some of the people i bring here are 
religious but many are just curious 
the passion play here dates back to 1633 when the bubonic 
plague was raging roman catholic villagers vowed to stage a 
passion play every 10 years if the plague abated when it did it 
was considered a miracle 
oberammergau a village of 5000 is widely known for 
woodcarvings and the painted frescoes on its buildings it is 
generally quiet and peaceful except during a passion play 
production 
americans are our no 1 customers said erika heigl owner 
of a souvenir shop selling cuckoo clocks beer mugs porcelain 
figures and crystal all 95 performances of the play have been sold 
out for months 
among the prominent guests at sundays premiere was the us 
ambassador to west germany vernon walters 
i found todays performance enormously impressive walters 
said at a reception held during the long midday intermission 
antisemitic elements removed from this years production 
include the removal of horns traditionally worn on the heads of 
jewish high priests depicted in the play 
the new production also emphasizes jesus roots as a jew which 
were formerly obscured at times he was referred to as a rabbi 
the changes were made at the urging of the american jewish 
committee the antidefamation league of bnai brith and the 
national conference of catholic of catholic bishops

the united states warned its ally 
pakistan on sunday that if it starts a war with india over the 
disputed territory of kashmir it cannot count on us backing 
diplomatic sources said 
two us envoys robert gates deputy national security 
adviser and john kelly assistant secretary of state for near east 
and south asian affairs met sunday with pakistani officials on 
the kashmir issue 
the us representatives then traveled to new delhi where they 
were meeting monday with indian leaders 
india and pakistan have fought three wars two of them over 
kashmir since the two nations were born out of the 1947 division 
of the britishruled subcontinent 
the division was along religious lines into islamic pakistan 
and hindudominated india but kashmir a predominantly moslem 
state went to india 
in recent months a moslem secessionist movement has flared in 
kashmir at least 400 people have been killed since the indian 
government began cracking down on the insurgency on jan 20 
our major objective is to help both sides avoid a conflict 
over kashmir and to begin the sort of political dialogue which 
would not only reduce tensions but lead to a peaceful and permanent 
settlement the us envoys said in a statement 
pakistans president ghulam ishaq khan met with the us 
representatives for 90 minutes and western diplomatic sources said 
both sides did some tough talking 
the americans stressed pakistan should do nothing that would 
start a war with india if it did they said washington would not 
necessarily support islamabad said the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
pakistan is a close us ally while the soviet union is the 
main arms supplier to india 
the us envoys also expressed concern about militant groups 
spearheading the moslem secessionist movement in indianheld 
kashmir from pakistani soil the sources said 
the pakistanis for their part suggested washington was 
applying a double standard by criticizing the secessionist groups 
but failing to condemn indian forces violence against kashmiris 
the sources said 
ishaq khan told the us envoys that pakistan is giving only 
moral support not military assistance to secessionists in 
kashmir said foreign ministry spokesman abu fazle he quoted ishaq 
khan as saying pakistan has made several proposals aimed at 
reducing border tensions but that india rejected them 
pakistan has called for talks on the kashmir issue but new 
delhi has not consented 
gates and kelly were unable to meet with pakistans prime 
minister benazir bhutto or its foreign minister sabahzada yaqub 
khan the two together with other senior pakistani officials are 
off on a weeklong tour of the middle east and north africa trying 
to drum up islamic support in the kashmir dispute 
the us envoys had hoped to meet with ms bhutto in north yemen 
before coming to pakistan but the lastminute logistics could not 
be worked out according to us officials instead they met with 
the president the army chief of staff and the prime ministers 
foreign affairs advisers 
ms bhutto in cairo said sunday more steps should be taken 
to make sure that a peaceful solution be found to the dispute 
but she also told reporters her country would support kashmirs 
independence from india no matter what the consequences 
both india and pakistan are suspected of possessing nuclear 
weapons technology india detonated a nuclear device in 1974 so 
the dispute over kashmir is of concern to the superpowers

a major earthquake rumbled through the 
jungles of southern sudan on sunday near the wartorn regions 
largest city but officials said there appeared to be no casualties 
and little damage 
the quake measured 75 on the richter scale a temblor of that 
size is capable of causing widespread destruction 
the official sudan news agency said the earthquake caused no 
deaths or injuries but much of the area affected by the quake is 
so isolated that any news might take days or weeks 
juba southern sudans largest city is 60 miles southwest of 
the quakes reported epicenter the region has been hit by famine 
as well as fighting between the government and the rebel peoples 
liberation army and juba is crammed with refugees from the 
7yearold civil war 
in nairobi kenya bob koepp a lutheran world federation 
official said a pilot flying relief supplies to juba returned late 
sunday and said the city had not been seriously affected he said 
there was some negligible damage 
it wasnt very heavy at juba the epicenter apparently was in 
the swamps and the ground may have just soaked it up koepp said 
scientists said the quakes epicenter was 700 miles south of 
sudans capital khartoum it occurred in sparsely populated 
territory controlled by the rebels who hold most of the southern 
countryside 
relief workers in two rebelcontrolled villages bor and torit 
apparently told officials in nairobi kenya the earthquake caused 
no damage there 
its pretty low area over there with low buildings and quite 
remote koepp said 
a crew with koepps organization landed in the region with 
relief supplies two hours after the quake struck at 422 am and 
reported seeing nothing amiss 
late sunday a khartoum airport tower operator said flights to 
the southern city had not been disrupted 
pierreandre conod of the international committee of the red 
cross said he had no details about injuries or damage he said 
colleagues in juba had not made their regular radio contact with 
khartoum but cautioned that maybe they have a problem with the 
antenna we cannot say it is due to the earthquake 
people seeking haven from the war and from famine have more than 
doubled jubas population of 125000 in recent years hundreds of 
thousands have died in southern sudan an area the size of texas 
egypts two principal earthquake monitoring stations including 
one at the aswan high dam 600 miles south of cairo and just north 
of the sudan border recorded the quake at 75 on the richter 
scale the us geological survey in menlo park calif reported an 
identical reading 
its such a big quake that the monitoring stations are 
saturated with data said geologist rashad m kebeasy president 
of egypts national research institute of astronomy and geophysics 
this is an extremely dangerous earthquake it is the first time 
that such a quake has struck this area 
he said large and very dangerous aftershocks were to be 
expected for the next two days 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph every 
increase of one number say from magnitude 55 to magnitude 66 
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater 
a magnitude of 7 is considered a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage magnitude 8 is a great earthquake capable 
of tremendous damage last octobers earthquake near san francisco 
registered 71 on the richter scale 
kebeasy an expert on earthquakes of northeastern africa said 
the epicenter was just west of the great african rift that 
earthquake zone stretches 4000 miles from mozambique through the 
red sea to lebanon 
the proximity to the rift accounts for the quakes magnitude 
kebeasy said

nasa engineers captured the first 
light photograph sunday of the hubble space telescope and a 
scientist said the experts were pleased as punch with the 
spectacular image 
a camera on the telescope clicked its shutter twice beginning at 
1113 am edt and the images were relayed to the ground more than 
two hours later giving astronomers their first glimpses of the 
view from the 15 billion telescope 
its quite an image fantastic james westphal the 
principal scientist for the camera used in the first photo 
exercise said as one the photos was displayed on a tv screen 
we are just as pleased as punch at this point westphal 
said our image is significantly better than we were concerned 
that it might be 
westphal said the hubble image revealed a double star that was 
previously unseen in groundbased photographs taken at an 
observatory in chile 
we didnt know it was a double star said westphal noting 
that he had expected the first image to be an engineering test 
but because of the clarity of the image he said boy we could 
get lots of science out of this right now 
the quality of the photo was a boost for national aeronautics 
and space administration officials who have gone through an 
unexpectedly troubled checkout and testing period with the costly 
telescope which is in orbit 381 miles above earth 
the target for hubbles first image was a star cluster called 
theta carina a group of objects about 1260 light years from 
earth the telescope took two exposures one for a single second 
and another lasting 30 seconds 
westphal said the 30second exposure was chosen for analysis 
because it gave better detail 
engineers manipulated the images while people watched on 
television and it took them over an hour to change the raw 
electronic data from hubble into a photograph on a tv screen 
nobody has ever done this before so we had to learn how 
westphal said the technical challenge now is to get the 
telescope in even sharper focus 
the scientists said that eventually they expect to get 
photographs at least seven times sharper than the one released 
sunday 
the image came down as four separate parts of the same photo 
engineers then used computer instructions to enhance the quality of 
each point of light the initial look at the photo showed very 
faint points of light on a gray field 
after manipulation the stars were brightened the background 
was darkened and the double star could be seen easily 
theta carina is part of a constellation called carina a word 
that means ships keel that is visible from the ground only in 
the southern hemisphere the star cluster is identified in the new 
general catalogue of stars as 3532 and is thought to be 3 billion 
years old its distance from earth is about 7400000000000000 
miles 
nasa officials said the first light photo is an important 
engineering milestone for the hubble checkout 
engineers have spent a month attempting to align and focus the 
instruments of hubble they have had to overcome computer problems 
a fouled antenna a programing error that resulted from an ordinary 
math mistake and an unexplained wobble that still is unresolved 
the checkout said be stull of lockheed missiles and space 
co the prime nasa contractor for the telescope has been a 
little more stressful and challenging that we expected 
we certainly expected some difficulties but we didnt expect 
the severity and the number that we got he told the washington 
post 
the telescope will undergo another seven months or so of intense 
checkout and testing before the fulltime programs of scientific 
study begin 
officials said long breakin periods are not unusual for robot 
spacecraft and the testing is even more difficult because of the 
precise demands of hubble the most powerful astronomical 
observatory ever put into orbit 
hubble by working from an orbit above the obscuring effects of 
the earths atmosphere will able to look at stars in the far 
reaches of the universe perhaps to point 14 billion light years 
from earth 
with its 945inchdiameter mirror and powerful lightamplifying 
and focusing equipment the orbiting telescope is expected to 
eventually take photos of stars that are 25 times fainter than the 
dimmest object visible from earth the best hubble pictures are 
expected to have 10 times the clarity of photos taken by the most 
powerful groundbased telescopes 
to accomplish this the telescope is designed to hold so steady 
that its motion in any direction would be less than the thickness 
of a sheet of paper its pointing system is so accurate that if it 
was mounted atop the washington monument with a laser gun it could 
hold a steady light beam on a dime atop the empire state building 
in new york city 
hubble was carried into space last month by space shuttle 
discovery on april 25 it was plucked from the shuttles cargo bay 
and left to orbit on its own 381 miles above the earth

helped the urban poor earlier this century was beatified sunday by 
pope john paul ii who praised him as a model for lay catholics 
beatification is the last major step before sainthood in the 
roman catholic church 
about 50000 people attended the ceremony in st peters square 
frassati who died in 1925 worked with the poor in turin as the 
northern italian city grew more industrial after the turn of the 
century 
he also inspired many catholic lay groups including catholic 
action 
frassati realized his lay christian vocation through multiple 
commitments social and political in a society in ferment 
indifferent and sometimes hostile to the church the pope said

police firing automatic rifles held 
off demonstrators hurling firebombs at a police station sunday as 
about 10000 protesters rampaged in this city for a third day 
witnesses and news reports said no one was injured in the attack 
on the police station but authorities said about 50 officers and 
protesters were hurt in other clashes including a student doctors 
said may lose his sight after being hit in the eyes by a rock 
about 200 people were arrested news reports said 
earlier sunday thousands of riot police firing tear gas stormed 
chosun university to disperse 5000 students and workers 
police in combat gear fired hundreds of tear gas shells to drive 
back the street protesters who charged in groups of up to 1000 at 
a time protesters tore up sidewalks for weapons and built bonfires 
at a dozen intersections to light firebombs 
about 40 taxis with headlights on drove through downtown streets 
honking their horns to support the protesters citizens in doorways 
and alleys cheered protesters and shouted insults at police 
the battles lasted about six hours and covered an area 
stretching 12 miles from the provincial government headquarters in 
the city center the protesters screamed slogans demanding the 
ouster of president roh taewoo and opposing the united states 
in the attack on the police station witnesses said police fired 
more than 40 warning shots from automatic rifles to drive off about 
50 protesters 
the battle represented an escalation in the clash because it is 
uncommon for police to fire or even brandish weapons during 
protests police trained in riot control do not carry arms and 
automatic rifles are considered military equipment not riot 
control weapons 
it was the second time in three days that police in kwangju used 
firearms to disperse protesters on saturday officers fired eight 
rounds when students attacked two police substations with firebombs 
at one point sunday dozens of students throwing firebombs at 
police accidentally set a shop on fire when a fire truck arrived 
the students used it as a shield to continue their attacks 
several students chased by police dashed into a roman catholic 
church to avoid arrest and parishioners rushed outside to guard the 
gate even small children joined in the protest but students urged 
them to go home warning that they might be hurt 
the protests began friday on the 10th anniversary of a bloody 
antigovernment uprising in kwangju about 150 miles south of seoul 
president roh a former army general was a key leader of the 
former martial law government that crushed the 1980 revolt with 
military force 
kwangju citizens claim us military officials condoned the 
military crackdown on the 10day uprising which claimed 200 lives 
and left more than 1700 injured 
the 1980 revolt was the bloodiest in modern korean history and 
seared the psyche of koreans more than any incident since the 
195053 korean war 
the us cultural center in kwangju was closed down last year 
after being attacked by korean radicals 18 times since the early 
1980s american officials plan to reopen the center next month 
student leaders scheduled a funeral rally wednesday for a 
student activist from seoul who died saturday en route to the 
protests 
police officials expressed concern that such a rally would 
provoke more clashes the deaths of radical leaders triggered 
violent protests in the past when students felt police were to 
blame

a top political adviser to chancellor helmut 
kohl recently traveled to moscow to discuss bonns likely financial 
support for soviet troops in east germany a government spokesman 
said sunday 
kohls aides have said west germany might have to temporarily 
subsidize soviet troops as early as this summer once the west 
german mark replaces the east german currency 
west german willingness to help support the 380000 soviet 
troops is widely seen as one way to overcome any soviet objections 
to german unification the kremlin strongly opposes nato membership 
for a unified germany 
west german financial support even temporary for soviet troops 
would be a first in the history of the atlantic alliance 
in an interview with the bonn newspaper die welt economics 
minister helmut haussmann said moscow agreeing to unity depends on 
economic cooperation between the two countries 
haussmann was scheduled to travel to moscow on monday for talks 
with kremlin officials the newspaper said haussmann said bonn 
wants to help the soviets in their difficult economic reform 
process 
in a report with the headline secret mission the west 
german news magazine der spiegel on saturday disclosed that kohl 
adviser horst teltschik traveled to moscow on the weekend of may 
56 for discussions with the soviet leadership 
der spiegel said teltschik had discussed financial 
questions including bonns likely financial support for soviet 
troops and the shaky future of east germanys contracts to supply 
the soviet union with numerous products 
a bonn government spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity confirmed the trip but denied teltschik was on a 
secret mission 
east germanys supply responsibilities to the soviet union are 
to be maintained even after unification the spokesman said we 
also are seeking ways to guarantee the financing of the soviet 
troops in the german democratic republic 
the spokesman declined to say with which soviet officials 
teltschik had spoken 
der spiegel said bonn is ready to pay 1875 million a year 
toward keeping the soviet troops temporarily in what is now east 
germany 
under current agreements the soviet union buys east german 
marks in exchange for socalled transfer rubles at a preferential 
rate 
the east german marks are then used to pay for goods and 
services for soviet soldiers stationed in east germany until now 
goods and services have been relatively inexpensive in east germany 
because of state subsidies 
bonn officials say unification poses some economic problems for 
the soviets 
the west german mark will become east germanys official 
currency as of july 2 and east german subsidies are also starting 
to disappear that means the overall cost of keeping the soviet 
soldiers in east germany will jump this summer squeezing the 
already badly strained soviet economy

the governors wifes afterhours use 
of the state library to help her 12yearold son with homework has 
generated giggles and jabs from the legislature and an apology from 
her husband 
one lawmaker jokingly suggested opening the governors mansion 
for public tours the same hours as the state library 
janet ashcroft wont talk about the 2 hours she and her son 
andy spent in the missouri state library on mothers day her 
husband gov john ashcroft says it was merely a case of a parent 
trying to help a child 
i assume that every parent knows that there are times when 
their kid isnt as prepared as he ought to be for school and what 
you do is you help em the governor said friday 
the governor said he was sorry if anybody was offended by their 
use of the state library to help andy finish a report on life in 
elizabethan england 
weve tried not to have an imperial governorship here we 
dont ride around in limousines because we dont see ourselves as 
different from the people of this state 
still the governor acknowledged that other students probably 
wouldnt have been allowed afterhours use of the library a 
reference library open on weekdays to the public but used primarily 
by lawmakers and state employees 
ashcroft said his family didnt mean to disturb anyone saying 
his wife only inquired if a library key was available a library 
employee who didnt have a key called the state librarian and both 
showed up to open the library 
they got more than they asked for the secondterm 
republican said it may have been that the person responded over 
and above what the person would have responded to someone else 
state librarian monteria hightower said her mothers day 
activities with her family were interrupted we dont do homework 
assignments for children when the services are closed they are 
closed the librarian said earlier last week 
the incident drew attention on talk shows and editorial pages 
from st louis to kansas city in the missouri house rep doug 
harpool drew laughter when he proposed an amendment to keep state 
officials from having the state library opened after hours 
he withdrew it saying nobody would be that rude again 
anyway 
there are extras which come with being the first family the 
public wouldnt have it any other way but people in positions of 
privilege have to walk a fine line they should be careful that 
they do not overstep the bounds into misuse of privilege the 
kansas city star said in an editorial last week 
on sunday st louis postdispatch columnist bill mcclellan 
wrote now finally we have the first scandal of the ashcroft 
administration we have librarygate 
missouri democratic chairman gene bushmann joined in 
criticizing ashcrofts vetoes of funds for libraries he suggested 
that jefferson citys public library might be open sundays if it 
had gotten the state money 
ashcrofts office responded that bushmanns numbers and premise 
were wrong that state funding for libraries has gone up and that 
the operating hours of the library in the state capital are a local 
matter 
democratic sen roger wilson offered then withdrew an 
amendment to open the usually closed governors mansion for public 
tours the same hours that the state library is open 
it was an attempt to inject a little humor in this wilson 
said 
a republican colleague house minority leader james talent 
dismissed the incident as really a small thing but republican 
sen bob johnson said this smacks of preferential treatment at a 
time that some members of the public think that politicians are too 
selfserving 
ashcroft wont discuss what andy youngest of three children 
thought about the matter nor will he confirm it was andy doing the 
homework the governor didnt answer questions about the library 
visit until friday saying he didnt know what happened because he 
was in church with his other son 
and he wasnt pleased with the attention the visit attracted 
ashcroft told a reporter the more you make of it the more 
difficulty there is for my children i dont think that helps 
my children and i very frankly dont think its a news story

european community foreign ministers 
on sunday laid the groundwork for closer political integration by 
1993 but made it clear that none of the 12 member nations wants a 
federal united states of europe 
irish foreign minister gerry collins described the weekend talks 
at parknasilla a lavish country resort in southwestern ireland as 
a real step forward in defining the shape of a new europe 
it is quite clear that we cannot stand still said collins 
chairman of the twoday meeting a community complacent with its 
achievements risks faltering and stagnating 
but officials said there was no question of community nations 
yielding the right to make sovereign decisions on foreign policy 
instead debate concentrated on whether more centralized powers 
should be focused on the 12 leaders of government or the 
communitys assembly the 518member european parliament based in 
strasbourg france 
britain the most skeptical about the idea of political union 
said it was pleased with the modest approach at parknasilla 
we dont want to give the euopean parliament more powers and 
we are clearly not alone said british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd 
france was adamant that foreign policy must remain a national 
matter 
today in 1990 no one is ready to delegate its sovereignty in 
foreign policy and security matters french foreign minister 
roland dumas said 
france and west germany pitched the community into an 
accelerated program for unity with a joint call last month for 
political union by 1993 
the meeting at parknasilla was the first since the community 
leaders at a summit on april 28 agreed in principle to the 
undefined frenchgerman proposal 
the foreign ministers are to meet again to complete draft 
proposals for the ecs next summit to be held in dublin at the end 
of june 
britain france and several smaller nations want the leaders of 
government to be the focus of centralized power while west 
germany backed by belgium and italy wants increased powers for 
the parliament diplomats said 
jacques delors president of the communitys strongly prounity 
executive commission based in brussels acknowledged for the first 
time there is no hope of agreement on a federation 
ireland currently holds the communitys rotating presidency

arab states and groups expressed outrage 
sunday over the killings of seven unarmed palestinian laborers by 
an israeli civilian and called for renewed protests in the 
israelioccupied territories 
the shooting sunday blamed on an israeli who had been 
dishonorably discharged from the army set off riots in the 
israelioccupied territories that left seven other palestinians 
dead and hundreds injured 
sunday was one of the most violent days since the start of the 
intefadah the palestinian uprising that broke out in december 1987 
against israeli military rule in the west bank and the gaza strip 
israeli officials themselves condemned the attack which one 
general called a tragic act by a deranged individual but many 
arab officials said it represented a pattern of violence against 
palestinians 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat called on 
palestinians in the occupied territories to stage protests in 
every village every city and every camp of the israelioccupied 
territory 
the plo chief also urged international intervention to protect 
palestinians against the crimes of the israeli army and 
colonialists referring to jewish settlers in the territories 
wafa the plo news agency said the plo made a formal protest to 
the united states on sunday over the incident saying it held 
washington responsible for israeli genocide operations against 
palestinians the plos permanent representative to tunisia hakam 
balaoui submitted the protest note to the us embassy in tunis 
in jordan prime minister mudar badran called the shootings a 
criminal act which is also denounced by all arabs all moslems 
and all the people of the world who have a live conscience 
roughly half of jordans 31 million people come from 
palestinian families who fled or were forced out of their homeland 
during the 1948 and 1967 arabisraeli wars 
in lebanon shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri who is 
also a government minister condemned the attack as a horrifying 
massacre and called in a statement for a nationwide protest 
strike wednesday 
egypt on sunday expressed deep sorrow over the killings 
which it said reflected the prevailing climate in israel and in 
israelioccupied arab territories 
this painful incident no doubt affirms once more the 
importance of overcoming all obstacles hindering the peace 
process foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid told reporters 
clovis maksoud the ambassador to the united states and the 
united nations from the league of arab states accused israel of 
have a deliberate plan to expedite through escalating violence 
its strategy to crush the uprising 
maksoud said arab states call on the international community 
as a matter of utmost urgency to take the necessary measures to 
protect the palestinians in the occupied territories 
to attribute the immediate cause for todays violent incidents 
to a socalled deranged person is a cynical and arrogant contempt 
of the facts he added 
israeli police who arrested the gunman said he was distraught 
over personal problems including a recent breakup with his 
girlfriend his identity was not released pending a court hearing

tuberculosis a oncedeadly disease now largely 
forgotten by americans is reemerging as a health threat primarily 
among aids patients health officials said sunday 
tuberculosis cases increased 35 percent in newark nj in 1989 
over the previous year alarming health officials who had noted 
with satisfaction a slow steady decrease in tb cases over the last 
few decades 
on the national level tb cases rose 5 percent in 1989 over 
1988 a jump largely attributable to the aids crisis said dr 
philip c hopewell chief of chest service at san francisco general 
hospital 
aids attacks the bodys immune system and tb is one of the 
socalled opportunistic infections that can accompany the disease 
hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between 
aids and tb here during a fourday world conference on lung health 
which ends wednesday 
about 4 percent of americans identified as having aids also have 
been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis said dr dixie 
e snider jr director of the division of tuberculosis control at 
the centers for disease control in atlanta 
the american lung association estimates 20000 americans a year 
develop tb which worldwide kills an estimated 3 million persons 
each year 
in parts of africa where aids already is epidemic tuberculosis 
is also reaching those proportions said dr annik rouillon 
executive director of the international union against tuberculosis 
and lung disease in paris 
the combination of the two is really catastrophic she said 
snider stressed that tb unlike aids is curable and can be 
effectively treated even in aids patients he called for tb 
screening at drug rehabilitation programs prisons and wherever 
else aids tests are given 
he also said physicians should test for tb all persons who test 
positive for the hiv virus that causes aids 
its important we get control of the situation he said 
dr lee b reichman director of the pulmonary division of the 
university of medicine and dentistry in new jersey pointed to 
wyoming where the cdc recorded no new tb cases in 1989 as proof 
tb can still be controlled and cured 
but unlike aids tb is highly contagious and can be spread by 
airborne particles coughed up by a person with untreated 
clinically active pulmonary tb 
untreated tb kills about 50 percent of its victims within two 
years according to the cdc 
the doctors said minority groups in the united states have 
become increasingly susceptible to tb especially as the incidence 
of aids among those groups increases 
snider stressed that sustained contact is necessary for tb 
transmission although he noted that there had been an increase in 
positive tb tests among aids health workers 
tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that commonly affects the 
lungs but can attack almost any organ for the last three decades 
it has been preventable and curable through drug therapy snider 
said 
he said an estimated 10 million to 15 million americans have 
been infected with the tb germ but only a small percentage develop 
the disease since most have immune systems strong enough to ward it 
off 
reichman noted that most americans have forgotten about the 
problems of tb the cdc says tb cases declined an average 6 percent 
a year from 1981 to 1984 
but reichman warned tb is back with a vengeance

an israeli who was dishonorably 
discharged from the army shot and killed seven unarmed palestinian 
laborers and wounded 11 on sunday outraged arabs rampaged through 
the occupied territories in rioting that left seven more 
palestinians dead and hundreds injured 
it was one of the bloodiest days since the palestinian uprising 
began 29 months ago and could rekindle the violence that had 
declined in recent months 
the assailant dressed in army pants and a black jacket 
confronted the laborers at a junction south of tel aviv ordered 
them to sit in a line then opened fire police said the victims 
apparently followed his orders because they mistook him for a 
soldier 
police who arrested the shooter said he was distraught over 
personal problems including a recent breakup with his girlfriend 
his identity was not released pending a court hearing 
israeli officials condemned the attack which one general called 
a tragic act by a deranged individual the army imposed curfews 
on the gaza strip and most of the west bank confining 11 million 
palestinians to their homes 
but wild with anger palestinians defied the curfew and poured 
into the streets by the thousands attacking army outposts stoning 
passing israeli cars and blocking roads arab reports said 
they threw anything they could find at soldiers and came at 
them with all they had said an army spokesman imposing the 
curfew on the rioters was a difficult period in which most of the 
casualties occurred 
those killed in the rioting ranged in age from 14 to 30 in one 
case arab reporters said a youth was fatally wounded when he tried 
to stab a soldier 
hospitals and united nations clinics in gaza said 691 
palestinians were treated for injuries from live ammunition rubber 
bullets beatings and tear gas thirteen were wounded two 
seriously by gunfire in the west bank hospitals said israel 
radio said 11 soldiers were injured 
the scope and intensity of the rioting which lasted about 13 
hours before subsiding around nightfall was reminiscent of the 
early days of the uprising when tens of thousands took to the 
streets in december 1987 
it was the bloodiest day of the revolt since 17 palestinians 
were killed in clashes with israeli troops on april 15 1988 
rioting broke out then when plo military leader khalil wazzir 
known by his nom de guerre abu jihad was gunned downed in tunis 
reportedly by israeli commandos 
meanwhile arab leaders in israel announced that monday will be 
a day of mourning and that they would hold a general strike to 
protest the slayings 
the army called up reinforcements and arabs reporters said 
palestinians were barred from entering israel to prevent 
retaliatory acts 
the west bank troop commander maj gen yitzhak mordechai 
appealed on the radio in arabic for palestinians to remain calm 
palestinian leaders blamed prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing government for creating a climate of antiarab sentiment 
and called for international help in assuring the safety of the 17 
million palestinians living under israeli occupation 
the israeli government is responsible for the gunmans 
hatred and crime said a leaflet by the proplo underground 
this government feeds it own people from their birth until their 
death with hatred against our people and their rights for 
independence and return 
shamir went on israel radio to condemn the attack and called on 
palestinians to ignore agitators who sought to incite riots 
we were all disgusted by the terrible crime that happened 
today it is a cruel crime without any justification he said 
the act was condemned by a broad spectrum of israeli 
politicians and the 13member cabinet considered a proposal to pay 
compensation to the victims 
the clandestine uprising leadership called for a threeday 
protest strike twelve prominent palestinian activists met with 
western diplomats including us consulgeneral phil wilcox and 
announced a hunger strike 
they demanded a un security council meeting international 
investigation of israeli occupation practices and immediate 
international protection for the palestinians living in 
israelioccupied areas 
in tunis a plo statement called the shooting a massacre and 
claimed it was the premeditated act of several israeli soldiers 
in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said 
we deplore this senseless tragedy and extend our deepest 
condolences to the families of everyone touched by this incident 
she called on the israeli army to exercise restraint and for 
all sides to make efforts to reduce tensions following the bloody 
clashes in the occupied territories 
israeli police and palestinian survivors said the gunman acted 
alone 
survivors said the attacker was dressed in army pants and a 
black jacket when he arrived at the roses junction five miles 
south of tel aviv palestinian laborers gather there every morning 
to wait for day work usually in construction 
survivors said the gunman arrived about 615 am and approached 
a group of about 50 laborers from the occupied gaza strip he 
ordered them to sit in a line and hand over their identity cards 
when a white peugot 504 stopped to let off more arab workers 
fakri kawara 27 of khan yunis said the gunman told the arab 
driver to restart the car and leave the engine running 
then he killed him on the spot said kawara 
the man then started shooting at those sitting on the ground 
kawara said the gunman finished his first magazine and while 
inserting another the surviving arabs ran for cover in the 
underbrush 
after he killed everyone who was sitting there he started 
shooting into the air kawara said 
khalil abu amsha 30 a worker who was in the car and was 
wounded in the left arm and leg said from his hospital bed that he 
thought the gunman was a soldier because he wore army pants 
he said sit by your friends we sat he said take out your 
identity cards he said do you know why i stopped you we 
said no he said good that you dont know 
police said the shooting of unarmed palestinian laborers was the 
gravest such incident in memory 
they said the suspect is a 21yearold man who had been 
dismissed from the army as unsuitable for military service in 
december 1988 they said he had spent nearly four months of his 
18month service in the stockade for disciplinary offenses 
although political motives were not ruled out police commander 
haim klein told reporters from what we know now his reasons were 
personal 
he said the gunman told investigators he was suicidal after 
breaking up with his girlfriend recently and said he also sought 
revenge for a sexual attack made on him by an arab eight years ago

the arrests began may 8 when veteran opposition leader ahmed 
alkhatib and seven of his followers were detained at a diwaniya 
which is a kind of town meeting held in a private home 
the eight along with three other activists charged with 
distributing antigovernment leaflets were released three days 
later the authorities also released on bail a former parliamentary 
deputy and one other man but were still holding two members of the 
defunct parliament 
the move came in response to appeals by a number of kuwaiti 
notables who met with the emir the news agency said 
they expressed to the emir their appreciation for his paternal 
and sincere attitudes toward countrymen who though they differ on 
the method of practising democracy remain good sons and loyal 
soldiers of kuwait the agency quoted the sources as saying 
the pardon was viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the socalled 
group of 32 the activists who called for a boycott of june 10 
polling for the 75member national council they said the 
parliament was unconstitutional because the emir will appoint 25 of 
its members 
more than 80 candidates have withdrawn from the national council 
race since the nomination deadline on may 9 bringing the number of 
candidates to 485 
the emir issued a decree on april 22 setting up the chamber as a 
fouryear transitional legislature it was to assess the countrys 
parliamentary experiment and propose future steps with a view to 
averting the repetition of a third crisis 
this was a reference to the dissolution of the national assembly 
twice in a decade in 1976 and 1986 after members of parliament 
verbally attacked government ministers many of them members of the 
ruling family

a former chinese diplomat whose 
sudden flight to the united states aroused concern in hong kong 
will return to china after a rest in california his host said 
sunday 
xu jiatun for almost seven years director of the hong kong 
branch of the xinhua news agency chinas de facto embassy in the 
territory slipped away to los angeles three weeks ago xus exact 
whereabouts were unknown 
he told me that after he rests for a while hes planning to 
make a broad survey and research on american society he still 
wishes to go back to his country and will not ever seek political 
asylum said hsing yun the buddhist monk who is xus host 
xu 74 reportedly left without the approval of his government 
but hsing yun said he believed xu had permission to leave the 
british colony to visit the united states he said xu was carrying 
a visa good for up to six months 
the monk who is master at hsi lai temple in hacienda heights 
20 miles east of los angeles called a news conference because of 
persistent questioning by chinese journalists and published 
speculation in hong kong 
public confidence in hong kongs future under chinese rule has 
been shaken by the sudden flight of xu from the british colony to 
the united states 
xu directed the hong kong branch of the xinhua news agency for 
nearly seven years he has been in seclusion since arriving in 
california on may 1 
because we are friends i do not have the right to ask why he 
came or for how long the chinesespeaking monk told reporters 
through an interpreter he said he did not come here to seek 
political asylum 
the monk dispatched his political consultant lu keng to san 
francisco to bring xu to southern california lu told reporters xu 
didnt want to meet with them because questions might focus on 
touchy subjects 
the first word he said was that he came to have a good rest 
asking if i could find a nice quiet place for him the religious 
leader said he fended off repeated questions as to xus 
whereabouts 
a flurry of newspaper stories in hong kong linked xus departure 
to frustrations over the hardline policies of chinas leadership 
following the bloody suppression of a prodemocracy movement in 
beijing last june 
on thursday the chinese foreign ministry in beijing broke its 
silence and said xu was merely touring and taking a rest in the 
united states 
the explanation failed to convince many of hong kongs 57 
million residents who have long been suspicious of chinas future 
plans for the territory which reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
china has said it will retain hong kongs freewheeling 
capitalistic lifestyle for 50 years beyond 1997 but many there are 
skeptical and fear any opposition to chinese rule in the territory 
will be brutally suppressed like the prodemocracy movement in 
beijing 
if a veteran chinese communist party member like xu found 
himself disillusioned what else do the ordinary people here have 
to count on asked political analyst tl tsim in hong kong 
in 1983 when xu arrived in hong kong he was the highestranked 
chinese official ever named to head the xinhua office he was a 
member of the partys central committee and was reported to have 
been personally selected for the job by chinas paramount leader 
deng xiaoping 
his assignment was to prepare hong kong for its eventual return 
to china he gradually cultivated an extensive network of contacts 
particularly among businessmen and the media

excited romanians voted sunday in 
their first free elections in 53 years and a west german exit poll 
predicted an overwhelming victory for interim president ion iliescu 
and his national salvation front 
the projection based on an exit poll of 16000 voters was 
announced on nationwide television while voters were still casting 
ballots early monday 
according to the poll iliescu won 83 percent of the votes for 
president while his challengers the national liberal partys 
radu campeanu and the national peasant partys ion ratiu won 11 
percent and six percent respectively 
in the vote for the twochamber parliament the front won a 
projected 66 percent with no other party winning more than 10 
percent the exit poll was conducted by the west german infas a 
polling group at the invitation of the government 
if the exit poll proves correct the front will not have to form 
a coalition but will be able to govern alone 
iliescu had no comment on the poll the state news agency 
rompress reported but he praised citizens for their high turnout 
and calm behavior he said foreign observers were able to see the 
virtues of sundays truly free elections 
campeanu and ratiu quickly condemned the poll 
i find the projected results exaggerated monstrously so 
they remind me of the returns in ceausescus time campeanu told 
rompress referring to communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
i do not believe they are fair ratiu said i cannot 
imagine that 83 percent of the romanian people voted for mr 
iliescu ratiu said there were numerous instances of voter fraud 
but presented no firm evidence 
ballot counting was to begin monday and preliminary results were 
expected tuesday final returns are to be announced friday 
slowmoving lines of 200 people or more snaked out of voting 
centers on the clear windy day as voters chose an heir to the 
revolution that ousted the ironfisted ceausescu 
the almost 16 million registered voters were choosing a 
president and 506 representatives to the parliament 
at several bucharest polling stations crowds of up to 500 
waited patiently to vote after a midnight deadline for polls to 
close the original closing time of 11 pm was extended earlier in 
the evening when it became clear that the voting was proceeding 
much slower than expected especially in the capital of bucharest 
seeing this number of people willing to stand in line at this 
time of night gives me great encouragement for this democracy 
said new mexico gov garrey e carruthers leader of the us 
presidential observer delegation as he visited polling stations in 
a downtown bucharest high school 
i am voting for the first time in free romania said a 
beaming ioan hurmuzachi 67 waiting outside a bucharest polling 
center i voted in the past under ceausescu but it was very 
clear it was not real voting 
his comments appeared to reflect a universal joy among voters 
casting ballots in the first free election since 1937 
more than 80 parties ran candidates for parliament but only 
half a dozen were considered likely to win seats in the election 
which was by proportional representation 
iliescu had been heavily favored to win the presidency his 
front a loose grouping of former communists workers and 
technocrats that has dominated government since decembers 
revolution had also been expected to lead in the parliamentary 
vote 
the national peasant party and national liberal party have 
emerged as the primary opposition to the front 
but the poll by infas a respected west german institute gave 
the liberals only 95 percent to 10 percent of the parliamentary 
vote and the peasants party just 35 percent to 4 percent 
no margin of error was given 
the election was viewed internationally as a test of whether 
romanias interim government which included many former 
communists has truly embraced democracy 
some 500 foreign observers fanned out across the country to 
monitor the election which opposition parties repeatedly charged 
had been unfair due to the fronts domination of politics and media 
ratiu said before casting his ballot in bucharest that the 
runup to the election had been totally undemocratic 
campeanu also voting in the capital called the elections a 
great feat but added there is a fear they will be rigged 
romania is the only country in eastern europe to overthrow its 
communist government through a violent revolution 
although the preelection campaign occasionally turned violent 
no incidents were reported sunday 
thousands of police and soldiers were dispatched to keep order 
around polling centers 
the biggest difficulty with the vote appeared to be moving 
people through the polling stations quickly authorities said 
voters took longer than expected to fill in the complex ballots 
and there were apparently not enough voting booths 
staterun radio and television reported isolated incidents of 
prestamped ballots being discovered in bucharest and cluj it did 
not give details 
in brasov 100 miles north of bucharest some voting centers ran 
out of ballots by midafternoon the county electoral bureau 
reported voters were forced to wait while officials transferred 
extra ballots from other sites and ordered an emergency printing of 
10000 more ballots 
the officials said the situation occurred because many people 
received permission to vote outside their hometowns and cast their 
ballots in brasov 
the main issues of the campaign included moving romanias 
centralized socialist system to a freemarket economy and 
dismantling the communist system industrial workers more than 40 
percent of the labor force have strongly opposed a rapid change to 
capitalism fearing it could promote unemployment 
opposition parties have claimed iliescu will continue the 
communist system under a new name 
another issue was romanias ethnic minorities especially the 2 
million ethnic hungarians who have complained of discrimination 
tensions between romanians and ethnic hungarians exploded in march 
when six people were killed in clashes 
among those voting sunday in bucharest were ceausescus two sons 
and daughter 
the children nicu valentin and zoia elena are under 
investigation for crimes connected to their fathers 24year reign 
and the revolution nicolae ceausescu and his wife elena were 
executed after the revolution

letter from carter who was an international observer to 
wednesdays balloting the letter recommended a halt in the vote 
count while voter tallies from several municipalities are reviewed

balaguer a conservative held a 05 percent lead after results 
were counted from at least 93 percent of the polling stations

election officials agreed to verify the vote count by comparing 
tally sheets obtained by political parties at the polling stations 
with those received by elections officials that review began 
saturday 
electoral board president froilan tavares said sunday the vote 
count would be suspended until the review was completed 
in his letter carter said he was returning to observe the 
laborious process on may 25 
tavares said mistakes were committed in several municipalities 
which did not return complete tally sheets or had turned in tallies 
unsigned by local election delegates as is required by the 
election board 
he said there were also other unspecified errors tavares 
said the process of rechecking was expected to take several days 
before returning to the united states on friday carter said he 
had no evidence of fraud but said it was possible that honest 
errors were committed

a seaplane enthusiast took off sunday in 
perfect weather a rain shower in his second attempt to be 
the first to fly around the world landing only on water 
leaving a dock on lake washington pilot tom casey nearly 
damaged a pontoon because of a fouled rudder line that caused the 
oneengine plane to turn toward the shore 
casey killed the engine quickly and the plane gently bumped 
into the rocks after a moment to free the line he restarted the 
engine and was airborne shortly before 11 am pdt 
moments earlier the former seattle ski equipment and clothing 
manufacturer shrugged off the intermittent rain 
oh this is perfect weather casey said 
casey 53 of everett said he had sunk everything he owns and 
has borrowed 40000 more to make the attempt he estimated total 
costs at more than 500000 and has lined up sponsors to provide 
money and materials 
caseys cessna u206g stationaire ii painted red white and 
blue and dubbed liberty ii was modified with tougher floats 
and a more powerful engine and propeller 
the security is my biggest concern im not leaving this plane 
alone ill tell you that he said ill sleep in it if i have 
to 
his circumnavigation attempt on a westtoeast route last year 
ended about halfway when liberty i overturned in a windstorm while 
parked in reykjavik iceland 
casey said he expected to fly an average of six or seven hours a 
day and about half the distance alone 
the rest he plans to fly with observers including a 
governmentsupplied navigator required for all flights that are not 
on commercial air routes over the soviet union 
he expects to make 80 takeoffs and landings on oceans lakes and 
rivers on a route to anchorage alaska across the soviet union 
through moscow and leningrad over scandinavia to london north to 
iceland and greenland south again to maine and then through the 
south and midwest 
his return is set for a day before the opening of the goodwill 
games in seattle on july 21 
the toughest part is the 12stop 6000mile soviet section 
largely because of the uncertainty of obtaining fuel and any needed 
parts or service in remote areas he said 
if more miles are needed to make the 24860 required for 
certification as an aroundtheworld flight casey said he might 
add a segment or two through mexico 
the distance minimum the length a flight would take along the 
tropic of cancer is set by the federation aeronautique 
internationale the official world air record sanctioning body 
casey said he had spent two years planning the trip but had been 
toying with the idea for a decade 
his inspiration he said was the first roundtheworld flight 
by two douglas world cruisers also originating and ending in 
seattle in 1924 
casey dismissed the notion that aroundtheworld flights to set 
various records were becoming passe 
ill be indirectly blazing a trail casey said 
if i can do it in a float plane anybody can do it anywhere 
he said what aircraft can people relate to more than this 
aircraft anybody can fly this plane you can go right down and 
rent one just take off

president bush said sunday that despite 
new agreements on arms control differences on a wide array of 
subjects remain to be debated at his upcoming summit with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
even though secretary of state james a baker iii and his soviet 
counterparts failed to make substantial progress on reducing troops 
and tanks in europe during four days of talks in moscow bush said 
he still believes a conventional forces treaty can be completed by 
the end of the year 
weve got to get that done he said until its totally 
finished weve got to stay in close consultation with the soviets 
although continuing to voice a measured reaction to the 
agreements reached saturday the president said that overall 
im satisfied with the progress made in moscow that well have a 
good summit 
in the arms control area theres been some progress there 
still remain some other problems including the sticky issue of 
reducing tanks and troops in europe he told reporters traveling 
with him on air force one from houston to portland 
other issues of conflict he expects to discuss in the may 
30june 3 summit in washington bush said include german 
reunification and regional problems in afghanistan and cuba 
nobody thought it would be easy so were just plugging away 
on a wide array of agenda items he said the differences will 
be on the agenda 
bakers talks in moscow resulted in agreement on chemical 
weapons reductions and resolution of thorny sticking points on 
sealaunched and airlaunched cruise missiles 
us officials said the arms control agreement will result in 
some kind of summit declaration short of a formal treaty that 
would point the way to an overall reduction of 30 percent to 35 
percent in us and soviet longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines 
the chemical weapons treaty is expected to be ready for signing 
at the summit in 10 days 
bush refused to clarify conflicting reports about what secretary 
of state james a baker iii told lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene while in moscow us officials with baker 
denied statements by some sources that he had urged the lithuanians 
to suspend their declaration of independence from the soviet union 
bush said he would not discuss what baker might have said in 
private saying only we want to see talks going between 
moscow and the lithuanian leaders we want to see self 
determination of the people of lithuania 
pressed on the us position regarding whether lithuania should 
go along with moscows demand that it suspend the independence 
gambit bush added that theres no point when youre trying to 
make progress to discuss every aspect of it in public 
later in a speech to a law enforcement group bush accused 
congress of spawning weak imitations of his proposals to attack 
crime after allowing them to languish for a year 
we must reject those who softpedal the need to be hard on 
crime bush said a day in advance of senate debate on an 
anticrime bill 
he accused lawmakers of sitting on key anticrime measures he 
first proposed a year ago but he also acknowledged that congress 
agreed to his request for more federal law enforcement officers 
prosecutors and prisons as part of antidrug legislation enacted 
earlier 
bush said he still wants congressional action on his call for 
expanded use of the death penalty fewer burdens on police in 
gathering evidence and limits on the length prisoners have for 
filing federal appeals 
i urge the senate and in coming weeks the house to act quickly 
and build america up by opposing those who would tear america 
down he said 
senate democrats have recrafted bushs proposals and with the 
support of law enforcement groups inserted into the package a ban 
on the sale and manufacture of nine types of semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
fred mcclure bushs legislative liaison said the 
administration now opposes much of the package and will push for a 
substitute version by sen strom thurmond rsc 
the president visited portland to attend a fundraising event 
monday for gubernatorial candidate dave frohnmayer and also for 
sundays dedication of a memorial to portland police officers slain 
in the line of duty 
the department has lost 21 officers in its 139year history the 
last one 6 years ago the white house said 
bush said the administration anticrime proposal he unveiled in 
may 1989 would help free the country from violent crime 
yet for the past year it has gathered dust in the house and 
spawned weak imitations in the senate he said america 
deserves better so do the 163 police officers who died last year 
conservatives and the national rifle association are pushing 
hard to remove the proposed ban on semiautomatic assault weapons in 
the democratic bill although he has move to restrict imports of 
assault weapons bush has been unwilling to ban domestically 
produced models 
the democratic package however also includes some provisions 
more to bushs liking it authorizes the death penalty for 30 
federal crimes including presidential assassination and reshapes 
the sometimes drawnout postappeals process under which convicts 
seek new trials 
the bill also fine tunes the nations moneylaundering laws and 
reverses attorney general dick thornburghs decision giving local 
us attorneys control over the justice departments

mayor david dinkins pleaded for peace from a 
harlem pulpit sunday saying racial tensions threaten to plunge the 
nations biggest city into a cycle of fear and frustration 
in brooklyn about 100 people organized by a civil rights 
coalition marched past two koreanamerican groceries that have been 
boycotted mostly by blacks since january 
an equal number of boycotters chanted slogans as an estimated 
300 police officers guarded the stores and accompanied the 
marchers who called for an end to bigotry 
the boycott is one of a series of situations or incidents that 
have increased racial tensions in the city 
the most serious involved the slaying by a white mob of a black 
16yearold who went to brooklyns bensonhurst neighborhood with 
three friends a jurys verdict in the case friday sparked further 
polarization 
the panel acquitted a 19yearold accused of being the mobs 
leader of murder and manslaughter charges one day after another 
jury convicted another 19yearold of seconddegree murder in the 
aug 23 slaying of yusuf hawkins 
dinkins new yorks first black mayor entered the salem united 
methodist church in a burnedout section of harlem just before noon 
sunday knelt alone before the altar and buried his face in his 
hands to pray then he stepped to the pulpit 
when nelson mandela arrives i hope he will find a city at 
peace said dinkins referring to the scheduled visit next month 
of the south african apartheid fighter 
tensions are threatening to plunge new york into a cycle of 
fear and frustration that could tear us apart the mayor told 
several hundred worshipers 
we all come from somewhere else we came here to escape 
prejudice he said repeating a theme of earlier recent appeals 
for racial harmony 
dinkins praised a group of black high school students who last 
week defied the boycott and shopped at one of the groceries 
the boycott was triggered by accusations that a black woman was 
attacked in the store by a koreanamerican employee who suspected 
her of shoplifting 
i believe the boycott can be solved in a peaceful negotiated 
way dinkins added we need to be free to walk on any street 
free to shop in any store 
dinkins walked out of the church to a roaring standing ovation 
the congregation sang the civil rights anthem we shall overcome 
as they swayed and held hands in a chain 
later dinkins led the martin luther king jr memorial parade up 
fifth avenue several hundred people took part in the parade which 
was sparsely attended 
this years parade is more important than any other said 
roman catholic cardinal john oconnor who greeted the mayor on the 
steps of st patricks cathedral 
oconnor said he would try to join labor and church leaders in a 
discussion of the citys racial problems set for tuesday 
marchers in brooklyns flatbush section sunday said they were 
neither for nor against the boycott but wanted to see an end to 
racial discrimination and bigotry 
as the marchers disappeared down the street the boycotters 
chanted what does the fortune cookie say no money today 
the march continued past the site where a vietnamese immigrant 
was seriously beaten by a group of blacks police later 
characterized that a random confrontation unrelated to race 
we the people of new york in goodwill say no more norman 
siegel head of the new york civil rights coalition said through a 
bullhorn

a flotilla of private boats piloted by 
exiles sailed sunday across the wavetossed florida straits to 
rally for democracy on the edge of communist cubas territory 
cuban patrol boats were waiting but there were no 
confrontations said lt cmdr jeff karonis a coast guard 
spokesman 
it was a very emotional moment for all the cubans who 
particiapted in this said julio rebull of miami we felt we 
were right in front of the wall like the berlin wall that 
separates our people 
although 34 boats sailed from key west at sunrise only 24 made 
it all the way to the rendezvous point about 20 miles north of the 
cuban coast by early afternoon karonis said 
the flotilla sailed parallel with the cuban coast for about six 
miles then headed back across the strait for key west said petty 
officer luis diaz 
exiles tossed wreaths of flowers and bottles with messages into 
the water rebull said for seven minutes a catholic priest read 
prayers to a cuban operator monitoring a vhf radio channel from the 
lighthouse at havana harbor he added 
by just looking and knowing on the horizon that we were less 
than an hour away from our homeland and after talking on the vhf 
everyone was crying said rebull 53 a veteran of the 1961 bay 
of pigs invasion for me personnally it was the most emotional 
moment in my 30 years of exile 
rebull said the cuban operator acknowledged recieving the 
message but made no further response the ocean current carried 
the messages and flowers north away from cuba 
coast guard cutters on patrol in the straits monitored the 
flotilla by radar but did not provide an escort coast guard 
officials said they had warned the exiles to protest verbally but 
go along peacefully if they were intercepted by cuban defense 
forces and also warned them that cuba claims a territorial sea 
extending 12 miles or more from the coastline 
the expedition was billed as a peaceful demonstration against 
cubas communist government as well as a celebration of cubas 
independence from spain 
it will bring a message of solidarity and support for efforts 
seeking democracy in cuba spokesman jose basulto said before the 
flotilla sailed 
backers had said they expected more than 100 boats to take park 
but diaz said that no more than 51 signed up and only 34 actually 
sortied out of key west 
for reasons ranging from breakdowns to not wanting to buck 
5foot waves in the center of the 90milewide straits 10 of those 
34 stayed on this side diaz said 
its not the first time cuban exiles have ventured into the 
florida straits to protest castros government in september 1988 
two boatloads of exiles left key west to protest human rights 
abuses on the island cuban gunboats stopped them 17 miles offshore 
coincidentally as the flotilla headed south sunday morning two 
cubans escaping the island on a raft of innertubes were spotted by 
a pleasure boat in the straits about 20 miles east of key west 
karonis said the sunburned pair were picked up by a coast guard 
boat and brought in to key west where they were turned over to 
us immigration authorities sunday afternoon

president bush said sunday the jobs of 
timberrelated workers must be considered before forests are 
cordoned off to protect the northern spotted owl 
rep dennis smith rore said bush promised him sunday night 
that he would try to schedule a white house meeting in which 
logging interests and others could present their case before a 
decision is made on whether to protect the owl by listing it either 
as a threatened or an endangered species 
theres a lot of people whos livelihood is threatened out 
here i want to hear more about it bush said during a photo 
session with smith were trying to find out what is the right 
thing to do weve got to be concerned about the human equation as 
well as the environmental equation he said 
a federal interagency task force recommended setting aside 
several million acres of forest land as preserves to save the 
northern spotted owl the us fish and wildlife service is 
deciding whether to list the bird as a threatened or an endangered 
series or to leave it unprotected 
locally estimates have circulated that 28000 timberrelated 
jobs could be lost if the preserves are established and put off 
limits to logging 
im interested in the owl very much so and im also 
interested in jobs bush said during a second photo opportunity 
with washington gop congressional candidate bob williams so 
well try to find a balanced approach 
he said he was determined to come down on the side of people 
and still have a sound environmental policy i want to be known 
as the environmental president bush told smith but i also 
want to be one whos concerned about a persons ability to hold a 
job and have a job theres a lot at stake here in this question 
bush was to talk about the owl issue monday at a gop 
fundraising event 
smith told reporters that if the spotted owl is declared a 
threatened species then environmentalists are going to go out 
and find all kinds of owls and make more forest areas off limits 
we dont have an endangered species we have an endangered 
subspecies if even that he said there are millions of owls 
in this world this little puppy just happens to be kind of a 
passive kind of an animal that is being run over by the great 
horned owl the bottom line is people are more important than 
owls 
smith said at the white house meeting he wants to tell the 
president whats wrong with the endangered species act 
bush campaigned on a platform promising to be the environmental 
president so far his environmental record has been more 
progressive than that of his predecessor ronald reagan but has 
drawn mixed reviews from environmentalists

president lee tenghui on sunday urged an 
end to hostilities with chinas communist government and released 
10 political prisoners to mark his inauguration 
it was the first time a taiwan president had publicly indicated 
a desire to move away from the 40yearold policy of the three 
nos toward beijing no official contact no negotiations and no 
compromise 
at his presidential inauguration ceremony lee also promised an 
amnesty for political prisoners he pledged the restoration of 
civil rights to previously jailed political prisoners including 
the chairman of the opposition democratic progressive party 
allowing them to run for public office 
nine people imprisoned on sedition charges were released sunday 
including hsu hsinliang 49 who was jailed last year after 
returning from selfimposed exile in the united states 
taiwans bestknown political prisoner shih mingteh was also 
released early monday morning he had been jailed in 1979 on 
charges of instigating an antigovernment riot in the southern port 
city of kaohsiung 
he had originally refused to allow his family to sign for his 
release because he maintains he is innocent his sister said 
human rights groups claim taiwan has roughly a dozen other 
political prisoners 
meanwhile lees nomination of the nations only fourstar 
general as premier continued to spark protests on sunday about 
10000 people including students and opposition party members 
staged a noisy march through taipei smashing windows and throwing 
eggs at offices of the military and the ruling nationalist party 
lee heads the nationalist chinese government that has been based 
on the island of taiwan ever since losing a civil war to communist 
forces on the chinese mainland in 1949 
the nationalists still claim to be the rightful government of 
all china and beijing regards taiwan as a renegade province 
lee proposed establishing channels of communication and said 
the two countries should completely open up academic cultural 
economic trade scientific and technological exchange to lay a 
foundation of mutual respect peace and prosperity 
we hope then when objective conditions are ripe we will be 
able to discuss the matter of our national reunification he 
said reunification is a longstanding goal of the nationalists 
but lee said before such relations could be established beijing 
must renounce the use of force against taiwan end its policy of 
isolating taiwan diplomatically and promote democracy and a free 
economic system in china 
while beijing previously has indicated it would not meet 
conditions set by lee the speech clearly was designed to reflect 
taipeis desire to gradually improve relations with its neighbor 
across the taiwan straits recently civilian and business contacts 
have been growing between the two sides 
the president also expressed a desire to end within two years 
the mobilization for the suppression of the communist 
rebellion which dates from 1948 the decree has ensured the 
nationalists monopoly on power by stipulating that legislators 
elected before 1949 on the chinese mainland must stay in office 
until they can return to their constituencies for reelection 
this has presented obstacles to expanding relations with china 
and introducing democratic reforms in taiwan 
lee also stressed his commitment to bring more democracy to 
taiwan but his nomination of gen hau peitsun as the new premier 
has led opposition politicians and intellectuals to question the 
governments commitment 
in recent years the nationalist party has lifted martial law 
allowed multiparty elections and eased press restrictions but 
protesters closely identify hau 71 with the partys authoritarian 
past and believe his nomination could lead to a resurgence of 
military influence 
hau was chief of the general staff for eight years before 
becoming defense minister last year 
the halfhour presidential inauguration ceremony at the sun 
yatsen memorial hall attended by about 2600 people went off 
without incident 
lee became the first native taiwanese to lead the government in 
january 1988 when he moved up from the vice presidency to succeed 
president chiang chingkuo who died in office 
chiang was the eldest son of chiang kaishek the nationalist 
leader who led the retreat to taiwan four decades ago

hows this for revisionist history the 
pilgrims sailed to america in the pinto paul revere wrote the 
starspangled banner sandra day oconnor is chief justice of the 
us supreme court 
and gen douglas macarthur said give me liberty or give me 
death or was it martin luther king jr 
these are samplings of responses from communitycollege students 
to questions that might be asked of immigrants seeking us 
citizenship 
just five of 119 students at bellevue community college managed 
a passing grade of 70 percent or better 
this is pretty bad said aslam khan head of the colleges 
political science department who administered the test 
why should we give these questions to foreigners when our own 
citizens dont know what is going on asked the pakistanborn 
khan who took such a test when he became a naturalized citizen 
less than half the students knew that the supreme law of the 
land is the constitution 
when asked what kind of government the united states has many 
answered capitalist rather than a democracy 
some said the pilgrims left europe because they were searching 
for something to colonize apparently forgetting the religious 
persecution that prompted them to flee to the new world 
a decade ago khan gave a similar test of 10 questions to 118 
students six passed 
its not getting any better he said 
it may be good for a few snickers when a student identifies 
abraham lincoln as the principal author of the declaration of 
independence but when only one student answers 29 of the 30 
questions correctly and just 18 get 60 percent right everybody 
should be concerned khan said 
i think people should know what is going on in this country 
he said we really do need a course in remedial american 
government 
for the record 
the pinta not the pinto was one of three ships used by 
christopher columbus along with the nina and the santa maria the 
pilgrims sailed in the mayflower 
francis scott key wrote the national anthem while paul revere 
warned american revolutionaries the british were coming 
ms oconnor is the first woman to serve on the supreme court 
which has yet to have a woman chief justice 
patrick henry preferred death over tyranny in his famous to 
the virginia house of burgesses while macarthur is remembered for 
pledging i shall return to the philippines and civilrights 
leader king for his i have a dream speech

it is the only regional cooperation organization to unite 
neutral nations with countries from the wests north atlantic 
treaty organization and the sovietled warsaw pact

before a peaceful revolution in czechoslovakia toppled the

the decision to admit czechoslovakia was taken in april members 
of the group said say romania and bulgaria have also applied to

investment grants to the new bank for european development and 
cooperation formally founded in paris on saturday

conference in copenhagen denmark on human rights proposals on 
minority rights designed to defuse potential ethnic conflicts 
particularly those in eastern europe de michelis said 
during an hourlong televised discussion the five officials each 
stressed the importance of the group as a way to bring together 
organizations with diverse affiliations but common pasts and 
interests 
yugoslavia is nonaligned and in transition between communism and 
democracy czechoslovakia and hungary moving swiftly toward 
westernstyle democracy are still members of the sovietled warsaw 
pact and comecon austria is a neutral member of the european free

undercover officers who went to high school 
campuses to buy drugs this year say they ran into something never 
encountered before students who told them to just say no 
all eight young officers who posed as high school students on 
nine los angeles campuses last semester ran into at least some 
students who advised them against using drugs police chief daryl 
gates said friday 
officer sonia caballero added that some students she approached 
about buying drugs even told her they dont like to associate with 
people who are users 
gates said that was the first time in the 17year history of the 
departments twiceayear high school drugbuy program that ever 
happened he hopes it means the tide may be turning against drug 
use among los angeles high school students 
i feel we are moving toward winning our war on drugs on the 
campuses he said 
gates said police made about 165 purchases from 139 dealers at 
the nine high schools he said 120 arrests have been made so far 
with more anticipated 
nearly 10000 worth of drugs including lsd amphetamines and 
psilocybin was seized 
gates said as many as 300 buys would routinely be made during a 
semester in the 1970s when campus drug use appeared to be at its 
height 
but he acknowledged that buys may be down in part because 
students have become more careful because the word is out that 
undercover narcs haunt their campuses

supporters because colombian law prohibits public appearances by 
candidates during the last week of the campaign 
during the race for the may 27 elections three candidates were 
killed 
in less than nine months gunmen believed to have been working 
for drug traffickers have killed luis carlos galan of the governing 
liberal party bernardo jaramillo of the patriotic union party and 
carlos pizarro of the april 19 movement or m19 
it was galans assassination in august that set off a 
usbacked government crackdown on the traffickers who responded 
with a wave of violent attacks 
since august president virgilio barcos administration has 
extradited 14 drug suspects killed medellin cartel leader gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging 
to the cocaine magnates 
bombings blamed on the medellin cartel including urban carbomb 
attacks and an explosion aboard a colombian jetliner have killed 
about 300 people in the last nine months 
in the latest attack a car bomb exploded late sunday outside a 
shopping center in northern bogota wounding six people and causing 
extensive damage to buildings officials said 
earlier sunday gunmen wounded two pedestrians when they sprayed 
the police headquarters in the city of medellin with automatic 
weapon fire 
death threats forced gaviria who replaced galan as liberal 
party candidate to cancel recent campaign appearances 
campaign sources said they believed the death threats were from 
drug traffickers angry over the candidates promise to continue a 
government crackdown on the countrys cocaine cartels 
during his speech gaviria repeated his promise to carry forward 
galans reform program including changes in the countrys congress 
and judiciary 
colombians frequently point to the congress as the governmental 
branch most corrupted by drug traffickers payoffs traffickers 
have also severely damaged the countrys judicial system by 
bribing threatening and killing judges 
we are obligated to reform our justice system gaviria said 
sunday it must be made effective so that we colombians can 
confront the violence that comes from drug traffickers 
narcoterrorists and common criminals 
fifteen bodyguards their jackets bulging with firearms crowded 
around the candidate as he spoke from a podium 20 feet above the 
crowd on the stadiums floor 
the stiffness apparent in gavirias movements suggested that the 
red parka he was wearing was packed with bulletresistant plastic 
colombian law prohibits the publication of public opinion polls 
during the last month of the campaign but recent private polls 
have shown gaviria leading his nearest rival by at least 30 
percentage points 
two other leading candidates alvaro gomez of the independent 
national salvation movement and rodrigo lloreda of the conservative 
party also made appearances sunday at smaller political gatherings 
in bogota 
both candidates have said they were willing to end the 
governments policy of extraditing drug suspects in exchange for 
traffickers pledge to end their campaign of terrorist attacks 
another candidate antonio navarro was not making appearances 
on sunday navarro who became the candidate for the leftist m19 
movement after last months assassination of pizarro said he has 
also received death threats 
candidates will continue campaigning this week on radio and 
television stations the government donated time on stateowned 
television stations for candidates advertising and speeches so 
they could cut down on risky personal appearances

the netherlands and belgium have threatened to 
contest the choice of a frenchman as head of a new development bank 
for eastern europe and the choice of london as its headquarters 
the 42 members of the 12 billion european bank for 
reconstruction and development voted late saturday to make jacques 
attali the institutions first president with london as its 
headquarters attali won over a dutch rival 
the treaty establishing the bank which will finance eastern 
europes transition to a marketoriented economy is to be signed 
in paris may 29 
as far as were concerned there was no vote it was simply an 
opinion poll said cees maas a senior dutch treasury official 
and head of the dutch delegation 
dutch delegates said they intend to review their position prior 
to the treaty signing 
there were 32 votes among the 42 founding members in favor of 
attali top aide to president francois mitterrand and credited with 
conceiving the idea of the bank his dutch rival for the chief 
executives job onno ruding received eight two of the banks 
members the european commission and the european investment bank 
abstained 
london received 23 votes as the choice for the banks 
headquarters while amsterdam and copenhagen gathered five each 
other cities in the running to host the institution were berlin 
brussels dublin ljubljana madrid prague and vienna 
it was not immediately clear whether a decision by the dutch and 
belgians not to sign the treaty would prevent the bank from coming 
to life but officials said privately that such a move certainly 
would delay the proceedings 
the dutch backed by six other small western european nations 
have led a diplomatic offensive against the choices of attali and 
london they claim the selection was a precooked decision 
cobbled together by the seven leading industrialized countries in 
washington earlier this month 
the g7 decision offended many people commented one 
european official noting that many of the smaller countries in the 
european community felt they were being left out of the 
decisionmaking process 
the 12 ec nations hold a controlling 51 percent interest in the 
bank the united states is the banks biggest single shareholder 
with a 10 percent stake eastern european countries will hold 135 
percent 
the g7 agreement on attali and london came after france and 
britain settled a longrunning dispute over their respective 
rankings inside the international monetary fund that arrangement 
gives france equal ranking with britain 
observers at the time said the deal was a tradeoff with 
britain agreeing to the imf reclassification if france would 
support london as the site of the development bank 
the dutch made a lastminute proposal on friday to withdraw 
their support for ruding a former dutch finance minister if the 
other ec countries would agree to locate the bank in amsterdam 
under the banks statutes twothirds of the 42 founding members 
must ratify the treaty before the bank can start lending to 
countries in eastern europe the ratification process must be 
completed by next spring

the washington public power supply system 
has announced it will offer 600 million in refunding bonds for 
sale the week of june 4 
the sale announced friday would be the fourth in the effort by 
wppss and the federal bonneville power administration to refinance 
about 28 billion in bonds sold a decade ago to finance 
construction of three nuclear power plants the outstanding 
highinterest bonds carry interest rates upwards of 9 percent 
about 16 billion in debt for wppss plants nos 1 2 and 3 has 
been refinanced through issuance of new bonds carrying interest 
rates of from 6 percent to 7 percent

one and possibly two more sales after june he said all sales of 
refinancing bonds are to be completed this year

northwest region which is paying for the wppss plants through bpa 
electricity rates about 1 billion

interest rates received in the previous three sales

this year 
senior manager for the june sale is first boston corp 
the supply system headquartered in richland attempted to build 
five nuclear power plants in the 1970s 
of those one plant no 2 at the hanford nuclear reservation 
is operating after starting up in late 1984 
two others nos 1 and 3 are mothballed because of construction 
delays 
wppss terminated the other two plants nos 4 and 5 in 1982 
and defaulted on 225 billion in bonds sold for their construction 
plants 1 2 and 3 are being paid for through bpa rates the 
bonneville umbrella was never extended to plants nos 4 and 5
