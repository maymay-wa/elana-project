vice president salvador laurel said 
saturday that doctors fear ferdinand marcos has lost the will to 
live has only a 10 percent chance of surviving the year and wants 
to die in his own country 
laurel spoke to reporters after returning from honolulu where 
the ousted philippine president accused of plundering billions from 
his homeland is in exile 
he said he would seek a meeting immediately with president 
corazon aquino to relay marcos wish and appeal to her sense of 
christian values to allow the former president to come home to die 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos or members of his family 
to return from hawaii where they have lived since a popular 
uprising toppled his 20year administration in february 1986 
laurel said doctors in honolulu told him that marcos might not 
survive the trip to the philippines but that the former president 
would prefer to die on the plane rather than on foreign soil 
a newspaper in the philippines quoted a cabinet official as 
saying saturday that the government has decided not to allow marcos 
to return and would even bar his body from being sent back after he 
dies 
the philippine daily inquirer quoted cabinet secretary jose de 
jesus as saying the government feared marcos supporters would try 
to destabilize the aquino administration if their leader came home 
we cant risk the gains by any destabilization effort which 
could derail us de jesus was quoted as saying 
the newspaper quoted unidentified government sources as saying 
the cabinet considered allowing marcos to return to laoag capital 
of his home province of ilocos norte about 250 miles north of 
manilabut the idea was rejected because of fears marcos would not 
honor the restriction the paper said 
laurel visited marcos hospital bedside thursday without mrs 
aquinos blessing 
marcos 71 remained in critical condition friday in st francis 
medical centers intensive care unit but an attorney said marcos 
was buoyed by laurels visit and doctors said his fever had subsided 
laurel declined to disclose details of his conversations with 
marcos his doctors and his wife imelda 
whatever our past differences and conflicts the reality is 
that the crisis in this mans life can seriously affect political 
stability of the philippines now is the time for compassion and 
forgiveness in order to achieve much needed unity among all 
filipinos laurel said in a statement thursday night 
marcos and his wife are under us indictment for allegedly 
plundering the philippines of more than 100 million and stashing 
much of the money in the united states 
when laurel was asked whether marcos would ever return to his 
homeland he repliedthats up to her referring to mrs aquino 
marcos son ferdinand jr said he relayed a letter to mrs 
aquino asking that his father be allowed to return mrs aquino who 
has repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return said she had not 
received the letter 
i can just make a decision once i know what the letter is all 
about she told the associated press in manila 
laurel conceded his was a personal not official visit but said 
he would make a full report to mrs aquino 
marcos was breathing with the assistance of a respirator 
following emergency surgery wednesday to reduce fluids building up 
in his lungs hospital spokeswoman norma kop said marcos was alert 
but unable to talk because of the respirator 
marcos was admitted to the hospital jan 15 for treatment of 
pneumonia and bronchial asthma in december he was hospitalized 
twice with congestive heart failure 
the marcoses would need permission from the us attorney general 
and the us district court in new york to leave the united states 
according to assistant us attorney charles labella the prosecutor 
in the us governments racketeering case against marcos and his 
wife 
a federal judge in new york is to decide this month whether 
marcos is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering 
charges mrs marcos pleaded innocent and is free on 5 million bail

barbara bush says she fears guns and despite 
the presidents membership in the national rifle association favors 
banning the rapidfire assault weapons used in a wave of gang 
killings and the california rampage that left five children dead and 
29 others wounded 
the first lady in an interview friday also expressed enormous 
sympathy for the financial plight of members of congress who are 
taking political heat for a 51 percent pay increase 
i know it sounds outrageous to people at home but if they saw 
the cost of washington housing its terrible and the 
sacrifices the family makes mrs bush said 
she said her family had not been able to live off her husbands 
salary in the 1960s when he was a member of the house from houston 
but had to rely on the money he had earned as an oilman she said 
they probably could have made it on his congressional salary if they 
hadnt owned two homes and hadnt wanted to send their children to 
private schools 
mrs bush said she did not want to discuss the politics and 
policies surrounding handgun ownership her husband president 
bush opposes new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member 
of the nra the nra is the most powerful lobby against laws 
regulating firearms 
i myself do not own a gun she said i choose not to get 
into that im afraid of guns im so afraid id shoot the wrong 
person 
nancy reagan before moving to washington eight years ago 
revealed she had owned a tiny little gun that she kept by her 
bed for protection while her husband was away in her first white 
house interview in 1981 mrs reagan said she had gotten rid of the 
weapon 
marking the end of her second week in the white house mrs bush 
spent part of friday afternoon giving her first interviews since her 
husband became president i feel at home here she said sitting 
on a couch bathed in light from an arched window behind her 
asked if her husband had changed in any way since becoming 
president she replied i dont see a difference with him 
pointing to several people in the room she said i see a 
difference in you and you and you not me i mean its just 
different when youre president everybody treats you differently 
when youre president 
joking about her husbands former status as vice president mrs 
bush said i spend half my life saying could you please get the 
vice president on the phone and the operator says do you really 
want dan quayle or dont you know dan quayles in venezuela 
more seriously she said one big difference for bush is that 
everything you say becomes major and it is major he is the 
president of the united states 
and yet she said of her husband i think hes exactly the 
same she said many people who used to kid with her husband had 
stopped doing that briefly but after awhile they all became normal 
again it just took a little while 
i call him mr president sometimes when im needling him 
to tease him yes mr president 
the first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws 
banning sale to the public of military assault guns measures to 
outlaw the manufacture sale or possession of a variety of rifles 
are pending in congress and dozens of states it was a chinese ak47 
assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five 
children were killed and 29 others were wounded in stockton calif 
last month 
mrs bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed 
they should be absolutely she said 
while refusing to discuss her position on handguns mrs bush 
said that she does not like to go hunting as does her husband an 
avid outdoorsman 
i went hunting with george once mrs bush recalled he 
told me to follow the bird and i followed the bird and his head 
came right through that little circle the rifle scope i put down 
the gun and said thats it im not going to do that again

president bush was using his camp david 
mountain hideaway today to work on a plan for solving the savings 
and loan crisis that aides said was unlikely to embrace a 
controversial deposit insurance fee 
bush was meeting at the maryland compound with treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady budget director richard darman and other key 
advisers to go over the treasurys recommendations for sampls 
white house aides speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
did not expect the president to reach a final decision on the 
complete sampl package although a depositors fee seems to have been 
ruled out 
administration officials have refused to disavow the fee 
publicly but aides conceded privately that the plan most likely 
would not include it 
on friday bush summoned congressional leaders to the white house 
to hear their advice just as in a thursday meeting with industry 
officials the president did not reveal his own preference from 
among the options discussed 
from the congressional leaders participants said bush heard 
overwhelmingly onesided advice against a proposal to charge 
depositors about 25 cents for every 100 in their accounts 
i dont recall anybody taking the other side of that issue 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich the chairman of the senate 
banking committee told reporters afterward 
both he and sen jake garn rutah the committees senior 
republican predicted that the bailout package eventually agreed to 
by congress and the administration would include an increase in the 
premium that institutions pay for federal insurance but no new 
direct fee on depositors 
that deposit fee is not a live option garn said i dont 
think it was to begin with 
the fees or insurance premium increase would help raise the 7 
billion to 9 billion needed to pay the interest on the 85 billion 
to 100 billion in borrowing that the administration believes is 
needed to bail out insolvent thrifts 
the president told the legislators that he hopes to have the 
administrations plan in place early next week on thursday he 
addresses a joint housesenate session on the budget 
at the meeting friday bush told lawmakers whatever we come up 
with will not be popular and i expect that whatever you come up 
with will not be popular but weve got to get the problem solved 
there are no easy answers and no worrying about blame plenty 
to go around 
meanwhile in another development federal regulators late friday 
announced the resignation of stuart d root the executive director 
of the fund that insures savings and loan deposits 
root appointed to head the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp in october 1987 submitted his resignation on monday it will 
be effective feb 10 
replacing root as acting director will be mary a creedon 
currently principal deputy director of operations said the federal 
home loan bank board the fslics parent agency she had previously 
served as acting fslic director from december 1983 until march 1987 
root last year presided over the sales or closings of 205 
insolvent institutions and the stabilization of 18 others at a 
combined cost of 38 billion

president friday after ousting president alfredo stroessner in a 
coup that reportedly left scores dead rodriguez ordered the 
dictator out of the country he had ruled for 34 years 
rodriguez who had been stroessners secondincommand in the 
army and whose daughter is married to stroessners son took the 
oath of office and swore in a ninemember cabinet comprised of seven 
civilians an active general and a retired general 
paraguayans poured into the streets to celebrate the military 
coup and to gape at damage left by hours of heavy fighting between 
rebel soldiers and police and troops loyal to stroessner 
my government will respect the human rights of everyone to make 
democracy a reality rodriguez five rows of medals on his 
shirtfront said during a short speech at the 19th century national 
palace overlooking the broad paraguay river 
cox newspapers quoting from a classified state department 
report said friday that rodriquez is considered by law enforcement 
authorities in paraguay to be the countrys no 1 drug trafficker 
the new york times on saturday quoted john hoyt williams a 
professor of latin american history at indiana state university in 
terre haute ind as saying rodriguez has reportedly provided 
protection airfields and an air taxi service to people smuggling 
drugs northward 
at least 18 soldiers and a handful of civilians were killed 
during fierce clashes between troops loyal to stroessner and 
rodriguez the roman catholic churchrun radio caritas said saying 
that the total could top 200 
it gave no source or explanation for the wide fluctuation 
officials at the main military and police hospitals refused to give 
figures on casualties and the new government made no estimate 
but a police sergeant said on condition of anonymity im sad 
for my 35 dead companions about 150 soldiers died at the 
presidential escort batallion and two civilians 
stroessner 76 was put under house arrest at an army base about 
30 of his followers and aides detained and the hierarchy of the 
government and ruling colorado party replaced 
stroessner was ordered out of the country and unconfirmed 
reports said he was going to santiago chile but gen mario 
mardones santiago police commander said he is definitely not 
coming here tonight he is still in paraguay thats official 
mardones said he believed stroessner was leaving paraguay 
saturday morning but we do not know where to not necessarily 
chile 
rodriguez was cheered by several thousand citizens as he took the 
oath of office and swore in a cabinet about 15000 accompanied him 
to the colorado party headquarters and cheered again when he 
appointed juan ramon chaves 87 as party president replacing 
prostroessner militant sabino montonaro 
were going to have a true democracy shouted domingo laino 
president of the national accord group of four opposition parties 
and paraguays bestknown human rights advocate 
i think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected 
our country for so long has come to an end thanks to the armed 
forces said aldo zuccolillo publisher of abc color the 
countrys biggest newspaper at the time stroessner closed it down in 
1984 for printing news the government didnt like 
rodriguez however said nothing about elections nor how long his 
provisional presidency would last he spoke at his swearingin 
ceremony and in a nationwide address hours earlier in which he 
declared he was taking command of the country from this moment 
rodriguez 64 commands the first army corps the premier unit of 
the mostlyconscript 12500man army diplomats and political 
observers said his coup was provoked by stroessners attempt to 
force him to retire his personal dislike for montonaro and the 
growing influence of the military prostroessner wing of the 
colorado party 
rodriguez took advantage of what observers said was widespread 
military resentment at the forced and allegedly politically 
motivated retirements of about 130 army colonels and navy captains 
last month 
at about 945 pm thursday night shooting broke out at the 
corps base in loma pyta four miles north of the capiital soon 
after 40 to 50 tanks rumbled out of the base heading downtown 
toward the headquarters of the police and stroessners presidential 
guard 
they didnt even ask us to surrender said a member of the 
presidential guard located next to the us embassy in a 
fashionable neighborhood of streets lined by fine homes and old 
mango trees they just opened fire and battered down the gates 
with small tanks 
army units around the country rallied to rodriguez side and the 
lack of support for stroessner was broadcast throughout the capital 
by radio primero de marzo which the rebels took over 
the two tv stations in the capital abruptly went off the air 
after the shooting started as did all radio stations except radio 
caritas and radio primero de marzo 
as light dawned and paraguayans ventured from their homes they 
saw the main building at the presidential guard roofless and with 
gaping holes in its brick walls the modern national telephone 
building behind the police station was a mess of twisted metal and 
shattered glass 
pools of blood that dried quickly into large red stains were 
beside bulletriddled cars in front of the presidential guard 
scene of some of the heaviest fighting were the bodies of a dozen 
soldiers who died defending stroessner 
the coup was as successful as it was sudden and unexpected by 
afternoon rodriguez was in complete control there were no apparent 
pockets of resistence to his authority no condemnations by foreign 
governments 
stroessner had been a staunch us ally but in 1986 the reagan 
administration labeled his government a dictatorship he has been 
reported in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago

the operator of the three mile island nuclear 
plant has been given clearance to boil away 23 million gallons of 
radioactive water that is part of the legacy of the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident 
about 260000 gallons of the water has been sitting in the 
reactor building basement since the accident at the pennsylvania 
plant in 1979 the rest of the water was used in cleanup operations 
since the accident 
general public utilities nuclear the plant operator proposed to 
get rid of all the water by boiling it into steam released from a 
100foothigh stack and packaging impurities for shipment to a 
lowlevel radioactive waste dump 
but two pennsylvania citizens groups challenged the decision 
expressing concern about the release of radiation into the 
atmosphere the groups asked the atomic safety and licensing board 
which is part of the nuclear regulatory commission to consider 
other alternatives including storing the water in tanks for perhaps 
30 years to allow radiation to decay 
but after holding hearings in lancaster pa the licensing board 
said in a written decision that the storage plan is not obviously 
superior to the evaporation proposal 
we are convinced that implementation of gpu nuclears 
proposal will have extremely small radiation exposure consequences 
both to workers and the general public the board said 
last spring gpu nuclear raised eyebrows among local citizens by 
spending initial 800000 on the evaporation system even before the 
licensing board had held hearings to decide whether the system could 
be used 
kay pickering spokeswoman for three mile island alert an 
antinuclear group said at the time that it was distressing 
that the plant operator had apparently acted prematurely 
but gpu nuclear said it was merely trying to plan ahead and that 
it would abide by whatever the board decided 
the 7 million evaporation process is part of the 1 billion 
cleanup of three mile island unit 2 during the accident uranium 
fuel was allowed to lose the vital cooling water the normally covers 
it causing material in the core to melt

donald trump needs only a safety certification 
from the federal aviation administration to clear the way for his 
takeover of eastern airlines profitable northeastern shuttle 
service 
the transportation department declared his organization 
financially fit friday giving final approval of an economic 
certification for the new york real estate magnate 
the department had given tentative approval of the planned 365 
million purchase two weeks ago and it became final after no 
objections were raised by interested parties said department 
spokesman hal paris 
as far as were concerned he can fly said paris he said 
the department determined that trump had the managerial talent and 
the financial resources to operate what is to be renamed the trump 
shuttle 
faa spokesman john leyden said there is no deadline for issuing 
an operating certificate but it could be approved within the month 
trump had said he wanted to begin the service under his name this 
month 
leyden said the faa has to determine whether trump has the 
ability to run a safe airline by examining all his plans including 
pilot training maintenance and operating procedures 
once the faa gives its approval the sale by texas air corp 
easterns houstonbased holding company can become final and trump 
can repaint the shuttles 17 boeing 727 jetliners with his name and 
gold red and black stripes 
texas air has been trying to sell off the shuttle and some other 
eastern assets arguing that it needs cash for eastern to survive 
a federal judge approved the sale last december over objections 
from labor leaders who said it was part of a texas air effort to 
dismantle eastern and reconstruct it as a nonunion company 
judge barrington d parker in his opinion recognized the 
unionmanagement struggle but said it was also plausible that the 
company was trying to rebuild and place itself on sound financial 
footing 
the union has said it would appeal the decision 
trump already owns a helicopter service that flies between 
atlantic city where he owns casinos and new york city where he 
has built up a real estate empire he announced an agreement to 
purchase the shuttle service last october 
eastern says the shuttle which employs 850 people and makes 62 
flights a day made average annual profits of 17 million over the 
last five years while the airline itself lost 2337 million in the 
first nine months of 1988 
trump has vowed to recognize unions representing pilots flight 
attendants and mechanics but has not guaranteed current wages 
eastern has offered to retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain 
with the company

when the environmental protection agency wanted 
to prepare an annual report to congress on its superfund toxic waste 
cleanup program it sought out a consultant 
icf inc prepared the document for 260000 congressional 
critics maintain that little more than the letterhead was changed on 
the draft received from the private company before it was sent to 
capitol hill 
three words were changed two ands and a the complained 
sen david pryor dark who held a hearing friday on the 
widespread use of private consultants by the federal agency 
responsible for cleaning up the environment 
he said one of his major concerns is that many of the consultants 
working for the epa also have private sector clients from the very 
industries the epa is charged with regulating raising questions 
about conflict of interest 
pryor and other critics suggested that the epa and most likely 
other federal agencies and departments as well are relying too 
heavily on private contractors to do work including critical 
analysis and often decisionmaking that the government ought to be 
doing 
epa officials acknowledged in testimony before pryors government 
affairs subcommittee that they make extensive use of consultants 
but maintained that precautions are taken to avoid a conflict of 
interest they insisted that decisionmaking remains in agency hands 
it comes down to workload its a matter of resources henry 
longest director of the epas superfund cleanup program where 
contractors are used widely told the senate panel 
but pryor who has waged a decadelong fight against the federal 
governments extensive use of private consultants did not accept 
the explanation 
consultants do everything from working on enforcing compliance 
with epa regulations to writing epas annual reports pryor 
declared in opening the hearing it appears that the basic work of 
epa has been delegated to private consultants 
the senator cited the case of a florida subcontractor found by 
congressional investigators to have recommended a particular cleanup 
method for a toxic waste dump it turned out that the same company 
owned the rights for that cleanup method and was given the job said 
pryor 
pryor also cited the epa contracts with icf inc including the 
one for preparing the agencys annual report to congress on 
superfund as another example where questions of conflict of 
interest might be raised 
while icf inc has several socalled sliding contracts with 
the epa valued for as much as 15 million it also aggressively 
seeks business with private companies that are subject to epa 
regulation and boasts of its epa connection in its promotional 
literature said pryor 
earlier this week the office of technology assessment which is 
congress scientific research agency also criticized the epa for 
relying too much on contractors in its superfund cleanup program 
suggesting that contractors and not epa officials are running the 
program 
superfund is the 85 billion program through which the epa is 
tackling hundreds of toxic waste cleanup projects across the country

a program to help prevent the spread of 
aids among intravenous drug abusers by distributing free sterile 
needles has been delayed due to a shortage of disposable syringes 
organizers said 
the sponsoring agencies portlandbased outside in and the 
american foundation for aids research had planned for the program 
to begin in july but had difficulty insuring the program 
the groups found a company in november to provide medical 
liability insurance but national union fire insurance co 
stipulated that the distributed needles must be of such a design 
that they could not be reused 
outside in has been negotiating with a british company to supply 
singleuse hypodermic syringes agency director kathy oliver said 
wednesday delivery had been promised jan 1 but the manufacturer 
cant mass produce them she said 
oliver said the supplier is having 1500 syringes manufactured 
each month outside in will need a couple of thousand each month for 
its distribution program she said 
she said she didnt know when the supply problem would be 
resolved 
epidemiologists have said that direct blood contamination through 
shared needles is the most rapid way acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome is being spread

a ship laden with more than 50 tons of 
equipment headed toward the antarctic today to try and contain an 
oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to 
wipe out a colony of baby penguins 
the spill from a sunken argentine supply ship has fouled the 
oncepure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than 
24000 penguins and other nesting birds said biologist ted de laca 
its very disturbing everything right now is worrisome said 
de laca a researcher at the palmer station a us research outpost 
on the antarctic peninsula 
about 52 tons of equipment flown from the united states was 
loaded onto the 219foot polar duke here from a giant us air force 
c5 galaxy cargo plane 
the polar duke departed shortly after 6 pm friday and was 
expected to reach the area in four days 
the oil is leaking from the argentine research and supply ship 
bahia paraiso which is trapped and nearly submerged on shoals in 
the bismarck strait just off the antarctic peninsula 
thousands of penguins terns gulls and other birds live around 
the site of the accident and the waters teem with marine life 
including whales two areas nearby are set aside by the antarctic 
treaty for scientific study 
punta arenas is at the windblown tip of south america about 600 
miles from the stricken argentine vessel 
thomas forhan ocean projects manager for the national science 
foundation in washington leads the cleanup mission 
american scientists wearing respirators as protection against 
the smell of oil fumes are working in open boats to try to limit 
the damage but de laca said virtually all of the area is exposed 
to fuel causing young birds to disappear and killing small sea 
animals in large numbers 
de laca spoke by telephone with the the associated press in 
washington 
about 24000 penguins nest in rookeries in the affected area and 
de laca said 38 of the 40 adult birds checked by scientists have 
been fueldipped 
the fear of the experts he said is that penguin chicks due to 
leave nests within a few days will swim in the oilcoated water and 
be sickened or killed at least three dead penguins have been 
sighted said de laca 
all of the rookeries are surrounded by oil he said 
a number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were 
acting in a lethargic fashion said the scientist 
we have a slick 150 meters yards by 2 miles long going south 
from the vessel moving along and a little bit away from the 
coast forhan said in an interview aboard the polar duke 
he said there were reports of birds smothered by oil and of dead 
krill shrimplike creatures that whales feed upon in large numbers 
floating ashore 
scientists and workers at palmer station collected 112 compressed 
gas cylinders and 15 oil drums from the waters around the wreck 
forhan said and there are more in the water 
the bahia paraiso ran aground jan 25 the more than 250 people 
aboard were taken off without injury 
authorities said the ship carried at least 200000 gallons of 
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck

president bush says usjapanese relations 
entail some confrontation at times and vows to make sure that 
american businesses gain fair access to markets in that nation 
bush spoke friday at a white house luncheon for us business 
leaders as japanese prime minister noboru takeshita wrapped up a 
twoday visit to washington 
takeshita was leaving friday night for los angeles and a meeting 
there next week with former president reagan 
speaking of the barriers us companies face entering japanese 
markets bush pledged to do my level best to be sure that we 
are treated fairly that we have access that we are not 
operating under standards that favor one side to the detriment of 
the other 
bush observed that he and takeshita are realistic men and 
we realize we are going to have some confrontation at times or 
certainly differences of opinion 
the president added that he believes the prime minister wants 
very much to have a cooperative relationship 
on thursday the two men pledged after their 2hour meeting and 
lunch to strive to smooth irritations over the 50 billion us 
deficit with japan and tensions over the japanese contributions to 
its defense effort 
bush did not elaborate on the details of the trade problems he 
and the prime minister discussed on thursday but said theyd 
reviewed the progress that our nations have achieved in bringing 
the economies into better balance and of further opening our markets 
to each others goods and services 
he added that the united states carries a disproportionate 
responsibility for the defense requirements of free countries and 
japan given its economic standing today is willing to accept 
much more in the way of responsibility for helping in the whole 
development aid side of things 
i just wanted to assure you that the visit yesterday had gone 
reasonably well bush told the businessmen 
as the president spoke secretary of state james a baker iii bid 
takeshita a formal farewell at the end of his twoday washington 
visit with a state department luncheon of champagne toasts pheasant 
and ice cream with mangoes 
in remarks at the luncheon the secretary of state also struck a 
cautionary note telling takeshita the two economic superpowers 
still face a difficult agenda baker also expressed hope the 
partnership will grow stronger as japan assumes a broader world role 
japan is determined to do its utmost to collaborate with the 
united states its strongest ally for the peace and security of the 
world the prime minister said in his toast 
no problems are unsolvable as long as japan and the united 
states join in an effort to solve them takeshita said

birds and other wildlife in one of the most 
remote parts of the world are being injured and killed by fuel oil 
spilled from a ship wrecked on an antarctica island and more damage 
is possible before cleanup crews arrive 
biologist ted de laca chief scientist at palmer station in 
antarctica said that more than 24000 penguins and other birds are 
endangered by an oil spill that threatens to wipe an entire 
generation of chicks maturing in nests surrounded by the pollution 
some wildlife already has been killed he said 
the environment has been compromised in a way that we cant 
even evaluate right now de laca said in a telephone conference 
call from palmer station its very disturbing everything right 
now is worrisome 
palmer station scientists wearing respirators to protect against 
the eyestinging fumes of the oil slick worked in open boats to 
recover debris littering the fouled bay and to evaluate the damage 
but de laca said a more effective effort to contain the spill 
must await the arrival monday of a navy oil pollution control team 
from the united states 
he said the fuel oil is spilling from the argentine ship bahia 
paraiso at the rate of about two gallons a minute and if it 
continues the vessel could dump about 250000 gallons into the 
previously pure untainted waters nearby 
the ship which doubled as a cruise ship and a supply vessel for 
an argentine research station ran aground near palmer station last 
saturday it later floated free went aground again 11 miles from 
the us outpost and then turned over on its right side against 
another island as it turned fuel oil and deck cargo spilled into 
the palmer station embayment home to a number of large bird 
rookeries 
palmer station is a national science foundation research station 
twentysix scientists and staff are now working at the station under 
the director of de laca the chief scientist palmer is about 600 
miles south of cape horn the tip of south america 
de laca reported that krill a tiny shrimplike crustacean have 
been killed by the thousands and are lining the nearby beaches 
birds feeding on the krill seem sickened he said in a nesting area 
of the polar skua a bird of prey up to 40 percent of the chicks 
have disappeared possibily because parent birds sickened by the oil 
are unable to protect their young he said 
about 24000 penguins nest in rookies in the affected area and 
de laca said that 38 of 40 adult birds checked by scientists have 
been fuel dipped 
a number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were 
acting in a lethargic fashion said the scientist 
the precise number of animals killed by the oil is difficult to 
calculate because other animals quickly eat the dead its pretty 
depressing he said

publishing magnate malcolm forbes is the 
new owner of a 1749 document that is believed to be one of the last 
remaining royal charters in new jersey 
forbes who collects rare documents and purchased the bedminster 
township charter from a private collector said thursday he will 
display the charter in a climatecontrolled case at his new jersey 
office building the document was originally given to bedminster 
township by king george ii of great britain 
bedminster mayor joseph cirona said the asking price for the 
charter was 20000 to 25000 but the purchase price was not 
disclosed 
the document was believed lost in an 1845 fire that destroyed the 
home of a town clerk who stored it in a desk but in 1918 the 
somerset county historical quarterly revealed that the document had 
somehow survived 
forbes son christopher said the relic is one of the last 
remaining royal charters in the state he said it grants bedminster 
the right to be and remain a perpetual township and community in 
word and in deed to be called and known by the name of the township 
of bedminster

ending 
the man who portrayed a teacher at the high school of performing 
arts in the 1980 movie fame lost and then regained his reallife 
job as a drama teacher at the school for aspiring actors and dancers 
he holds a temporary teaching certificate and was told wednesday 
he was being replaced by a drama teacher with a permanent license 
and more seniority 
but on friday the united federation of teachers announced that an 
agreement had been reached with the board of education for moody to 
remain in the drama class and teamteach with his replacement said 
union spokesman bert shanas 
teamteaching puts more than one teacher in the same classroom 
and takes advantage of each teachers special skills shanas said 
moody said he chose to teach with a temporary license because it 
meant he could take acting jobs he has appeared in eight movies

new allegations against defense 
secretarydesignate john tower arent expected to delay further a 
vote by the senate armed services committee on his nomination says 
the ranking republican on the panel 
sen john warner rva declined on friday to say what the 
information dealt with but other sources indicated it concerned 
towers personal life and specifically alcohol and women 
its just another chapter in an ongoing investigation warner 
said i dont attach any more significance to this chapter than to 
any other 
he said an fbi report on the subject should reach the committee 
on monday and we can proceed to a vote tuesday or wednesday 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the fbi was looking into allegations concerning towers behavior 
at a party last year in houston 
cbs news reported that the allegations involve an alleged liaison 
in houston between tower and a woman from an eastern bloc nation 
along with an allegation of excessive drinking in the past year 
according to abc news the new allegations include a report from 
an air force colonel which said tower had 14 separate liaisons with 
women while he headed the us negotiating team in geneva after 
leaving the senate 
the committee had been expected to vote thursday to recommend 
senate confirmation of tower but that was postponed after the 
emergence of the new allegations 
tower meanwhile sought to dispel any impression of an embattled 
nominee meeting for about two hours at his jefferson hotel 
residence with five people likely to be named to deputy posts at the 
pentagon 
he later issued a statement saying the meeting had been 
scheduled for a week and had nothing to do with the proceedings 
before the senate armed services committee 
editorials in defense news and army times two widely circulated 
industry publications called for tower to withdraw his nomination 
the editorials are scheduled to appear in mondays editions 
army times a 49yearold independent publication said towers 
public position has been so compromised by the agonizing process 
by which he was nominated and is being confirmed that he cannot 
be the strong spokesman the defense department needs now 
defense news also an independent publication suggested towers 
links to defense consultants is the most troubling aspect of the 
recent confirmation process and said there is ample reason to 
doubt whether mr tower is the man for these times 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said our 
feeling is he will be confirmed whenever you have a candidate who 
is undergoing this kind of scrutiny there are always things that 
turn up we will await the final judgment 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said he did not think it was necessary at this time to 
withdraw the nomination 
tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before 
his nomination in divorce papers filed two years ago by his second 
wife lilla burt cummings tower was accused of marital 
misconduct 
tower who has been divorced twice is now single

the 32 people sent into the jury pool this week 
in the trial of oliver north have one thing in common all say they 
know almost nothing about north and the irancontra affair 
most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at 
frontpage newspaper headlines and most say they are too busy with 
jobs or occupied with other interests to have paid much attention to 
the biggest foreign policy debacle of the reagan administration 
most are blue or pinkcollar workers several with the 
government while several others are unemployed or retired one 
woman is holding down two jobs 
of the first 25 prospective jurors a dozen finished the 12th 
grade one has a masters degree two others finished college and 
another has some college education 
their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health 
administrator and the focus of their lives is work and family not 
politics and controversy 
on friday one of the prospective jurors a woman who supervises 
50 employees at the willard hotel in washington explained that she 
circled the name joseph coors on the jurors questionnaire as a name 
with which she is familiar because substantial amounts of the 
brandname beer are delivered to the hotel 
occasional talk by coworkers about the irancontra affair said 
the woman had bored her during her 10 to 12hour workdays 
coors who contributed money to the contras after meeting with 
north is scheduled to testify for the prosecution at norths trial 
north attorney brendan sullivan told the woman that the name on 
the cans is the same as the name on the questionnaire and that the 
beer magnate would be pleased to know you buy a lot of it 
north who took the nationally televised congressional 
irancontra hearings by storm in 1987 has through smiles and 
gestures made contact from across the courtroom with the potential 
jurors who will decide his fate 
but it is unclear whether he has made much of an impression with 
jurors who say they just barely recall having seen pictures of him 
in uniform a year and a half ago 
one man sent into the jury pool thought north might be the man 
who kept blinking and winking at him constantly as the 
prospective juror underwent questioning from us district judge 
gerhard a gesell prosecutor john keker and sullivan 
north signaled that the prospective juror had guessed right by 
giving him a thumbsup sign 
gesell said as he concluded fridays court session that he wants 
a pool of 45 people to choose a panel of 12 jurors and six 
alternates the jury selection process resumes monday

the 1974 felony conviction of new york yankees 
owner george steinbrenner hurt his business interests and was a 
source of personal humiliation according to his successful 
application for a presidential pardon 
former president reagan granted the pardon just before he left 
office last month 
for example the papers note 
last summer minnesota racing officials denied steinbrenner an 
owners license at canterbury downs the states first parimutuel 
thoroughbred racetrack because of his conviction 
against his wishes steinbrenner declined a nomination to serve 
as a member of the board of regents governing floridas public 
universities because of the adverse publicity to the florida 
educational system that would likely ensue 
and he has suffered the indignity of being referred to in 
articles as a convicted felon and the only convicted felon 
among baseballs ownership 
the harm suffered by mr steinbrenner is far more than 
economic it is a symbolic slap in the face for a man who has tried 
so hard to overcome his conviction and be a good citizen 
steinbrenners lawyer former attorney general and senator william 
b saxbe wrote in the application 
the documents were obtained by the associated press after a 
special application to the justice department 
steinbrenner was pardoned jan 19 by reagan 17 years after he 
attempted to influence and intimidate employees of his 
shipbuilding company into lying to a grand jury about the nature of 
a 100000 contribution to richard nixons 1972 reelection campaign 
steinbrenner pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate federal 
election laws he was fined 15000 but received no prison sentence

former white house aide michael k deaver says 
he is broke and tired of being a captive of the system 
so on friday he dropped the appeal of his conviction of lying 
to a congressional subcommittee and a federal grand jury saying he 
wanted to put this period of my life behind me 
deaver a top adviser to former president reagan and a close 
friend of the former first family said in a statement issued by his 
lawyers that he was dropping the appeal with the firm belief that 
i was not guilty of the charges of which i was convicted 
however he said to proceed with this appeal means to continue 
to live in doubt to continue to wait for a decision and if my 
appeal is successful to face another trial a process which could 
mean another two years of agony and doubt 
he also said he could not continue the financial burden of 
the appeals process 
the 50yearold onetime reagan deputy chief of staff was fined 
100000 and ordered to perform 1500 hours of community service for 
his three felony convictions in 1987 of lying about his lobbying of 
former administration colleagues after leaving the white house 
my decision to withdraw my appeal does not come easily 
deaver said in the statement issued as his lawyers asked the 
appellate court here to dismiss his appeal 
it results from a number of factors primarily my desire to put 
this period of my life behind me and get on with whatever lies 
ahead deaver said 
deaver must now begin performing the community service which us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson set as a condition of three 
years of probation when he sentenced him last september jackson has 
not yet specified what type of community service he will order 
deaver said his belief in my innocence has not changed from the

depends on which of the two corporations involved makes the best 
ketchup nuts and chinese food 
in a decision announced friday the federal trade commission said 
it would not challenge the 245 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco 
by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co if kkr within a year sells 
the chun king oriental line of rjr nabisco or the la choy line 
of beatricehuntwesson inc a unit of kkr 
the planters nuts line of rjr nabisco or the fisher nuts line of 
beatrice 
and rjr nabiscos del monte ketchup or beatrices hunt ketchup 
together the corporations account for oneeighth of the food 
sold in the nations supermarkets the ftc said the two must reduce 
their share of the markets for ketchup oriental foods and packaged 
nuts in order for the market to remain competitive 
a spokesman for kkr said that to his knowledge no decisions had 
been made on which product lines to keep and which to sell off 
kkrs tender offer for rjr nabisco shares was to expire at 
midnight est monday but kkr late friday extended its offer to 10

the exchange of securities not tendered to kkr must still occur and 
there is no time limit for completion of that portion of the deal 
under an agreement between the ftc and kohlberg kravis roberts 
kkr must maintain rjr nabisco as a separate operation until the 
three product lines are sold

percent to 13 percent of the market for manufactured foods said 
jeffrey zuckerman head of the commissions bureau of competition 
zuckerman declined to give estimates of market share held by each 
of the lines but did give these estimates if the brands were 
combined chun kingla choy probably slightly under 60 percent 
of 300 million in sales del montehunt ketchup about 25 percent 
of 500 million and plantersfisher nuts about 50 percent of 
15 billion 
although market share is a concern we look at other factors 
the most important of which is the ease with which other people 
could enter the business if the company tried to raise prices he

the bush administration still publicly endorses 
the reagan administrations approach toward solving the 13 
trillion third world debt problem and is searching for ways to make 
that approach more workable 
discussion on third world debt dominated two days of meetings 
that wrapped up friday between finance officials of the 
noncommunist worlds seven most powerful economies the united 
states japan west germany great britain france canada and italy 
the meetings had been billed as a getacquainted session for the 
new bush administration as it completed its second week in office 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who was host for the 
discussions along with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
that a review of conditions around the world showed the global 
economy was performing reasonably well an opinion that was seconded 
by his fellow finance ministers 
tatsuo murayama the new japanese finance minister who was 
attending his first group of seven meeting said that he believed 
prospects for the world economy were brighter than they were five 
months ago because currency fluctuations had stabilized and 
inflation appeared to be moderating 
brady said that the seven countries had a thorough discussion 
regarding third world debt with no decisions being taken 
several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreedon 
strategy based on the same principles we consider valid brady 
said growth economic policy changes and reforms in the debtor 
countries the continued need for external financing by debtor 
nations and continued observance of the casebycase method 
these were all goals of the baker plan drafted in 1985 by 
bradys predecessor james a baker iii baker who is secretary of 
state in the bush administration crafted an approach to third world 
debt that stressed increased loans in exchange for economic reforms 
made by the developing countries 
while the united states repeatedly rejected calls to forgive some 
of the debt america has found itself increasingly isolated on the 
debt issue as political stresses have risen in debtor countries 
these nations are suffering falling living standards because of the 
growing burdens they face in servicing their huge debts 
while brady made no mention of any modifications he would like to 
see to the debt plan other finance ministers said they believed 
changes would be proposed and possibly adopted at the groups next 
meeting in early april when the international monetary fund holds 
its spring meeting in washington 
canadian finance minister michael wilson said the officials 
examined a number of options including proposals made by the french 
to create a new international fund to guarantee interest payments by 
the poorer nations and a japanese proposal to provide more money for 
loans 
bush has pledged to review the american policy on third world 
debt but so far the administration has not revealed any 
modifications to the baker plan that it would consider acceptable 
the meetings of the group of seven are generally held three 
or four times a year to review economic conditions and search for 
ways the countries can better coordinate policies to promote global 
prosperity 
at present the issues of concern are efforts to stabilize 
currencies lower the stillhuge trade imbalances which exist and 
provide relief to latin american nations straining under a heavy 
debt burden 
participants said that brady assured the other nations of 
president bushs commitment to lower the budget deficit a longtime 
matter of concern with us allies who believe americas huge 
borrowing needs have deprived their economies of needed capital 
brady said that bush was seeking to cooperate with congress to 
find a way to reduce the us budget deficit by 60 billion in the 
next fiscal year which begins oct 1 officials said 
participants said that finance ministers were generally pleased 
with how the effort at greater policy coordination was working 
including the drive to prevent wild fluctuations in the value of the 
dollar in contrast to past meetings when the us greenback was 
under heavy selling pressure the dollar at present has been 
relatively stable

which was founded by his father in 1948 
he told the post he has reduced his holdings to real estate 
partnerships government bonds and a multimilliondollar interest in 
media general corp another communications giant

a spokesman for richard nixon says the former 
president would use the controversial proposed pay raise for members 
of congress and the cabinet and federal judges for security 
responding to a request by david keating executive vice 
president of the national taxpayers union for nixon to publicly 
oppose the pay increase spokesman john h taylor wrote in a letter 
the nixons are now paying for their own security an expense of 
over 500000 since 1985 
it is rns intention to apply whatever increase may be enacted 
in his pension entirely toward defraying the cost of his and mrs 
nixons security taylor added 
the raise which would increase cabinet salaries from 99500 to 
155000 would increase nixons pension as a former president by the 
same amount because of a 1971 law linking the two amounts 
the pay raises automatically go into effect unless they are 
disapproved by both houses of congress before wednesday

says the department wont abandon its recommendation that a vast 
wildlife refuge in northeastern alaska be opened for gas and oil 
exploration despite pressure from several powerful environmental 
groups to review the decision 
in his first news conference after being sworn in as interior 
secretary friday lujan told reporters president bush has said we 
should explore the refuge in an environmentally acceptable 
manner and the question is out of my domain 
a recommendation endorsing development of the alaska refuge was 
sent to congress by outgoing interior secretary donald hodel in the 
final days of the reagan administration 
congress must approve any such oil exploration and legislation 
has been introduced in both the senate and house that would open the 
refuge for drilling but other legislation also has been introduced 
that would make the refuge a wilderness area protected from 
exploration

when soviet jewish scientist yakov kogan 
contacted israeli officials in paris last week to say he wanted to 
defect little did he know the complications he faced 
first he was told prove you are jewish a serious problem 
because kogan had left his identity card thousands of miles away in 
moscow 
what followed was a nightmarish saga of wrong airports 
problematic telephones delays and mixed directions proving to 
kogan it wasnt as easy to defect as he may have thought 
kogan a 48yearold mathematician and computer expert told the 
israeli daily yediot ahronot he first thought of defecting while 
attending the scientific seminar as part of a sixmember soviet 
delegation 
i thought this was the chance to reach israel who knows if 
this opportunity would ever be repeated he said in the interview 
published thursday 
kogan decided to phone israeli diplomats in paris but the task 
proved complicated 
i did not want to phone from the hotel and i was looking for 
public telephones but soon i discovered you cannot use a coin for 
every telephone and that for some you need a magnetic card kogan 
said 
contact was finally established but then came the israeli 
demand prove that you are jewish 
kogans sovietissued identity card which he left behind in 
moscow stated he was jewish but the passport he carried made no 
mention of his religion 
according to israels law of return all jews are eligible for 
automatic israeli citizenship 
they asked what jewish holidays do you remember kogan 
recalled i told them with a stressed yiddish accent rosh hashana 
the jewish new year yom kippur the day of atonement and of 
course shavuot a holiday celebrating the spring harvest he said 
the officials were not immediately convinced but the next day 
when kogan called back officials told him to take a taxi to orly 
airport and go to the el al israels airline counter 
kogan left all his belongings at a hotel toured the quai dorsay 
museum and left for the airport but there were more problems ahead 
they only forgot to tell me that orly is divided in two west 
and south with the first one designated for internal flights 
only he told yediot 
when kogan finally reached his destination time was running out 
i could not find the el al counter then i started to walk 
around slowly and gradually saw the word tel aviv appearing on 
display screens the bespectacled grayhaired kogan said thursday 
on israel television 
he said he passed through french passport control with the help 
of an el al official who issued him an israeli visa then he was 
brought to an empty plane 
they told me that i can relax now that this is israeli 
territory he said 
takeoff was delayed for what seemed an endless 30 minutes kogan 
said once the plane took off he destroyed a piece of paper on 
which he had written the number of his israeli contacts in paris as 
they had ordered 
at tel avivs ben gurion airport two men were waiting for 
me one of them asked why did you arrive alone you could ask for 
a visa and bring along your family 
kogan left behind his wife asia and two sons aged 7 and 10 he 
told yediot he believed nothing would happen to them under the more 
liberal policies of president mikhail s gorbachev 
he said he decided to defect because he felt progress in his 
scientific career at a moscow institute was stymied due to treatment 
of jews in the soviet union he told yediot that money played no 
role both he and his wife were highly paid lived in a threeroom 
apartment considered a luxury by soviet standards and owned a summer 
house near a forest 
during all those years i never asked to emigrate to israel i 
knew i would be refused apparently on grounds that he knew state 
secrets he said

call it the muddle of the maps or the clash 
of the cartographers but kenya and sudan are at it again over a 
disputed area of dismal swamp and desert 
the dispute goes back years but neither side appeared to be 
paying much attention to it until recently and a discovery of oil 
may have roiled their dispute over soil 
in 1914 the british drew a straight line marking kenyas 
northwestern border with sudan 
but in 1938 the british who then ruled the east african 
nations decided to give kenya administrative control of a 
triangular piece of land north of the sudan border 
the area known as the elemi triangle contained 1393 square 
miles of seemingly worthless land and was home to the nomadic 
turkana tribe which was constantly raiding and being raided by 
other tribes from sudan ethiopia and uganda 
the british administration in khartoum sudans capital was 
unable to police the raiders and handed over administration of the 
area to authorities in the kenyan capital of nairobi which was much 
closer 
the 1938 agreement resulted in a new line on the map this one 
putting the triangle in kenya there the matter rested until 1956 
when sudan gained its independence followed by kenya seven years 
later 
the newly independent governments began drawing their own maps 
sudans with the original 1914 straight line kenyas with the 
triangular border 
from that time on said sudans charge daffaires in nairobi 
ali yousuf we have had two opinions 
yousuf told reporters friday that a joint border commission met 
in the late 1970s but failed to resolve the matter and the dispute 
once again faded 
but last year yousuf said kenya published a new map that not 
only included the elemi triangle within its borders but enlarged the 
triangle by 2489 square miles 
yousuf said he called the news conference to clarify the 
position of the sudan government he was not he insisted 
discussing our borders with kenya through the press 
but most of the argument has been waged through reporters 
the newly revived dispute began with a frontpage story in 
mondays kenya times an englishlanguage daily published in nairobi 
by the ruling kenya african national union party 
headlined its a map of provocation the story noted that 
thousands of maps published by a scottish company john bartholomew 
and son ltd of edenburgh showed the straight 1914 border between 
kenya and sudan 
the next day the newspapers top story carried the banner 
headline sudan claims kenyan soil 
on wednesday at a reception for foreign journalists kenyas 
foreign minister robert ouko made it a point to mention the 
dispute 
he too said he would not discuss the matter in the press but 
added the elemi triangle is an integral part of kenya and thats 
the way it will remain 
the two governments have not officially discussed the problem 
anew 
pressed friday at the news conference yousuf said he didnt 
have enough information as to who is doing what in this disputed 
area but suggested kenya may have found oil in the region 
president daniel arap moi announced last month oil had been found in 
northern kenya but did not specify where

death came to oliver w sipple without any 
of the fanfare that once anguished the disabled exmarine who 
became a reluctant hero when he foiled an assassination attempt on 
president gerald ford 
a friend found sipple 47 dead in his san francisco apartment on 
thursday apparently of natural causes a framed letter of 
commendation signed by ford hung on the wall 
sipple gained unwanted fame on sept 22 1975 when he lunged for 
a 38caliber chrome revolver aimed at ford by wouldbe assassin 
sara jane moore outside a san francisco hotel his move caused 
moores shot to go astray hitting a building instead 
afterward sipple telephoned news outlets and begged them not to 
mention his name his address or anything about me 
im not a hero im a live coward he said later its 
probably the scariest thing that ever happened in my whole life 
but reports about sipple some mentioning his homosexuality were 
published anyway 
sipple filed a 15 million invasion of privacy lawsuit against 
several newspapers claiming he was abandoned by his brothers and 
sisters after they learned of his sexual orientation by reading 
published accounts 
my sexuality is part of my private life and has no bearing on 
my response to the act of a person seeking to take the life of 
another he said in the lawsuit which was filed five days after 
the assassination attempt 
he lost the fiveyear court battle when superior court judge ira 
brown dismissed the suit 
i think that his life was a very tragic life attorney john 
wahl who represented sipple said friday he did some very heroic 
things he was 100 percent disabled from his service in the marine 
corps then he went out of his way endangering his life to save 
the life of president gerald ford then he got punished for doing 
it 
sipple who was on disability because of mental problems relating 
to his combat experiences in the vietnam war had originally come to 
san francisco from detroit so that he could live as he wished 
without upsetting his family according to wahl however that all 
changed by the published accounts of his personal life 
sipple though never regretted his lifesaving action wahl said 
he just was astounded that some columnist and then the rest of 
the media would just take it upon themselves without ever asking 
him to publicize these personal facts about him said wahl 
san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen first hinted that 
sipple was homosexual noting that the white house had not thanked 
him for his actions ford eventually did convey his gratitude to 
sipple 
moore pleaded guilty to the assassination attempt and is serving 
a life term in federal prison 
a coroners office spokesman said sipple apparently died of 
natural causes but results of an autopsy performed friday were not 
immediately available a statement released by the office said 
sipple had a pacemaker and a long history of hypertension and heart 
problems

vice president salvador laurel said 
today that an ailing ferdinand marcos may not survive the year and 
appealed to president corazon aquino to allow her ousted predecessor 
to die in his homeland 
laurel spoke to reporters after returning from hawaii where he 
met the 71yearold former president he said he was told by doctors 
that marcos heart lungs and kidneys were failing and the former 
president had lost the will to live 
there was no immediate comment from mrs aquino who has refused 
to allow her predecessor to return to the philippines since her 
february 1986 people power revolution ended the 20year marcos 
regime 
but a manila newspaper the philippine daily inquirer quoted a 
cabinet official as saying the government would refuse even to allow 
marcos to be buried in the philippines 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno has said laurel was acting 
without mrs aquinos blessing when he went to see marcos 
relations between mrs aquino and laurel have been strained since 
the vice president quit his cabinet post as foreign minister in 1987 
over policy differences last august laurel formally parted ways 
with mrs aquino when he demanded her resignation and announced he 
was joining an opposition coalition 
laurel said he would try to contact mrs aquino immediately to 
ask for an appointment so he could relay to her marcoss request to 
come home he would also hand mrs aquino a letter from marcos son 
ferdinand jr containing the same request 
asked if marcos had offered to return part of the billions of 
dollars he allegedly embezzled laurel replied he was not at 
liberty to answer that later he told another reporter no offer 
was made 
laurel said doctors believe marcos might not survive the trip to 
the philippines but that marcos told him he doesnt mind and 
he would be happy dying on his way home 
he told me he has already resigned his fate to almighty god 
laurel said mr marcos expressed to me his desire to die in his 
own country 
he said marcos was concerned for the future of his wife imelda 
and three children and added that they also should be allowed to 
return 
before laurels trip unconfirmed news reports said he and 
wealthy filipino industrialist enrique zobel were trying to work out 
a deal under which marcos would return part of his hidden wealth 
in exchange for permission to return 
asked how he would try to change mrs aquinos mind about banning 
marcos laurel said that he will invoke the fundamental right of 
any filipino to come home i will try to appeal to her sense of 
christian and moral values 
laurel said that his conversation with marcos was carried on 
intermittently because of the former presidents poor health 
last wednesday marcos underwent a tracheotomy to clear fluids 
building up in his lungs he has been breathing through a respirator 
since then 
quoting from a briefing given by doctors laurel said marcos was 
running a fever of 103 degrees and weighed less than 100 pounds he 
said doctors told him marcos lungs had collapsed twice in three 
weeks his transplanted kidneys were failing and his heart had grown 
too weak to pump enough blood 
the doctors described marcos body as now destroyed and said 
he has less than 10 percent chance of survivial within the year 
laurel said 
philippine officials have said in the past that marcos must 
return his allegedly embezzled funds and apologize for abuses in his 
administration before there could be any discussion of his return 
in its report the philippine daily inquirer quoted cabinet 
secretary jose de jesus as saying the government would refuse marcos 
burial in the philippines because his followers would use the 
funeral to undermine mrs aquino 
marcos and his wife are under us indictment for allegedly 
plundering the philippines of more than 100 million and stashing 
much of the money in the united states 
a federal judge in new york is to decide this month if marcos is 
healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering charges mrs 
marcos pleaded innocent and is free on 5 million bail

normally balmy south texas coating new york city and philadelphia 
with freezing rain and sending temperatures plunging across georgia

take their frustrations out on someone so they call and kind of get 
all over the weatherman every once in a while burnett said 
weve got thick skins 
one man he said called to say im just in a fit of 
depression and i blame you guys ive got to get out of here

that would stop a parade said assistant police chief ray holman of 
new orleans cold weather doesnt dampen many spirits but it may

in northern california up to three feet of snow whipped by 
winds of up to 70 mph fell friday in parts of the sierra nevada and

although her visit to new york was brief 
britains princess diana seemed to capture the heart of the big 
apple wherever she went 
in three days she saw an opera in brooklyn visited a fancy toy 
store on park avenue and hugged a child with aids in a harlem 
hospital 
the princess of wales rubbed elbows with developer donald trump 
publisher malcolm forbes and actor michael douglas 
diana also touched the heart of 13yearold hope manley a 
pennsylvania youngster suffering from cystic fibrosis and wanda 
morales whom the princess visited in a lower east side shelter for 
the homeless 
on friday the last day of her visit she toured the pediatrics 
ward of harlem hospital where diana unexpectedly picked up a 
7yearold afflicted with aids after first asking him are you 
heavy 
the 27yearold princess has long sought to educate the public 
about the disease which doctors say cannot be transmitted through 
casual contact 
the princess also attended a briefing by the hospitals 
pediatrics director dr margaret heagarty who said later that 
diana was genuinely concerned about the plight of the children and 
occasionally interrupted to ask questions 
at the hospital hundreds of excited workers strained to catch a 
glimpse of the princess it had been the same throughout her visit 
as usually nonplussed new yorkers sometimes breathlessly recounted a 
royal handshake or a wave 
after her visit to the hospital diana attended a private 
reception given by british consul general gordon jewkes for about 60 
patrons of the royal academy of music 
after that she left new york as she had arrived aboard a british 
airways supersonic concorde 
fridays events capped a visit that also included a visit to a 
homeless shelter and daycare center and the american debut 
performance by the welsh national opera at the brooklyn academy of 
music 
cheering crowds greeted the princess at nearly every stop the 
exception was when about 400 protestors showed up in brooklyn to 
denounce britains policies in northern ireland 
but inside the brooklyn academy of music diana dazzled the 
audience as she entered to a drumroll and the opera patrons fell 
silent 
and later that same evening new yorks social elite again fell 
silent as the princess walked down a marble staircase to the dining 
area of a gala reception in her honor at the world financial center 
the 800 or so guests remained silent until she approached her 
seat at the head table when they broke into spontaneous applause 
her husband prince charles who stayed in britian this week 
will arrive in the united states on feb 16 for a fourday visit to 
washington and palm beach fla where hell attend charity polo 
matches

a bill aimed at compelling newspapers and 
broadcasters to publish corrections of errors moved ahead in the 
house of commons but legislators said it has little chance of final 
success 
the bill introduced by opposition labor party lawmaker tony 
worthington proposes a statutory right for members of the public to 
correct inaccuracies about them in the news media corrections would 
have to be given the same prominence as the original mistake 
worthington said his right of reply bill was needed because of 
what he called the deterioration in standards of some sections of 
the press 
he said the bill which was unopposed friday in its second 
reading was not an attack on press freedom but an attack on the few 
editors and proprietors who abused their power 
legislators said the government was neutral about the right of 
reply bill so it would not have any priority on the crowded 
parliamentary agenda they said time was likely to run out before 
the bill was examined in committee or in the crucial third reading 
after being approved by the house of commons the bill would then 
have to go to the house of lords 
timothy renton a home office junior minister speaking for the 
government said scandal had been used to sell newspapers for 
hundreds of years 
but we have a number of reservations about both the 
statutory control of the press and about the procedures set forth in 
the bill renton said 
labor legislator ann clwyd a journalist said the bill was 
necessary to protect the public from what she called the excesses of 
the tabloid press 
two other bills dealing with the press failed in the house of 
commons friday for lack of debating time 
the indecent displays newspapers and workplaces bill 
introduced by laborite clare short would have barred newspapers 
from publishing pictures of naked or partially naked women in 
sexually provocative poses 
the protection of privacy bill introduced by conservative 
lawmaker john browne also failed it would have given all citizens 
a legal right to privacy and compelled newspapers to show their 
revelations were for the public benefit

a weekly magazine said today that two 
american hostages will be freed soon and other publications 
reported the imminent release of some of the 15 foreign hostages 
held by proiranian extremists 
the magazine annahar arab and international said hezbollah or 
party of god has decided to release two american captives as a 
goodwill gesture 
the group composed of shiite moslem fundamentalists loyal to 
iran is believed to be an umbrella for underground factions that 
have claimed the abduction of most of the westerners missing since 
1985 
the magazine based in christian east beirut quoted an unnamed 
hezbollah official as saying the scenario is being set for the 
release the short report gave no other details 
the weekly alshiraa reported this week that the case of the 
foreign hostages has been put on a hot burner while the 
magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret 
us arms sales to iran in november 1987 subsequent reports on the 
hostages have not proved accurate 
this could result in releasing them in the light of a 
decision to this effect adopted by regional powers interested in 
this case alshiraa said without elaboration 
there are 15 foreign hostages held in lebanon including nine 
americans 
the longest held is terry anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
the independent daily annahar and the conservative addiyar 
reported today that the release of foreign captives in lebanon was 
part of an agreement mediated by syria and iran this week to end a 
bloody intershiite power struggle between hezbollah and the 
syrianbacked mainstream amal militia 
informed sources believe that the basic aim of the 
amalhezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captives 
held in lebanon annahars terse report said 
addiyar in an equally brief report quoted an unnamed official 
as saying the amalhezbollah accord could result in the handing 
over of some foreign hostages to the syrians 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon it has some 40000 
troops controlling moslem areas including northern and eastern 
provinces as well as west and south beirut 
the leftist daily assafir which is close to the syrian army 
command in lebanon said diplomatic information speaks of the 
possible release of some foreign hostages in the next two weeks 
the report said the issue will be the focus of attention in the 
coming days recent reports about the possible release of irish 
hostage brian keenan were indirect messages to the americans and the 
britons it did not elaborate 
keenan of northern ireland holds both irish and british 
citizenship 
a native of belfast keenan was kidnapped april 11 1986 as he 
walked to his teaching job at the american university of beirut 
nabih berri leader of amal said in damascus after the agreement 
with hezbollah was signed on monday the peace pact did not refer 
directly to the hostages but i am sure that this agreement would 
help secure the release of hostages as quickly as possible 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati who negotiated on 
irans behalf during the damascus talks said nobody will be 
satisfied with the holding of the hostages so we do hope that all 
the hostages will be released 
irish ambassador patrick mccabe flew in from baghdad last week to 
investigate reports that keenan 38 would be freed 
mccabe who is ambassador to lebanon and iraq said wednesday he 
hoped the statements by berri and velayati would result in the 
release of some foreign captives before too long 
the 15 foreign captives missing in lebanon are in addition to 
keenan and the americans three britons an italian and a belgian

residents have begun cleaning up from the 
debris and damage left behind by an railroad explosion and fire that 
compounded the difficulties of coping with subzero cold 
as federal officials began an investigation many people spent 
friday sweeping up glass and assessing the destruction from the 
blast which forced 2000 people to evacuate their homes in 
temperatures of 30 below zero 
carroll colleges 700 to 800 students remained in temporary 
lodgings while hundreds of windows in dormitories and classrooms 
were repaired classes were canceled until feb 13 
weather forecasters called for a high today of minus 22 
the explosion early thursday shattered windows up to two miles 
away and knocked out power to half the city for more than six hours 
it was caused by 21 runaway railroad freight cars that derailed and 
crashed 
paul spengler disaster coordinator for lewis and clark county 
said the blast site was being examined by investigators from the 
national transportation safety board the federal railroad 
administration also has announced it will conduct a complete 
investigation 
federal railroad officials had said the initial explosion was 
caused when a derailed car hit a propane tank but that version was 
questioned friday 
bill bradford of louis dreyfus propane co in helena said both of 
his companys propane tanks in the area were intact the propane is 
used to heat railroad switches 
officials said a rail tank car filled with highly flammable 
hydrogen peroxide exploded just before 5 am but a second hydrogen 
peroxide car was quickly coated with ice from firefighters water 
which fire crews believed minimized the danger of it exploding 
a load of granular plastic inside one of the rail cars smoldered 
until it was extinguished friday afternoon according to spengler 
only two people were injured in the incident neither seriously

president ranasinghe premadasa today 
called for an end to the discord tearing apart this once idyllic 
island and promised a revolution to usher in social change 
premadasa presided over austere independence day celebrations 
part of a plan to save government funds for an antipoverty program 
we must terminate ethnic discord he said so that in the 
years ahead a new revolution will flourish in every hamlet village 
and town to eliminate poverty create an equitable social order and 
eliminate discrimination 
premadasa 64 who won the dec 19 presidential election and took 
over jan 2 has vowed to give monthly payments to 14 million 
families who earn less than the national annual per capita of 360 
after taking office he announced a plan to pay poor people 75 
monthly for two years beginning in april about 7 million of sri 
lankas 16 million people stand to gain the president has not 
specified where the funds will come from though he has urged all 
government departments to curb expenses 
sri lankas independence from britain in 1948 was commemmorated 
today by a 100member honor guard that presented arms to the 
president schoolgirls dressed in white sang during the ceremony in 
the capitals independence square 
the traditional military pageant and parade was absent this year 
to save money for premadasas antipoverty program 
political analysts however insist the major hurdle in the 
premadasa presidency will be to curb ethnic insurgencies that have 
torn the island nation apart since 1983 
militants from the tamil minority claiming discrimination by the 
majority buddhist sinhalese have waged a bloody insurgency for an 
independent tamil nation since 1983 
more than 8500 people have been killed in the 5year separatist 
insurgency by militants in the tamil minority 
extremists from the sinhalese majority angered by the 
governments peace overtures to the tamils have killed more than 
900 people mostly government supporters the past 18 months 
the government says india has begun to withdraw indian troops 
sent here in 1987 to disarm tamils under terms of a failed peace 
pact the indian troops are estimated at 44000 
both tamil and sinhalese extremists have vowed to violently 
disrupt parliamentary elections feb 15 
speaking in sinhala english and tamil premadasa warned 
elements who seek to obstruct or destroy the democratic process 
will not be tolerated by the vast majority of freedomloving sri 
lankans 
let us join hands in amity and unity to make our motherland a 
land of peace and prosperity he said 
the tamils who are mainly hindu make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas population they claim discrimination by the mainly buddhist 
sinhalese who are 75 percent of the population and dominate the 
government and military

a supporter of the irish republican army who 
allegedly rushed at the duchess of york with a flagpole will have 
all charges dropped if he stays out of trouble for six months 
authorities said 
the federal government agreed friday to defer prosecution against 
michael shanley 25 who is accused of attempting to assault the 
former sarah ferguson who is the wife of britains prince andrew 
shanley allegedly rushed at the duchess on jan 21 1988 as she 
was entering a manhattan hotel he was holding a green flag that 
read erin go bragh which means ireland forever 
he also was accused of assaulting a state department agent who 
wrestled him to the ground 
the deferral which came as the duchess sisterinlaw britains 
princess diana was visiting new york means that the charges will 
be dropped if shanley does not violate the law during the sixmonth 
period 
this is as good as an acquittal when it happens said 
shanleys attorney stephen sumerstein this was a false arrest 
in our opinion the charges were all ridiculous 
shanley a member of the irish northern aid committee said in 
court friday that he had followed sumersteins advice and not taken 
part in a thursday night demonstration against princess diana in 
brooklyn but my heart was there

authorities are investigating the possibility 
that a black man whose death brought about two nights of violence 
might have suffocated as he was lying face down and handcuffed in a 
police car 
edgar allen price 40 of houston died following a struggle with 
police wednesday night as eight officers tried to arrest the 
6foot3 300pound drug suspect 
dr charles diggs assistant hillsborough county medical 
examiner said it appears price suffocated 
he is working it as an asphyxiated death said april strouse 
a medical investigator in the medical examiners office but we 
dont know how we have not been able to determine that yet there 
is a very intense investigation going on 
she said doctors hope to have conclusive results by next week 
diggs said officials were looking at the possibility that price 
was in the cruiser when his breathing stopped adding that he had 
been deprived of oxygen for some time 
prices death triggered violence wednesday and to a lesser 
extent thursday night in college hill a poor depressed 
predominantly black neighborhood one person was arrested wednesday 
night and nine thursday night 
there were no disturbances friday night and police said that no 
sections of the area were blocked off 
the breathing of a person who is intoxicated or stunned then 
placed face down in handcuffs on a seat or car floor can be 
restricted diggs said price reportedly had alcohol in his blood 
but ms strouse who wouldnt confirm whether tests showed price 
had been drinking cautioned there are a lot of things that can 
cause restricted breathing and we have to wait until we know for 
sure 
deputy chief thomas depolis had said thursday that preliminary 
findings showed price died of a cardiac arrest but that authorities 
had not yet determined what caused prices heart to stop the 
findings showed police did not choke or beat price during the 
confrontation after an undercover crack cocaine buy according to 
police chief austin mclane 
officials who released the information on prices death thursday 
in an effort to forestall more trouble said incidents of rock and 
bottlethrowing were more sporadic and the young people fewer in 
number the second night 
city officials residents and community leaders continued to 
discuss the reasons behind the outbreak which came less than three 
weeks after three nights of unrest in miami followed the shooting 
death of a black motorcyclist a police officer is charged in that 
incident 
this is not miami either in scope or in what touched off the 
trouble said john dunn spokesman for mayor sandy freedman 
these are teenagers out there this was a drug arrest that 
sparked it this was not an indiscriminate action on the part of the 
police department 
since an outbreak of violence in 1987 that lasted several days 
tampa authorities have increased efforts to spruce up housing 
improve economic opportunities and fight drug use which they say 
is an underlying problem 
price a convicted felon who served 10 years in texas on a 
robbery conviction before being paroled in 1984 was carrying 25 
pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded 25caliber pistol in his 
pockets said cole

a judge today struck down objections from 
union carbide and said hindi not english would be the language for 
court proceedings on the 1984 gas leak that killed more than 3300 
people 
our clients do not understand hindi objected vijay gupta 
attorney for the danbury connbased company it will be better 
if the practice of writing order sheets in english continues 
bhopal district judge nk jain replied the governments 
clients the gas leak victims do not understand english 
the government of india is suing union carbide for 3 billion in 
damages for the gas leak that by the governments count killed 
3329 people and injured more than 20000 others 
jain said the two sides can argue their cases in english but the 
courts order sheet that records the arguments after each hearing 
will be prepared in hindi up until now the arguments had been 
recorded in english 
however he said judgments will be handed down in english 
india filed the damage suit in 1985 but the case has bogged down 
in legal wrangling in a variety of courts 
hindi is the official language of india spoken by more than half 
its 880 million people especially in north and central india where 
bhopal is located english also is an official language 
the bhopal pesticide plant where the leak of methyl isocyanate 
gas occurred is owned by the indian subsidiary of union carbide corp 
jain replaced judge mw deo in the case in bhopal district judge 
after the high court of madhya pradesh state ruled last november 
that deo was biased against union carbide corp a previous judge 
gs patel was removed for conflict of interest after it was 
discovered he was among the 500000 people who had filed claims in 
an attempt to collect compensation 
jain set feb 18 as the date to fix hearing dates in the suit

soviet president mikhail gorbachev will travel to 
china in midmay to meet deng xiaoping in the first summit between 
the worlds two largest communist powers since 1959 it was 
announced today 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told a news 
conference he and deng agreed that soviet and chinese leaders will 
precede from the presumption of complete normalization of 
relations between the two countries putting a formal end to three 
decades of enmity 
shevardnadze said the two nations also agreed to try to reduce 
offensive forces and ease military tensions along their 5000mile 
border 
he said his three days in talks in china including a meeting 
with the chinese leader this morning in shanghai had produced broad 
agreements on the need for sinosoviet efforts to end the 10year 
conflict in cambodia 
shevardnadze left for islamabad pakistan where he is to confer 
today with pakistans leaders about the soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan and the prospects for a peace in that nation 
it is our common task now to make sure to contribute to ending 
the bloodshed to contribute to ending the hostilities and to 
contribute to the development of dialogue between the afghans he 
said 
shevardnadze said he and deng agreed that the first summit since 
nikita khrushchev met mao tsetung in beijing in 1959 will occur 
sometime in the middle of may soviet sources said the tentative 
date was may 15 
shevardnadze quoted deng as saying the summit will close the 
page on the past and open up a chapter of the future 
china and the soviet union split over ideological and strategic 
differences in 1960 they fought a brief border war in 1969 and more 
recently have been divided over the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan cambodia and their heavily militarized common border 
china last year agreed to begin talking about a sovietproposed 
summit after gorbachev announced plans to withdraw soviet troops 
from afghanistan and reduce soviet troop strength in asia 
on friday china formally invited gorbachev to visit and 
shevardnadze accepted on the soviet leaders behalf 
the soviet union financial backer of vietnam now agrees with 
china supporter of the antivietnamese resistance in cambodia on 
the need for vietnam to end its military occupation 
shevardnadze said china and the soviet union agree on almost all 
external aspects such as ending arms shipments to the warring 
cambodian factions after a political settlement is reached 
shevardnadze said he proposed that diplomatic and military 
experts begin drafting an agreement on reducing military forces 
along the sinosoviet frontier 
he said the experts could begin meeting before the summit and 
we hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that 
important direction 
the foreign minister said the two sides might initially agree on 
advance notice for troop movements and military exercises and 
progress to the more difficult issues of disbanding offensive forces 
normalization the soviet official said will extend to 
longsevered party ties he envisioned increased contacts in trade 
science protection of the environment and exploration of outer 
space 
he said normal ties are directly linked with soviet 
perestroika or economic restructuring and chinese efforts to 
modernize its economy 
shevardnadze who flew to shanghai 870 miles south of beijing 
for the meeting with deng said chinas senior leader was a very 
wise man who has a lot of rich experience 
he earlier held met with foreign minister qian qichen and premier 
li peng

the average global temperature last year was the 
warmest of the century and six of the 20th centurys hottest years 
have occurred in the 1980s a british study said 
meteorological officials however said it was too early to 
conclusively blame the greenhouse effect where heat from the sun is 
trapped in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a 
greenhouse 
while a warming of this amount is consistent with the 
greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide 
and other manmade gases in the atmosphere the earths temperature 
fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious 
connection can yet be made said david parker of britains 
meterological office in bracknell 
their work showed that 1988s global average temperature was 572 
degrees fahrenheit 05 degrees higher than the 30year global 
average ending in 1979 
since 1979 the succession of tiny increases has been too steady 
for the weathermen to ignore parker said 
the six warmest years in the century have all been in this 
decade he said they were 1988 1987 1983 1981 1980 and 1986 in 
descending order of warmth 
global temperatures have risen by about 08 degrees since the 
beginning of the century parker said 
it could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse 
effect could be detected with much certainty he said in a recent 
interview 
the apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global 
weather records by the meteorological office and the university of 
east anglia in norwich southeast england 
britain has had a mild winter with temperatures averaging 5 
degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in december and 
january spring flowers are shooting up and blooming 
the debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been 
fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years including a 
serious drought in the united states last summer 
last week us scientists said they could find no evidence of 
any overall temperature increases for the united states from 1895 to 
1987 
but they stressed that the united states makes up only 6 percent 
of the earths surface

a reputed japanese red army terrorist who was 
convicted of transporting explosives was intending to use them to 
blow up a navy recruiting station in new york city prosecutors say 
government attorneys charging that yu kikumura has ties to a 
libyandirected terrorist conspiracy asked a judge friday to 
sentence him to a lengthy prison term 
however defense attorneys said the governments presentence 
report makes only tenuous ties between their client and other 
terrorist incidents worldwide 
kikumura 36 faces up to 100 years in prison when he is 
sentenced monday 
in papers filed in us district court the government revealed 
that kikumura planned to blow up a navy recruiting station in new 
york city in conjunction with a uso club bombing april 14 1988 in 
naples italy 
us attorney samuel a alito asked judge alfred j lechner to 
help deter terrorism by sending kikumura to prison at least until 
he is so old that he is no longer physically capable of building and 
planting bombs or assisting with terrorist plots 
the naples blast came on the second anniversary of the us air 
strike against libya and two days after kikumura was arrested on the 
new jersey turnpike with three 18inch pipe bombs in his car 
each bomb manufactured from a fire extinguisher gunpowder and 
lead shot could destroy an averagesize building authorities said 
kikumura who is alleged to be a member of the terrorist japanese 
red army was arrested last april 12 and convicted nov 29 on 
charges of illegally transporting explosives possession of firearms 
by an alien possession of unregistered firearms and carrying false 
travel documents 
sources have said the government believed other potential targets 
may have been the united nations building or manhattans garment 
district 
the presentence report does not mention either site alito also 
said a map of new york city found in kikumuras car had marks that 
indicated only the recruitment center as the target 
the washington post reported friday that the government had 
evidence proving all three sites were targets of kikumura 
defense attorneys ronald kuby and william kunstler said in their 
presentence report that the linkages it the prosecution 
attempts to make between kikumura and others are as tenuous as they 
are inflammatory

relatives of some of the 259 people who 
died on a pan am jet that crashed in scotland are banding together 
to criticize the us government for its handling of the tragedy 
paul hudson a lawyer whose 16yearold daughter melina died in 
the crash said the families are outraged at the policy of 
utter silence that has apparently been decided upon by the federal 
government 
hudson said at least a dozen family members intend to hold a news 
conference monday in new york city to discuss their criticisms he 
said the relatives believe the government should release details of 
the crash investigation to them 
lynne fraidowitz whose son daniel rosenthal 20 was among the 
dead told the syracuse poststandard that she would press the 
government for information until im satisfied were satisfied 
that we have the truth 
this is just the beginning she said were not going to 
let a wash go down if were not satisfied were going to do 
something else my son is dead all i have is a hole in the 
ground i owe my son a reckoning 
among those killed dec 21 were 35 students enrolled in syracuse 
universitys overseas studies program in addition to the 259 people 
aboard the plane 11 residents of lockerbie scotland also were 
killed when the jet smashed into a row of houses 
investigators have determined that the crash was caused by a bomb 
that was smuggled aboard flight 103 in frankfurt west germany the 
plane later stopped in london and was on its way to new york when 
the bomb went off 
a state department official declined to comment on the families 
accusations saying department officials wanted to hear the charges

trial under the internal security act about 550 were detained when 
mahathir became prime minister in 1981 mahathir called for a review

in december amnesty international criticized the act which 
empowers authorities to order preventive detention without trial for 
activities deemed extremely and imminently dangerous to the state 
and the public 
the londonbased human rights group said the act fails to state 
clear criteria for identifying such activities and authorities have 
not distinguished between violent activities that threaten national

threat

are seriously inadequate to safeguard against arbitrary arrest 
detention without trial torture or other degrading treatment it

several ultraleftist groups have formed an alliance 
aimed at disrupting the funeral of emperor hirohito a radical 
leader said today 
yoshihisa fujiwara said in an interview that his group is in a 
common front with three other major ultraleftist organizations 
speaking with the associated press at the heavily fortified 
headquarters of his middle core faction he said the alliance is 
planning guerrilla activities to disrupt hirohitos funeral on feb 
24 
he said the alliance includes the revolutionary workers 
association a group of revolutionaries linked by police to more 
than a dozen incidents since hirohitos health deteriorated in 
september hirohito died of cancer on jan 7 
police believe the middle core faction and the revolutionary 
workers association are japans largest ultraleftist groups 
police say the marxistleninist faction has between 3000 and 5000 
members while the revolutionary workers association has hundreds 
of members 
fujiwara said the other two groups in the front are the battle 
flag faction and the insurrection faction 
police estimate the battle flag faction membership to be in the 
hundreds but are unclear about size of the insurrection faction 
fujiwara refused to estimate the size of any of the groups 
including his own 
at least half a dozen radical groups have threatened to disrupt 
hirohitos funeral which will be attended by dignitaries from over 
130 nations including president bush and prince philip of britain 
more than 30000 police will be mobilized to ensure their safety 
ultraleftists claim the monarchy supports japanese imperialism 
and they are protesting the state funeral because they say hirohito 
should be treated as a war criminal for his role in world war ii 
fujiwara who described himself as a ranking member of the 
middle core faction refused to say whether bush is being singled 
out as a target but said the american leaders attendance at the 
funeral is inexcusable 
the faction seen by police as a serious threat to funeral 
security is believed to have the capability of firing missiles more 
than 2 miles 
after the 1986 tokyo summit of industrialized nations it claimed 
responsibility for launching missiles that overshot a state guest 
house where western leaders were meeting it is natural to assume 
that our technology has improved since then fujiwara said he 
refused to elaborate

the bush administration through 
a visit by vice president dan quayle is putting el salvador on 
notice that it must curb human rights abuses or face potential loss 
of us aid 
quayle also signaled friday a us willingness to back 
postponement of upcoming salvadoran elections if president jose 
napoleon duarte feels he has a consensus mandate to do so 
wrapping up the bush administrations first overseas diplomacy 
trip quayle made a strong appeal for human rights in el salvador 
in a private meeting with top military leaders he used direct 
language reminiscent of a similar mission in 1983 by then vice 
president george bush according to officials who attended bush had 
told the salvadorans to improve their human rights record or face 
loss of further aid 
quayle was very emphatic in describing the bipartisan 
consensus in washington that has led to 3 billion in us aid to 
el salvador during this decade said one state department official 
quayle explained that the consensus is of necessity a very 
fragile thing and that sliding back on the human rights questions 
would threaten it the vice president tried to tell them the 
facts of life in washington the official said 
quayle also met in san salvador with the two leading candidates 
to succeed duarte as president and with labor and business leaders 
as well as archbishop arturo rivera y dama 
stopping in el salvador after two days in venezuela for that 
countrys presidential inauguration quayle had lunch with duarte 
and several government officials he offered a toast in which he 
praised duarte as a champion of human rights and repeatedly stressed 
us commitment to that cause 
why i am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms 
possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human 
rights quayle told reporters in a news conference later there 
are consequences to human rights violations in the future 
us commitment and support for el salvador he said is 
conditioned on advancing democracy and human rights 
human rights abuses including killing of civilians by rightwing 
death squads were rampant in el salvador in the early 1980s the 
situation calmed down considerably after 1984 but in the past year 
violence by both left and rightwing factions has picked up again 
quayle arrived amid tight security at a time when the wartorn 
central american nation is preparing for its march 19 presidential 
election 
the rebels farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
proposed in a peace plan jan 23 to postpone the election until 
september 
in the strongest us statement to date on the peace proposal 
quayle called it a step forward 
the rebels for the first time ever are offering to participate in 
the elections if certain conditions are met including the 
postponement 
quayle said im sure there would be strong support from the 
administration should duarte decide he has a national consensus to 
agree to the postponement

was a premeditated and deliberate military provocation aimed at 
pushing the situation on the korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of 
strain 
south korea must immediately desist from all hostile acts 
aggravating the situation which runs counter to the korean peoples 
desire for reunification and to the global trend toward universal 
detente it said

a soviet newspaper said about 40 million people 
were arrested executed or otherwise repressed under josef stalin 
and it gave the most detailed breakdown of his victims ever reported 
in the official press 
the tabloids figures indicate up to 15 million of those people 
died as a result of the dictators policies western historians who 
also include estimates of farmers believed to have died after they 
were forced from their land put the number at 20 million 
about 20 million soviets are estimated to have died in world war 
ii 
the figures were not new for western readers but their 
appearance in this weeks arguments and facts whose circulation is 
20 million marked a new attempt to fill in what soviets call 
blank spots in their history 
historian roy medvedev gave the 40 million figure in an interview 
with the newspaper and said it included all victims of 
stalinism he said he based the number on his own calculations of 
the number arrested executed and otherwise punished 
the figure is much higher than the vague estimate previously on 
the official record soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said in a 
november 1987 speech that many thousands of people were 
subjected to wholesale repressive measures under stalin 
western historians believe that about 20 million soviets died 
under stalin who ruled from 19241953 
in the new report the soviet historian wrote that 67 million 
were killed in the famine of the early 1930s 57 million were 
executed or died in labor camps during mass arrests in the late 
1930s and 1 million died in forced relocations of ethnic minorities 
during world war ii 
also today the daily sovietskaya rossiya reported that a mass 
grave had been discovered in gornoaltai 1900 miles southeast of 
moscow it said construction workers found the human remains 
including 50 skulls of men ages 30 to 50 who were shot in the head 
the report said a stalinera prison camp had been located in the 
region and that authorities could not yet guess at how many people 
were buried there 
sovietskaya rossiya suggested the mass gravesite was similar to 
one found last year in kuropaty an area of the byelorussian 
republic authorities say kuropaty was used as a graveyard for at 
least 30000 people killed from 1937 to 1941 under stalin 
apparently for political reasons 
in the arguments and facts article medvedev gave this breakdown 
for stalins victims 
from 19271929 about 1 million soviets mostly former members 
of political opposition groups and figures in soviet founder 
vladimir i lenins new economic policy were in jails or exile 
from 19301932 nine to 11 million peasants were deported to 
siberia and other remote regions or fled to cities at least 1 
million more peasants were deported in 1933 
from 19321933 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine 
blamed on stalins agricultural policies 
about 15 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for 
violating various extremely cruel laws on state property 
in 1935 1 million former officials merchants and nobelmen were 
branded class strangers and deported from leningrad moscow and 
other cities 
during 19371938 5 million to 7 million people were arrested in 
the great terror of them 1 million were sentenced to death and 
the rest sent to labor camps where most died 
mass repressions struck 1 million people from 19391941 in the 
baltic republics and the western sections of the ukraine and 
byelorussia 
during world war ii up to 2 million ethnic germans were 
deported about 3 million moslems were forced to move one million 
of those deported died 
after 1940 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for 
reporting late to work a crime punishable by up to five years in a 
labor camp 
from 10 million to 12 million soviets were deprived of certain 
rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the nazis 
occupied during the war 
after the war from 1946 to 1953 from 1 million to 15 million 
people were arrested for political reasons 
medvedev was expelled from the communist party in 1969 and his 
major works on stalins repression and other topics were banned from 
publication under gorbachev policy of glasnost or more openness 
medvedev is back in favor and has been quoted frequently in the 
official press

the radio said vorontsov would discuss with iranian officials and 
afghan resistance leaders the future of afghanistan after the red 
armys evacuation 
vorontsov said at this juncture it is necessary to discuss 
ways of positive reconstruction of that country it is necessary 
that its neighbors exchange views on the future of afghanistan 
but of course the future of afghanistan concerns only the 
afghan people he stressed 
the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to prop up its 
marxist government at one point the soviets had about 115000 
troops there 
the official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
nicosia quoted vorontsov today as discounting reports of a possible 
military coup by hardline afghan officers after the soviet pullout 
there are numerous rumors about afghanistan but there is no 
such possibility and it is thoroughly baseless he was quoted as

japan faces a grim task that may prove more vexing 
than flooding the world with cars or cracking the computer chip 
market having a good time 
although older japanese cling to the work ethic that rocketed 
this country from world war ii devastation to economic superpower 
status their children have decided all work and no play made japan 
a dull nation 
shoko shima 31 works 45 hours a week as a translator about 
average for the japanese 
but she also takes time to work out regularly at a health club 
and play tennis and golf people used to work for works sake or 
their familys sake but now many of us work to have free time 
ms shima said 
more and more young people are choosing parttime jobs so they 
can work when they want instead of being tied to a big company 
in some ways japan today is a nation bent on enjoying itself 
the number of official holidays surpasses that of the united states 
and young peoples vision of the future does not include working 
grueling hours and blind loyalty to a company 
many people today say their hobby is work and the older ones 
especially say it with a sense of pride said sumiko iwao a 
psychologist who teaches at tokyos keio university but younger 
people today are saying no thats not my cup of tea 
in the future productivity will decline but thats not bad 
because it is much better for japanese to enjoy life and relax than 
just work all the time ms iwao said 
but the old ways continue especially in the highly charged 
business world 
if you want to succeed in business in japan you still have to 
work from 9 to 9 ms shima said 
the average japanese worked 2150 hours in 1986 about 225 hours 
more than americans and almost 500 more than west germans according 
to labor ministry statistics in 1987 the japanese figure edged up 
by 18 hours 
the government embraced the idea of a fiveday workweek in 1985 
partly to reduce big trade surpluses more leisure time the theory 
goes would equal increased spending on imports an expansion of 
recreational industry more domestic spending 
but no one said it would be easy 
office worker kayoko kumagai 41 divides her free time between 
household chores bowling and working out at her health club but 
her 37yearold husband a company worker just lies around the 
house on his one day off a week she said 
like most japanese kumagai has grown used to working six days a 
week with only sundays off 
not many people realize they are working too much they take it 
for granted said mrs kumagai she counts her husband among them 
and added my husband wouldnt be able to figure out what to do if 
he had weekends off 
when the government announced plans to give about 58 percent of 
public servants two saturdays off a month people complained they 
could no longer pay taxes apply for travel visas or visit the 
national library every saturday the socalled twin holidays 
went into effect jan 14 
financial institutions went to a fiveday workweek feb 1 and 
the government hopes other businesses will follow suit it has 
targeted 1993 for a uniform fiveday workweek 
meanwhile japan is creating more leisure time by expanding the 
number of official holidays from 12 in 1988 to 13 this year well 
ahead of the 10 holidays a year enjoyed by some americans 
the japanese find vacant time excruciatingly difficult and 
come nowhere near enjoying its advantages wrote former government 
official taichi sakaiya in the daily japan times 
japanese tend to hustle even on vacation sakaiya noted an 
overwhelming number of japanese prefer the quickie type of package 
tour such as five european cities in eight days 
today sports travel and relaxing at home with videos stereos 
and computers are the most common ways japanese spend their leisure 
time a change from a few years ago when the majority in a survey 
said sleeping was their favorite pastime away from work

azaldin a schoolteacher from the 
eastern city of ghazni says he doesnt care who rules his ravaged 
country as long as the fighting stops 
he is typical of many afghans who have braved a decade of brutal 
fighting between communist forces and moslem rebels called 
mujahedeen 
mujahedeen leaders the seven most powerful of whom are based in 
peshawar pakistan are fighting for an islamic republic of 
afghanistan but so far have failed to agree on how to slice any 
postwar political pie 
they have had no unity said azaldin 37 who uses just one 
name each of them wants power but seven kings or presidents in 
afghanistan is impossible 
fazle mohammad an elderly merchant who sells spices and grain 
from a grimy adobe shop in this small settlement says he doesnt 
know one guerrilla chief from another 
we dont know much about them we follow the local mujahedeen 
commanders he said 
fazle said his sympathy for the guerrillas forced him to abandon 
his original shop in the communistheld center of ghazni about 75 
miles southwest of the afghan capital 
with the feb 15 deadline for the final soviet troop withdrawal 
from afghanistan drawing near mujahedeen political leaders have 
been trying to reach a political consensus 
they have tentative plans for a feb 10 shura or 
consultative council to convene in pakistan but its composition 
remains uncertain 
invitees include representatives of rebels based in iran these 
guerrillas belong to the shiite moslem sect which comprises about 
17 percent of afghanistans population 
the majority of afghans are sunnis as are the pakistanbased 
rebel groups both sides have yet to agree on their proportional 
representation in the council 
the shuras main task is to name a transitional government that 
can step into power if the guerrillas topple the ruling peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
mohammad zai a 78yearold former farmer who now runs errands 
for the guerrillas says that for him politics plays second to 
peace 
for me its not a problem of who it is who leads afghanistan 
as long as the people like him and choose him zai said 
fazle said that if individual guerrilla leaders make a grab for 
power after the soviet withdrawal they will get little support from 
battleweary afghans 
we just want an islamic government he said we didnt 
fight for anybody but god islam and our country even our small 
children understand this

diplomatic and political sources have 
linked the new president gen andres rodriguez with drug 
traffickers and cast doubt on his pledge to lead paraguay into a new 
era of democracy 
rodriguez who led the bloody coup that ousted president alfredo 
stroessner on thursday was sworn in as president friday 
rodriguez who held the no 2 position in the military and was 
considered a strong stroessner ally immediately promised democratic 
reforms and more human rights protections but he failed to provide 
details 
the coup leader had no comment today on stroessners fate on 
thursday he gave the 76yearold stroessner 12 hours to leave 
paraguay a deadline that apparently passed unenforced he 
apparently remained under house arrest 
the new president finds himself in a very difficult situation 
because of his professional and personal ties to stroessner an 
opposition political leader said today rodriguezs daughter is 
married to stroessners son and the generals share two 
grandchildren 
aside from the strictly political question this involves 
family ties the leader said on condition of anonymity 
up to 200 soldiers mostly stroessner loyalists were killed in 
battles with rodriguezs troops beginning thursday night according 
to estimates from roman catholic radio caritas the government and 
hospital officials have refused to comment on the death toll 
by friday afternoon stroessner paraguays president and army 
commanderinchief for 34 years was under arrest rodriguez was 
sworn as the new president the armed forces proclaimed loyalty to 
him and the population was quiet not even the staunchly 
prostroessner wing of the ruling colorado party rallied to 
stroessners side 
in addition to stroessner about 30 of his followers were 
arrested there was no word of their fate today 
unconfirmed reports said friday that stroessner was going to 
chile gen mario mardones santiago police commander said he 
believed stroessner was leaving paraguay today but we do not know 
where to not necessarily chile 
rodriguez initially was enthusiastically endorsed by opposition 
leaders who hoped he would offer them a political opening that 
stroessner and the militant wing of his party did not 
but academics foreign observers and even some paraguayan 
leaders already are hinting at a dark side of rodriguez 
he has an exceedingly unsavory reputation john hoyt 
williams a professor of latin american history at indiana state 
university in terre haute ind told the new york times 
i mean really bad and thats an understatement rodriguez 
reportedly has provided protection air fields and an air taxi 
service to people smuggling drugs northward williams said 
the cox newspaper group citing a classified us state 
department report said on friday that rodriguez is considered by 
law enforcement authorities in paraguay to be the countrys no 1 
drug trafficker 
a western diplomat in asuncion speaking on condition of 
anonymity said today that reports are common in paraguay that 
rodriguez allows cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns in 
deserted chaco province along the border with bolivia 
however he added absolutely no proof of that has ever been 
offered 
rodriguez the son of a smallscale farmer definitely lives 
better than his army salary would seem to allow his house in a 
plush neighborhood is a mansion with a fountain in the 
wellmanicured front yard 
in his biography paraguay under stroessner us academic 
paul lewis said rodriguez made his fortune from the whisky and

well before oliver l norths trial got under 
way in courtroom 6 judge gerhard a gesell asked how long it would 
last telling lawyers far more important matters awaited his 
attention 
sparring from the bench with defense lawyers and prosecutors 
alike the energetic 78yearold federal district judge obviously 
relishes the limelight and legal challenges posed by the first 
criminal trial in the irancontra affair 
but despite the national attention given the case gesell took 
pains at the jan 9 hearing to remind the lawyers that he will treat 
it like just another criminal matter on his crowded docket 
it has become increasingly urgent for me to know how long this 
case is going to take gesell said at the hearing there are a 
substantial number of litigants with i think far more important 
matters pending who want to be heard 
ive got all kinds of problems in terms of the work of the 
court as an institution said gesell who unlike most judges his 
age has refused to take a reduced caseload by going on senior 
status 
told the trial could last four or five months gesell replied 
it will be a wonderful summer 
highly regarded for his intellect and ability to conduct a 
difficult trial gesell is known among washington lawyers as being 
impatient with slipshod pleadings and arguments 
you better be prepared but he gives you a fair hearing on 
everything said attorney james jordan a former bar association 
president who has tried a number of civil cases before gesell 
others note a touch of intellectual arrogance in gesell the son 
of a noted yale university child psychologist 
sometimes wrong never in doubt said one attorney echoing 
on condition of anonymity a sentiment expressed by other 
colleagues in the local bar he does a lot of thinking out loud a 
sign of selfconfidence of which he is not lacking 
gesells habit of expressing his thoughts from the bench has sent 
many a reporter scurrying to the telephone with excited accounts 
about the judges latest doubts about the future of the irancontra 
case 
at the outset of jury selection gesell said the difficulty 
finding prospective jurors who had no knowledge of norths immunized 
congressional testimony raised questions about the triability of 
the case 
yet after five days the judge managed to find 32 prospective 
jurors for a planned pool of 50 from which the panel will be 
selected 
gesell can also be hot tempered as he was when he threatened an 
abc news reporter with a contemptofcourt citation for airing an 
account of jury selection that he said appears to be a deliberate 
effort to disrupt the process 
the judges storm of vituperation quickly passed and there has 
been no further mention of contempt proceedings against the 
television reporter tim obrien 
gesells experience with big cases and troubling issues 
throughout his 20year career on the bench no doubt figured in the 
decision by aubrey e robinson jr the chief judge of us district 
court here to assign the irancontra cases to him 
throughout the pretrial maneuverings several judges expressed 
the view that if any jurist could bring the difficult case to trial 
it would be gesell 
he is just very much in control said william jeffress a 
criminal defense lawyer who clerked for gesell in the early 1970s 
i would certainly say he has a dominating personality he is and 
remains in control of what goes on in his court 
gesell has had his share of other famous cases notably the 
watergate plumbers case in 1974 which involved the conspiracy to 
break into the office of a los angeles psychiatrist to get the 
patient records of daniel ellsberg who leaked the pentagon papers 
to the new york times 
gesell refused in 1971 to enjoin the washington post from 
publishing its version of the secret pentagon study of the vietnam 
war 
he was the only federal judge who refused to grant the justice 
departments requests for injunctions to delay newpaper publication 
of the pentagon papers a position vindicated by a unanimous 
supreme court decision in the case 
a year earlier gesell had enjoined the government printing 
office from publishing a house internal security committee report 
listing 65 radical revolutionary campus speakers the judge 
found it had served no legislative purpose and was issued solely 
for exposure for intimidation 
after attending yale as an undergraduate and law student gesell 
came to washington during the new deal and went to work at the 
securities and exchange commission for william o douglas who later 
became a supreme court justice 
at the sec gesell successfully investigated a major wall street 
investment scandal an episode douglas cites in his memoirs later 
gesell became a partner for the celebrated washington law firm of 
covington and burling making his mark as an antitrust lawyer 
with his rosy cheeks the whitehaired jurist was once aptly 
described by the new york times as resembling a cleanshaven santa 
claus known among friends as a jovial raconteur gesell usually 
spends the month of august at his summer home on an island off the 
cost of maine 
on most weekends he and his wife peggy go to their dairy farm 
near leesburg va where he produces his own brand of honey that is 
sold in local stores and vegetable stands 
jeffress said gesell is not just a gentleman farmer who goes 
out and gets waited on but a farmer who gets his feet dirty

when house speaker jim wright sent out a 
questionnaire on the pay raise issue to his colleagues last week 
one came back with a cryptic note sam rayburn would not have sent 
out a survey like this 
the reference to fellow texan rayburn considered among the 
strongest house speakers in the century was a pointed jab at wright 
for failing to take command on the controversial issue and instead 
attempting to spread the blame by seeking the opinions of his 
colleagues 
there were four who wrote on the survey something to the effect 
that this is a bum idea wright conceded to reporters as he 
handed out the results of his poll last week but he contended many 
more members were glad to be consulted on how to handle the 
recommended 51 percent pay hike 
wrights venture into the polling business an apparent attempt 
to demonstrate that he was acting on behalf of a majority of house 
members to engineer a salary increase appeared to have backfired in 
several ways 
for one the speaker failed to consult even his top leadership 
team before sending out the 12question survey form 
the leaders in turn were left scrambling to distance themselves 
from what they clearly considered a dubious idea 
some senior democrats were bitter about the move this has 
permanently hurt wright said one speaking only on condition of 
anonymity 
in addition the confidential survey was sharply at odds with the 
outcomes of several public surveys conducted by the news media and 
interest groups 
wright said of 326 house members responding privately to his 
survey 57 percent did not want to vote on the pay raise before it 
goes into effect at midnight tuesday 
but when the associated press queried 105 lawmakers 88 percent 
said they did want to vote before the deadline in an informal poll 
of 278 members by the selfdescribed consumer group public citizen 
265 61 percent of the house said on the record that they wanted 
a vote 
somebodys not telling the truth said public citizens ralph 
nader an outspoken pay raise critic for the speaker to expose 
members to a charge of lying is a very serious case of leadership 
run amok 
wright intended the survey to bolster his strategy of letting the 
raise go into effect then holding a vote to roll it back to 30 
percent but it instead showed the speaker could fall short of the 
twothirds majority needed for a rollback under the expedited 
process he chose for bringing the issue to the floor 
what the results did show was deep division among house members 
over the entire issue of congressional pay and how it is set and 
inconsistency between the answers to some questions for example 
fiftysix percent favored and 44 percent opposed the process 
under which pay levels for lawmakers and top officials are 
recommended by an independent commission proposed by the president 
and put in effect automatically unless both houses vote to cancel 
them 
on the question of whether they would vote against any effort 
to rescind the raise entirely 49 percent said yes and 46 percent 
said no 
asked if the 50 percent raise for congress and similar 
increases for other top government jobs were fair and proper 54 
percent said yes but asked more specifically about the amount of 
the increases 56 percent said they were too high 
a majority 54 percent opposed a vote before wednesday on 
banning honoraria such as fees for speaking before lobbying groups 
and limiting the raise to 30 percent but after wednesday and 
following an honoraria ban 61 percent favored rolling back the pay 
raise to 30 percent 
only on one question were sentiments near unanimous 98 percent 
said they would vote to ban honoraria if the pay raise goes into 
effect 
the survey has put the heat on everybody and it isnt going to 
go away said rep tim penny of minnesota one of the few 
democrats willing to criticize the speaker publicly this issue is 
going to leave a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of members and 
eventually thats got to add up sooner or later the good will is 
going to be gone 
some lawmakers observed that wright came into the fray over pay 
carrying heavy political baggage from two continuing house ethics 
committee investigations into his conduct one case involving 
allegations the speaker abused his office while majority leader for 
financial gain is expected to be resolved late this month 
whatever the outcome of that inquiry wright will likely face 
another public pummeling led by his chief accuser rep newt 
gingrich rga and the fallout from the survey could hurt said 
one prominent house democrat 
in a matter of weeks hell be asking these same people to 
stand up for him against gingrich said the lawmaker

william carter alexander doesnt get hate mail 
from constituents or pressure from lobbying groups but like 
congressmen federal judges and president bushs cabinet officers 
hes up for a sizable pay raise 
alexander research director at an air force laboratory in texas 
is one of 7100 members of the senior executive service managers 
of federal programs ranging from space missions to tax collection 
whose pay is tied to presidential recommendations 
spokesman jim lafferty of the office of personnel management 
calls the senior executives the top part of the federal 
governments middle management 
to carol bonosaro president of the senior executive association 
a group formed by the senior managers they are the glue of the 
government without them it couldnt run 
annual salaries for senior managers now range from 68700 to 
80700 they would be 80000 to 120000 if the raise takes effect 
on wednesday with the average being 98000 
while congress and the judges would get a 51 percent raise 
members of the senior executive service would get raises ranging 
from 16 percent to 49 percent another 700 federal employees known 
as super graders who have management responsibilities would get 
similar pay hikes 
the exact size of the pay increases is in flux as congressional 
leaders deal with mounting pressure to scale back the raise 
a dozen senior executives interviewed in recent weeks said not 
surprisingly that they supported the raise most said their support 
stemmed not solely from personal financial interest but also from a 
hope that higher pay will help the government attract top talent 
alexander has been a federal employee for 28 years rising 
through the ranks to a position in which he now is directly 
responsible for 200 people five of whom are at top civil service 
levels and paid more than he is 
still in alexanders words its always my hide if theres a 
screw up 
alexander is paid 71900 a year and said his salary would rise 
to 90000 if congress allows the pay package to take effect on 
wednesday he says he could make double that in the private sector 
but wont quit despite having two sons in college and a third in 
high school 
ive built a life and career in government and i intend to stay 
even after i reach retirement eligibility in two years alexander 
said in a telephone interview 
marylouise uhlig predicts a major crisis in government if 
congress kills the pay raises something she said would prompt a 
major exodus of managers 
i really do think that you get the kind of government that you 
pay for said uhlig director of program management at the 
environmental protection agencys pesticide and toxic substances 
division in order to keep good people you have to pay them 
uhligs duties as director of the agencys office of pesticides 
and toxic substances range from hiring and budgeting to acting as a 
liaison with regional epa offices 
im paying for this raise too is her answer to criticism the 
raises will bloat the federal budget my entire salary is taxed 
if you want to know how much grain is grown in nebraska or the 
top crop in utah you might try fred vogel director of the 
agriculture departments state statistical division 
you look at some of the salaries on the outside and you wonder 
why you hang around and listen to all of the government bashing 
said vogel who supervises 675 employees in 45 states and a 40 
million budget 
so why does he 
you get committed to your job and your employees and you feel 
that what youre doing helps said vogel who now makes 76400 a 
year and would see his pay to jump to 98000 
bonosaro said an informal survey by the senior executives 
association supported uhligs talk of a mass exodus in the 
management posts 
they have no real reason to stay and wait another four years 
she said the commission that suggested the raises meets every four 
years 
the commission said the cost of paying the executives raises 
would be 41 million in the current fiscal year and 71 million next 
year less than a third of the cost of a b1 bomber is the 
comparison made by bonosaro

as a candidate george bush promised a 
kinder gentler nation without saying how hed pay for it now 
with the day of reckoning near president bushs efforts to finance 
his campaign promises are meeting unexpected complications 
the difficulty of crafting a rescue plan for the troubled 
savingsandloan industry and disagreement over defense spending 
levels are making it harder for budget officials to finish rewriting 
former president reagans 115 trillion fiscal 1990 budget 
according to administration and congressional sources 
bush goes before a joint session of congress and a nationwide 
televison audience thursday to hang a pricetag on his campaign vows 
and to show how hell meet grammrudman defict targets while 
adhering to his read my lips no new taxes slogan 
bushs budget according to sources probably wont look as good 
on paper as did reagans which proclaimed a deficit reduction in 
the upcoming fiscal year to 928 billion down from the estimated 
1615 billion in the current year 
the new budget will project a deficit barely under the 100 
billion ceiling called for in the grammrudman law which aims for a 
balanced budget by 1993 through declining annual steps the sources 
said 
the presidents campaign proposals for new spending on education 
child care the homeless and environmental cleanup add up to well 
over 5 billion money that his administration is finding all but 
impossible to squeeze from already tight federal ledgers 
with just a few days to go bush aides said many pivotal 
decisions have yet to be made by the president including whether to 
go along with his predecessors proposed 4 billion increase in 
defense spending or to freeze it at the rate of inflation which 
would free up about 2 billion for other programs 
although bush has generally proposed a flexible freeze that 
would hold overall spending at the rate of inflation some key 
aides including chief of staff john sununu have reportedly been 
pressing for higher levels of defense spending 
administration officials who insisted upon anonymity have said 
bushs budget will call for lower defense spending than proposed by 
reagan but how much lower had not yet been determined 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said the 
administration is looking into the option of no growth except for 
inflation possibly over a threeyear period 
the administration officials also said that some of bushs 
campaign promises will surface in scaledback form in the budget or 
not be financed at all still a senior official said that the major 
ones would at least be noted if not fully paid for 
among bushs more ambitious campaign promises a 1000 
childcare tax credit for lowincome families a 500 million 
national merit school program to aid the countrys best schools a 
multiyear 5 billion program to attack acid rain expansion of 
medicaid housing vouchers for the poor and a new taxfree 
individual savings plan 
bush will also have to find money in his budget to pay for 
cleaning up deteriorating nuclear plants 
given his notax pledge and the tightness of available funds it 
seems unlikely that bush can afford to retreat from reagans 
proposal to ax more than fivedozen programs or to restore much of 
the 55 billion cuts in medicare proposed by the former president 
coming up with a budget plan in time for thursdays address to 
congress has been complicated by the savingsandloan crisis 
federal regulators say that from 85 billion to 100 billion will be 
needed to shore up the industry 
bush and his top financial advisers were huddled saturday at the 
presidential retreat at camp david md trying to work out a 
solution 
an original trial balloon by the administration to charge 
depositors a fee of 25 cents for each 100 on deposit was quickly 
deflated on capitol hill still white house aides were reluctant to 
rule it out entirely claiming the means for raising the rescue 
funds had dwindled to a precious few 
congressional speculation as of saturday was that the 
administration would propose raising the money through the sale of 
special 30year treasury bonds with an increase in insurance fees 
paid by financial institutions to cover the 6 billion to 7 billion 
cost of servicing or paying interest on the bonds 
the president also must make room in his budget for his proposal 
to reduce the tax on capital gains to a maximum of 15 percent and 
then to use what he claims will be increased revenues from that move 
to pay for other tax breaks 
those include restoring tax benefits for the oil and gas industry 
and establishing taxfree enterprise zones in inner cities 
in all its a big order for a new president who conceded even in 
his inaugural address that there was more will than wallet 
in a speech friday to a group of business leaders bush said 
next week were going to have to come forward with some tough 
decisions 
and he added ive heard from a lot of you here the importance 
of having what we send up there credible so that world markets will 
understand that this is for real

five lebanese publications predicted 
saturday that some foreign hostages held in lebanon will be freed 
soon one magazine said two of the nine missing americans will be 
released 
also saturday irish ambassador patrick mccabe who spent one 
week in lebanon trying to verify reports hostage brian keenan might 
be released said there was a distinct possibility keenan would 
be freed 
the reports marked the first time several lebanese publications 
have simultaneously carried nearly identical articles about the 
possible release of foreign captives the reports came shortly after 
a top iranian official and a shiite moslem leader predicted a 
breakthrough in the hostage problem 
the annahar arab and international weekly said the 
iranianbacked hezbollah has decided to release two american 
captives as a goodwill gesture it gave no names 
the magazine based in christian east beirut quoted an 
unidentified hezbollah official as saying the scenario is being 
set for the release the brief report did not elaborate 
hezbollah made up of shiite moslem zealots is believed to be 
the umbrella organization for several groups holding hostages 
there are 15 foreigners missing in lebanon in addition to the 
nine americans and keenan who holds both irish and british 
citizenship there are three britons an italian and a belgian 
the longest held is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the leftist daily assafir which has close ties with the syrian 
army command in lebanon said diplomatic information speaks of 
the possible release of some foreign hostages in the next two 
weeks 
the weekly ashshiraa said the hostage issue has been put on a 
hot burner its brief report said without elaborating this 
could result in releasing them in the light of a decision to 
this effect adopted by regional powers interested in this case 
the independent annahar and conservative addiyar dailies both 
said a peace pact reached monday in damascus between hezbollah and 
amal the rival prosyrian shiite militia also aims at securing the 
release of foreign captives the pact sponsored by syria and iran 
halted a ninemonth war between the rival militias 
informed sources believe that the basic aim of the 
amalhezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captives 
held in lebanon said annahar lebanons most prestigious 
newspaper the report did not elaborate 
addiyar quoted an unidentified official as saying the 
amalhezbollah accord could result in the handing over of some 
foreign hostages to the syrians 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
deployed in predominantly moslem areas 
in the past some foreign captives were set free in 
syriancontrolled sectors of lebanon and the syrians took credit 
for their release 
the irish ambassador who spent one week in lebanon trying to 
verify reports about keenans possible release returned to iraq on 
saturday 
before departing he told reporters i leave with the impression 
that the release of brian keenan before long remains a distinct 
possibility 
keenan a teacher from belfast was kidnapped april 11 1986 in 
beiruts moslem sector no group has claimed his abduction 
mccabe said he would return to lebanon in coming weeks or 
sooner if necessary

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze ended 
a threeday visit to china on saturday by announcing the nations 
will hold their first summit in 30 years in midmay 
shevardnadze said soviet president mikhail gorbachev will travel 
to beijing at the invitation of the chinese for a meeting with 
senior leader deng xiaoping soviet sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the summit was tentatively scheduled for may 15 
chinas deputy foreign minister tian zengpei however said no 
date had been set and that the chinese were studying the 
proposal for the may meeting 
shevardnadze later flew to islamabad pakistan for meetings with 
pakistani leaders about the soviet troop withdrawal from neighboring 
afghanistan 
at a news conference before his departure shevardnadze said deng 
told him the summit would close the page on the past and open up a 
chapter on the future 
in a move toward complete normalization of relations 
diplomats and other officials are to discuss reducing military 
tensions along the 5000mile sovietchinese border he said 
western diplomats said the issue first came up when chinese 
foreign minister qian qichen visited moscow in december 
we hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that 
important direction shevardnadze said 
he said the first step might be an agreement on advance notice of 
troop movements and military exercises and then negotiations for 
disbanding offensive forces 
in the 1950s china depended on soviet technical and military aid 
and followed the soviet lead in diplomatic policy relations between 
the countries soured in 1960 over ideological and strategic 
disputes and they fought a brief border war in 1969 
the chinese agreed to discuss a summit last year after progress 
was made on what they call the three obstacles border 
tensions soviet aid for vietnams invasion of cambodia and the 
soviet intervention in afghanistan 
the last soviet troops are supposed to be out of afghanistan by 
feb 15 
gorbachev has pledged to remove from asia 200000 soviet troops 
many now stationed along the chinese border and has said that most 
of moscows 50000 troops in mongolia will be withdrawn 
qian was the first chinese foreign minister to visit moscow in 32 
years shevardnadzes visit was the first by a soviet foreign 
minister in 30 years and was designed to lay the groundwork for the 
summit 
china formally issued its invitation to gorbachev on friday 
substantive progress has been made on obstacles that have 
stood in the way of a summit deputy foreign minister tian told 
reporters following shevardnadzes departure this visit produced 
results 
he said the two sides now agree that vietnam should end its 
10year occupation of cambodia by september as promised and that 
there should be international supervision of the troop withdrawal 
china backs the antivietnamese resistance in cambodia and has 
demanded moscow pressure its ally vietnam to pull out 
shevardnadze said better sinosoviet relations are the result of 
the countries economic reforms and he envisioned increased trading 
between the nations 
the countries are believed to want to ease tensions so they can 
concentrate less on military matters and more on rejuvenating their 
economies 
shevardnadze flew to shanghai about 870 miles south of beijing 
for the 90minute meeting with deng on saturday morning 
he said chinas top leader was a very wise man who has a lot of 
rich experience 
there have been rumors that the 84yearold deng is in failing 
health but shevardnadze said he appeared quite fit

oil from a sunken ship off antarctica threatens 
not only the environment in a pristine bay but also wildlife 
research in a biologically rich area prized until now for its 
unspoiled state scientists say 
the paths of research that have been followed down there have 
been forever changed said national science foundation spokesman 
jack talmadge i think if youre a scientist in the year 2035 
youve got to remember there was an oil spill 
ted delaca chief scientist of the foundations polar programs 
said the highly sensitive environment has been compromised in a 
way that we cant even evaluate right now 
while the spills effect on future research cannot yet be 
determined its something i find personally disturbing he said 
by telephone friday from palmer station a research outpost near the 
spill 
the oil is leaking from an argentine research and supply ship 
that ran aground jan 25 the ship is nearly submerged on shoals in 
the bismarck strait just off the antarctic peninsula 600 miles from 
the tip of south america 
authorities said the ship carried at least 200000 gallons of 
fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck american 
cleanup crews are expected to reach the site sometime this week 
some scientists said the effects of the spill may be magnified 
because it involved fuel oil more dangerous to wildlife than crude 
oil and because antarctic conditions could slow the oils 
decomposition 
the spill struck an area that has the largest and most diverse 
plant and animal populations of the continent said polly penhale 
manager of the science foundations polar biology and medicine 
program 
apart from a large seal population some 30000 sea birds live in 
the area affected by the spill including adele and chinstrap 
penguins cormorants kelp gulls and giant petrels penhale said 
it is one of the most spectacularly beautiful areas in the 
whole antarctica said sayed z elsayed an oceanography 
professor at texas aampm university who has studied it for 25 years 
most plants and animals live on islands off the mainland where 
the science foundation operates palmer station on a spit of rock 
scientists have already seen oilcovered and apparently lethargic 
seals three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting 
birds delaca said 
thirtyeight of 40 penguins checked friday bore traces of oil 
thousands of dead and dying krill shrimplike crustaceans that are a 
key food for bigger animals have shown up on beaches he said 
all the principal penguin rookeries here are now surrounded 
by fuel oil he said what its effect could be on the birds is 
anybodys guess 
birds can freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural 
insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening 
themselves or eating contaminated prey 
scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20 
years focusing on birds and seals and also on such organisms as 
fish kelp krill and shelled animals called limpets 
one of the main concerns of the scientists is that that 
area stay pristine because we have a lot of environmental research 
thats going on said langdon quetin research biologist at the 
university of california in santa barbara 
it is one of the few areas in the antarctic we have good 
logistics to he said the spill will be the ruination of a good 
laboratory at least in the near future at least as a natural 
uncontaminated study area 
some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other 
organisms kept in tanks at palmer station which marine botanist 
mike neushul of the university of california at santa barbara calls 
probably the best marine biology laboratory in the antarctic 
the tanks draw seawater from the nearby harbor and if oil 
contaminates that supply the experiments might have to be stopped 
nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem penhale said 
neushul said one factor boding poorly for the areas wildlife is 
that the spill involved fuel oil which is much more toxic than 
crude oil because it can damage biological tissue 
neushul who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off 
baja california 30 years ago said that spill caused mass deaths of 
fish starfish sea urchins and other animals the same may happen 
to similar animals in the antarctic he said 
in the california spill the environment took 17 years to 
recover he said recovery in antarctica may take even longer 
because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down 
said paul dayton professor of marine ecology at the scripps 
institute of oceanography in la jolla calif 
after years of studying wildlife in a pristine environment 
researchers are now turning to monitor how the wildlife responds to 
the oil spill talmadge said this disaster is the experiment 
nobody wanted he said

the world health organization says 7000 new aids 
cases were reported last month raising the worldwide total to 
nearly 140000 
most of the increase was due to updated reports on acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome from the americas and europe who said 
friday in its monthly update on the spread of the deadly disease 
the united states reported more than half of the new cases 
nearly 4000 
who estimated the real number of adult cases was between 350000 
and 400000 by the end of last year with subsaharan africa thought 
to account for more than half the victims the un agency noted 
that the accuracy of reports on aids patients varies widely between 
countries and continents 
who said 139886 cases were reported from 144 countries by jan 
31 a rise of 6910 over a month earlier thirtythree countries 
said they had no cases 
new caledonia the french pacific territory reported its first 
victims two as of aug 1 
the united states which has recorded 60 percent of all aids 
cases reported 3965 new cases last month 
france with the highest total and case rate in europe reported 
an increase of 781 to 5655 cases 
italy reported 452 new victims bringing its total to 3008 
spains figure rose to 2165 with the report of 315 new cases 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant

ronald reagan left the white house two weeks 
ago to retire as elder statesman in his beloved california but 
instead of lounging around the pool hes been busy lining up work 
and visiting old haunts 
the expresident has signed a book deal worth up to 7 million 
lined up a 50000perspeech lecture contract and opened his 
century city offices where a variety of offers are pouring in 
there are also social demands his 78th birthday party monday 
night at the ritzy bistro gardens a feb 23 palm springs gala

amber michaela and ilene young girls 
living anonymous lives in quiet middleclass suburbs of san 
francisco until one by one they disappeared without a trace 
it isnt as if a child has never vanished been kidnapped or run 
away from any of the commuter towns near the bay but some see 
unsettling similarities in these three cases although they remain 
unexplained and unsolved 
sevenyearold amber schwartgarcia vanished june 3 after she 
went to play in the front yard of her pinole home 
five months later on nov 19 ambers case drew new attention 
that was the day 9yearold michaela joy garecht was snatched by a 
stringyhaired stranger in a dingy car outside a market in hayward 
about 30 miles south of pinole 
michaela and a friend had ridden their scooters a short distance 
from home to get some candy and pop the friend said she watched in 
horror as the man grabbed michaela and roared off 
hayward and pinole are situated just off busy freeways that serve 
communities along san francisco bay near hayward interstate 580 
shoots off to the east heading to other communities that share the 
two towns rambling housing tracts kids on skateboards fastfood 
restaurants and shopping malls 
communities like dublin where 13yearold ilene misheloff 
disappeared monday 
she was last seen about 3 pm walking along a major 
thoroughfare on her way to a skating rink her family describes her 
as a good student a girl who never varied from her routine without 
letting her parents know 
at first reluctant to categorize her disappearance as a 
kidnapping investigators said friday that she may indeed have been 
kidnapped 
evidence of community concern is everywhere yellow ribbons dot 
virtually every major dublin street people can be seen posting 
pictures of ilene on utility poles in the rain 
ilenes synagogue held a prayer service for her thursday night 
and local churches plan to do the same in coming days 
all the parents i know have sat their children down and talked 
to them said connie spence one of the volunteers who worked 
feverishly friday answering phones passing out fliers and accepting 
donations 
robert e lee a resident of benicia about 35 miles north of 
dublin dropped by the volunteers headquarters with enough paper to 
make 45000 fliers with ilenes picture 
ive got 10 grandchildren he said so i feel for whats 
happened 
people traveling to lake tahoe and oregon have picked up fliers 
as did an airline pilot flying east the postal service is passing 
out fliers in dublin and pleasanton along with the mail 
we cant even begin to understand the feelings of the 
parents said pleasanton postmaster jose cantu but we know that 
if it were our kids wed want help too 
at ilenes school wells intermediate few children walk to 
school alone these days 
we all are being more careful said toni dona whose daughter 
is a classmate of ilenes the kids are grouping together and the 
parents are carpooling 
its constantly on their minds when they see that empty chair 
next to them its hard not to think about it dona said 
especially when you turn on the news every morning and hear about 
it and now were not hearing anything which is even worse 
police say theyve received about 200 calls a day not counting 
those coming in on the tollfree hotline 
the fbi has joined the investigation but spokesman chuck latting 
said the agency has nothing more to report than police theres no 
proof ilenes disappearance is related to the others but no 
evidence to rule out the possibility either he said 
ilenes parents michael and madelyne misheloff said they spoke 
with their children after michaelas disappearance just as they had 
warned them before about being careful around strangers 
before his daughters disappearance misheloff familiarized 
himself with a sketch of the suspect in the garecht case but he 
said he had not been unduly alarmed that the same thing could happen 
to his children 
this is a very quiet community lowcrime area where if there 
is a crime you notice it not like in one of the large cities 
where there seems to be a serious crime just about every day he 
said 
ilenes parents said they have no gut feeling about whether her 
disappearance is linked to the others 
unfortunately for all of us three children are gone and 
one of them is our daughter said mrs misheloff choking back 
tears 
shes not home and its cold and its raining

john towers reputation and the intent of the 
senate armed services committee to conduct a thorough investigation 
collided headon this week as the expected confirmation of the 
defense secretarydesignate hit a snag 
new allegations surfaced thursday of a drinking problem and 
womanizing prompting the committee to postpone a planned vote on 
towers nomination until the fbi could complete a new inquiry 
despite the new twist to the wellcirculated but unsubstantiated 
rumors senators said they expect the senate panel to approve the 
tower nomination and forward their recommendation to the full senate 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the panel 
said he expected the fbi report to reach the panel on monday and 
we can proceed to vote tuesday or wednesday 
tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before 
his nomination in divorce papers filed two years ago by his second 
wife lilla burt cummings tower was accused of marital 
misconduct 
when president bush announced towers appointment he said an fbi 
background check found nothing that would prevent tower from serving 
as defense secretary bush dismissed a lot of rumors that proved 
to be groundless 
the ranking members of the committee sen sam nunn dga and 
warner read the fbi report and any questions about towers 
personal life were reserved for executive sessions with committee 
members 
but when conservative lobbyist paul weyrich testified tuesday at 
the committees open hearing that on a number of occasions he 
had seen tower inebriated and in the company of women other than his 
wife the former senators lifestyle was pushed to the forefront 
one day later according to congressional sources the committee 
and the white house received new allegations regarding tower and 
the vote was postponed 
complicating matters is the committees concerns about an 
appearance of conflict of interest 
after his 24year tenure in the senate including a stint as 
chairman of the armed services committee tower worked as a defense 
consultant for such industry giants as rockwell and martinmarietta 
in his testimony tower said he received more than 1 million in 
consulting fees over a 2year period 
although tower said he had severed all ties with the companies 
and promised to recuse himself from any decision on an air force 
electronics system that he had lobbied for members of the committee 
still voiced concern over conflict of interest 
but what is the difference in terms of the appearance as to 
whether or not you lobbied congress for a program or whether or not 
you advanced that program through other means sen carl levin 
dmich asked tower on wednesday isnt the same connection to 
that program in existence 
senator thats a judgment call on my part and thats the only 
one in which i might have had some profile tower responded i 
would emphasize i am not legally required to do this but i have an 
abundance of caution and thats a judgment call that im making 
myself 
the committee also is conscious of its experience with melvyn 
paisley a key figure in the pentagon procurement investigation 
paisley was nominated in 1981 as assistant secretary of navy and 
later confirmed 
tower committee chairman at the time said the white house 
refused the panels request to see the fbi report on paisley nunn 
and warner said if they had known of the allegations against paisley 
they would have withheld approval until the charges had been checked 
the ranking members of the 1989 committee would like to avoid a 
similar incident 
its not over till its over nunn said thursday the 
investigation is not over until all serious allegations have been 
checked and thats the process we always follow

hundreds of supporters of a moslem party 
demonstrated saturday near the soviet embassy to protest what they 
called the red armys continued atrocities in afghanistan 
more than 500 members of the bangladesh moslem movement 
participated in the protest 
witnesses said two truckloads of policemen followed the 
protestors as they marched toward the soviet embassy the 
demonstrators were stopped a few hundred yards from the embassy but 
a sixmember delegation was allowed to enter the mission to submit a 
memorandum according to the witnesses 
party chief maulana azizur rahman said the soviets were killing 
afghan moslems with a sense of vengeance 
they have adopted a scorchedearth policy to kill moslem 
brethren and destroy afghanistan he told a meeting of the 
demonstrators the peaceloving people of the world will not 
tolerate this 
it is painful to believe that the soviets continue their 
barbarism in afghanistan even when they are withdrawing for the 
establishment of peace in the region said maulana shamsur rahman 
another party leader 
the soviets have been accused of heavily bombing afghan villages 
along the salang highway the route taken by withdrawing soviet 
soldiers to reduce attacks by moslem guerrillas stationed nearby 
soviet troops moved into afghanistan in 1979 to support the 
marxist government in a civil war against moslem rebels 
under a unsponsored accord last year the soviet troops are 
scheduled to withdraw from afghanistan by feb 15

it was inevitable that japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshita would be asked during his getacquainted call on 
the new bush administration whether he addressed the us president 
by his first name 
each new prime minister of japan generally visits washington 
early in his term to demonstrate to the japanese public that he will 
have good relations with his countrys big transpacific ally 
yasuhiro nakasone prime minister in 198287 set a new standard 
by proclaiming his vibrations with president ronald reagan so 
positive that they called each other ron and yasu american 
style 
nakasones successor takeshita met that challenge a year ago 
when he was able to announce here that he had cultivated a 
ronnobu firstname relationship with reagan 
and takeshita happily told a japanese embassy gathering here 
thursday that he and george had decided to use first names he 
added that he hopes they can have casual telephone exchanges and 
told reporters he was impressed by bushs character and intelligence 
bush addressing takeshita at the white house thursday referred 
to the late japanese emperor not as hirohito but as emperor showa 
the president was using the japanese style of referring to a former 
emperor by the name of his era 
the emperor whose funeral bush plans to attend feb 24 in tokyo 
died last month in the year showa 63 which at the time was the 
japanese calendar equivalent of 1989 the same year is now heisei 1 
using the name of the new era of emperor akihito showa means 
enlightened peace heisei peaceful achievement 
takeshita told bush the japanese people were deeply moved by his 
decision to attend the state funeral 
a former schoolteacher takeshita recalled at lunch in the state 
departments benjamin franklin room that he was not very good at 
helping japanese high school youngsters learn english but he did 
teach them through ben franklins writings why america is so 
great and how americans respect freedom independence and 
diligence 
the spirit of the american revolution as represented by 
franklin is alive and well he added 
another takeshita story was that he had stayed in blair house 
the us presidential guest residence 20 years ago as a 43yearold 
aide to the late prime minister eisaku sato when sato visited former 
president richard nixon his boss suggested he should plan to stay 
in blair house again on a future visit meaning he should aim at 
becoming prime minister it came true 
takeshita and secretary of state james baker iii reminisced about 
when they were their countries respective finance ministers at the 
1985 new york plaza hotel meeting that grappled with currency 
exchange rates 
takeshita said currency rates should be decided by god and i 
agree with that baker then us treasury secretary recalled 
jokingly one american dollar was then worth 245 japanese yen but 
takeshita and other finance ministers said it should be 215220 yen 
and two weeks later it became 215 yen baker said today one 
dollar is worth in the range of 130 yen 
by coincidence finance ministers of the same seven g7 
countries accompanied by their staffs met in washington during 
takeshitas latest visit his last day here he dropped in at their 
meeting for a brief round of handshakes with old acquaintances 
from washington takeshita started home via los angeles where he 
plans to meet his friend ron reagan monday a spokesman said it 
was in the tradition of japanese etiquette that the prime minister 
should personally wish the retired president well and thank him for 
his leadership of the western alliance 
asked why it was necessary for the prime minister to wait through 
the weekend for monday spokesman koichi haraguchi said reagans 
schedule was such that they can meet only on feb 6

when levi strauss amp co announced last week it 
would close a denim jacket plant in tennessee it gave 140 workers 
90 days paid notice 
it was a better cushion than most workers have been getting when 
plants close down 
levi strauss was following voluntary policies in place since 
1984 guaranteeing workers advance notice of pending plant closings 
notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs however is now 
the law 
plant closing legislation passed by congress last year took full 
effect saturday with business and labor still debating its impact 
and both sides predicting a flood of lawsuits 
the companies are mystified at how complicated this law really 
is said renee reymond of the national association of 
manufacturers the labor attorneys certainly are poised and ready 
for business 
supporters say the law will not hurt business and gives workers a 
time to prepare for job loss federal figures show 64 percent of the 
nearly 2 million workers idled annually receive no notice 
opponents maintain the law represents a threat to industry 
the threat is one of government fines lawsuits back pay and 
benefits expenses loss of market image and costly training and 
adjustment problems the virginia employers association declared 
recently 
thenpresident reagan allowed the measure to become law in august 
without his signature despite having earlier called it a ticking 
time bomb in the back seat of any mediumsized or larger company 
pressure from then presidential candidate george bush was said to 
have influenced reagan 
on capitol hill supporters of the concept still say it was long 
overdue 
the chicken littles have been proven wrong again said sen 
edward m kennedy dmass the sky did not fall enactment of this 
law was a triumph of reason over ideology and american workers will 
now receive the notice they deserve 
provisions of the law call for it to take effect saturday but 
some employers have started early on the theory that courts may 
eventually hold that shutdowns up to 60 days beforehand were covered 
lehigh structural steel co of allentown pa for example 
announced jan 24 that its 184 employees would be laid off after 
current orders are filled president r leslie mullen said in a 
telephone interview last week that the company was observing the 
60day notice period 
nobody can seem to tell us what the law is so were being 
safe mullen said 
a random survey of a dozen companies that have announced 
shutdowns or major layoffs in the past two months found that nearly 
all had given their workers at least 60 days notice most because 
of company policies in place before the law was passed 
for example 
pillsbury co said last week it would close a pizza plant in 
missouri and a potato flake plant in north dakota idling 334 
workers who got 60 days notice 
atampt recently announced plans to close two facilities in the 
washington dc area one with 500 workers the other 130 many 
are being offered jobs elesewhere in the company and atampt has a 
policy of giving a minimum 90day notice spokesman don griffith 
said 
mack trucks inc five weeks ago announced it was laying off 300 
workers at its macungie pa assembly plant but since has said 
only about half that many would lose their jobs 
mack spokeswoman debbie morgan said the union workers had been 
told of the initial layoff plans several months before the 
announcement 
our policy has been that were not going to wait until february 
to be in compliance she said we decided to treat it as if it 
was in effect immediately 
but about 130 workers at a microwave plant in sioux falls sd 
who lost their jobs friday got only one week notice the layoffs do 
not appear to be covered by the law even under the liberal 
interpretation of its effective date 
the law requires advance notice of plant closings by employers 
with at least 100 fulltime workers if the shutdown will cost 50 or 
more of those employees their jobs in the case of layoffs notices 
are required if the number of affected workers totals 33 percent of 
the companys employees or 500 whichever figure is lower 
in sioux falls microwave products of america began the year with 
about 650 workers at its plant and in january laid off 155 that 
left the company with about 495 workers by laying off 130 workers 
the company fell about 35 short of the 33 percent threshold 
it was reviewed company spokesman gordon taylor said when 
asked about the plant closing law he said the companys position 
was that the law did not carry weight until after saturday and also 
noted that regardless of the effective date the layoffs did not meet 
the threshold

the united states has paid late un dues 
of nearly 30 million but it remains almost 500 million behind in 
payments to the regular un budget officials said 
the united states is in the process of paying back money it 
withheld several years ago when washington complained of what it 
viewed as mismanagement and antiwestern bias at the united nations 
washingtons secondranking un ambassador herbert s okun 
delivered the 288 million dues check friday to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar un officials said he 
also gave perez de cuellar a 73 million check to help pay for un 
peacekeepers in cyprus 
the united states is assessed for onefourth of the uns 
regular budget of about 880 million annually fridays payment 
ended us dues obligations for 1988 
however un financial spokesman fred eckhart said the united 
states still owes the world body 279 million for unpaid pre1988 
dues and 216 million for 1989 dues 
in 1985 the reagan administration and congress began withholding 
substantial amounts of un dues to spur the world body into cutting 
its staff and imposing fiscal reform reagan and several congressmen 
also criticized the united nations for what they viewed as 
antiwestern bias 
in september however reagan announced he was satisfied with the 
uns progress toward reform and its role in mediating the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan and the iraniraq ceasefire he said 
the united states would begin repaying the money it owed

quietly arranged payments to the mistress 
and two aides of a former mayor have sent city hall into an uproar 
with threats that the city council may strip the mayor of some of 
his power 
mayor brian j sarault who is preparing to run for a second term 
in this old industrial city says he was just cleaning up the tray 
of garbage left by his predecessor henry s kinch 
some city council members upset that they werent consulted 
before the claims against the city were settled want to end the 
mayors power to settle claims unilaterally 
from a business standpoint it may have made sense to settle 
these said councilman john q calista but the fact remains 
the public perception is one of rumors innuendos lack of 
confidence and mistrust 
the council was never notified of settlements before either 
why are we being held to a different standard sarault replied 
weve been more open around here and im getting kicked in the 
teeth for it 
each of the problems ive been resolving theyre left over 
from the previous administration which left me a tray of garbage 
that i have to clean up said sarault who faces reelection in 
november i literally didnt have a pen in my desk when i took 
over 
the controversy in this city of 73500 began last may when the 
council discovered that kinch who declined to seek a fourth term in 
1987 had awarded himself and eight aides a total of 128000 in 
severance pay before leaving office 
the situation attracted a wider audience in early january after 
headlines about saraults agreement to pay former city clerk penny 
maynard 40000 to settle a sexdiscrimination complaint she 
accused kinch of firing her after their extramarital affair ended 
that had all the makings of a class b movie sarault said 
there was no comment from kinch he did not return a reporters 
telephone calls 
sarault and city solicitor fred joslyn said they settled the case 
because maynard stood a good chance of winning a much larger 
judgment at trial 
council members complained they were never notified about the 
settlement which was reached in october 
their complaints reached fever pitch when two other settlements 
were revealed one with joslyn himself whom kinch fired from a 
city finance job because he leaked information to thencouncilman 
sarault 
if the newspaper reporters hadnt walked in there who knows if 
it ever would have come out said councilman james doyle a 
sarault opponent 
council president raymond w houle jr said mayors have never 
made a practice of disclosing settlements 
im in my 20th year on the council houle said in all 
those years never once has any city solicitor ever reported to the 
council on any case nor has any council member ever questioned the 
city solicitor about any case 
at a recent council meeting sarault promised to keep the council 
better informed about settlements

a 30yearold masterpiece of fraternity 
prankdom the smoot marks on harvard bridge will not pass into 
history after all officials supervising the renovation of the 
bridge say 
back in october 1958 lambda chi alpha fraternity brothers at the 
massachusetts institute of technology measured the bridge by using 
the 5foot7 frame of pledge oliver reed smoot jr as a yardstick 
the bridge was found to be precisely 3644 smoots and one ear 
long 
ever since people crossing the charles river over the 
massachusetts avenue bridge have been able to measure their progress 
in 10smoot intervals painted on the sidewalk the fraternity has 
repainted the marks twice a year 
but new construction was erasing the marks smoot now 48 and the 
executive vice president of a washington dcbased trade 
association expressed optimism but others worried that the smoot 
would soon be moot as a unit of measure 
now officials at the metropolitan district commission say that 
though they normally frown on defacing public property the smoots 
will stay 
just how they will be replaced is still under discussion 
possibilities include bronze bars of official smoot length or a 
smootlong section of the original painted concrete that would be 
embedded in the new bridge fraternity members also vow to maintain 
the tradition saying they have carefully measured the smootlength 
and will repaint the new bridge 
last spring some students proposed resmooting the bridge using 
smoots son stephen r smoot a junior at mit this year but 
fraternity members demurred the son is 4 inches taller than his 
dad and besides theres no smoot like an old smoot

in a bid for unity among white 
liberals three antiapartheid political parties announced saturday 
they have merged in anticipation of national elections this year 
the formation of the new party to be known as the democratic 
party is an attempt to broaden the political base of white 
liberals who are widely seen as being in a state of disarray 
the party will be launched formally in johannesburg on april 8 
but concerted planning and action begin today the organization 
said saturday after a meeting 
the democratic party will have three leaders who presently are 
serving as the heads of the merging parties 
they are zac de beer of the progressive federal party wynand 
malan of the national democratic movement and denis worrall of the 
independent party 
the progressive federal party currently has 17 of the 178 seats 
in the white chamber of parliament while the national democratic 
movement has three and the independent party none 
the national party which has ruled south africa 40 years 
maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats while 
the extremeright conservative party is the official opposition with 
24 seats a small independent party holds the 178th seat 
south africas parliament has separate houses for whites asians 
and people of mixedrace but not for the majority 26 million blacks 
the liberal white parties draw their support almost exclusively 
from the major urban areas such as johannesburg cape town and 
durban but they have been losing some support in recent years 
the three merging parties all oppose apartheid and their 
platforms are largely similar 
they said they hope to attract whites who traditionally vote for 
the national party but who have become disillusioned by its 
startandstop race reform 
our immediate objectives are the consolidation of existing 
membership the recruitment of those many south africans who are 
looking for a new political home and the achievement of support and 
credibility across the political spectrum the democratic party 
said saturday 
in 1987 malan resigned from the national party to form the 
national democratic movement and worrall quit as south africas 
ambassador to britain to form the independent party both men cited 
disappointment with the governments slow pace of reform 
the government must call an election before march 1990 and most 
observers believe it will be scheduled sometime this year 
in neighboring zimbabwe a group of white south african lawyers 
and black officials of the african national congress ended a meeting 
saturday with a call for the formation of a multiparty democracy in 
south africa 
a communique released jointly by 30 south africabased attorneys 
and law academics and about 15 exiled anc officials said a consensus 
was reached that there is a need to create conditions so south 
africas whites and blacks have equal rights 
it was the first meeting between white law academics and leaders 
of the anc the largest guerrilla organization fighting the south 
african government

moslem insurgents surround the key 
city of jalalabad and will launch a major attack on it if the 
communist defenders do not surrender soon guerrilla leaders said 
saturday 
the leaders decided at a meeting at ghazi abad about 15 miles 
outside jalalabad to press their siege of the city so that no 
supplies get through to afghan army forces 
the insurgents said jalalabad about 90 miles east of the afghan 
capital of kabul could be the first major city to fall after the 
soviets complete their military withdrawal from the nation 
jalalabads fall would weaken the defenses of kabul and open up 
the highway to the capital the guerrillas said 
abdul zaher a senior commander of the jamiatiislami guerrilla 
group said the insurgents do not want to attack the crowded city 
for fear of injuring civilians 
but the guerrillas will have no choice if afghan troops attempt 
to hold out and an assault could come within 10 days zaher said 
the guerrilla forces are moving to take control of afghanistan 
when the soviets complete their pullout under a unmediated 
accord the red army is suposed to be out of afghanistan by feb 15 
it entered the country in 1979 to back afghan troops in their war 
with moslem guerrillas 
occasional artillery fire from government forces outside 
jalalabad could be heard saturday but guerrillas appeared in 
control of the surrounding countryside 
trucks and buses filled with heavily armed insurgents moved up 
the highways leading to the city and zaher said up to 12000 
guerrillas surrounded jalalabad 
he said there were an undetermined but much smaller number of 
afghan troops and that they were demoralized 
there are only a few communists who still want to fight 
zaher said 
but the guerrillas did not appear to have artillery or other 
heavy weapons they might need for a decisive attack jalalabad was a 
major soviet army and air base and reportedly has powerful defenses 
the guerrillas plan to blockade supply routes and then expect 
jalalabad kabul and other cities to fall quickly 
the fighting will end when the russians withdraw an islamic 
government is established and the communists surrender zaher said 
guerrilla forces have taken over and occupied all government army 
bases and outposts along the main highway connecting jalalabad to 
the pakistani border about 45 miles away 
burned out government tanks armored personnel carriers and 
trucks destroyed in fighting last month are strewn along the road 
a large explosion saturday near the guerrilla base at ghazi abad 
was caused by a longrange rocket fired by government forces 
guerrillas said there was no sign of afghan air force planes and 
the insurgents said there had been no air attacks in the area in 
recent days 
some guerrilla leaders fearing civilian casualties have said 
they do not want to launch major attacks on cities but others said 
privately that some of the seven rival moslem groups are pressing 
for quick action 
after jalalabad falls the guerrillas there would reinforce the 
insurgents at kabul zaher said 
he said the commanders of the guerrilla groups were cooperating 
in taking jalalabad and that plans were under way to run the city 
and ensure the safety of civilians and property after its fall 
guerrilla officers also said appeals were being made at mosques 
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed 
were fighting only the communists do not harm the good people 
when we take kabul do not loot or kill an islamic mullah or 
priest said in a sermon broadcast over loudspeakers saturday in one 
area held by insurgents 
some western aid officials and afghans have expressed fears of 
bloodshed reprisals and looting by vengeful guerrillas 
we dont want any bad things to happen zaher said

chinas leading dissident fang lizhi took his 
message straight to the establishment saturday by telling a party 
attended by hundreds of actors scientists and businessmen they 
should work for human rights 
some people think china doesnt need democracy but i think 
human rights is basic fang said in a strong voice until his 
speech the tea party had been nonpolitical with some guests 
volunteering songs and stories 
for human rights to be realized first of all famous people 
must take a stand he told the audience which included many local 
leaders in the arts science and trade 
fang and several other leading intellectuals were expelled from 
the communist party in 1987 after nationwide student demonstrations 
for democracy 
more recently authorities punished fang for his outspokenness by 
revoking his permission to spend six months this year at the 
colorado joint institute for laboratory astrophysics 
fang who is also known for his work as an astrophysicist has 
made many prodemocracy speech to groups of sympathizers 
particularly students 
however saturday was the first time he took his message of 
democracy and human rights to an establishment audience 
the party at a local hotel was organized by the chinese cultural 
academy and academy of sciences entrepreneurial association to 
celebrate the upcoming lunar new year both groups are staterun 
some people came up to me afterward and said they agreed with 
what i said fang said after his speech which ended to tepid 
applause but he acknowledged that not everyone in the audience was 
happy 
i will speak out more in the future to such groups fang 
said i think there will be more and more discussions among 
intellectuals because the government right now is very weak due 
to economic problems even inside the party they cant agree on 
things 
china is trying to control inflation of more than 20 percent 
shortages of energy and raw materials and growing corruption

an international fund designed to promote peace 
in northern ireland through economic revitalization has been 
overhauled following criticism that some of the money was given to 
programs such as a parachute club a congressman says 
the international fund for ireland an outgrowth of the 1985 
angloirish pact sought to ease the two decades of violence between 
catholics and protestants in britishruled northern ireland by 
improving economic conditions thereby reducing deepseeded 
resentments 
the fund run by an independent commission appointed jointly by 
britain and the republic of ireland fuels economic projects across 
northern ireland and in border counties in the republic areas where 
both tensions and unemployment run rampant 
the program got off the ground in 1986 largely due to a 
threeyear 120 million us aid package pushed personally by two 
of americas most famous irishmen ronald reagan and thenhouse 
speaker thomas p oneill jr dmass 
but concern has grown over how the agency is doling out the money 
up until this point the policy of the fund has been to spread 
the money around take what i call a scattergun approach to it 
under the theory that all areas in northern ireland and the border 
counties have been affected by the troubles and thats true said 
rep brian j donnelly dmass but the reality is some areas have 
been affected more than others 
some of the projects backed by international fund grants have 
been praised such as the creation of an industrial park for 
fledgling businessmen near the protestantcatholic divide in belfast 
but others have come under sharp criticism including the 
refurbishing of a bank which later returned the grant and aid for 
a parachute school which fund officials said was given to help 
promote tourism and lift the local economy 
more importantly according to donnelly some catholic 
nationalists who oppose british rule of northern ireland felt they 
were being excluded from the program the money he said was not 
always going to the neediest areas 
donnelly an oneill protege who has led the fight in congress 
for irish aid since the house speaker retired two years ago met 
with fund officials in ireland last month and was told the system 
recently has been revamped 
the fund now will target grants to areas most adversely affected 
by the violence and economic depression such as west belfast he 
said 
fund managers also have hired their own staff to help nationalist 
communities apply for grants 
my position has been that if mistakes have been made and i 
think some have i think the fund managers have learned from them 
and lets wait and see what the next goround of grants bring 
donnelly said in an interview last week 
donnelly chairman of the friends of ireland caucus in congress 
and other leading proponents of irish aid including sen edward m 
kennedy dmass and his nephew rep joseph p kennedy ii 
dmass are prepared to push for more money for the fund this year 
sen kennedy said he was optimistic congress would continue to 
support the fund despite the criticism 
encouraging economic development is one of the most effective 
roles that the united states can play in ending the conflict the 
senator said 
but us financing for the program has remained a tenuous 
proposition since the threeyear package ran its course last year 
levels that had averaged 40 million a year for the first three 
years were reduced to about 10 million last year donnelly and 
irish officials attribute the decrease to budget constraints within 
congress rather than a dissatisfaction with the program but others 
say criticisms of the program are expected to result in it being 
carefully scrutinized on capitol hill this year 
donnelly predicts congress will continue to fund the program but 
concedes it was never a state department favorite 
ronald reagan personally supported it but i think within the 
bureaucracy at state there has been less than enthusiasm he 
said 
the current reagan budget as the previous one proposed no money 
for the irish fund

the general in charge of the us central 
command has recommended suspension of combat pay for sailors in the 
persian gulf pentagon sources say 
the recommendation under review by the joint chiefs of staff is 
the strongest indication yet that american defense officials believe 
the truce between iran and iraq may hold 
the imminent danger bonuses previously known as hostile fire 
or combat pay are worth 110 a month and have been paid to 
servicemen working inside the persian gulf since august 1987 
precise figures were not available last week but navy officials 
estimated 4000 servicemen were receiving the payments at that 
rate the pentagon would save 440000 a month by dropping them 
the defense sources insisted however that the recommendation 
had nothing to do with budget concerns 
according to the officials who declined to be identified by 
name the recommendation was forwarded to adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff within the last month or so 
it came from gen h norman schwarzkopf who assumed command of 
the us central command last november and believes the threat has 
now receded to the point where it is difficult to justify the 
payments said one source 
and the fact that weve gone to a different regime one of 
monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers 
directly changes things too the source added 
another source said the staff that serves the nations highest 
council of military officers is hard at work reviewing the 
recommendation and its ramifications 
a final position should be presented to crowe within the next 
month but there doesnt appear to be any reason to maintain the 
payments the source said 
the central command is the organization responsible for american 
military operations in the middle east and indian ocean region as 
such it is the parent command for the joint task force middle east 
the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships 
flying the us flag in the persian gulf 
the administration of former president reagan agreed in the 
spring of 1987 to extend american military protection to 11 kuwaiti 
tankers after they switched to us registry kuwait a friend of 
the united states and a key ally of iraq had found that its ships 
had become special targets for iranian forces 
in august 1987 one month after the first usescorted kuwaiti 
tanker ran into an underwater mine the pentagon announced it would 
start making the payments to the crews of warships operating inside 
the persian gulf the strait of hormuz and a small portion of the 
gulf of oman as well as to personnel stationed in kuwait and 
bahrain 
iran and iraq agreed to a truce last august in their bloody 
8yearold war and the ceasefire has held as a result the united 
states has slowly reduced the number of warships operating in the 
region and stopped conducting closely supervised convoy runs 
instead the ships now in the region maintain what the navy calls 
a monitoring regime of keeping usflaged tankers within radar 
or radio range 
the united states now has 14 ships inside the gulf including six 
small minesweepers 
according to the pentagon sources even if schwarzkopfs 
recommendation is approved some minor exceptions might be made to 
continue the payments to the sailors on the minesweepers those men 
are still actively engaged each day in hunting for floating mines 
the officials noted 
the authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to 
the pentagon in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously 
established procedures for providing hostile fire or combat pay 
the new law specified that danger pay could be provided to 
servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or 
other physical threats even though american forces were not 
directly involved in combat

the intense publicity the fight over secret 
documents the legal dilemmas posed at the trial of oliver north 
rouse memories of a celebrated watergate trial at which us 
district judge gerhard gesell also presided 
as he began jury selection last week in the trial of the former 
white house aide the whitehaired judge with the nononsense manner 
followed procedures he used more than 14 years ago for the socalled 
plumbers trial 
a defendant in that case was an aide from an earlier white house 
john ehrlichman former chief domestic adviser to richard m nixon 
courtroom no 6 on the second floor of the us district 
courthouse was the scene of that trial as it is the north trial 
there are other similarities 
like north ehrlichman was a prodigious notetaker who contended 
his files were essential to his defense 
like north ehrlichman had starred on television as a featured 
witness at hearings watched by millions of americans 
like north ehrlichmans role in a white house scandal was the 
subject of frontpage stories that intrigued a nation for months 
before his case came to trial 
despite the torrent of publicity it took gesell just two days to 
seat a jury for the plumbers trial named for the white house unit 
established to plug leaks of classified information only three 
potential jurors were dismissed because they said they doubted they 
could render an impartial verdict 
but the north trial presents gesell with a problem he didnt face 
14 years ago ehrlichman didnt have immunity when he testified 
before the senate watergate committee north did have a guarantee 
his testimony before the congressional irancontra committee 
couldnt be used against him 
dozens of prospective jurors have been dismissed from the north 
trial because they said they heard north testify to congress that he 
committed crimes 
the search for an untainted jury in the north trial is 
exacerbated by the immunity said richard benveniste one of the 
watergate prosecutors 
this case has more problems than any ive ever seen said 
benveniste who played a leading role in the trial of former nixon 
administration officials convicted on charges stemming from the 
breakin at democratic party headquarters in the watergate office 
building 
what has struck some observers of the north trial is the search 
for people who had no curiosity about the irancontra scandal when 
it was unfolding in televised hearings 
whether they will differ from normal average jurors remains to 
be seen said sen howell heflin dala a former state supreme 
court judge who served on the irancontra committee if a man 
never saw anything of it what type of individual is he 
i wouldnt want people who lived in washington the seat of 
government on that jury who were so uninformed said bill 
moffitt a criminal defense attorney 
the magnitude of gesells problem was illustrated by the case of 
a prospective juror disqualified because she worked at a sears 
roebuck store where dozens of tv sets were turned on when north 
testified in july 1987 
the woman has not watched the testimony but her exposure to it 
was such that the judge decided to remove her from the panel of 
potential jurors 
documents are another common issue 
in both cases gesell made extraordinary appeals to the 
president but the tone of each was quite different 
in the north case gesell urged president reagan to decide 
whether massive amounts of classified information north contended 
was vital to his defense could be released 
the court has a very limited role said gesell adding that 
the constitution provides that it is up to the president not north 
or any witness to protect the prerogatives of the presidents 
office if he deems them unduly threatened 
north had sought some 40000 pages of documents 
when the president refused to release material saying these 
are things that are national security secrets conspiracy charges 
against north were dropped 
gesell never implied he thought the white house was withholding 
material simply to block prosecution of the man reagan had once 
referred to as a national hero 
the judges attitude was very different when he came into 
conflict with the nixon white house over ehrlichmans request to 
have access to his files 
when the white house said that only the defendant not his 
lawyer would be allowed into the room where the files were kept 
gesell responded scathingly 
i dont see how i can agree to a procedure that is so totally 
offensive he said 
it is offensive sir it borders on obstruction he told 
james st clair the lawyer representing nixon at various 
proceedings then underway to examine the presidents role in 
watergate

fritz wagner once lost a job with less than 
a weeks notice so he appreciated getting two months warning of 
the closing of lehigh structural steel cos fabricating plant 
that notice under a new federal law is only so much help though 
youre out of a job no matter how you look at it wagner 23 
said friday in a drizzle at the lunch truck outside the 70yearold 
factory 
lehigh structural steel president r leslie mullen citing 
inability to compete in the northeast with canadian companies 
announced jan 24 that the company would shut down most of its 
allentown operations permanently by march 24 putting about 185 of 
225 employees out of work 
a new law that took effect saturday requires companies with 100 
or more fulltime employees to give 60 days notice of plant 
closings or major layoffs under some interpretations of the law 
lehigh had to give notice even before the feb 4 effective date and 
the company provided it 
its not like you can come in one day and the doors are 
locked wagner said the notice he said means now weve got a 
chance to look for other jobs 
a union official said that notice may not be a big help for many 
of his members but said company officials have been straightforward 
theyre abiding by the plantclosing law theyve been really 
cooperative secretarytreasurer john kontier of local 548 of the 
international association of bridge structural and ornamental 
ironworkers union 
the law doesnt require that each employee receives 60 days 
notice because some employees may be laid off before a plant closes 
entirely 
they just said the plants shutting down then i got a 
threeday layoff notice said john shelby a punch operator at the 
plant for five years who was one of seven or eight workers laid off 
friday he said he thought he should have received more notice 
even with 60 days notice job counseling under way and 
retraining to start soon kontier said the law may not get his 
members quickly back to work he said they will first search in vain 
for jobs that pay near the steel plants average 10 to 11 an hour 
plus benefits including health insurance 
he wants to see more government efforts to keep companies in 
business particularly in making sure foreign companies dont get an 
unfair advantage in markets 
but those would be too late for this company gradual layoffs 
began in january and one fabricating shop closed a week ago with 
another scheduled to close this week said plant superintendent ken 
weiss who at 59 will be looking for a job himself 
by the target closing date of the entire plant in april the last 
shop will have finished the remaining steelwork for a 41story 
building in new york weiss said about 30 employees will be needed 
for the last stage 
the shutdown plans surprised wagner who began work at the plant 
last may he liked the idea of the new law but little did he know 
as politicians fussed over its passage last year that it would 
affect him 
i had no feeling at all when i started in may i thought my 
job was set said wagner who bought a house last september and 
was married in october i thought i could retire here 
my whole family worked here he said my grandfather was 
here when they opened the plant

major problems still plaguing the b1b bomber 
may reduce its expected range and payload capability says a report 
issued by congress investigative arm 
the general accounting office concluded in its report that 
although the air force has made progress in correcting certain 
deficiencies in the rockwellbuilt bomber problems in the bombers 
performance persist 
several areas critical to b1bs mission performance have not 
yet been demonstrated the report said 
the review also said the cost of the air force plane could be up 
to 400 million each if the service goes ahead with all the planned 
improvements 
those problems mean the b1b may not have the range it was 
designed to have or be able to carry all the bombs and missiles 
planned for it the report said 
the bomber is designed to carry conventional and nuclear gravity 
bombs cruise missiles and shortrange attack missiles 
specifically the report said the air force has not made progress 
in resolving problems with the b1bs defensive avionics in 
short it is now known that the defensive avionics cannot meet 
specifications without a major redesign the report said 
the defensive avionics or electronic countermeasures system was 
designed to improve the bombers probability of penetrating the 
soviet union by allowing the aircrafts crew to avoid degrade and 
deceive the soviet air defenses the report said 
the problems involve the systems radar warning receiver and 
processor function 
the report also said that data for the bomber indicate that 
reported fuel leaks have for the most part remained the same over 
the last year elimination of the fuel leaks is probably not 
possible according to the report which noted that the fuel cells 
are part of the airframe and seals and joints are subjected to 
flight stress 
the b1 killed by thenpresident carter in 1977 was resurrected 
four years later by former president reagan who said 100 of the 
swingwing planes were needed to update the nations aging force of 
nucleararmed bombers 
reagan ordered 100 of the planes at a cost of 205 billion 
three have crashed leaving the service with 97 b1bs the air force 
has already received all the b1s it intends to buy and is now 
proceeding with plans to buy the radarevading b2 stealth bomber

the number soviets have wondered about for more 
than 30 years appeared in print saturday more than 40 million 
arrested killed or otherwise repressed in the bloody political 
terror of josef stalin 
in the most detailed account of stalins victims reported in the 
soviet press the weekly tabloid arguments and facts said 15 million 
people died because of the dictator who took power in 1924 
its article came as a daily newspaper reported bulletfractured 
skulls were found in what may be a mass grave of stalins victims 
although figures on stalins victims have been known to 
westerners soviets have not seen them published officially almost 
every soviet living today had relatives who suffered under stalin 
and since his death in 1953 they have hoped to put a number on the 
human toll 
historian roy medvedev gave the 40 million figure to arguments 
and facts and said it included all victims of stalinism based on 
his own calculations 
the toll was much higher than previous vague estimates 
in 1987 soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said many thousands 
of people were subjected to wholesale repressive measures 
under stalin 
western historians believe 20 million soviets died under stalin 
the same number of soviets were killed in world war ii 
medvedev said 6 million to 7 million people were killed in an 
early 1930s famine 5 million to 7 million were executed or died in 
labor camps after mass arrests in the late 1930s and 1 million died 
during forced relocations of ethnic minorities during world war ii 
also saturday the daily sovietskaya rossiya reported 
construction workers discovered a mass grave jan 19 in gornoaltai 
1900 miles southeast of moscow human remains they found include 50 
skulls of men 30 to 50 years old who were shot through the temple or 
back of the head it said 
before world war ii a greenhouse and vegetable storage facility 
were on the site next to a camp for political prisoners run by the 
dreaded nkvd secret police the newspaper said investigating 
prosecutor i gushchina told the newspaper one thing is clear a 
tragedy happened here 
sovietskaya rossiya likened the killing field to one found last 
year in kuropaty in the byelorussian republic authorities said 
that field is a mass graveyard for at least 30000 people killed 
from 19371941 apparently for political reasons 
medvedev a dissident historian who recently has received 
official backing gave arguments and facts this breakdown for 
stalins victims 
from 19271929 about 1 million soviets were jailed or in exile 
most were former members of political opposition groups and figures 
in soviet founder vladimir i lenins new economic policy 
from 19301932 911 million peasants were deported to siberia 
and other remote regions or fled to cities when stalin forced 
collectivization of soviet agriculture at least 1 million more 
peasants were deported in 1933 
from 19321933 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine 
blamed on stalins policies 
about 15 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for 
violating extremely cruel laws on state property 
in 1935 1 million former officials merchants and nobelmen were 
branded class strangers and deported from leningrad moscow and 
other cities 
five million to 7 million people were arrested in the great 
terror of 193738 one million of them were sentenced to death 
the rest were sent to labor camps where most died 
mass repressions struck 1 million people from 19391941 in the 
baltic republics and western sections of the ukraine and byelorussia 
during world war ii up to 2 million ethnic germans were 
deported about 3 million moslems were forced to move a million of 
those deported died 
after 1940 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for 
reporting late to work a crime punishable by up to five years in a 
labor camp 
from 10 million to 12 million soviets were deprived of certain 
rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the nazis 
occupied during the war 
between 1 million and 15 million people were arrested 194653 
for political reasons 
medvedev was expelled from the communist party in 1969 and his 
major works on stalins repressions and other oncetaboo topics were 
banned from publication under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness he is back in favor

more than 200 soviet moslems marched from a mosque 
through the uzbek capital of tashkent to press the government to 
take up their religious demands tass reported saturday 
the official news agency said the demonstrators from the central 
asian republics of uzbekistan kazakhstan and tadzhikistan demanded

demonstrators and told them their demands should be addressed by the 
clergy not the government regional religious leaders were to 
discuss the demands monday tass said 
in a country whose government espouses atheism the population 
includes an estimated 45 million to 50 million moslems the largest 
minority after ethnic russians 
the moslems are increasing in number much more rapidly than 
ethnic russians who hold the reins of political power based on 
current trends the moslem population will rise to 100 million by 
the year 2000 meaning one in every three soviets will be moslem 
the kremlin has expressed concern that islamic fundamentalism 
across the border in afghanistan and iran could spread to soviet 
moslems

vice president dan quayle is back home from his 
first foray abroad for the bush administration apparently with 
neither great gaffes nor startling accomplishments to show for his 
largely symbolic mission to latin america 
quayle meeting in venezuela with world leaders at a presidential 
inauguration signaled bush administration sensitivity to latin 
america and then went to el salvador where he delivered a stern 
human rights message to the usbacked government 
the latins had waited with great curiosity to size up the new 
vice president while his own countrymen watched to see how he would 
handle his first major assignment from president bush 
foreign service officials nervously hoped he would not live down 
to campaign criticisms that he was not up to the job of vice 
president 
by many accounts from both us and foreign officials the 
diplomatic greenhorn acquitted himself well on the international 
stage even displaying a certain verve for his mission 
in venezuela where his job was mostly to spread goodwill 
quayles affable political style was a hit with latin leaders who 
place great store in personalismo one member of the us 
delegation said 
i was skeptical but im impressed said michael skol a state 
department latin america specialist who traveled with quayle after 
one day of meetings skol said hes making the right political 
moves the right body language hes not saying too much when he 
shouldnt say too much 
in el salvador a harder line was called for as quayle went 
before some 20 military officers who lead the nations 56000member 
armed forces he delivered what was described by us officials as 
an emphatic admonition on the need for progress in curbing human 
rights abuses 
quayle took that same message to the countrys political and 
business leaders leaving a clear message that future us aid will 
be linked to the countrys success on human rights 
in caracas quayle was a less dominant figure in the company of 
some 20 heads of state and countless seasoned diplomats at the 
inauguration of president carlos andres perez 
aside from perez the center stage figure was the 
largerthanlife fidel castro of cuba he was ubiquitous on 
television screens and he sat not far from quayle at the 
inauguration the two did not speak to each other 
quayles hectic schedule during two days in caracas included 
bilateral meetings with 10 heads of state and less formal meetings 
with about the same number 
while the former senators diplomatic inexperience did not go 
unnoticed that was not necessarily a negative factor in these 
getacquainted sessions according to those familiar with them 
the vice president left behind some extremely positive 
feelings he was well informed but at the same time he elicited the 
opinions of the leaders he met with in a very sincere way said 
otto reich the us ambassador to venezuela 
hes getting experience here said francisco aguilar urbina a 
harvardeducated adviser to costa rica president oscar arias 
he said the latins had been unsure what to expect having heard 
mostly negative news reports about quayle 
urbina said quayle while not a particularly imposing figure was 
projecting a positive image 
they liked the fact that he went out of his way broke with 
protocol and just did things with regular people said a member of 
the us delegation 
quayle on two occasions mingled with ordinary brazilians once 
stopping his motorcade on the way from the airport to buy fruit at a 
local market 
he also visited a popular plaza where he worked a crowd campaign 
style 
a few hundred people quickly gathered and quayle stepped up to a 
statue of regional hero simon bolivar and pleased the crowd by 
declaring bolivar a hero of democracy in the united states as well 
in his energetic upbeat style quayle made friendly small talk 
to get his bilateral meetings with heads of state underway 
as photographers recorded the start of their meeting he talked 
with costa ricas arias about mutual acquaintances in the us 
senate with perus president alan garcia he joked about his 
upcoming 42nd birthday 
quayle was seen as sensible by president jose sarney of 
brazil said sarneys spokesman carlos henrique de almeida he 
indicated the brazilians also see quayle as a new guy on the job who 
has a lot to learn 
they were testing each other sarney was very clear and open 
without the customary diplomatic verbiage and quayle was the same 
way de almeida said 
guatemalas president vinicio cerezo subtly noted quayles 
newcomer status saying this was a really good opportunity for you 
to come here and meet many leaders from latin countries for you 
especially

a man accused of falsifying his resume to 
gain government and police jobs in several states pleaded no contest 
to a theft charge and agreed to find another line of work 
carl keyser jr 34 was fired from the city administrators job 
in the tiny southeastern alaska village of kake in december one day 
after he was arrested on a kentucky fugitive warrant 
he was charged in kake with felony firstdegree theft for using a 
bogus resume to get hired and obtain 28000 worth of salary 
benefits and expenses he entered his nocontest plea friday but it 
was not immediately approved by a judge during a hearing held via 
telephone superior court judge thomas schultz in ketchikan took the 
agreement under advisement and said he would wait for a probation 
report on keyser before deciding whether to accept it 
keyser who had been in jail in nearby petersburg since his 
arrest remains wanted in pikeville ky on another theft charge 
stemming from his sixday stint as pikevilles city manager last 
august 
in a plea agreement to settle the kake charge keyser agreed to a 
jail term of up to 90 days with credit for time already served 
which is about half of that the agreement requires keyser to pay 
restitution for the money he received during the 2 months he was on 
the job and would place keyser on probation for seven years 
the maximum penalties for firstdegree theft are 10 years in 
prison and a 100000 fine 
keyser also agreed not to accept any type of government 
employment to sign a letter of apology to the town and to remain 
in petersburg while awaiting sentencing 
schultz reduced bail on both theft charges to 2500 each and 
keyser posted bail after fridays hearing 
residents in kake a timber and fishing town about 75 miles south 
of juneau on kupreanof island became suspicious of keyser shortly 
after he took the 44000ayear job they accused him of 
overspending and criticized him for refusing to release his resume 
for public inspection 
a police records check in december revealed the outstanding 
kentucky warrant 
interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states 
revealed that at least 19 of keysers jobs since 1980 have been with 
city or county governments documents and the interviews also showed 
keyser used false information while obtaining at least 11 jobs 
kake officials have said they hired him because of an impressive 
resume and people who gave glowing references but they now believe 
the resume and the references who were contacted by telephone were 
fraudulent 
assistant district attorney steven west in ketchikan said friday 
that pikeville officials probably would dismiss their charge against 
keyser 
last month pikeville city commissioners asked the prosecutor 
there to drop the charge but the prosecutor said at the time that 
he wanted to continue to press the case 
in pikeville keyser is accused of theft by deception for failure 
to reimburse the city for 697 in travel expenses 
keyser declined to comment on the kake case after the hearing he 
said he planned to do community and church volunteer work while 
awaiting sentencing 
in an interview in december he maintained his innocence and said 
the charges were the result of a conspiracy in pikeville keyser 
accused the news media and officials of seeking to make an example 
of him

senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen 
is asking the treasury department to investigate the possibility of 
swapping latin american debts for money that would be used to clean 
up pollution in the western hemisphere 
bentsen dtexas said saturday he is particularly interested in 
debtfornature swaps that would involve mexican debt and 
cleaning up pollution along the usmexico border including the 
dumping of raw sewage into rio grande 
on friday bentsen asked treasury secretary nicholas brady for an 
accounting of the mexican debt situation before congress assesses 
his plan 
latin american debtors have become increasingly interested in 
reducing their foreign debt in unconventional ways bentsen said 
citing debtfornature swaps in costa rica equador and bolivia 
in which small quantities of their foreign debt have been converted 
to local currencies for investment in environmental projects 
in one case an international consortium of environmental groups 
purchased 56 million of costa rican debt from a bank in the united 
states for about 700000 and converted it to a local currency bond 
worth 56 million bentsen said interest on that bond will be 
devoted exclusively to environmental investments to protect clean 
air and water and promote conservation in costa rica 
both mexico and the united states would benefit if 
environmental investments are stepped up along the border in 
mexico bentsen told brady citing the sharp deterioration of the 
water in the rio grande and air pollution on the border 
bentsen said much of the 400 billion in latin american debt will 
never be paid back but if it could be bought at a deep discount 
and then traded at full value in local currency to solve such 
problems as sewage dumping and the chopping down of tropical rain 
forests wed be far ahead 
the dumping of raw sewage into the rio grande is creating serious 
health threats to citizens on both sides of the border bentsen 
said noting that 20 million gallons of raw sewage are dumped into 
the river every day at nuevo laredo mexico 
the enormous debt in latin american nations has slowed their 
growth and crimped foreign exchange reserves hurting united 
states exporters bentsen said 
the sale of our manufactured exports to the 20 latin american 
republics fell 10 percent between 1980 and 1987 he wrote 
many worldclass united states industrial firms like caterpiller

cabinet nominee louis sullivan said saturday he 
would take an unpaid leave of absence from his medical school while 
serving as health and human services secretary to avoid any 
appearance of a conflict of interest 
sullivan president of the morehouse school of medicine in 
atlanta had wanted to maintain his ties to the school with a paid 
leave but he withdrew the request after the white house raised 
questions about the arrangement 
i intend to preclude even the remotest possibility of any 
appearance that my actions as secretary might be influenced due to 
any outside income sullivan said in a statement released by the 
white house 
sullivan said he has asked the medical schools executive 
committee to grant him an unpaid leave of absence while he serves in 
the bush administration 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said an unpaid leave would 
mean the school would suspend any salary payments while he served 
as secretary of hhs 
sullivan earns about 170000 a year from morehouse it was 
learned 
the arrangement is designed to avoid any conflict of interest 
that could arise because morehouse gets federal funds for its 
programs in fiscal 1988 the school received 58 million from hhs 
federal ethics officials indicated last week that sullivan would 
be able to receive payments from the school while serving at hhs 
don campbell deputy director of the office of government ethics 
said ethics officials had met with sullivan and his lawyers and 
all the problems have been worked out 
a government source familiar with sullivans situation said the 
nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain 
payments for a leave of absence based on days of service 
morehouse like many academic institutions gives its faculty 
paid sabbatical leaves based on years of service sullivan was 
allowed a paid sabbatical after 13 years of uninterupted service 
the white house said 
the new york times in saturdays editions quoted a friend of 
sullivans as saying the nominee had accrued about 300000 worth of 
sabbatical leave 
but sullivan said in his statement president bush has called 
on all of those in his cabinet to set the very highest ethical 
standards and to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts 
of interest i agree emphatically with the president 
sullivans decision resolves one of the issues that has held up 
his confirmation hearings in the senate 
the senate finance committee last week postponed sullivans 
confirmation hearings indefinitely at the request of the white house 
the panel is awaiting completion of an fbi background check that 
is focusing in part on sullivans ties to reginald eaves a 
suspended fulton county ga commissioner who has been convicted of 
extortion 
in a matter unrelated to the extortion case eaves was paid more 
than 34000 over four years as a lecturer at morehouse while using 
his seat on the commission to promote matters beneficial to the 
school he reportedly gave two lectures at morehouse over the four 
years 
the eaves controversy however does not appear to threaten 
sullivans confirmation according to lawmakers

nearly a quarter of the north american 
population of trumpeter swans is in danger of starvation at their 
winter feeding grounds in eastern idaho us fish and wildlife 
service officials say 
service biologist signe satherblair blames the 1988 drought and 
current arctic cold for preventing the birds from getting their 
normal food they are not on the endangered species list but they 
are on idahos sensitive species list 
the swans feed on aquatic plants and low water in henrys fork 
of the snake river near island park has been frozen over the 
roughly 500 birds are unable to break through the ice to reach their 
food 
elsewhere in idaho the cold and accompanying high wind has 
interfered with state efforts to transplant bighorn sheep by 
helicopter 
in an attempt to rescue the swans fish and wildlife was granted 
1600 acrefeet of water from irrigators in the snake river water 
district and also received 8000 from the nature conservancy to 
purchase an additional 3200 acrefeet of water 
however wildlife biologist ruth gail who has studied the swans 
for the idaho fish and game department said friday that the 
increased water flow had not broken up the ice on the river 
there is no way to measure what condition they are in now 
ms gail said of the swans but its pretty grim theyve had 
decreased food supplies for 2 months already this winter 
ms gail said other swans as many as 800 that water on lakes 
and rivers around yellowstone national park may be in worse shape 
than the flock at henrys fork 
in all likelihood we could lose a fair number of those 
birds she said thats why it is so important to protect the 
swans on the henrys fork 
the cold and high wind grounded the idaho department of fish and 
games plans to transplant bighorn sheep from the morgan creek 
drainage north of challis in central idaho to the selway river 
drainage 
officials first attempted to capture sheep on tuesday but we 
were blown out of the sky lloyd oldenburg the departments big 
game supervisor said friday he said it would be rescheduled for 
the week of feb 12 
he said two sheep were caught the first day but had to be 
released once high winds kicked up and made flying difficult wind 
and poor visibility also kept helicopters on the ground wednesday 
on thursday temperatures near zero 10 mph wind and the 
additional wind chill created by flying combined to create 
temperatures estimated by oldenburg at 100 degrees below zero 
in addition he said the net gun used to trap sheep froze and 
would not fire and the helicopter had no doors to protect the crew 
from the cold 
the lone ewe caught thursday was released but not before nasal 
blood and fecal samples were taken and a radio collar was placed on 
her 
oldennburg said one of the sheep caught tuesday a 4yearold 
ram appeared weak and in poor health but he attributed that to two 
years of drought and winter hardships rather than pneumonia the 
others appeared healthy he said

a group of carmelite nuns protesting 
what they call the liberalization of their order began the fifth 
month barricaded in their monasterys infirmary saturday with no 
apparent sign of coming out 
betty sutton a friend who acts as their spokeswoman says the 
five women are resigned to wait until the vatican rules on their 
dispute with monastery officials 
theyre patient and theyre awaiting an answer and theyre very 
hopeful she said in a telephone interview 
tim manning a spokesman for the roman catholic diocese of 
paterson said the nuns have given no sign of ending their protest 
they are objecting to the introduction of such things as 
television and candy into the monestery and want it returned to the 
carmelites traditionally austere lifestyle they also seek 
permission to remain at the monestery 
no word has come from the vatican and there is no way of knowing 
when a decision can be expected manning said 
obviously it must have been a very trying time for all the 
nuns those inside the infirmary and in the monastery he said 
there are eight other nuns at the monastery of the most blessed 
virgin mary of mount carmel 
the nuns locked themselves in the infirmary oct 4 saying they 
were afraid officials wanted to expel them from the monastery for 
their dissident views 
since the protest began vows of one of the five nuns sister 
bernadette have expired and those of another sister john of the 
cross expire feb 19 manning said those two were under temporary 
fiveyear vows while the other threes vows have become permanent 
the nuns refuse to recognize the expiration dates saying 
everything remains status quo while their case is before the vatican 
manning said the monastery will take no action against the two 
nuns whose vows have expired or are expiring 
the hope is that it will soon be resolved he said

the most exhaustive mafia study ever done by the 
italian government was released saturday 13 years after it was 
completed news reports said 
the 3852page study lists the names of 2405 people and 345 
organizations or businesses collected by a special parliamentary 
commission set up in 1962 to probe the mafia according to the ansa 
news agency and staterun television 
the names range from wellknown italian politicians to such 
fabled mafiosi as lucky luciano the italianamerican gangster the 
ansa report said 
the files published today dont refer to people suspected of 
belonging to the mafia or having links with it but instead to every 
person insinuated in a situation of this mafia type 
said the introduction written by sen gerardo chiaromonte according 
to ansa 
chiaromonte is head of the current parliamentary antimafia 
commission 
sources for the names included police newspaper reports 
witnesses who testified before the commission and anonymous tips 
the reports release had been expected since chiaromontes 
commission voted in november and again in december to make it public 
no one answered the telephone in chiaromontes office saturday 
and the senate press office was closed 
it was not clear whether the report would have much effect both 
because of its age and the varying credibility of the sources 
chiaromonte said the commission decided to make the list public 
in order to dispel any suspicion that a public organism wants to 
hide in all or in part news regarding the involvement of 
politicians in mafia affairs 
links between politicians and the mafia have been a hot topic 
since the socalled maxitrial ended in december 1987 with 338 
people found guilty 
the 30member parliamentary commission issued statements listing 
the names of some suspected mafia leaders but the final report did 
not give names the part made public called for trying suspected 
organized crime figures on tax charges and increasing surveillance 
of them 
leftist members of the commission in a minority had charged 
that powder keg revelations were being covered up but other 
members of the commission said unsubstantiated charges should not be 
published 
the report released saturday focuses on mafia activity from 1963 
to the early 1970s 
it reportedly includes names of local and national politicians 
ranging from communists to members of the farright italian 
socialist movement 
among those denounced to the commission were several politicians 
judges and writers who had taken strong stands against the mafia 
suggesting that some people tried to use the investigation to damage 
their enemies 
one senator who accused several politicians of having mafia ties 
was himself later charged by an anonymous source with having links 
to the mafia

making false statements kevin sharkey the federal prosecutor in 
the case told the boston globe in a report published saturday 
on each count ross faces up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
ross attorney anthony r pelusi jr confirmed to the newspaper 
that ross would plead guilty pelusi did not return a telephone

from the home of an alleged cocaine dealer

police arrested a rebel leader at a hotel and 
dealt a strong blow to perus procuban guerrilla movement 
authorities said saturday 
police said victor polay 37 was seized with a female companion 
late friday in huancayo 140 miles east of lima 
polay a former college friend of president alan garcia is 
considered one of the leaders of the tupac amaru revolutionary 
movement which favors cubastyled marxism the group began armed 
actions against the government in 1984 
the seizure of polay known as commander rolando is the most 
important guerrilla arrest since osman morote the reputed no 2 
leader of the maoist shining path guerrilla band was captured in 
june said police 
they spoke on condition of anonymity citing security reasons 
the tupac amaru group is smaller and considered much less violent 
than the shining path whose nineyear insurgency has claimed more 
than 12000 lives the two groups do not have ties 
dozens of police surrounded the hotel where polay was staying and 
arrested him without a struggle police refused to say how they knew 
he was at the hotel 
the lima newspaper expreso said polay shouted death to 
informers as he was led away 
the tupac amaru guerrillas startled peru in november 1987 when 
polay led 100 wellarmed rebels in a monthlong series of raids near 
tarapoto a jungle city 435 miles northeast of lima 
the military quickly dispersed the rebel column the government 
never fully disclosed details of the clashes but analysts said the 
rebel band was seriously hurt its armed actions since have been 
rare 
in the 1960s polay was a student leader of the governing 
centerleft aprista party he reportedly studied with garcia in 
europe in the early 1970s

iranian authorities have carried out summary 
executions arbitrary arrests and torture on a troubling scale 
despite the ceasefire in the war with iraq a new un report says 
the study for the un human rights commission said a wave of 
executions in 1988 especially after an invasion by antigovernment 
forces based in iraq halted a twoyear decrease in the number of 
executions it said the scale of recent abuse in iran justifies 
international concern

alleged to have been executed between late july and middecember 
but it was alleged that there were in all probability several 
thousand victims said the report 
the unmediated ceasefire in the eightyear war took effect 
aug 20 
arrests are apparently so numerous that some high officials 
have requested the authorities to act with more moderation said 
the report it said detention of relatives of people accused of 
political crimes appears to be a common practice 
the study also pointed to continuing reports of illtreatment and 
torture of prisoners investigation trial and serving of sentence 
are reportedly effected under duress hardships and different kinds 
of torture it said

house democrats tried with 
little success on saturday to temporarily put aside the firestorm 
over a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise and focus instead 
on broader national issues 
while an inspirational speech by new york gov mario cuomo and 
the pampering and recreation of the greenbrier resort helped soothe 
frayed nerves the lawmakers remained anxious for a way to put the 
pay issue permanently behind them 
former president reagans proposal to raise federal pay for 
members of congress federal judges and top executive branch 
employees takes effect wednesday unless both the house and senate 
vote to kill it the senate has already done so making house 
democrats the center of the controversy because speaker jim wright 
dtexas plans to let it take effect 
wright said he would hold a subsequent vote to reduce the raise 
to 30 percent but rankandfile democrats continued to voice 
skepticism that such a plan would quell public outcry 
rep steny hoyer dmd a member of the democratic leadership 
supportings wrights approach acknowledged that many house members 
were willing to give up any pay raise even though they believed they 
needed to earn more than the current salary of 89500 
i think theyre frustrated with trying to answer to an angry 
public and an insatiable press said hoyer at some point 
people get tired of being looked upon as thieves and greedy folks i 
think everybodys getting a little testy like me 
rep pat williams dmont offered one of the most graphic 
descriptions yet of the controversy its like living with a 
political gas leak only its not odorless or colorless he said 
and the voters are going to strike the match 
many of the approximately 150 democrats spent saturday morning 
listening to panel discussions on issues facing the country 
including the deficit and social economic inequities then cuomo 
delivering the keynote speech at a luncheon told them that 
democrats should take heart because president bushs statements that 
more needed to be done for the homeless and needy was an embracing 
of democratic values and a giant step forward to the truth and 
progress 
he has clearly said that the democrats were right by 
candidly rejecting his predecessors narrow view of life in 
america cuomo said if bush fails to push forward his kinder 
and gentler programs he will have earned himself some cheap 
grace by reciting some democratic poetry he said 
in such an event he said democrats should push their agenda 
even if that eventually means seeking to raise taxes to cover the 
cost 
when you present him with the solutions would it not be 
difficult for the president then to say no he asked 
cuomo made no direct mention of the pay raise controversy but 
kidded the lawmakers that their annual retreat to west virginia to 
get away from daily pressures was a great idea when it works 
several dozen news people were watching the conference but the 
resort otherwise coddled and protected the democrats 
a small band of antipayraise demonstrators was kept outside the 
front gates seen only by those lawmakers who cruised by in resort 
limousines on their way to the skeet and trapshooting range the 
hotel switchboard screened callers asking whether they were calling 
about the pay raise 
wright at the center of the controversy kept mostly to himself 
except for introducing cuomo at the luncheon protected by staff he 
didnt talk to reporters about the pay raise but praised cuomos 
speech as a challenge to bush who addresses a joint meeting of 
congress thursday night 
well now see whether its words or whether its deeds he 
said words are fine they set a good tone but now its time for 
deeds 
rep gary ackerman dny who is cuomos congressman praised 
the speech as what we came to hear 
hes the only constituent ive seen in two weeks who didnt ask 
about the pay raise he said

ben and jerry who made their mark selling 
premium vermontmade ice cream are trying their hand at marketing 
worldwide peace in hopes it will be as popular someday as their new 
york super fudge crunch 
ben cohen and jerry greenfield cofounders of ben amp jerrys 
homemade inc are in the seventh month of their 1 percent for 
peace campaign an effort to have 1 percent of the us military 
budget devoted to promoting peace 
certainly taking 1 percent of the military budget is not going 
to leave us open to attack cohen said its just saying lets 
redirect a small portion of it and i think people can understand 
that 
one percent of the military budget amounts to 3 billion cohen 
said 
if you put 3 billion in the bank the interest alone would be 
750000 a day he said 
the icecream makers would like to see the money spent on things 
like exchanges between the united states and the soviet union 
conversion of weapons factories to power plants or a multinational 
youth corps for problems like homelessness and hunger 
they are financing the lobbying effort with 1 percent of the 
profits from the peace pop a chocolatecovered ice cream bar on a 
stick that sells for 175 one percent of the profits comes to 
about 50000 a year 
they expect it will take five to 10 years for the idea to reach 
the people who can make it work 
i think of this as a product the same as weve been in the 
business of marketing ice cream so the beginnings fairly slow 
cohen said were at the very beginning and actually im 
incredibly excited at how fast its going 
ben amp jerrys which generates annual sales of 32 million began 
11 years ago in a renovated burlington gas station the 1 percent 
for peace project began just as inauspiciously when cohen discussed 
the concept with a friend of a friend in ithaca ny 
an office was set up in ithaca at the ben amp jerrys foundation 
a company group that distributes about 250000 a year to charitable 
causes 
the push for peace was officially launched in new york city in 
august and again at the newport ri folk festival 
while robert cray and taj mahal entertained the crowd cohen and 
greenfield manned a booth and collected signatures on petitions 
sold tshirts with the 1 percent logo and promoted the concept to 
passersby 
so far the campaign has attracted interest from roughly 40 
businesses they include a restaurant in ithaca a childrens 
musical recording company in california and a construction company 
in woodstock ny said neil schwartzbach executive director of 
the 1 percent organization 
the idea here is to try to get as many businesses as possible 
to use this logo cohen said 
the organizations goal for 1989 is to interest another 320 
companies in the concept they in turn will spread the word an 
estimated 1615 million times either through brochures bumper 
stickers logos on their products or similar means 
i dont believe that the world cannot change cohen said 
and if the world is going to change we have to take positive steps 
we as citizens to change it

rightwing radicals claim they are 
winning the allegiance of more mainstream germans after capturing 11 
seats in the west berlin legislature 
the berlin elections show that a psychological barrier has been 
removed said michael kuehnen the leader of a nazioriented group 
and a prominent rightwing extremist 
west germany has been involved in some deep soulsearching ever 
since jan 29 when the farright republican party won 11 seats in 
the 138seat legislature and 75 percent of the vote 
with their showing the republicans also won the right to send 
two representatives to the federal bundestag next year west berlin 
is considered a state under the west german system but its 
representatives to the national parliament have limited powers 
though a sweeping rightist trend seems virtually impossible in 
modern west germany a jewish leader called the elections a 
warning shot 
i fear the republicans have hit upon a mood thats not just in 
west berlin said frankfurt jewish community spokesman michel 
friedman 
he said the strong showing by the republican party will make the 
extreme right socially acceptable to many west germans 
the republicans campaigned on a platform that included a call to

the government facing allegations it 
allowed exports that helped libya and iraq develop poison gas said 
saturday it wants this weeks geneva conference on disarmament to 
ban chemical weapons 
the 40nation conference begins tuesday in geneva 
the federal government hopes that the geneva negotiations lead 
to a worldwide comprehensive and unqualified ban on the development 
and production possession acquisition proliferation and use of 
chemical weapons said government spokesman friedhelm ost 
the meetings secretarygeneral milan komatina told reporters 
in geneva that libya and syria have asked to join in the conference 
and that he does not expect objections from the participants 
washington says libya has built a chemical weapons plant in the 
desert city of rabta with the help of west german firms 
komatina a yugoslav spoke friday at end of a twoweek 
closeddoor session of the disarmament conferences special working 
group that is preparing a treaty that would ban chemical weapons 
he said there is a positive climate for the talks because of 
frances decision to drop its proposal that each country be allowed 
to hold limited security stocks during the 10year treaty period 
when chemical weapons should be destroyed 
ost said west germany sought a chemical weapons ban since 1954 
and nearly three years ago asked the united states to remove its 
chemical weapons from the country no later than 1992 
but ost made no mention in his statement of an escalating 
controversy over west german firms shipments of equipment to iraq 
and libya that were apparently used to produce chemical weapons 
on friday the degussa ag company of frankfurt confirmed a report 
that german customs officials halted a libyabound shipment of its 
chemicals to determine if they could be used to produce explosives 
or poison gas 
the nordsee zeitung newspaper in the port city of bremerhaven 
reported friday that customs officials refused to authorize loading 
of 17 containers of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for 
shipment by the degussa company to libya the crystalline compound 
is used in the vulcanization of rubber in medicine explosives and 
other products 
the company also acknowledged it sent chemicals to libya since 
1983 for use in making fertilizer and not explosives or poison gas 
investigations are under way into the export activities of a 
number of west german companies primarily imhausenchemie of lahr 
but the probes have to date produced no charges or arrests in west 
germany

engine factory and stamping operation but local officials persuaded 
it to donate some buildings

factory space in four buildings in addition some land near a 
municipal golf course will be deeded to the city of 80000 
residents he said

the fourth game in the world chess 
championship candidates quarterfinal between hollands jan timman 
and hungarys lajos portisch was adjourned after 62 moves saturday 
the bishops and pawns left on the board after six hours of play 
might still hide some surprises but experts felt a draw would be the 
most likely outcome 
dutch grandmaster john van der wiel who visited the tournament 
hall in the basement of an antwerp luxury hotel to see his 
countryman in action even said he expected the two opponents would 
sign the draw without further play 
of course timman will analyze the position thoroughly with his 
seconds overnight but i for one dont see how he could possibly 
avoid splitting the point with portisch in this one van der wiel 
said 
a draw would be a serious setback for the 37yearold timman who 
played white in saturdays game and desperately needed a victory to 
catch up with his 51yearold hungarian opponent 
portisch won the third encounter the day before and was leading 
21 with only two more games to go in the sixgame match one of a 
series of knockout contests to select a challenger who will play 
world champion gary kasparov for his title in 1990 
timman started the game well following a line from the ruy lopez 
to build up a better position and concentrating his forces on the 
queenside where he seemed set to launch a strong offensive 
at the decisive moment however he hesitated playing a number 
of careful moves when he might have pressed his advantage and start 
an allout offensive 
portisch reacted immediately exchanging queens and after some 
tactical complications getting the rooks off the board as well 
even timmans west german second vlastimil hort admitted the 
hungarian was playing a fine defending game at that stage 
portisch kept a cool head he said jans attack seemed 
decisive but maybe portisch had calculated farther and decided he 
could take the risk 
jan was probably right in not going all out in fact i think 
its a miracle the way he is playing especially after the defeat he 
suffered yesterday most players would not even try they would 
settle for a draw the day after they lost a game hort said 
public attention for the duel was overwhelming at first with 
about one hundred spectators watching in the silence of the 
tournament hall while another two hundred thronged the auditorium 
next door where two belgian masters richard meulders and luc 
winants were commenting on the game meulders in flemish and 
winants in french 
but after portisch had succeeded in maintaining the balance and 
the game developed into an ever more drawish position most people 
went home until only a handful were left to see portisch seal his 
move at the 62nd 
the resumption is to be played on sunday with the fifth game 
following on monday

british and french diplomats left kabul 
on saturday after their nations closed their embassies joining an 
exodus of western countries as the last soviet soldiers pull out of 
afghanistan 
britains 19 embassy staff members and the four french embassy 
workers flew aboard a chartered plane to new delhi and arrived there 
saturday evening their departure from kabul was delayed a day 
because of a storm 
a convoy of about 40 soviet military vehicles rolled out of the 
snowy capital about 3 am headed toward the border 
on friday a huge column of tanks armored personnel carriers and 
trucks slipped out under cover of darkness and headed up the salang 
highway the only route between kabul and the soviet border 
the deputy foreign minister of the soviet union yuli vorontsov 
was quoted as saying the red army will be out of the country well 
ahead of the feb 15 deadline set by a unmediated accord 
within four days there will be no soviet forces in 
afghanistan vorontsov was quoted as saying by irans official 
tehran radio during a visit to iran 
the radio said vorontsov would discuss with iranian officials and 
afghan resistance leaders the future of afghanistan after the 
soviets leave 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived in pakistan 
on the same mission early sunday and was expected to propose a 
political settlement 
the soviet leadership has decided to consult with the 
government of pakistan on how best to contribute to restoring peace 
and tranquility in afghanistan shevardnadze told reporters before 
a scheduled day of talks with pakistani officials who support the 
guerrillas 
but he added problems have been piling up there are quite a 
few of them 
pakistani defense minister ghulam sarwar cheema said saturday in 
the saudi capital of riyadh that his government has formed a 
committee to oversee resettlement of the 3 million afghan refugees 
living in pakistan 
the process of shifting afghan refugees from pakistan to their 
homeland will be handled smoothly after complete evacuation of the 
soviet forces from afghanistan said cheema on a state visit to 
saudi arabia 
guerrilla leaders meanwhile warned they might launch a major 
attack on the strategic city of jalalabad about 90 miles east of 
kabul 
abdul zaher a senior commander of the jamiatiislami guerrilla 
group said the insurgents did not want to attack the crowded city 
for fear of injuring civilians but that they might if communist 
forces there dont give up soon 
jalalabad could be the first major afghan city to fall to the 
guerrillas local insurgent commanders said they said its fall 
would weaken the defense of kabul and open up the highway to the 
capital 
in and around kabul afghan solders patrol the streets and 
outdoor markets the armored personnel carriers once stationed in 
the crowded bazaars are gone 
western countries began pulling their diplomats from kabul late 
last month because of fears for their safety once the soviets are 
gone and afghan troops are left to battle moslem guerrillas alone 
the soviets intervened in december 1979 to back afghan troops in 
their war with the moslem guerrillas they began pulling their 
estimated 100000 soldiers out in may in accordance with the un 
accord 
soviet and afghan officials have estimated there are about 1000 
soviet soldiers still in afghanistan including a small contingent 
assigned to kabul airport 
giant ilyushin76 transport planes have been flying into kabul 
ferrying supplies of flour and other goods in short supply 
britain quietly shut its embassy early saturday we didnt want 
a public display said one diplomat referring to the highly 
publicized flaglowering ceremony when the us embassy closed 
britains highestranking diplomat in kabul ian mackley said he 
looked forward to returning home mackley was married jan 21 in 
britain and returned to kabul on jan 22 
i postponed my honeymoon to come here i hope to resume it 
fairly soon he said 
the french charge daffaires raymond petit saw his staff off at 
the airport he said he plans to leave kabul on monday and was 
staying over to lock the doors 
west germany italy and japan also have closed their embassies 
and some eastern european and asian countries are reducing their 
staff 
president najib denounced the moves thursday as psychological 
warfare trying to create panic and embarrass and confuse public 
opinion 
he said diplomats would be safe in kabul after feb 15

attorney general dick thornburgh said saturday he 
has told regulators with the federal home loan bank board in no 
uncertain terms that they lack authority to promise immunity from 
prosecution to savings and loan officials 
henceforth its not to be indulged in thornburgh said the 
attorney general said he believed there were only isolated 
instances in which bank board regulators offered immunity from 
prosecution to those under investigation for fraud in the savings 
and loan industry 
thornburgh in an impromptu news conference following a luncheon 
speech at the american bar association convention here declined to 
be drawn into a possible controversy over gun control 
aba president robert raven said friday he asked thornburgh to 
support a federal waiting period for wouldbe gun buyers 
raven citing the recent slaying of five children at a stockton 
calif school and the wounding of four others in washington dc 
said there is a glaring loophole in federal law that allows 
people to buy automatic weapons and assault rifles 
thornburgh refused to say if he supports ravens waiting period 
proposal or if such weapons are too easily purchased 
we want to look at it the attorney general said 
the savings and loan questions were prompted by a reports that 
federal prosecutors are being hamstrung by promises of immunity made 
by home loan bank board regulators 
a us attorney in los angeles said top officials of the failed 
san marino savings amp loan corp were told they could avoid 
prosecution by helping regulators recover some of the money lost 
when the thrift institution collapsed in 1984 
thornburgh said the offer was a misunderstanding made without 
consultation with the justice department and that bank board 
regulators have been warned not to do it again 
thornburgh also met with the aba group that assesses judicial 
appointees and said he thinks it will continue to play a role in 
evaluating bush administration nominees to the federal bench 
in his remarks to the aba luncheon thornburgh said the bush 
administration will be a tough fighter against street crime 
firm and effective action against drugrelated criminal 
activities including application of the newly enacted federal death 
penalty will be necessary to end the freefire zones that have 
taken the lives of so many innocent people he said 
thornburgh also said he supports a pay raise of about 50 percent 
for federal judges that is due to take effect unless both houses of 
congress vote to block it before wednesday 
its absolutely essential that the payraise bill take 
effect he said 
thornburgh also said he will press for higher pay for us 
attorneys and fbi agents

decades to get into the soviet union to investigate human rights 
abuses has been invited for a visit a newspaper reported saturday 
officials of the londonbased human rights organization were not 
available to confirm the report in the guardian the paper said the 
group had written to moscow to discuss the timing of the visit and 
the range of people and institutions with whom contacts would be 
sought 
amnesty international has been seeking an invitation to the 
soviet union since 1960 when the organization was established the 
guardian said 
in december soviet president mikhail s gorbachev declared his 
government no longer held political prisoners and western observers 
generally acknowledge a dramatic drop in the number of political 
prisoners since gorbachev rose to power 
amnesty international said in october that it had information on 
150 soviets imprisoned solely for the nonviolent exercise of 
their fundamental human rights 
the human rights group said its list included about 30 religious 
believers 30 conscientious objectors to military service and about 
20 people held against their will for indefinite periods in 
psychiatric hospitals 
it also said it had information that since february 1987 314 
political prisoners had been released in the soviet union 249 of 
whom we knew or suspected to have been prisoners of conscience

corruption and nepotism in the government nor the closing of 
schools and hospitals because city employees hadnt received their 
december paychecks

the first london production of follies stephen 
sondheims 1971 musical came to a gala finish saturday after a 
19month run that won extensive critical acclaim but made no money 
you are seeing the last night of my dream to bring follies 
to london producer cameron mackintosh told the audience at the 
conclusion of a performance marked by nostalgia affection and 
repeated ovations 
mackintosh gave special thanks to american director harold prince 
for putting it on in the first place 
his remarks ended a 10minute standing ovation that also brought 
onto the stage composerlyricist sondheim and the musicals 
choreographer bob avian both of whom had flown in from new york for 
the evening 
the musical at the shaftesbury theater told the story of two 
former follies showgirls and the stagedoor johnnies they married 
all of whom reconvene at a party in 1970 inside a broadway theater 
earmarked for demolition 
at its july 21 1987 bow the london production starred julia 
mckenzie diana rigg david healy and daniel massey with veteran 
american performer dolores gray in the supporting role of carlotta 
who sings the showstopper im still here 
directed by mike ockrent me and my girl and produced by 
cameron mackintosh the musical boasted four new songs by sondheim 
and a somewhat more upbeat finish from the original which ended 
with one character having a nervous breakdown 
the new follies was chosen best musical of 1987 at all three 
of londons theater awards ceremonies 
three of the five principals stayed with the show throughout its 
run in july millicent martin replaced diana rigg and eartha kitt 
took over from dolores gray in a casting coup that has led to kitts 
upcoming concert show at the same theater starting march 13 
one commentator brian hunt in the daily telegraph used the 
closing of follies to strike out saturday at what he called 
sondheims inflated reputation 
with sondheim we get all the glitter and glamor and still 
remain aloof wrote hunt in an article entitled the trouble with 
stephen sondheim he said that in 13 musicals only two songs 
stand out as being beautiful and original 
budgeted at 28 million follies repaid 60 percent of its 
investment and was never the sellout smash of such other 
mackintoshproduced musicals as les miserables and the phantom 
of the opera 
despite winning seven tony awards the original broadway 
engagement failed to recoup its investment which at 800000 was 
hefty at the time 
present hopes are for a recast american production of follies 
to start a national tour in the fall no actors have been signed 
although julie andrews and barbara cook have been touted for the two 
leading roles

that absolved his soldiers of responsibility in the killings last 
year 
the decision to reopen the investigation followed a friday 
meeting between the high command and visiting vice president dan 
quayle who said the bush administration is concerned about an 
upswing in political violence in el salvador said a military 
officer who commented on condition of anonymity 
a senior us official who attended meetings during quayles 
visit said the vice president hinted that if human rights conditions 
are not improved washington may withhold some of the 400 million 
in aid to the country 
what does he have to say no convictions of implicated 
officers no money thats too blunt but there was no question he 
was talking about aid said the us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
el salvador a tiny country of 55 million people has received 
more than 35 billion in economic and military aid this decade 
more than any country in the western hemisphere the aid is part of 
the us effort to help the government combat a 9yearold leftist 
insurgency 
the army officer said the new investigation would be conducted by 
a panel of highranking military officers 
rather than presuming innocence the investigators will presume 
guilt and those implicated will have to show they did not commit the 
abuses he said 
on sept 21 soldiers of the 5th brigades jiboa battalion 
rounded up the residents of the hamlet of san francisco 27 miles 
east of san salvador and accused them of collaborating with rebels 
seven men and three women were marched away and shots were heard in 
the distance according to witnesses 
forensic examinations showed the 10 were killed by pointblank 
shots to the head 
the army first claimed the ten were guerrillas killed in combat 
but later said guerrillas attacked while the 10 were being marched 
away this version of the incident was upheld by the investigation 
in which the soldiers brigade commander took part

a man who is seeking a 
courtsanctioned abortion for his comatose wife said saturday he 
believes she would approve of his actions 
martin klein 34 of upper brookville is awaiting a decision on 
his petition seeking appointment as his wifes legal guardian so he 
can authorize an abortion that he and some doctors say could help 
her survive 
its been stressful klein said its been very 
frustrating i am doing what my wife would want me to do 
inside they have ripped my guts out he added but my wife 
deserves every chance she is entitled to and i am going to do 
everything in my power to see that she gets it 
kleins 32yearold wife nancy is 17 weeks pregnant she has 
been in a coma at north shore university hospital in manhassett 
since she was injured in a car accident dec 13 
the hospital refused to allow an abortion for mrs klein unless 
her husband is named her legal guardian 
state supreme court justice bernard mccaffrey reserved a decision 
thursday on the case described as unprecedented by legal and 
medical experts after a twoday hearing that drew supporters and 
opponents of abortion 
klein an accountant said he had hoped the decision would be a 
private one as do his wifes parents who support the decision to 
terminate the pregnancy 
we didnt want any publicity said klein saying that if his 
wife knew what was happening she too would be uncomfortable about 
it 
she is a very private kind of person he said i just want 
to get the court order safe in my hands so we can at least resolve 
one issue and get it behind us 
during the hearing five medical experts for klein testified that 
pregnancy decreases the chances of recovery for the comatose patient 
and could threaten her life 
however two other experts called by the nassau county district 
attorney testified that the pregnancy was not lifethreatening the 
district attorney said he entered the case in part to ensure that 
an abortion was not performed without consent 
klein visits his wife daily she suffered extensive brain damage 
and has been unconscious since the accident but is not on 
lifesupport machines 
i talk to her he said i work with her arms and legs 
its important that they dont get stiff i just have to take 
one day at a time he said he has seen a slight improvement in his 
wifes condition 
the couple have a 3yearold daughter arielle 
for right now i have to be strong for my family my daughter 
and my wife klein said 
if i dont hold up what will be left

artur yusupov of the soviet union scored a 
brilliant victory over canadas kevin spraggett in a suddendeath 
playoff saturday to win their world chess championship candidates 
quarterfinal and advance to the semifinal stage 
with both players thinking time limited to one hour each for the 
entire game yusupov playing black unleashed a dazzling queen 
sacrifice on his 28th move to gain a crushing attack with his 
remaining pieces against spraggetts king 
it was the best move in all the match said yves boisvert a 
canadian chess commentator 
as yusupov steadied his nerves and waited to deliver an 
unstoppable checkmate on his 51st move spraggett ran out of time 
and lost the game 
im not disappointed i lost but i think i gave it my best 
spraggett told reporters at a joint news conference with his 
opponent onstage at the playing hall in quebecs gabrielleroy 
library 
yusupov said spraggett had proved his equal by holding him to a 
44 tie over the eight games played before saturday at a slower rate 
after his victory yusupov rushed from the hall to tell his wife 
tatiana of the victory following mikhail gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost wives of soviet grandasters have in the last months 
begun to travel to the west with their husbands 
when the players came back to the stage they received a standing 
ovation of more than a minute from the disappointed but 
appreciative canadian crowd 
the winner of the candidates a series of knockout matches will 
challenge world champion garri kasparov for his title in 1990 
yusupov a 28yearold muscovite joins british grandmaster 
jonathan speelman in the semifinals 
mark dvoretsky a soviet international master who acts as 
yusupovs second said yusupov would probably play former world 
champion and fellow soviet anatoly karpov in the semifinals 
karpov is currently leading icelands johann hjartarson 31 in 
the sixgame duel underway in seattle and requires only one draw 
from two games to win the contest 
speelman is likely to meet either lajos portisch of hungary or 
dutch grandmaster jan timman portisch is leading their contest in 
antwerp belgium 21 after three games 
robert finta the general director of the quebec chess federation 
who oragnized the contest with the support of quebecs provincial 
government said the players would split the 42000 prize fund 
becasue the match was tied after the initial six games 
both semifinals will be staged together in london in the autumn 
each contest wil feature a prize 125000 with fiveeighths to the 
winner and threeeighths for the loser 
in a remarakable incident at the 1983 candidates quarterfinal 
between robert huebner of west germany and former world champion 
vassily smyslov of the soviet union in velden austria organizers 
turned to the roulettte table to break the tie 
huebner refused to attend and on the first spin the ball landed 
on the zero 
but on the second roll the ball landed on red and gave smyslov 
victory he went on to reach the candidates final before being 
knockout out by kasparov

inspections of boeing jetliners ordered by the 
federal aviation administration have turned up five more cases of 
miswiring in twinjet boeing 737s a federal official said saturday 
the latest findings were wrong connections on fire extinguisher 
bottles in engines on four boeing 737s operated by australian 
airlines and a problem with an indicator light for an engine on a 
737300 operated by usair 
the indicator light problem involved an incorrect light going on 
in the cockpit not a wrong switch being activated the seattle 
times reported in saturdays editions 
mitch barker of the faas seattle office said no more details 
about the miswirings or the australian airlines involved were 
available 
the inspection of about 740 boeing 737s 747s 757s and 767s 
built since 1981 was ordered by the faa to put to rest concerns 
about miswiring of firewarning and firesuppressant systems in 
engines and cargo areas 
concerns about miswiring or crosswiring arose during the 
investigation of the jan 8 crash of a british midland airways 
737400 that killed 44 people investigators questioned whether 
miswiring caused the pilot to shut down the wrong engine the cause 
of that crash has not been determined 
most foreign aviation agencies ordered their carriers to make 
similar inspections 
the inspections were advised previously by boeing in 
correspondence with its customers irregularities in 17 aircraft 
have been reported in the past few weeks 
boeing also acknowledged this week that it had put decals 
mislabeling wiring connectors on 10 737300s and 400s that had been 
delivered to customers in december and january 
boeing spokesman craig martin said none of those planes had 
actually been miswired or had connections improperly made he said 
new decals were sent to the airlines

cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk in an exchange of letters with secretary of state james a 
baker iii has called on the united states to step up its efforts to 
resolve the cambodian conflict 
we cambodian patriots ask the united states to play a more 
important and active role in the search for a fair solution to the 
problem of cambodia sihanouk said in his letter dated friday and 
seen sunday 
sihanouk said he received the baker letter earlier in the day 
during a meeting with us ambassador to china winston lord the 
meeting took place at beijings state guesthouse where sihanouk is 
staying 
according to a copy of the baker letter provided by sihanouk 
baker expressed us appreciation for your indispensable 
leadership in the valiant struggle of the cambodian people to regain 
their independence 
baker said without question your leadership is crucial to 
achieving an acceptable cambodian settlement both as the head of an 
interim government preceding elections and as a symbol and focus for 
the unity of your people 
we consider it vital that you remain involved in the ongoing 
diplomatic processes and that your views be conveyed to all 
involved parties at every opportunity 
sihanouk leads one of three chinabacked forces fighting 
vietnamese troops in cambodia china and the association of 
southeast asian nations asean want sihanouk to head a coalition 
government to take power after vietnams pullout tentatively set 
for september 
the prince is thought to be the only man with broad enough 
support to unify his nation but his unpredictable diplomatic ploys 
have also complicated efforts to resolve the conflict he has on 
several occasions resigned as president of the threeparty 
resistance government because of differences with his coalition 
partners 
last month he announced he would boycott all further peace talks 
because hun sen prime minister of the vietnambacked government in 
phnom penh had rejected his proposals for introducing an 
international peacekeeping force after vietnam ends its 10year 
occupation 
he has since modified his position saying he will support any 
unanimous agreements coming out of talks in jakarta indonesia later 
this month among the warring factions 
sihanouk was ousted in a 1970 coup he alleged was engineered by 
the cia however his faction now receives nonmilitary aid from the 
united states which calls for an end to the vietnamese occupation 
and the holding of free elections in cambodia

session from 11 am to 1 pm said b jay cooper a presidential 
spokesman 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan joined the group 
for lunch which broke up shortly after 230 pm 
options were presented to the president he made no decisions 
at the meeting cooper said 
among proposals that were to have been presented to the president 
were plans to raise 54 billion over three years through complicated 
financing arrangements based largely on boosting deposit insurance 
premiums paid by the institution according to a report saturday in 
the new york times 
the plan would call for banks to pay 18 cents in insurance 
premiums for every 100 in deposits while savings and loans would 
pay 25 cents per 100 according to unnamed congressional aides 
cited by the newspaper banks currently pay 8 cents per 100 in 
deposits while sampls pay 21 cents 
also the times sunday editions quoted industry officials as 
saying the bush administration is studying a proposal to take 
control of the 350 insolvent savings and loan associations and place 
them under the management of the federal deposit insurance corp 
advocates argue that the fdic with 4000 bank liquidators and a 
reputation for toughness would be better able to bring the problem 
under control than the federal home loan bank board which has a 
smaller staff and is less experienced the times said 
member of the home loan bank board which oversees sampls and the 
fdic chairman would have to approve the plan but it would not take 
an act of congress the times said 
the general accounting office on thursday urged the government to 
consider taking over the insolvent sampls once an overall bailout plan 
is devised 
white house aides speaking on condition of anonymity said 
friday that a controversial fee paid by bank and sampl depositors 
likely would not be a part of the package 
bush met with industry officials on thursday and congressional 
leaders friday and said he would lay out his plan early this week 
he plans to include the subject in a nationally broadcast speech to 
congress on thursday

in a lurid hollywood trial rock hudsons 
onetime lover has testified that the actor had unsafe sex with him 
up to five times a week although he knew he had aids and lied about 
having the deadly disease 
hudson fiercely kept secret his homosexual life for more than 25 
years before admitting he had aids in 1985 
but during testimony in recent weeks blond cleancut marc 
christian a 35yearold unemployed bartender has glaringly exposed 
hudsons love life 
the trial stems from christians 11 million lawsuit against 
hudsons estate and the actors former secretary mark miller 
christian alleges that he suffers extreme emotional distress for not 
being told hudson had aids 
to prove his claim christian has testified that he and hudson 
engaged in unprotected oral and anal sex for eight months three to 
five times a week after hudson learned he had aids in june 1984 
christian said that although the actor lost weight rapidly 
developed neck sores and had profuse night sweats when they lived 
together at hudsons hilltop mansion all symptoms of aids he 
denied he had the disease until shortly before his death in october 
1985 
christian said he has tested negative for exposure to the aids 
virus but lives in fear of contracting the disease and dying 
christian testified that he met hudson in october 1982 and moved 
in with him 13 months later in june 1984 the actor learned he had 
aids but kept the illness a secret christian said 
attorneys for the hudson estate and miller contend the pairs 
sexual relationship ended in february 1984 after christian allegedly 
told hudson he had engaged in sex for money with women and other men 
the attorneys contend that hudson allowed christian to continue 
living in the actors house until after his death because christian 
allegedly threatened to blackmail him by publishing love letters the 
actor wrote 
the defense has tried to portray christian as a publicityseeking 
gigolo who filed the lawsuit after he learned he was left out of 
hudsons will 
christian said he feels like a leper because of his contact with 
hudson the oncehandsome screen idol who wooed the likes of doris 
day elizabeth taylor and linda evans in dozens of movie and 
television roles 
the trial has attracted spectators daily but for those who may 
have expected to hear about the glamour and excitement of one of 
hollywoods leading stars the trial has yielded only the seamiest 
of insight 
testimony has focused primarily on sex how much sex christian 
and hudson had what type they had and in questions from defense 
lawyers whether they had sex at all 
christians attorney harold rhoden has repeatedly apologized to 
the jury for his clients graphic testimony 
the jury is expected to hear closing arguments in a few days

vice president salvador laurel 
returned saturday from a visit with ailing ferdinand marcos and 
appealed to president corazon aquino to let the man she ousted die 
in his homeland 
mrs aquino on sunday refused to meet with laurel as he 
requested and she said he should share with the filipino people 
the results of his visit to marcos instead of disclosing it to her 
first a presidential palace statement said 
president aquino felt that there should be nothing secret in 
what mr marcos sought to convey to her said the statement 
mrs aquino had disavowed laurels trip which laurel said he 
made at marcos request 
laurels relations with mrs aquino have been strained since he 
quit as foreign minister over policy differences in 1987 in august 
he accused mrs aquino of incompetence demanded her resignation 
and joined an opposition alliance 
laurel said he was appealing to mrs aquinos sense of 
christian and moral values to allow marcos to return he said 
doctors at honolulus st francis medical center told him marcos had 
lost the will to live and may not last through the year 
marcos admitted to the hospital jan 15 underwent a tracheotomy 
wednesday to drain fluids from his lungs and has been breathing 
through a respirator since then he was hospitalized twice in 
december for congestive heart failure 
laurel said that when he met marcos for 35 minutes the 
71yearold former president had a fever of 103 and weighed less 
than 100 pounds at times marcos could not speak or recognize 
visitors he said 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return for security 
reasons because the former president still enjoys a substantial 
following in the philippines 
marcos has been living in honolulu since a militarycivilian 
uprising toppled his 20year regime and swept mrs aquino to power 
in february 1986 
on saturday the philippine daily inquirer quoted cabinet 
secretary jose de jesus as saying the government would even refuse 
to allow marcos to be buried in the philippines 
before laurel left thursday unconfirmed newspaper reports said 
he and a filipino businessman were trying to work out a deal to let 
marcos return in exchange for giving back part of the billions of 
dollars he is accused of embezzling 
asked if marcos made such an offer laurel replied he was not 
at liberty to answer that he told another reporter no offer was 
made 
marcos and his wife imelda are under us indictment accused 
of plundering the philippines of more than 100 million and stashing 
much of it in the united states they would need permission from the 
us district court in new york to leave the united states

president carlos andres perez on 
saturday urged gen manuel antonio noriega to step down as commander 
of the panamanian defense forces and ruler of the nation 
in his first press conference since being sworn in as president 
perez said the next elections in panama scheduled for midyear 
should not be a farce but must really signify the sovereign 
expression of the will of the panamanian people 
he also said that noriega who by law should have retired last 
year after 25 years in the army could do panama and latin america 
a great service by resigning his military power when the 
constitution and the panamanian laws order him to do so 
perez said he saw no possibility of panamas rejoining the 
group of eight unless noriega the de facto leader of panama steps 
down and the country goes forward with democratic reforms 
the group is made up by venezuela colombia mexico brasil 
uruguay argentina and peru panama was suspended in 1988 after 
noriega ousted the elected president from power 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions on panama to 
pressure noriega to step down

telephone party lines and dialadate numbers are 
being banned in britian where critics say teenagers may be too 
hung up on the costly social calls 
british telecom the telephone company ended its own service a 
year ago and announced friday that it was indefinitely suspending 
the other privately run chatlines effective monday 
we have taken this action in the public interest following 
acute and growing public concern over chatlines which we feel has 
brought the whole service into disrepute said a company statement 
critics of the party lines with which people can call a number 
and speak to likeminded strangers welcomed news of the cutoff but 
expressed worry over those in debt to the telephone company 
costs for the services were 66 cents per minute during peak hours 
and 44 cents per minute during offpeak times newspapers have 
printed stories of parents facing phone bills of 5000 to 10000 
run up by their children 
although british telecom said it could not waive high bills we 
will work out a way in which an account can be paid which is best 
for the family said duncan lewis director of products and 
strategy 
the independent chatline association which represents most of 
the 100 companies providing the services was holding emergency 
talks to consider the news 
british telecom was privatized in 1984 but remains the countrys 
main telephone company with monopoly privileges and a nearmonopoly 
on services 
a final decision on the party lines which are enjoying wide 
popularity in the united states is expected after the monopolies 
and mergers commission publishes the results of a study on feb 28

some 300 works by paul gauguin the french painter 
who rejected the comforts of middleclass life to pursue art in the 
polynesian wild have gone on show at the grand palais in the first 
major retrospective of his work in 40 years 
gauguin running through april 24 is a 2 million 
coproduction with the art institute of chicago and the washington 
national gallery of art which presented slightly different versions 
of the show last year 
the french have not had a comprehensive look at gauguin since 
1949 and they have wholeheartedly embraced his works the show has 
been billed as the blockbuster art event of the season daily 
drawing some 6000 visitors 
critics say the shows highlight are 11 paintings on loan from 
the hermitage museum in leningrad and moscows pushkin museum which 
rarely leave the soviet union 
they include pastorales tahitiennes 1892 a brightly 
colored bucolic scene which gauguin believed to be his best 
tahitian effort 
with its flat surface exotic flowers and sensuous women in 
native dress the work sums up the essence of gauguin the distorted 
perspective and bold use of color which he once called a 
profound mysterious language a language of the dream would 
later influence works by pablo picasso henri matisse and other 20th 
century masters 
the show begins with gauguins early work including such 
paintings as effet de neige 1883 a wintery village scene 
reminiscent of claude monets la pie 
in the early years when working as a respectable stockbroker and 
painting on the weekends gauguin tried to master impressionist 
techniques later reacting against realism he would reject them 
altogether opting instead for mystery and exoticism 
gauguin sought a primitive naturalness where ever he went and 
became dependent on it for stimulation 
in 1886 he left paris for pontaven in brittany there his eye 
focused on the elaborate head pieces worn by the native women 
two years later he went to arles in southern france where he 
painted the same sun flowers and haystacks van gogh immortalized 
later during two different stays in the south pacific he would 
depict the tribal rituals and superstitions of true savages 
besides bringing together so many remarkable paintings executed 
after 1895 when he left france never to return the paris exhibition 
features two important works not displayed in washington or chicago 
in the vision after the sermon jacob wrestling with the 
angel 1888 gauguin experimented with pure color and reduced all 
forms to their outlines in papa moe 1893 he portrayed a 
native woman drinking water from a jungle source against a lush 
backround of tropical flora and fauna 
also on show is aita tamari vahine judith te parari 
189394 a bizarre portrait of a naked polynesian adolescent 
posing with an orange monkey anna the javanese as she was known 
was 13 years old when she became gauguins mistress and accompanied 
him back to france from the south pacific after his first stay there 
on a visit to brittany the flamboyantly dressed gauguin anna 
and her monkey were laughed at by sailors prompting the artist to 
pick a fight he sustained a broken foot and was bedridden for 
weeks anna left him returned to paris and robbed his studio of 
paintings and other valuables leaving him practically destitute 
the show ends on an optimistic note the monumental door frame 
sculpted in redwood and taken from the hut in the remote south 
pacific island of marquesas where gauguin died miserable and alone 
in 1903 at the age of 55 
carved with flowers and nude native women it bears the 
inscription the house of pleasure and sums up gauguins life 
credo be in love and you will be happy

the political ferment of 1988 a year of unprecedented losses at 
the polls for the ruling institutional revolutionary party sparked 
a wave of graphic daring 
more than one artist has depicted mexicos diminutive jugeared 
balding new chief executive carlos salinas de gortari as a 
disneyesque rodent named mickey 
they are tough very tough monsivais said approvingly 
although president salinas seems to be getting a bit more cartoon 
respect than he did as candidate and presidentelect 
jerry robinson head of the new yorkbased cartoonists and 
writers syndicate agrees that something special is afoot 
mexico has a fantastically high number of exceptional 
cartoonists said robinson who syndicates many of mexicos best 
they are highcaliber graphic artists it makes their work very 
very effective 
rogelio naranjos razorsharp pen has been on the cutting edge 
for years day by day stroke by ironic stroke naranjo has chiseled 
away at the pretensions foibles hypocrisies and taboos that have 
buttressed a oneparty government for 60 years hes honed a sixth 
sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political 
cartooning 
its like a mystical thing in my work i navigate the line that 
divides what is possible and what isnt he said when it comes to 
government policy now there are very few limits 
government austerity programs and mexicos crippling foreign debt 
provoke some of the bitterest commentary 
naranjo resorted literally to gallows humor depicting a plump 
man representing the world bank picking the pocket of a starved 
barefoot and hanged worker 
bulmaro castellanos who draws under the monicker magu showed 
salinas architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and 
prices as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a 
bloody body skewered by the pact 
the generals are another story both official censorship and 
selfcensorship have a long history in mexico where few care to 
rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule 
the army is the most taboo thing naranjo said everyone 
assumes the army is a great power in mexico that can influence the 
government in a radical and substantial manner 
as for the virgin of guadalupe even naranjo who has lampooned 
the pope says such a revered symbol cannot be used to make a point 
a museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of mexicos 
patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry 
although most of their satire is directed at the ruling 
establishment the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the 
opposition efren maldonado showed opposition leader cuauhtemoc 
cardenas as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of 
former president lazaro cardenas cuauhtemocs father and a national 
hero 
cartoonists such as naranjo and helio flores began stretching the 
limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine la 
garrapata in 1968 a year of political upheaval in much of the 
world including mexico 
the notion of reverence disappeared monsivais said 
in a show of impatience with the oneparty status quo thousands 
took to the streets the unrest lasted only a few months until the 
army opened fire on a demonstration in mexico city killing scores 
not long after the massacre la garrapata cofounder eduardo del 
rio who signs himself rius was kidnapped by uniformed men and 
forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out 
to be a mock firing squad 
subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve 
that included tolerance for press freedom 
the mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach no 
matter how unpopular even now maldonado the first cartoonist to 
put dumbo ears on salinas insists he intends no disrepect 
flores remembers a cartoon of president jose lopez portillo who 
left office to almost universal relief in 1982 he was drawn as 
hamlet but very very handsome very athletic flores said 
with salinas cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his 
ears and his austere economics attacking the very legitimacy of his 
presidency his election was marred by accusations of fraud and 
cardenas still claims that he won 
the most audacious cartoons appear in el universal a mainline 
newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988 and 
in two publications born after 1968 la jornada a liberal daily 
and the feisty weekly proceso 
but both naranjo and flores who just won his second gran prix 
from the international salon of cartoon say even el universal 
sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring 
after the july 6 presidential election which many say the ruling 
party rigged flores did a sketch portraying salinas as dr 
caligari the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film 
el universal rejected it without explanation he said the 
cartoon later ran in an opposition paper

the savings and loan crisis represents the 
largest government bailout in history an estimated 85 billion 
rescue that has raised a multitude of questions over whether 
taxpayers are being taken for a ride 
critics contend the bailouts negotiated by the federal home loan 
bank board are huge government giveaways with generous benefits for 
the purchasers of sick sampls that will saddle taxpayers with billions 
of dollars of openended obligations 
board chairman m danny wall disputes those charges saying the 
agency which regulates the countrys 3000 sampls is doing the best 
it can to handle a gigantic problem with limited resources 
in december the bank board negotiated deals involving 75 
bankrupt sampls in a yearend frenzy spurred by the fact that 
lucrative tax benefits available to the buyers were to be slashed in 
half on jan 1 
the 167 billion in government aid promised in december alone 
dwarfed the combined 28 billion handed out to chrysler corp and 
new york city the two previous record holders as the largest 
government bailouts 
to attract buyers the government included such sweeteners as 
multimilliondollar tax breaks to some of the countrys 
wealthiest investors that in many cases have far exceeded what the 
investors put up to purchase the sampls 
government guarantees extending over the next decade that make 
many of the purchases virtually riskfree to the new sampl owners 
lucrative pay packages which in one case will provide the 
manager of a conglomeration of failed texas sampls with a salary of 1 
million a year for the next five years 
rep jim leach riowa calls the deals with their big tax 
breaks a backdoor raid on the us treasury 
one of the impressive aspects of these deals is that an 
outsider can march in with very little capital and utilize 
substantial tax benefits leach said if the thrift investment 
works the outsider makes a riskless killing if it doesnt because 
of the nature of deposit insurance the outsider has the right 
simply to walk away 
with the government once more left holding the bag 
charles o bowsher head of the watchdog general accounting 
office told congress the bailouts are so complex that just 
monitoring them will strain the bank boards resources 
all of the controversy is coming as the bush administration and 
congress are trying to find a way to pay for the bailouts past and 
future the gao estimates that in the deals negotiated so far 
including 205 institutions closed in 1988 regulators have spent or 
promised to spend 26 billion more than they will take in over the 
next decade the gao projects that 35 billion more will be needed 
to handle 350 insolvent institutions still operating 
in a report last week the gao recommended that the government 
move promptly to take control of the remaining insolvent sampls to 
isolate them from the healthy part of the industry 
for years badly managed sampls were allowed to remain open because 
federal regulators didnt have the money to close them and pay off 
depositors all the while the eventual bailout costs to the federal 
government were mounting by 1 billion a month 
it is this crunch that has left the bank board which regulates 
sampls but not banks scrambling to craft inventive ways to handle the 
mess 
consider a mediumsized sampl with 1 billion in assets and 2 
billion in liabilities the assets are home mortgages and real 
estate loans the stocks in trade of an sampl the liabilities are 
depositors savings the institution is insolvent with a negative 
net worth of 1 billion 
if the bank board closed the sampl the government would have to 
pay out 2 billion immediately to depositors who are protected by 
federal insurance regulators would hope to recover the 1 billion 
representing the failed institutions assets as it collected loan 
payments and sold off repossessed properties 
this traditional approach still used by regulators of the 
nations 13000 banks requires huge upfront payments while waiting 
years to recoup part of the expense 
that is a luxury sampl regulators dont have because their 
insurance fund unlike the bank fund is busted instead the bank 
board has hit upon a strategy that for the first time makes the 
government the guarantor not only of deposits but of bad loans as 
well 
instead of taking over bad debts the board is leaving them with 
the new institutions and guaranteeing the new owners certain profit 
levels for managing the soured loans 
the bank boards bailout strategy features these elements 
promissory notes these notes are provided by the board to bring 
an institutions net worth back up to zero for an institution with 
a 1 billion negative net worth that would mean pumping up its 
assets with a 1 billion promissory note the notes which are 
typically for 10 years often carry an interest rate 2 percentage 
points higher than the cost that other financial institutions in the 
region are paying to obtain funds 
for many new institutions their biggest single asset is a 
government note in 1988 the bank board issued 14 billion in 
promissory notes and now has more than 20 billion in such notes 
outstanding 
government guarantees in its yearend rush to close deals the 
bank board agreed to protect new owners against losses on old loans 
over a 10year period these guarantees include capital loss 
coverage whereby the government agrees to cover any losses on the 
book value of a loan when it is eventually sold and yield 
maintenance agreements in which the government promises to make 
up any loss of interest income on loans 
many of the agreements covered every loan in a failed sampl except 
for stillperforming mortgages on singlefamily homes these 
guarantees carried a price tag of 18 billion last year 
tax breaks the boards assistance in the form of promissory 
notes and guarantees is tax free in addition sampl purchasers have 
been allowed to deduct bad loans that had not been written off the 
failed institutions books 
congressional critics have complained because these tax 
writeoffs can be carried from the acquired sampl to the investors 
other businesses corporate takeover specialist ronald o perelman 
the head of revlon cosmetics came away with tax breaks worth 900 
million in his purchase of a group of failed texas sampls three times 
the capital he put into the deal in all the bank board dealt away 
5 billion in tax breaks for 1988 
beyond the tax breaks the bank board projects that the perelman 
deal will cost the government 51 billion including 29 billion 
in loan guarantees

included in the perelman agreement was authorization to pay 
dallas banking executive gerald j ford 1 million annually to 
manage the newly created institution first gibraltar bank that 
deal left lawmakers fuming rep charles schumer dny said 
the public will not stand for that kind of salary because 
indirectly its taxpayer money 
revelations such as these have prompted six congressional 
committees to launch investigations the gao is sifting through the 
deals and one court suit has already been filed by disappointed 
bidders alleging the government acted improperly 
but bank board officials insist they have put together the best 
deals possible maintaining that the favorable terms were necessary 
to attract new capital and new investors into the troubled industry 
i would rather be criticized for having acted than not having 
acted wall says 
critics contend that the bank board deals are a recipe for 
disaster the new owners dont have a lot of capital in the deals 
or often much experience in running sampls in some cases the 
failed sampls were turned over to home builders or real estate 
developers with an inherent conflict of interest in running a 
financial institution 
some critics say congress should not approve the money to mop up 
the sampl mess without changing the bank boards rules 
the gao said the boards current approach with its heavy use of 
government subsidies could actually worsen the problem by making it 
more difficult for marginal sampls to survive without the subsidies 
lowell l bryan a financial analyst for mckinsey amp co inc 
warns that the boards flood of deals has created a new interest 
group of rich powerful individuals who will fight to protect the 
sweetheart deals they have struck further complicating 
congressional efforts to resolve the crisis 
as if those werent enough problems some in the industry worry 
that the bank board deals will work only if the record peacetime 
economic expansion continues 
these deals were built on certain assumptions on interest rates 
and economic conditions and if those turn south you could have a 
second round of failures said mark riedy president of the 
national council of savings institutions an industry lobbying group

to assess the size of the savings and loan problem 
in texas you need only look at the skyline of boston 
boston the massachusetts capital has 39 million square feet of 
office space downtown in the dallas area alone almost an equal 
amount of office space is empty according to cushman amp wakefield a 
real estate research firm 
much of that real estate is now foreclosed and owned by the 
states savings and loans and the dead space remains one of the 
biggest problems for the nations struggling thrift industry 
despite last years rescue of nearly onethird of texas thrifts 
the savings and loan business wont rebound experts say until the 
states economy recovers and tenants start to fill up all those 
empty moneyguzzling buildings 
it could take years 
unfortunately their sampls greatest exposure is to the weakest 
segment of the texas economy said alex sheshunoff an austin 
texas banking expert its a bit of a spiral 
half the repossessed assets now owned by the nations sampls is in 
the lone star state texas savings and loans own so much repossessed 
real estate nearly 13 billion worth they literally cant give 
it all away 
texas got the nation into the sampl mess and texas has continued 
to make it worse the thrift industry lost 88 billion in the first 
nine months of 1988 and 83 billion of that was lost in texas 
of the 382 billion spent last year by regulators to clean up 
the colossal mess 252 billion was spent in texas 
yet after closing or merging 88 insolvent texas sampls last year 
nearly a third of all the sampls in the state there are still 65 to 
70 that regulators havent gotten to yet 
the ones that have the most notoriety as far as the fraud have 
been addressed said george barclay president of the federal home 
loan bank of dallas but its a moving targetare there more 
insolvents coming on stream yeah there probably will be 
additional ones but theyll be smaller 
barclay one of the architects of the federal home loan bank 
boards southwest plan says that most of the remaining large 
texas insolvent thrifts will be dealt with by summer that losses 
will begin to end this year and that regulators are making progress 
and have the situation under control 
that still doesnt mean the thrift crisis is over in texas 
however there are other areas of concern 
despite reports of widespread fraud that contributed billions 
of dollars to the sampl crisis only a handful of sampl officials have 
been indicted the justice department has assembled a huge task 
force in dallas which has been at work more than one year 
the texas economy which crashed with the oilmarket collapse 
remains sluggish dashing dreams of a quick turnaround that would 
absorb many of the thrift problems should the economy dive again 
with a new crash in oil prices the cost of the thrift cleanup would 
grow again 
new owners of sampls have brought with them 11 billion in fresh 
capital something regulators say is an accomplishment but some 
economists say thats just a drop in the bucket and not enough to 
return the state and the industry to solid footing 
at the heart of the thrift crisis in texas is the bank boards 
often criticized southwest plan which merges sick institutions 
into healthier ones rather than liquidating 
it was created with a premise that the government just couldnt 
dump all the dead real estate in texas that it would have to wait 
for the economy to recover and absorb the vacant space 
now its almost a catch22 situation the sampls need the economy 
to recover but the economy remains sluggish because of the sampl 
related problems economists say 
the ultimate question is how fast does texas come back if it 
does come back said salomon brothers inc real estate analyst bob 
hopkins 
the lone star states battered economy has begun growing again 
slowly but its not keeping up with the rest of the nation 
its going to be awhile before we have growth consistent with 
the rest of the us said william gruben a senior economist at 
the federal reserve bank in dallas 
construction has come to a near standstill because of the 
oversupply of office buildings and homes and banks and sampls are 
hesitant to lend money these days to anyone but the safest of 
customers making it tough for new businesses to get started 
lenders at virtually every financial institution are running 
scared sheshunoff said the reality on the texas economy is 
that the texas economy is going to come back one job at a time 
and if the economy doesnt cooperate with the regulators the 
cost for the sampl cleanup will undoubtedly rise 
if the economic environment deteriorates further if the value 
of real estate rather than coming back or stabilizing goes down 
or if interest rates go up dramatically that cost will go up 
barclay said 
how the sampl crisis came about is a story of part crime and part 
circumstance it was triggered by the downfall of the southwest 
economy but it was exaggerated by the highflying antics of 
entrepreneurs primarily in texas who either through fraud 
mismanagement or bad decisions created billiondollar messes 
at the same time regulators had only skeletal forces in texas 
and werent keeping up 
so widespread were sampl shenanigans across dallas that the justice 
department task force reportedly subpoenaed the records of hundreds 
of people 
the task force which occupies an entire floor of a federal 
building in dallas has grown to 58 including 25 fbi agents said 
richard m fishkin an agent with the fraud section of justice 
department 
so far 33 people have been indicted and 20 convicted four 
trials are pending but the major players in what has been described 
as looting of thrifts remain under investigation 
these cases are complex and it takes a long time to accumulate 
evidence and put the cases together fishkin said 
meanwhile regulators have beefed up their examination forces in 
texas both to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of the mid80s 
and watch over their southwest plan creations 
in the last five years the southwest regional regulatory bank 
which moved from little rock ark to dallas in 1983 has grown 
from 92 examiners and supervisors with a 5 million budget to 450 
professionals with a 33 million budget 
this year another 123 examiners and analysts will be added 
barclay said with another 115 million for the budget 
we see an awesome responsibility to make sure that the mergers 
were putting together work barclay said 
everybody always learns from their experience what happened 
here in 83 84 and 85 when the regulatory process wasnt up to 
snuff wont happen again barclay said if anything we may 
even be overreacting

the treasury department will be turning to the 
auction block again soon to peddle a barrage of new bonds and notes 
that will help support the governments growing national debt 
this time around wall streets largest brokers will be asked to 
buy 2875 billion in new three and 10year notes and 30year 
bonds they in turn will resell the securities to the public 
analysts said the auction plan outlined this past week was in 
line with market expectations its set to begin tuesday and end 
thursday 
the only big difference between this auction and the previous two 
is that it includes the 30year bond which was on hiatus because 
congress had failed to raise the ceiling on issuance of longterm 
debt congress finally passed new legislation before it adjourned 
last year 
while there were few surprises in the size of the upcoming sale 
economists appeared divided on how well it might go in the wake of 
the latest economic data 
adding pressure to the credit markets was the governments 
january unemployment report which pointed to continued strength in 
the economy along with the possibility of higher inflation 
the report released friday showed that the nations jobless 
rate inched up to 54 percent in january from 53 percent at the end 
of the year but despite the slight increase 408000 new jobs were 
created last month and that was far more than most economists had 
predicted 
we believe the employment data is extremely negative said 
william v sullivan director of money market research for dean 
witter reynolds inc it increases the pressures for the fed to 
tighten credit 
the federal reserve has indicated repeatedly that it will push 
for higher interest rates to keep inflation in check thereby making 
borrowing more expensive and slowing down economic growth 
sullivan and several other analysts predict that interest rates 
will be on the rise going into the upcoming auction 
we dont think the current yield level reflects the underlying 
fundamentals in the us economy he said 
the upward slant in rates will put pressure on the treasury to 
make the yields of its new bonds and notes high enough to attract 
domestic and foreign money 
one saving grace though is the fact that the dollar has 
remained strong in foreign exchange 
the foreign exchange market is definitely a plus for the 
treasury auction said carol a stone a senior economist for 
nomura securities international inc i would say there will be 
good foreign participation 
a rising dollar is seen as good news for foreigners because it 
means they are likely to earn more on their dollardenominated 
investments 
proceeds of the upcoming treasury auction will be used toward 
raising about 137 billion in cash and redeeming 151 billion in 
old obligations which make up part of the 28 trillion national 
debt 
the sale will begin on tuesday with 975 billion worth of 
threeyear notes followed by 95 billion in 10year securities on 
wednesday and 95 billion thursday

arguments over who pays the estimated 85 
billionplus tab for cauterizing the wounds of the nations savings 
amp loan industry are growing louder and angrier with auditors 
criticizing regulators depositors rebuking president bush and his 
chief of staff chastising banks 
by the end of the week the government wasnt any closer to a 
solution to what everyone agrees will be the biggest federal bailout 
in history at a time the country can least afford it given a budget 
deficit of 150 billion bush told congressional lawmakers any 
rescue plan will not be popular 
the underlying acrimony in the crisis afflicting many of the 
nations 3000 sampls seemed to turn uglier with each passing day in 
washington where much of the feuding took place over how their 
rescue should be financed 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
told lawmakers that federal regulators were wrong to rush into a 
rash of deals late last year with promises of billions of dollars in 
assistance and guarantees to buyers of broke badly managed savings 
amp loan institutions 
the gao recommended the government seize all remaining insolvent 
sampls to isolate them from the healthy part of the industry 
in addition gao comptroller general charles bowsher released a 
report suggesting several accounting firms inexplicably failed to 
report staggering loan problems at troubled southwestern thrifts 
contributing to what some lawmakers called a massive coverup 
at least one congressional critic of the governments handling of 
the crisis rep henry gonzalez ttexas said he had asked the 
justice department to explore taking unspecified civil action 
against the errant accountants 
at the same time the first notable bush gaffe in his 2weekold 
presidency suggesting sampl deposits could be taxed to subsidize the 
bailout effort not only refused to die but snowballed into a 
serious political problem that raised new questions about his 
judgment 
some lawmakers said they were inundated with constituent mail 
denouncing the bush idea reports surfaced nationwide that 
depositors were withdrawing their money from both sick and healthy 
sampls to avoid the risk of a tax 
bushs chief of staff john sununu meanwhile fired off his own 
critical barrage directed at the banking industry over 
advertisements run in three states that he said were designed to 
raise thriftdepositor doubts about the sanctity of their savings 
he called the ads unequivocally irresponsible 
the american bankers association lobby group rejected sununus 
outrage over the ads which ran in kansas texas and arkansas where 
the sampl crisis has been acutely felt the aba countered that it has 
always maintained banks are more secure than sampls and that history 
is bearing the claim out 
it is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under 
siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are 
trying to compete with belowmarket rates said maryliz meany an 
aba spokeswoman 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the government released reports that showed january unemployment 
rose slightly while in december factory orders surged personal 
income and spending both climbed at the same rate and a key 
forecasting gauge jumped analysts remained divided over whether the 
data evidenced a slowdown or higher inflation ahead 
market corruption crackdowns spread from chicago and new york to 
other big cities targeted by a special justice department task 
force at the same time chicago futuresexchange officials 
intensified a selfpolicing effort in the aftermath of an fbi 
bugging operation said to expose rampant fraud 
more fallout hit drexel burnham lambert inc as a result of its 
agreement to plead guilty to securities fraud charges related to the 
ivan boesky insider trading scandal this time from new jersey 
gambling authorities who moved to sever the firms ties to the 
atlantic city casino business kidder peabody amp co another big 
firm that paid a big fine a few years ago because of the scandal and 
has been struggling since was hit by a spate of resignations 
general motors corp announced the indefinite shutdown of a 
plant in framingham mass an indication the giant automaker is 
still trying to cut operations despite claims of a turnaround 
chrysler corp meanwhile announced an agreement to market hyundai 
cars in the united states becoming the last big us automaker to 
develop direct ties to a korean counterpart

a series of recent price increases suggests that 
one group of economywatchers is worrying less not more about 
inflation 
the prices in question are those of common stocks up close to 15 
percent on average over the last 2 months 
at their lows in midnovember wall street was brimming with talk 
that economic growth was straining the capacity of the nations 
factories and labor force 
the resulting inflationary pressures it was said would push 
interest rates sharply higher and set the economy on a course toward 
recession 
since then however money managers at investing institutions 
seem to have reassessed the inflation outlook bidding stocks up to 
levels not seen since before black monday on oct 19 1987 
a good many observers including chairman alan greenspan of the 
federal reserve board have warned lately that inflation remains a 
threat 
but as people make their investment decisions these days they 
appear to be operating more and more on the assumption that the fed 
will keep inflation in check without stifling the business expansion 
that thinking is evident in the behavior of longterm interest 
rates in the bond market which have actually declined a bit even as 
the fed has tightened credit and shortterm interest rates have 
moved up 
the bullish sentiment in the bond market in january has partly 
reflected the viewpoint that shortterm rates will not have to rise 
much higher and for a prolonged period in order for the fed to 
contain inflation said maury harris economist at painewebber inc 
similarly david resler at nomura securities international inc 
observed through word and deed mr greenspan has proven his 
commitment to hold inflation in check 
we suspect that the principal reason for these rather euphoric 
markets is the growing belief that discipline will govern both 
monetary and budgetary policies during the year and perhaps 
years ahead 
in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
839 to 233125 posting its fifth straight weekly gain since the 
start of 1989 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 172 to 
16650 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 839 to 40635 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 331 at 32488 
volume on the big board averaged 18679 million shares a day 
against 19640 million the week before 
fears that rapid employment growth might soon touch off 
inflationary forces in the form of accelerating wage increases have 
by no means been dispelled altogether 
for some analysts those worries were in fact heightened on 
friday when the labor department reported that payroll employment 
increased by a largerthanexpected 408000 jobs in january 
full employment is imminent so is sharply higher inflation 
asserted charles lieberman director of financial markets research 
at new yorks manufacturers hanover securities corp in a report 
published this past week 
the pool of unemployed is sufficiently depleted that only about 
800000 to 900000 more workers can be hired without unusual wage 
inducements 
but edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities 
argues that low unemployment need not be an inflationary force 
we believe that labor shortages will induce business 
particularly in the services sector to boost productivity 
yardeni says 
if so then low unemployment rates in effect will boost our 
national productivity which should reduce inflationary pressures 
during the 1970s we experienced high unemployment and high 
inflation in the 1990s we should experience low unemployment and 
low inflation
