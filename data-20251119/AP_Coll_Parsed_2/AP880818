george bush must sharpen a personal image 
that has grown fuzzy over the last eight years and show democrat 
michael dukakis for the liberal he is if the gop is to win the 
presidency say delegates to the republican national convention 
his image was fairly sharp with the american people eight 
years ago said rep carlos j moorhead of california as vice 
president hes had to step out of the limelight but when he comes 
back into the spotlight his independent image will become clear 
again 
oregon state treasurer anthony meeker said bush has suffered an 
image problem because he has been no 2 as soon as he can 
transcend that an image transplant will have occurred 
many delegates believe bushs major opportunity to strengthen 
his image will come tonight when he delivers his acceptance speech 
to the convention 
people are telling him to be himself but you know sometimes 
you can try too hard said rep john p hiler of indiana if 
hes just relaxed and tries to deliver the kind of acceptance 
speech george bush can deliver and he does a good job i think 
youll be surprised by how quickly george bush starts to pick up 
momentum 
barry mccarty a north carolina delegate said bush needs to 
take off the gloves 
the democrats have done everything they could to cover up what 
mr dukakis is a rabid liberal bush has to pull that mask off 
mccarty said 
colorado delegate syl morgansmith said bush has got to frame 
his campaign around his record and tell the truth about the 
dukakis record 
hes got to get to the point tell the truth and hes got to 
come out of the chutes raising hell she said 
others warn bush against trying to be someone hes not 
alan punch green bushs oregon campaign chairman said he 
advised the vice president to stay the way you are every time 
you try to change it it comes out phony 
added ken chlouber a miner and state legislator colorado you 
cant reaganize george bush hes going to have to plow his own 
ground 
delegates believe that once the vice president outlines his 
agenda and goes after the democrats he will surge ahead of dukakis 
in the polls 
surveys taken immediately after the democratic national 
convention last month showed dukakis enjoying the traditional 
postconvention bounce and leading in some surveys by 17 or 18 
percentage points but bush narrowed that doubledigit lead to an 
almost dead heat as the republican convention neared 
house minority leader bob michel of illinois said the gop 
convention was orchestrated with the hope of the vice president 
improving his lot by 10 points i think weve accomplished some of 
that 
i saw some polls last week that showed the race was narrowing 
the democratic convention is wearing off and george bush will 
benefit from our convention said iowa sen charles grassley 
je brown a state representatives from texas likened the 
convention attention to volleyball at the olympics 
nobodys ever seen it then its on tv for five days and the 
next thing you know everybody you call and ask what theyre doing 
theyre going to play volleyball 
a bush surge in the polls may not be enough historically no 
candidate since president truman has won the presidency after 
trailing in the polls prior to the convention 
history professor and georgia rep newt gingrich is unfazed by 
that information 
were a party that twice nominated a man who made movies with 
chimpanzees why do you think that we would worry about historical 
precedents he said

george bush tapped sen dan quayle as his 
running mate in hopes of turning baby boomers into gop boosters 
but analysts say younger americans may prove too diverse for the 
overture to pay off 
although the roughly 75 million americans born between 1946 and 
1965 shared such formative experiences as vietnam and watergate 
there is no evidence that such generational links create a voting 
bloc pollsters note 
they cross all income occupational and ideological lines 
pollster peter hart said wednesday 
bush and his strategists portrayed the selection of quayle 41 
as a daring bid for the loyalties of the younger generation noting 
that he is the first baby boomer on a majorparty ticket for 
national office 
campaign chief james a baker iii called it a bold stroke 
and bush said do i need help in this area sure and have i 
gotten it by the selection of a young experienced united states 
senator i think so 
pollsters say however that some of the values shared by 
younger americans just dont mesh with quayles beliefs 
quayle fits on the economic stuff pretty well as a proponent 
of deregulation entrepreneurship and low taxes said public policy 
researcher edward h crane president of the cato institute in 
washington 
but crane whose nonpartisan group has been a leader in 
analyzing the babyboom generation said quayles foreign policy 
views are more hawkish and his social views more conservative than 
those of many baby boomers 
he doesnt have that combination of views that i would argue 
is unique to baby boomers crane said so he wont be able to 
appeal to a large group of them 
young americans are the least reliable voters and republican 
pollster neil newhouse said quayle may be able to improve turnout 
among the onethird of baby boomers who already identify with the 
republican party he said the next step drawing new adherents was 
possible even if difficult 
will it encourage younger democrats younger independents to 
cross party lines for a candidate of their generation who knows 
he said but theres a shot at that happening 
there are some openings for quayle hart a democratic pollster 
who studied the babyboom generation for rolling stone magazine 
said that younger adults could find it easier to relate to him at 
least in terms of appearance and metaphor 
and newhouse noted that baby boomers are less strongly committed 
to either political party than are older americans 
it goes beyond whether you are liberal or moderate or 
conservative to what kind of concerns you have newhouse said 
if he can demonstrate shared concerns over the things the 
babyboom generation is concerned about such as day care and 
education then he can have a tremendous impact 
another republican pollster linda divall also said quayles 
candidacy could have an impact so long as it was not overstated 
simply through the message his selection sent to younger voters 
i dont think anyone is saying that dan quayle singlehandedly 
is going to deliver the babyboom generation she said but i 
think its the first time that either of the major parties has made 
an absolute gesture of basically passing the torch a couple of 
generations and saying this is the future leader of our party 
this is the way were going to go

vice president george bush 
apparently is losing no time taking president reagan up on his 
offer to march as a foot soldier in the bush campaign for the 
presidency 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that a 
joint appearance with bush has been penciled in as a possible 
political event on the presidents schedule while he is in los 
angeles next week 
fitzwater said reagan vacationing at his ranch north of here 
planned to watch on television wednesday night as bush formally 
became the gop nominee for president 
he said the reaganbush appearance next week was planned for 
wednesday a day when the president had not scheduled any public 
appearances he did not know whether the event would be a 
fundraiser a rally or something else 
the event would be the third joint reaganbush appearance in 
less than two weeks 
last friday in their first political duet since the president 
endorsed bush at a washington fundraising dinner may 11 they 
appeared before a group of reagan political appointees whom bush 
described as the field commanders of the reagan revolution the 
president predicted we are going to hold the white house with 
george bush 
on monday night addressing the republican national convention 
in new orleans reagan reversed bushs field commanders 
metaphor and promised that ill leave my phone number and address 
behind just in case you need a foot soldier 
bush was watching the presidents speech on television at the 
vice presidents residence in washington 
on tuesday morning the two got together at belle chasse naval 
air station near new orleans as bush arrived and reagan departed 
for three weeks of vacationing and political fundraising in 
california 
nancy and i want you to know that you have all our support all 
the way he told bush the vice president then took reagan aside 
and told him privately of his choice of sen dan quayle of indiana 
as his running mate 
reagan telephoned quayle from the ranch tuesday night to 
congratulate him fitzwater said 
the presidential spokesman said he did not think the secondterm 
senator would be handicapped by his relative youth and inexperience 
hes a young man but he has accomplished a lot in his 41 
years fitzwater said 
he recalled that quayle was one of those who recommended that 
reagan veto the pentagon spending bill that defense secretary frank 
c carlucci and other advisers had urged him to sign in vetoing 
the measure reagan argued that it would cripple his star wars 
system of spacebased missile defense among other things 
fitzwater quoted quayle as telling the president we can paint 
our opposition in gray or we can paint them in bold colors 
the president chose to go with the bold colors and i think 
this is a bold selection the spokesman said 
the tentative bushreagan appearance next week would be 
sandwiched between previously announced fundraisers for sen pete 
wilson in irvine on tuesday and for the california republican party 
in thousand oaks and rep robert lagomarsino in santa barbara on 
aug 27 lagomarsino is the presidents congressman reagan votes 
in solvang calif

its hot miserably hot and a recordbusting 
sizzling spell has the country in a sweaty summertime lather 
international falls minn known as the icebox of the 
nation for its subzero winter temperatures tied an alltime 
record with an ovenlike 98degree reading july 6 it had 90plus 
readings 14 times so far 
harvard university shut down because of heat for the first time 
in its 335year history new york city streets melted into goo 
cranky inmates set fire to a 144yearold granite jail in lawrence 
mass fires burned near old faithful in yellowstone national park 
and mount rushmore and about the only thing brisk were sales of 
pools and air conditioners 
its been a long summer said heatweary meteorologist ed 
olenic of the national weather service you basically have to 
tell people bad news day after day it gets old after a while 
relief wont come soon enough for most of the nation 
forecasters predict two to three more weeks of above normal 
temperatures and below normal rain with only an occasional break 
the miserable summer of 88 and its triple whammy of heat haze 
and humidity began with a late spring high pressure system over the 
great plains that blocked the jet stream from delivering cooler 
cleaner air from canada and hobbled the production of thunderstorms 
its like being in a tropical rain forest said anthony gigi 
of the national weather service in steamy sticky new york 
michigan autoworkers chafed by 100degree temperatures staged 
wildcat strikes at two chrysler corp plants to escape factories 
that felt like blowtorches chrysler responded with extra fans 
ice soda pop and optional fourhour shifts 
its murder said fred obrien recording secretary of 
united auto workers local 1264 we have enough fans to lift the 
roof but they just blow hot air 
there should be less hot air inside the wisconsin state capitol 
gov tommy g thompson reversed himself on a veto and gave the 
goahead for air conditioning to be installed inside the 
70yearold building in madison 
in new york city where things crackle at a feverish pace year 
round people are more gruff than normal as eight records were 
broken or tied and the temperature reached 90 or above 32 
oppressive times by tuesday 
everybodys nerves are totally frayed said robert louden a 
former cop and hostage negotiator who teaches a security course at 
john jay college 
theres a shorter wick it takes less to set off the 
firecracker i notice a lot more hornblaring things seem to 
provoke people who dont have a good handle on their own aggression 
and anxiety louden said its a chore just to walk you want 
to be left alone 
albert mehrabian professor of psychology at the university of 
california at los angeles said the combination of unbearable heat 
and the squalor of the inner city can result in anger 
frustration anxiety and aggression 
adding to new yorkers woes dozens of beaches have been closed 
by medical waste washing ashore heavy power demand has caused 
electrical shortages a combination of heat above and leaky steam 
pipes underneath literally melts asphalt forming bumps on streets 
and a fourfold increase in the regions mosquito population is 
blamed on a dry june rainy july and a humid august 
its really rough out there said john lockett 65 who has 
been shining shoes outside grand central terminal for 27 years 
people are wiping the sweat off their brows and theyre not 
smiling nobodys smiling 
death and injury have accompanied the fiery heat 
two new york men both in their 20s died of heat stroke 
following separate foot races 
the number of broken necks has increased in chicago and 
milwaukee both of which have shattered records for most days above 
100 degrees the injuries occur when people dive into shallow 
water doctors said 
and heatwarped rails were blamed for an amtrak train crash that 
injured 165 people and spewed wreckage over the montana plains near 
saco 
the homeless whose misery usually is worst in winter were 
allowed to stay in air conditioned shelters in atlantic city nj 
and other cities in chicago social workers set up tanks of ice 
water on the sidewalks but somebody stole the tanks authorities 
said 
meteorologists say there is no proven connection between the 
miserable summer of 88 and the greenhouse effect a canopy of 
gases in the earths atmosphere that some scientists say will trap 
heat and push temperatures higher over time 
but others are not so sure 
its a signal were getting things out of balance something 
is not right in this picture said irvin mintzer of the world

president mohammed zia ulhaq was a 
dictator who blended firmness with political shrewdness in a 
formula that kept him in power 11 years longer than anyone else in 
pakistans 41year history 
zia imposed martial law and executed the man he overthrew but 
did not instill the fear of prison and midnight knocks on the door 
he was a zealous moslem who stamped islamic law on his nation 
but did not enforce such cruel punishments as amputation for theft 
and stoning to death for adultery 
a western diplomat said a few years ago zia is something of a 
paradox by and large hes had an unfavorable press in the west 
but hes not nearly as bad as people make out 
zia 64 died wednesday when his military plane exploded after 
taking off from bahawalpur 330 miles south of islamabad 
he was a strong ally of the united states and his regime was 
helped by international politics and luck soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan in 1979 led to more western aid and 
good harvests produced more food in the early 1980s 
recently however he has had difficulty with the unprecedented 
opposition generated by benazir bhutto the daughter of the prime 
minister he overthrew and other political leaders 
zia called himself a reluctant ruler in an interview with 
the los angeles times earlier this month but added i am not a 
person to just give up in disgust and walk away i am determined to 
stay here until i solve all of the many problems that continue to 
face our country 
the man whose surname means light of god was a career 
military officer and had spent 30 years in the army before prime 
minister zulfikar ali bhutto made him a full general and army chief 
of staff on march 1 1977 
zia banned alcohol in officers messes and tried to instill the 
islamic principles of imam faith taqwa abstinence and jihad 
readiness for holy war 
some military colleagues called him bhuttos butler because 
of the deference he showed the prime minister so they were 
surprised when he seized power in a bloodless coup july 5 1977 
other observers who had described zia as dumb like a fox 
were not surprised 
once in charge zia arrested the cabinet and proclaimed martial 
law he had bhutto tried later that year for conspiracy to murder a 
political opponent who was not killed three years earlier 
bhutto was hanged in 1979 and his daughter benazir has became 
zias main political opponent 
at first zia had deferred to bhutto and expressed hope that the 
former prime minister would compete in elections scheduled for 
october 1977 
after studying secret documents on bhuttos years in power 
however he called his predecessor an evil genius who had run 
the country on more or less gestapo lines misusing funds 
blackmailing people detaining them illegally and even perhaps 
ordering people killed the trial ensued in september and zia 
canceled the elections 
last month after announcing that free fair and impartial 
national elections would be held in november he made election 
rules that hobbled the opposition 
zia kept up his nations military strength to guard the borders 
with india with which pakistan has fought three wars since 
partition and independence from britain in 1947 
he supported moslem guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked 
communist government in neighboring afghanistan after the soviet 
troop withdrawal from afghanistan began may 15 the kremlin accused 
him of continuing to funnel arms to the insurgents 
mass arrests and floggings occurred even after zia lifted 
martial law and his public image was stern but acquaintances said 
he was warm in private and aides report many instances of kindess 
according to one story he was on a trip through the interior 
when he heard about a village boy who was sick he directed the 
local authorities to get the child examined at state expense or 
flown to another country if the proper treatment was not available 
in pakistan 
zia resisted a cult of personality and did not permit his 
portrait to hang in government offices or public places unlike 
previous military leaders in pakistan he was married with five 
children 
the general was the first head of state to use the national 
language urdu at all state functions instead of english and 
encouraged officials to wear national dress 
he was born into a middleclass family aug 12 1924 at 
jallunder in what now is the indian state of punjab and became a 
devout moslem in his youth 
in june of this year he issued a presidential decree making 
islamic law supreme thus bringing much of pakistani life under the 
supervision of islamic scholars and priests 
his great passion in life is islam a close aide said 
one acquaintance of zia said during his prayers he forgets 
everything worldly he forgets his status as a general and head of 
state and even as a father and a husband i have seen him crying 
like a baby at the prophets tomb at medina 
several pakistani and western analysts said zia believed running 
the country was destiny not duty and in 1983 he declared its 
not important what people say about you now but what history 
remembers after youve gone

the city council has given police 
permission to arrest convicted drug dealers and illegal users for 
loitering in parts of the city known to be drug hangouts 
the council approved the ordinance on tuesday and declared that 
the drug problem was an emergency requiring that a 10day comment 
period for new ordinances be waived 
we have a grave emergency and we need these emergency 
measures said councilman tom stenger just before the 60 council 
vote 
under the ordinance 40 police officers specially trained to 
recognize tactics of drug sellers will start cruising the city 
thursday said mark mann a police department spokesman 
the ordinance permits police to arrest people who 
show physical characteristics of drug intoxication or use such 
as needle marks 
possess drug paraphernalia 
were ordered by a judge to stay away from particular areas of 
the city 
are physically identified by police as a member of a gang known 
to deal drugs 
transfer small objects or packages for currency in a furtive 
fashion 
run when police appear 
attempt to conceal themselves or an object that police believe 
is related to a drug deal or behave in any manner that police 
believe looks like drugdeal behavior 
councilman jack warnick cautioned police about violating 
peoples civil rights saying were giving the police 
extraordinary powers and hope they will be extraordinarily careful 
in their use of those powers 
kathleen taylor executive director of the american civil 
liberties union of washington said from seattle that based on 
accounts she had read of the measure i think there are some 
serious civil liberties problems with the ordinance and were 
going to look into them further 
specifically there are problems with the loitering 
sections she said theyre going to arrest people for merely 
being in a certain location people who have already served time 
for drugs arent supposed to carry the burden with them they 
would be the target for special treatment 
people may be arrested for hanging out in their own 
neighborhood the breadth of the ordinance is very likely to cause 
people not at all engaged in illegal activity to get caught up in 
some sort of police action

hell to capture the white house

republican fundraisers rising to their 
stiffest democratic challenge in decades are working this 
convention week on their fall strategy and celebrating their 
success so far 
their challenge comes from robert farmer the vaunted democratic 
money man who has pledged to raise 50 million for democratic 
nominee michael dukakis effort in the fall presidential campaign 
that sum though unprecedented for a democrat has instilled 
newfound fervor in republican campaign donors 
were concerned about it said fred bush chief fundraiser 
of vice president george bushs campaign there seems to be a lot 
of interest in fund raising on the democratic side ive never seen 
that before 
bush no relation to george bush is responding by marshaling 
his own forces more than 600 contributors of 10000plus who are 
in town for the republican convention in addition to a full slate 
of parties the top 200 fundraisers held a 1hour meeting to plan 
their efforts in each state 
our guys understand they know whats going on out there 
fred bush said in an interview a lot of them have come to us and 
said i dont want the democrats to beat us on fund raising what 
can i do 
one thing they could do was attend a 1000perplate lunch at 
the city convention center to benefit the republican national 
committee the goal a whopping 4 million compared with 25 
million at the dallas gala in 1984 
its our one big gala every year said rnc spokeswoman 
katherine murray its an opportunity for us to honor the new 
nominee and vice presidential nominee its a celebration of our 
all being here together 
its also a chance for corporations to get in good with the gop 
by reserving tables at 100000 each and its a way for the 
republicans to stroke their wealthy supporters with a personal 
appearance by the nominee 
so far the republicans have done well at raising money for 
starters they have raised the legal limit of 83 million in 
privately donated money the campaign can spend directly that 
supplements 46 million from the federal government for direct 
spending 
they also have come up with about 7 million of a 25 million 
goal for state party accounts to be spent in coordination with the 
presidential campaign and several million dollars more for general 
partybuilding a separate item is the rncs operating budget 
beneficiary of thursdays gala 
if the democrats meet their goal theyre going to do better 
than theyve ever done said fred bush and we republicans are 
going to try to match them or even beat them

when alfred wilhelm traveled from germany 
to oshkosh in search of his roots he never expected to hit paydirt 
in a cemetery by meeting one of his living relatives there 
the 38yearold bavarian was diligently copying birth and death 
dates from headstones in the riverside cemetery last year when 
wilhelm mauritz walked by 
mauritz 84 was born in a farmhouse near the germanaustrian 
border in 1904 his father joseph wrote to three uncles living in 
oshkosh and asked them to sponsor their voyage to america they 
complied and the mauritz family came to america in 1905 on the 
steamship pennsylvania 
but mauritzs father did not forget his german relatives 
keeping in touch with them through letters and photographs the 
letters and photographs came back to his son via wilhelm

conversation with wilhelm at the cemetery wilhelm explained he was 
from munich researching his family history and then brought out a 
photograph a copy of the same picture mauritz had at home

sen dan quayle won an honorary degree from 
his alma mater depauw university in 1982 but it took more 
ballots than will be required tonight to give him the republican 
vice presidential nomination 
faculty members at the greencastle ind liberal arts college 
first voted not to award quayle the degree but relented after the 
university president said he had already invited quayle to be the 
schools commencement speaker 
professors were troubled that quayles youth brief record in 
congress and mediocre academic record made him a bad candidate for 
the honorary doctor of laws depauw professor o ralph raymond said 
wednesday night 
it wasnt that his career was undistinguished it was just 
that it was such a short career said raymond a specialist on 
soviet affairs who opposed the degree award 
i hope honorary degrees mean something and i think 
prematurity tends to trivialize them he said i was simply 
trying to protect two institutions the university and the honorary 
degree 
raymond said some faculty members thought quayle at 35 needed 
a longer record of accomplishment 
he added that certainly there were some people quite bothered 
by the fact that we were honoring a person whose intellectual 
achievements were unimpressive said raymond who never taught 
quayle we like to see students achieve a little bit more than he 
did 
the arguments of raymond and other opponents of the degree 
initially carried the day when the faculty voted 3224 against 
giving the award 
but then depauw president richard f rosser said he had already 
extended quayle an invitation to speak at commencement and pick up 
the degree 
about 16 faculty members wanting to avoid embarrassing rosser 
later switched their votes clearing the way for the award that 
quayle listed on his official campaign biography in 1986 
quayle is a 1969 graduate of depauw and an attorney trained at 
the indiana university law school 
another dispute followed the degree spat when two reporters at 
student radio station wgre broke the story 
they were fired for reporting on what rosser claimed was an 
offtherecord meeting a news supervisor at the station quit to 
protest 
quayle who once worked as a reporter at his fathers newspaper 
wrote a letter to the university to urge the reporters 
reinstatement 
he said the firings could have a chilling effect on freedom of 
the press 
the students didnt get their jobs back raymond said 
rosser is now president of the american association of 
independent colleges in washington dc he could not be reached 
for comment wednesday night

joaquin rabago feels an affinity for this 
mediterraneanstyle city with its easygoing atmosphere and 
cosmopolitan foods but he may be one of few visiting journalists 
whos seen much of new orleans 
rabago the washington bureau chief of efe an international 
news wire serving spain and latin america says the french quarter 
makes him nostalgic for spain 
the atmosphere the smells the food is the best ive had in 
the states by far he said theres some indolence about it 
savoir vivre things you dont find in other cities in the united 
states 
joel southern meanwhile has gotten acquainted mainly with the 
inside of the press room at the louisiana superdome site of the 
republican national convention 
southern here with the berns bureau a washingtonbased radio 
service said of the work area i probably know this room better 
than anyone else one day was about 32 hours long yesterday was 25 
or 26 
both rabago and southern are among the 12000 journalists in 
town for the convention many of whom dont have their own 
headquarters and work out of a common press room equipped with 
telephones and typewriters 
while hes glad to be in new orleans rabago says he cant 
understand why the republicans chose this city for their convention 
cabbies are telling him tales of former jobs in the oil drilling 
business he said underscoring the gap between the upbeat 
republican economic theme and the downbeat louisiana economy 
and then there is the french quarter 
all that eroticism and voluptuousness doesnt seem to fit into 
their message particularly the conservative sector he said 
though the city may remind rabago of spain it doesnt remind 
john ralston of home 
this place is much more decadent than las vegas said the 
reporter for the las vegas reviewjournal theres no place in 
las vegas where you can look from the street and see topless and 
bottomless dancing and women dancing in the streets virtually 
taking their clothes off 
the media visitors to new orleans range from correspondents for 
japanese newspaper groups to chris holly a reporter for the herald 
of rock hill sc circulation 30000 
we have a pretty hot republican team here theyre going 
places and we couldnt afford to ignore them said holly lee 
atwater george bushs campaign manager is from south carolina 
and gov carroll campbell was on bushs short list of vice 
presidential possibilities 
kawauchi takas washington correspondent for the mainichi 
newspaper group in japan said his predecessor had given him some 
tips on convention coverage if you go to a republican 
convention the first thing you notice will be the smell of the 
perfume if you go to a democratic convention the first thing you 
notice will be the smell of sweat he laughed i think my 
predecessors advice was not quite correct 
unlike reporters from bigtime news organizations many of those 
in the common press room are searching for local stories with 
mixed success 
reporters from southerns bureau had just completed sending a 
story to guam but werent having much luck for a client in 
edmonton alberta 
we tried to find the canadian observers down here but we 
couldnt southern said i tried a few free trade questions on 
some michigan delegates but they werent in a position to say 
anything intelligent said matt kaye 
yoichiro miwa chief of the nishinippon shimbun west japan 
dailys washington bureau said the 14hour time difference means 
we must work everyday until very late at night sometimes very 
early in the morning its very difficult for us to find sleeping 
time we are workaholics 
still he added i would like to go to the french quarter it 
is very popular in japan

the rich soil of the red river valley 
normally produces 40 bushels of red spring wheat per acre helping 
make canada the worlds secondlargest wheat exporter the drought 
of 1988 has changed that 
farmer glenn whitmore harvesting 300 acres in st norbert just 
south of winnipeg is getting just 10 bushels an acre from fields 
parched by the sun and infested with weeds and grasshoppers 
well at least weve got the seed back whitmore 35 said 
with resignation as he rode a mower over stunted foothigh stalks 
of wheat i dont know if theres any lessons in farming you 
just take it one year at a time 
things are worse in southern saskatchewan the countrys major 
wheat producer many farmers failed to get any crop at all in 
conditions likened to the dust bowl of the 1930s 
wheat and barley yields overall will be 50 percent below normal 
in alberta canadas other breadbasket province the weather has 
been whimsical to the point of perversity southern areas felt the 
full impact of the drought while farmers in the northern peace 
river region had 22 inches of rain and could collect bumper crops 
if their fields dried out long enough for harvesting 
across the prairies experts predict a harvest down at least 30 
percent from last year and that means canadas 105000 grain 
farmers will find it harder to fill orders from the soviet union 
japan china and other traditional markets 
its a terrible year said john morriss of the canadian 
wheat board the winnipegbased government marketing agency for 
prairie grain were going to have substantially reduced 
exports 
after selling 316 million metric tons of wheat and other 
prairie grain last year earning about 25 billion despite a 
global price war there may be just 15 million metric tons 
available for export this year 
a metric ton is equivalent to 2205 pounds or 11 short tons 
one of the major grain cooperatives united grain growers ltd 
estimated wednesday that the 1988 harvest of six major grains will 
total 317 million metric tons only 69 percent of last years 459 
million tons 
the reduction is even greater in comparison with the record 514 
million metric tons harvested in the west two years ago 
its sort of worse than people had hoped or thought said 
united grain official george weaver farmers that thought they 
might get 15 to 20 bushels an acre found they were getting 12 to 
15 
the company forecast a wheat harvest of 153 million metric 
tons down 40 percent while barley and rye harvests will be 40 to 
50 percent of normal in many areas 
we went into the season with virtually no snow or moisture 
reserves in the soil said dave mcintyre of the alberta wheat 
pool and some areas have still seen virtually no rain since last 
august 
things appear much brighter for the 279 floor traders at the 
winnipeg commodity exchange who have handled record volume this 
summer as speculators gambled on the future price of grain and 
prices almost doubled 
ive never seen so much action said bill craddock an 
independent dealer who also farms 3000 acres of wheat barley 
canola and flax 
he said the wildcard in the market is the farmer whos been able 
to fill his bins with grain but may let prices rise further before 
selling any of it a lot of farmers are just holding on 
craddock said 
most farming towns across the canadian prairies became towns 
because of the local grain elevator and railroad loading bay but 
the manitoba saskatchewan and alberta wheat pools expect to handle 
just 60 percent of normal traffic this season because of the 
drought 
that could have a devastating impact on isolated communities 
where elevators are closed down while the reduced volume also 
threatens jobs at grainhandling ports such as thunder bay and 
along the st lawrence seaway 
we depend on people coming into the town said manno wiens 
owner of a car repair shop in oak lake west of winnipeg where the 
grain elevator is to close later this year if a farmer blew a 
tire hed buy one from me now hell do it elsewhere 
prime minister brian mulroneys government is providing 23 
billion in aid to farmers this year and so fa there has been no 
mass exodus from the land due largely to crop insurance that 
covers up to 100 percent of losses 
but the drought of 1988 will be remembered as mcintyre said 
fathers who are thinking about handing over their farm to their 
kids are hesitating and saying maybe youd better think about it 
again

george bush has a problem with women voters 
and dan quayles blond good looks and youthful charm arent enough 
to help him out analysts of womens voting trends say 
the gender gap the difference between political preferences of 
men and women has been nettlesome for the republican presidential 
candidate this year polls show a significant lead for democratic 
nominee michael dukakis among women voters 
bush advisers some gop delegates and the vice president 
himself cited an appeal to women as one explanation for the 
selection of the indiana senator as bushs running mate 
we need the female vote hell do the trick said sharon 
estrada a delegate from billings mont hes very cute 
but the suggestion that quayle is attractive to female voters 
based on physical appearance rather than issues sparked 
disagreement and even outrage among some women 
oh come on thats stupid said delaware delegate lynn 
glaze who led a futile effort to add support for the equal rights 
amendment to the gop platform women will vote on the economic 
issue on the day care issue theyre not going to vote for someone 
because of his looks 
this is not a screen test this is about an election said 
jane danowitz executive director of the womens campaign fund the 
largest womens political action committee 
it appears like the republicans are attempting to woo the 
womens vote rather than win it its a sad strategy she said 
rep bill green rny warned that the gender gap is the 
major threat george bushs campaign faces 
dukakis has enjoyed an advantage among women over bush that is 
as large as 32 percentage points in a harris poll taken in late 
july other polls in the last six weeks have shown dukakis lead 
among women to be at least 12 percentage points 
the dukakis campaign believes the figure currently is about 18 
points said nikki heideprim dukakis adviser on the womens vote 
republican analysts saw the selection of quayle the 41yearold 
conservative indiana senator as a choice that carried appeal to 
his generation of young adults born after world war ii and to 
women voters 
i think he will be someone who will help the ticket with all 
the voters and particularly women voters of that generation 
said bush pollster robert teeter 
at his first news conference with quayle bush cited both those 
factors as well he called quayle a running mate who has record 
of strong appeal to young people and to women voters in his state 
because of his record 
nancy neuman president of the league of women voters said bush 
underestimated women voters if he believed quayle would help 
improve the gop tickets support among women because of his 
appearance 
do you think anybody would have said that about geraldine 
ferraro she said referring to the 1984 democratic nominee for 
vice president its sexist 
the idea that somebodys telegenic and gorgeous and thats why 
people will vote for him is patronizing neuman said 
political analysts say they believe the gender gap is driven by 
differences in the way women and men feel on key issues 
principally economic and social ones 
democratic polltaker mark mellman says the gender gap is 
becoming institutionalized that women tend to identify more with 
the democratic party 
the fact the bush people would even think the looks of a 
candidate would be important i think shows how profound their 
misunderstanding is of the nature and sources of their problem with 
women voters mellman said 
quayle has been an opponent of the equal rights amendment and is 
a fierce opponent of abortion he supports bushs plan for tax 
credits to lowincome families for child care beyond the existing 
child care credit and opposes national standards for day care 
quayle his supporters point out won a landslide reelection 
with 61 percent of the vote over a female opponent in 1986 he 
showed strength among both women and men voters although his 
opponent ran an underfinanced campaign 
quayle has been popular with middleaged and older women as a 
campaigner in indiana he frequently hugs an elderly woman or 
accepts a peck on the cheek when working the crowds at county fairs 
and parades 
after his selection quayle said women ought to resent the 
suggestion that they would vote for somebody on looks that is an 
insult to women i think its absolute nonsense it is demeaning to 
women

dan quayle has not yet been nominated for 
vice president and already republicans are comparing him to thomas 
jefferson and john f kennedy 
sen john warner of virginia who served with quayle on a senate 
subcommittee told an audience that whenever he heard the indiana 
senator speak id say there stands the next thomas 
jefferson 
and added warner he does have the same fire in his belly as 
our great forefather thomas jefferson of virginia 
former president gerald ford made the comparison with kennedy a 
democrat 
in 1960 the american people voted for john f kennedy for 
president and he was the relatively same age as dan quayle said 
ford john kennedy had been in the house and senate 14 years 
before he was elected president and dan quayles had 12 years 
what quayle thinks of those references isnt known but he 
doesnt like it when people say he looks like movie idol robert 
redford 
whether indeed he looks like redford seems to be in the eye of 
the beholder in the parlance of politics its an issue they are 
both male they are both blond 
the socalled resemblance became a point of contention in the 
1980 senate race and redford took umbrage the actor who once 
played the role of a presidential office seeker in the 
candidate sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the 
lookalike references in his congressional campaign literature 
quayle said the news media had made the comparison not he and 
after he was elected sent redford an autographed picture of himself 
and this week he told reporters he considered the socalled 
redford look a stigma he wasnt asked how he felt about being 
painted as another jefferson or kennedy 
meanwhile fellow senators were trying to publicize quayle who 
at 41 hasnt had a chance to become a legend he is a republican 
vice presidential candidate who is not as spiro agnew once said of 
himself a household word 
to help him get known eight fellow senators wednesday took 
turns telling reporters how much they liked him 
we know him well said strom thurmond rsc 
hes attractive because of his looks hes attractive because 
of his enthusiasm said sen john mccain rariz 
i think dan quayle although hes 41 years of age hes going 
to send a message to the american people that the republican party 
respects young people who achieve said sen pete domenici rnm 
oh yes hes also rich but the senators said that should not 
hold him back 
lets not start this business of whos wealthy sen alfonse

george bush surrounded by his grandchildren 
and other relatives watched from his hotel room wednesday night as 
his oldest son announced the roll call vote that delivered the 
republican presidential nod he has awaited so long 
the vice president grinned and applauded as son george w bush 
a delegate from texas announced the 111 votes that put the states 
favorite son and the worlds best father over the 1139 
delegates needed for nomination 
it is a special moment bush said the conclusion was 
foregone but its special 
in what looked like a bush family production scenes of the vice 
president in his hotel suite seated on a couch with his six of his 
10 grandchildren swarming over him were flashed on the large 
screens of the superdome as the balloting progressed 
his wife barbara sat for a while in the hall alongside sen 
dan quayle bushs vice presidential choice then later joined her 
husband to watch the roll call 
all of bushs five adult children are delegates to the 
convention his mexicanborn daughterinlaw columba delivered 
the final seconding speech for his nomination from the floor in 
spanish 
son neil announced the colorado vote daughter dorothy bush 
leblond called out the maine tally son marvin announced the vote 
from virginia vote speaking after the texas count had been posted 
as the texas vote approached bush exclaimed here we come 
heres the big moment then turning to his wife he pointed to 
the scene on television and said theres junior referring to 
his son by his nickname 
bush told reporters that his acceptance speech was all ready 
and that he was ready to go 
earlier bush had vowed to show off three generations of his 
family to america claiming i get my strength from my family 
the vote was the culmination of a campaign that began officially 
on oct 12 1987 and seemed on the verge of ending after his 
thirdplace finish in the iowa caucuses but bush bounced back with 
a victory in the new hampshire primary and then swept 16 primaries 
on super tuesday a showing that left little doubt this convention 
would belong to him 
bushs first bid for the presidency in 1980 and stunned many 
observers with his victory over ronald reagan in iowa but reagan 
was not to be denied and bush ended up as vice president 
his downtheline loyalty in that post earned him support from 
many conservatives and he picked up additional political support as 
a tireless campaigner and fundraiser for republican candidates a 
base that proved more difficult to shake than his gop rivals 
imagined 
during a news conference hours before he was to be nominated 
bush reacted indignantly to criticism of his introduction tuesday 
of his three mexicanamerican grandchildren as the little brown 
ones 
those grandchildren are my pride and joy and when i say 
pride i mean it he said his voice rising angrily 
for anyone to suggest that that comment of pride is anything 
other than what it was i find it personally offensive he went 
on and ps i dont want to see these kids hurt 
the three youngsters jeb jr noelle and george p are the 
children of bushs son jeb and his mexicanborn wife columba 
his family was also the subject of bush remarks moments later 
when he visited the california delegation 
im saying to myself youre going to have share more to show 
where you get your strength he told the delegates and i get 
my strength from my family 
bush said he intended to put them under the spotlight at the 
convention after he delivers his acceptance speech thursday bush 
will be joined at the podium by his four sons and daughter their 
spouses and 10 grandchildren 
the vice president and his advisers were clearly impressed by 
the family images projected at the democratic convention last month 
at which presidential nominee michael dukakis was joined on the 
podium by his wife and three children his mother and actress 
cousin in addition there was the prominent role given the five 
children of jesse jackson 
bush commented after that convention that dukakis did a good 
job at the convention with his speech and showing those wonderfully 
warm pictures 
bush aides said that after the convention bush and quayle would 
set out on a joint campaign trip through indiana ohio and illinois 
the latter two states key industrial battlegrounds in the fall 
election 
bush will head off without quayle on monday to address a vfw 
convention in chicago and then fly to the west coast for 
appearances in washington and california where he will make a 
joint appearance with reagan 
looking ahead to the campaign bush said he and quayle were 
going to tell the truth and its going to see like youve 
engaged a couple of pit bulls we will be telling the truth 
about where we want to lead this country spelling out my 
priorities

pat robertson said his republican 
presidential campaign sank partly because evangelicals arent a 
monolithic voting bloc willing to give him the overwhelming 
support that black voters handed to jesse jackson 
i learned they were not a monolithic group robertson said 
at a news conference on wednesday the day after he addressed the 
republican national convention the second thing i learned was 
that if they had supported me in the strength that the black people 
supported jesse jackson i would be standing on the platform 
tonight 
thats when bush is scheduled to formally accept the partys 
nomination 
the blacks supported jesse in numbers as high as 97 percent in 
many of the primaries robertson said evangelicals on the 
other hand were divided 
they were not monolithic he said thats not a bad thing 
but it limits their effectiveness 
robertson had been considered something of a wild card in the 
republican presidential field but he was never able to move beyond 
his base of fundamentalist christians and quickly fell by the 
wayside some have compared his role in the republican party with 
jacksons among democrats but the two candidates have resisted 
such comparisons 
on wednesday however robertson conceded that one of the major 
flaws in his campaign was that he was unable to mobilize his 
political base as effectively as did jackson 
robertson said he garnered a plurality among fundamentalists 
during the early tests but probably never won more than half of 
those voting 
i was coming out no 1 but i wasnt coming out with 60 or 
70 or 80 or 90 percent of them like jesse jackson was among black 
people robertson said i dont think i even had more than 
half thats sort of the polls ive read 
the biggest thing i was facing was not antagonism but 
apathy he said 
the former television evangelist conceded that other republican 
candidates were able to make significant inroads into his base 
each candidate spoke to the evangelicals addressing their 
concerns they all addressed the issues he said there was no 
clear choice like this is this good guy and this is the bad guy 
if i were a candidate in the future i think more and more of 
the evangelicals would say this man is the leader among us 
robertson said 
robertson expressed confidence that he would be handed a role in 
the fall election campaign but said no details had been spelled 
out 
ill be doing some traveling myself robertson said im 
sure they want our help 
in addition robertson said he would launch a voter registration 
drive among fundamentalists where he said there are large numbers 
still uninterested in politics despite his campaign 
robertson was evasive on questions about his future in the 
republican party but said there are no signs that his backers are 
leaving the political arena 
the people who are there now want to continue so thats the 
start of a base robertson said 
he rejected suggestions that that stance represented a threat to 
gop unity or that his forces would seek to take control of the 
partys machinery 
i dont like the concept of takeover robertson said its 
not necessary to do that 
he conceded the potential for conflict between his backers and 
the party establishment 
there are cultural differences between some of the 
evangelicals and some of the wealthier members of the republican 
party robertson said

at age 67 democratic vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen follows a lowfat diet takes a common 
medicine to keep his cholesterol level down and is in excellent 
health his doctor says 
i would say hes in better physical condition than men 20 
years younger than he is says antonio m gotto jr a houston 
internist 
bentsens wife beryl ann kidded about whether he had the body 
of a 41yearold said wednesday you bet no question about it 
bentsen is the oldest of the four men on the republican and 
democratic tickets this year democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis is 54 republican nominee george bush is 64 and 
his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana is the youngest at 41 
bentsens doctor said the senior senator from texas spends 18 
minutes a day on a treadmill or plays a vigorous game of tennis 
three to four times a week 
gotto said bentsen also inherited good genes from his father 
who is 94 and in good health and takes responsibility for his 
health by avoiding tobacco and limiting his intake of alcohol 
eating right and keeping his weight 167 pounds in check for his 
6foot1 frame 
he follows a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol of the 
type recommended by the american heart association gotto said in 
a statement released wednesday along with the senators income tax 
returns for the past five years 
those returns show bentsen and his wife paid an average of 
264453 annually in federal taxes on gross earnings averaging 
772181 between 1983 and 1987 
gotto bentsens personal physician since 1986 last examined 
him in april and prescribed a low dose of lovastatin a drug to 
reduce his cholesterol level from 245 milligrams per decaliter in 
early 1986 bentsens cholesterol level reached 267 
government guidelines say cholesterol counts of 245 are 
considered high risk 
gotto said that after the senator used the drug for a month his 
cholesterol level fell to 200 a level the government guidelines 
say is desirable 
bentsens spokesman jack devore said the senator continues to 
take medicine for his cholesterol level but that he requires only 
the lowest dose available 
results of the april physical were completely normal with the 
exception of a slight elevation of systolic blood pressure to 148 
and two small lesions on the skin gotto said 
a followup examination found bentsens blood pressure was normal 
and the skin lesions had disappeared 
in his financial disclosure report bentsen a former insurance 
executive did not declare his net worth on the campaign trail in 
lubbock texas bentsen said he did not know the precise figure 
frankly i havent made out a financial statement that has 
given me my net worth in a number of years i dont know what it 
is bentsen said 
however he added later i have paid a lot of taxes 
a source close to the senator who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he would not argue with other estimates that 
bentsens net worth exceeds 10 million 
bentsen also revealed wednesday that he had opened a blind trust 
because of his race for vice president holdings in the trust 
include interests in mineral leases and land mutual funds and 
common stock in more than a dozen wellknown companies such as 
chevron boeing exxon johnson amp johnson and unisys 
bentsens income tax returns for the years 1983 through 1987 
show that he and his wife earned a high of 1020607 in 1983 and a 
low of 597906 in 1984 he paid his highest taxes of 403932 in 
1983 and a low of 155329 the following year 
the couple had gross earnings of 604587 and taxes of 253098 
in 1985 gross earnings of 718237 and taxes of 298495 in 1986 
and gross earnings of 919566 and taxes of 211411 in 1987 
the threeterm senator and his wife also distributed an average 
of 21381 in charitable contributions during each of those five 
years about 28 percent of their income their federal taxes over 
the five years averaged 342 percent of adjusted gross income 
bentsen also issued new financial disclosure forms which mixed 
his blind trust income and assets with other holdings and earnings 
the new figures considerably increased his reported worth from 
the financial disclosure report he filed with the senate last may 
which did not include details of the blind trusts holdings 
the new figures show assets ranging from 51 million to more 
than 79 million income ranging from 894000 to more than 2 
million and liabilities ranging from 260000 to 615000 
in his may statement which covered his assets income and 
liabilities as of the end of 1987 bentsen reported income ranging 
from 296000 to 418000 assets of 14 million to 2 million 
and liabilities of 100000 to 250000 
the disclosure forms only require a range of figures for all 
categories in addition to his other earnings bentsen earns 
89500 annually in senate salary

president mohammed zia ulhaq who guided 
pakistan for 11 years enjoyed close ties with the united states 
despite liabilities that would have doomed that relationship had he 
governed a less strategically important country 
zias refusal to be intimidated by the presence of over 100000 
soviet troops in neighboring afghanistan overrode all other 
considerations in washington enabling pakistan to be among the 
largest recipients of american assistance 
zia who died wednesday in a plane crash along with us 
ambassador arnold l raphel and an american brigadier general 
allowed usbacked afghan rebels to use pakistan as a staging 
ground for attacks on afghanistan he also permitted pakistan to be 
used as a safe haven for 3 million afghan refugees 
so dependent was the reagan administration on pakistan for 
achieving its policy goals in afghanistan that washington 
softpedaled other aspects of zias rule that many in congress 
found objectionable 
secretary of state george p shultz in new orleans on wednesday 
for the republican national convention credited zia with inducing 
the soviet union to begin withdrawing its forces from afghanistan 
the reagan administration normally favors multiparty democracy 
but essentially remained silent in the face of zias scornful 
attitude toward his countrys political parties 
he decreed that the nov 16 national elections would be 
conducted on a nonparty basis meaning that the largely illiterate 
pakistani population will not have the benefit of party symbols 
when they cast their ballots 
if you have the spirit of democracy why insist on the form 
zia asked an interviewer recently why must there be parties 
there are also congressional concerns about pakistans role as 
source of supply for usbound heroin 
but the greatest concern to members of congress was the 
suspicion that pakistan under zias rule was developing or 
already has developed a nuclear weapons capability 
us law prohibits aiding countries that acquire uranium 
enrichment technology and do not put it under the international 
atomic energy agencys safeguard system 
sen john glenn dohio has criticized the reagan 
administration for aiding pakistan even though that country has not 
provided ironclad assurances that it is not building nuclear 
weapons 
leonard spector an expert on the spread of nuclear weapons has 
said available evidence leaves little doubt that pakistan is 
indeed developing nuclear arms 
president reagan has certified repeatedly that pakistan has not 
developed such a capability and therefore is eligible for continued 
us assistance the us aid program totals 328 billion over six 
years a generous sum in an age of worldwide aid cutbacks 
to sen gordon humphrey rnh zias critics overlooked his 
role as a bulwark against soviet imperialism a sentiment he 
repeated wednesday while attending the gop conclave in new orleans 
after zias death the state department was quick to reaffirm 
support for pakistan 
we have a long history of close and friendly cooperation with 
pakistan department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said at this 
moment of extreme trial i want to reiterate our commitment to 
pakistan and our full support for the acting president and his 
government 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick wondered 
whether pakistans strong stand on afghanistan would continue under 
zias successors and whether the country would be able to contain 
islamic fundamentalists 
she called zia a very strong person very important to the 
whole geopolitical strategic constellation of the region very 
important to the freedom fighters of afghanistan

the navy says it has agreed to delayed 
delivery of the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier george washington 
under a mutually agreeable proposal by the contractor the newport 
news shipbuilding amp drydock co 
the delay will total six months and push the scheduled delivery 
date for the huge nimitzclass carrier from dec 29 1991 to july 
3 1992 the navy said 
the change will not affect the price of the carrier the navy 
said the service said it approved the delay to help newport news 
set up the most costeffective and efficient construction 
schedule possible for carrier work that will extend at least 
through 1998 
newport news shipbuilding a division of tenneco inc is the 
only shipyard in the country capable of building the 
nuclearpowered carriers the yard is in the midst of constructing 
the abraham lincoln which is scheduled to be delivered dec 29 
1989 and the george washington 
last fall at the navys urging congress agreed to add funding 
for two additional nuclear carriers to ensure that replacements are 
available when two older conventionally powered carriers are 
retired in the 1990s 
during the debate newport news officials said awarding such 
contracts now would save taxpayer money by avoiding disruptions to 
the companys labor force 
according to lt bruce cole a navy spokesman the navy 
approached newport news after receiving congressional approval and 
asked the company to propose the most costeffective carrier 
construction schedule to include those they were already working 
on 
the company responded that a 30month interval between ship 
deliveries would be more efficient than the 24month interval that 
was originally set for lincoln and washington said cole 
at no cost to the government we have accepted a 30month 
interval between the lincoln and washington as well as a 30month 
interval between deliveries for the two that will follow 
jack schnaedter a spokesman for newport news said the company 
proposed a 30month interval because we think that will be the 
optimum for ensuring workforce stability avoiding big 
fluctuations 
its really just a matter of keeping the workforce stable 
thats all as we move from one carrier to the next he said 
the navy estimates the lincoln and washington will cost a total 
of 612 billion while the two followon carriers ordered this 
year will cost an estimated 6325 billion 
newport news receives slightly more than half of those totals 
with the remainder going for the nuclear reactors and other 
equipment purchased separately from other contractors by the navy 
the navy informed congress of its acceptance of the new delivery 
date for the washington in a quarterly selected acquisition report 
filed tuesday the acquisition report is mandated by congress to 
help keep tabs on the cost and production schedules of all major 
weapon programs 
the george washington will be the sixth nimitzclass carrier 
delivered to the navy by newport news

bones buttons and bullets uncovered at 
recently discovered graves near the antietam battleground in 
western maryland are providing new details about a pivotal civil 
war battle that included the bloodiest day in american military 
history 
researchers for the smithsonian institution and the us 
national park service say the graves are of four members of the 
famed irish brigade from new york 
the four died sept 17 1862 as wave after wave of irish 
brigade soldiers smashed against the confederate line and were cut 
down by rifle fire on a day that saw 24000 soldiers union and 
confederate fall in battle 
examination of a shoulder blade and teeth found in one of the 
sites shows that a 45yearold man helped lead the union charge 
this gentleman was in the front rank as the irish brigade 
tried to dislodge the confederate troops on that day stephen 
potter an archaeologist for the us national park service said 
at news conference wednesday 
potter said discovery of buck and ball ammunition indicates 
that the irish brigade was not wellarmed for the battle it met 
that day 
the irishmen he said were carrying smoothbore long guns 
loaded to fire a marblesized ball and two buckshot pellets 
these were in effect combat shotguns he said that killed 
best at close range 
based on the confederate slugs that killed the 45yearold new 
yorker said potter the rebels were using rifled long guns that 
were lethal from long distances as a result he said the 
confederates were able to kill the union troops at 200 yards long 
before the yankees could charge to within the effective range of 
their weapons 
the burial sites were found in april by three amateur 
archaeologists searching a field near the boundaries of the 
federally owned battleground near hagerstown md a team from the 
smithsonian and the park service excavated the site and sifted tons 
of clay soil to find artifacts 
dennis f frye park service historian said the battle of 
antietam named after the creek which flows through the grounds is 
considered by many to be pivotal in the civil war though it ended 
in a draw frye said the battle halted the souths first invasion 
of the north persuaded france and england to withhold recognition 
of the confederate government and encouraged president lincoln a 
few weeks later to issue the emancipation proclamation that freed 
the slaves 
the battle also marked the first time that the union army 
retained command of a battleground after a clash with southern 
troops 
it was the bloodiest single day in united states military 
history said frye in 12 hours of fighting there were four 
times more casualties than on dday the allied invasion of 
europe in world war ii 
the battle which confederates named the battle of sharpsburg 
after the nearest village pitted 40000 confederate troops under 
gen robert e lee against 46000 troops of the federal army of the 
potomac under maj gen george b mcclellan 
though undefeated lee withdrew the next day across the potomac 
river into virginia mcclellan who had 40000 troops in reserve 
later was criticized for not attempting to the block the southern 
withdrawal 
the attack by the irish brigade came at midday the union troops 
were sent against a confederate line dug in along a sunken road 
within a few hours bodies were piled like cordwood and that small 
road became known to history as the bloody lane 
douglas owsley a physical anthropologist at the natural history 
museum said the recently discovered shoulder blade showed evidence 
of arthritis and that teeth from the same body were heavily worn 
this suggests he said that the soldier was about 45 years of age 
this makes him somewhat unique said owsley since most of 
the soldiers in the irish brigade were young volunteers because of 
the unusual age he said there is a chance that the middleaged 
soldier may be identified by name

the president of eastern airlines says paying 
sister carrier continental airlines 30 million to hire and train 
pilots in the event of a strike is the equivalent of a corporate 
insurance policy 
eastern president phil bakes was questioned about the plan 
during crossexamination wednesday by lawyers challenging easterns 
plan to curtail service to 14 cities and lay off 4000 employees 
three unions are seeking to prove in the case that texas air 
corp the parent company of eatern and continental is trying to 
break the power of organized labor at eastern by transferring 
assets of the financially troubled airline to its nonunion 
subsidiaries such as continental 
bakes said the 30 million payment to continental will assure 
the company has 400 pilots in case eastern pilots honor a walkout 
by the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers 
the machinists union the air line pilots association and the 
transport workers union obtained an injunction temporarily blocking 
easterns plans to reduce its service and close its kansas city hub 
by sept 1 
us district judge barrington d parker is conducting hearings 
to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction 
the unions also are trying to undermine the companys argument 
that the service cutbacks are needed because the airline is short 
on cash 
the unions contend that the planned layoffs cannot take place 
unless eastern negotiates with its employees under the railway 
labor act 
bakes testified that in addition to the 30 million payment for 
pilot hiring and training eastern loaned continental 40 million 
in june at an interest rate of 175 percent asked by the judge to 
explain the loan bakes said the company didnt want its money to 
be idle 
eastern wants to concentrate its service along the east coast 
and to the caribbean and latin america bakes testified earlier 
this week that the kansas city hub has lost money virtually since 
eastern opened it in 1983 
he testified that the operational changes would save the company 
100 million

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen is aiming his pitch at democrats who strayed from the 
party to vote for ronald reagan as he tours his home state on 
behalf of the democratic ticket 
although confident of his own popularity in texas bentsen has 
to persuade some of his more conservative state supporters to vote 
for michael dukakis if democrats are to win the states 29 
electoral votes 
bentsen on wednesday appealed to those voters both in public and 
in private as he traveled from the city of fort worth to the 
ranching area of san angelo to a medical center in lubbock to the 
oil town of tyler 
i know that this county is principally republican bentsen 
told the 250 people gathered for a picnic at fort concho in san 
angelo i also know that lloyd bentsen carried this county by 58 
percent last time 
he told them that dukakis selection of a texan for the ticket 
showed the massachusetts governor was reaching out ready to 
listen to differing viewpoints 
he then traveled to lubbock where he was greeted at the airport 
by a dozen supporters carrying bentsen us senator placards 
but none of the dukakisbentsen signs hed like to see 
he attended a demonstration of a new program to diagnose rural 
patients via television at the texas tech medical center and then 
slipped away to meet with some 200 to 300 longtime supporters of 
his senate campaigns to make his pitch in private the meeting was 
closed to the press 
later in tyler he met with another support group again out 
of the view of reporters and again bentsens senate paraphernalia 
was in abundance but nothing for the dukakisbentsen ticket 
robert cargill of nearby longview one of those invited for the 
dinner sponsored by east texans for texas said dukakis addition 
of bentsen to the ticket might be enough for him to support it 
maybe he said 
bentsen is also explaining to his constituents both in his 
appearances and through television ads why he is running at the 
same time for reelection to his senate seat 
texas law allows him to do that and if he didnt his republican 
opponent rep beau boulter would automatically win a sixyear 
term if he won both races bentsen could resign from the senate 
and force a special election giving the democrats a chance to hold 
the seat 
as he traveled bentsen was peppered with questions about his 
personal wealth and his health as a result of the release of 
records monday by his washington office 
the disclosures showed the 67yearold senator is in good 
health although he has been treated for high cholesterol his 
financial records revealed he has earned more than 38 million 
over the past five years but they dont disclose his net worth 
i dont know what my net worth is he said frankly i 
havent made out a financial statement that has given me my net 
worth in a number of years 
as hes been hunting for conservative votes bentsen also has 
been taking some shots at republican george bushs choice for a 
running mate indiana sen dan quayle 
i guess well have an early season on quail he told 
reporters 
bentsen brushed aside the age difference between him and the 
41yearold quayle 
its not the miles on you its the depth of the tread he 
said

the department of energy has moved to shut 
down a nuclear reactor used in weapons production in the wake of a 
power surge that occurred last week while operators were seeking to 
restart the reactor 
ernest c baynard iii assistant secretary for environment 
safety and health said wednesday night that the incident involved 
the preactor one of three reactors located at the savannah river 
plant in south carolina 
theyre bringing it down to zero power level he said 
the two other savannah river weapons reactors also are shut down 
one of them for a scheduled maintenance outage and the other due 
to safety concerns 
baynard said the government is particularly concerned that 
operators of the reactor continued building up power despite the 2 
percent power spike an abrupt and unexpected increase in 
temperature and pressure 
in simple terms its not the machine that bothers me so much 
as the reaction of the people running it he said so weve had 
a lot of discussion with them savannah river plant officials 
about what we need to do here 
in aiken sc a spokesman for the du pont co which operates 
the complex for the energy department said the reactor had been 
shut down while an independent review panel investigates the aug 
79 restart process 
the spokesman clif webb said the review panel has questions 
and concerns about the operators decision to continue to build 
power in the reactor although there were indications of problems in 
maintaining a nuclear reaction 
according to webb the reactor was shut down aug 9 then 
restarted briefly after tests showed that the problem was a buildup 
of helium in the reactor vessel 
du pont then proposed this week that the reactor be shut down 
early for routine testing that had been scheduled for september so 
that the reactor would be out of service while the review panel 
studied the restart incident webb said 
jim gaver an energy department spokesman at the savannah river 
plant said wednesday night that the concern of the oversight panel 
is not whether that restart process was safe but a question 
about the procedures and the contractors checks and balances 
the concern is whether it would have been more prudent to 
examine unusual reactor readings at a lower power level gaver said

the martians landed in central new jersey and 
swept north toward new york city tearing up rail phone and power 
lines crushing houses and trees slaughtering thousands of 
soldiers sent to stop them 
the invaders apparent objective broadcaster douglas edwards 
intoned wednesday was to crush resistance paralyze 
communication and disorganize human society 
very bad news doug said his colleague steve allen 
maybe but nothing to worry about 
fifty years after orson welles caused national hysteria with his 
radio drama the war of the worlds martians are again invading 
the airwaves in a new production based on hg wells novel 
this is not a nostalgia piece director david ossman said 
before allen and edwards taped their parts in the drama which will 
be broadcast oct 30 on public radio stations its supposed to 
be realistic and contemporary the listener should react as if 
its really happening 
some changes have been made in howard kochs original script 
intercontinental radio news has become satellite news crowded 
interstate highways have replaced parkways and lasers amtrak and 
jet fighter planes have been added as have interviews with 
contemporary figures such as science fiction writer ray bradbury 
and scientist carl sagan 
and news of the invasion is broadcast to the nation not by the 
secretary of the interior as in 1938 but by the vice president 
he is not identified by name but he has just returned from texas 
where he was preparing for a final preelection campaign rally 
plans call for an actor to mimic george bush 
although welles production included a mild disclaimer it was 
introduced as a radio play at the beginning and before intermission 
the new version will have none 
were going to go seamlessly onto the air said producer 
judith walcutt alluding to the fact that welles was not punished 
50 years ago she said at least theres no precedent for suing 
the producer 
welles role that of astronomer richard pierson will be played 
by jason robards other players include scott simon and terry gross 
of national public radio 
the adaptation of kochs original script is not without humor 
after the vice presidents address edwards intones this action 
may prove to be an asset to his standing in the polls 
edwards recorded his part in jacksonville fla while allen did 
his simultaneously at wnyc radio later moving to a rooftop near 
wall street for a final broadcast in which he is overcome by poison 
smoke unleashed by the martians 
the entertainer said he was one of those fooled in 1938 
i didnt hear the beginning of the show allen said i was 
17 and i was on the ninth floor of a rundown hotel on the near 
north side of chicago with my mother and aunt take three otherwise 
normal people who believe the world is about to end turn them 
loose in chicago and you have a situation comedy 
we raced down the hall and pressed the elevator buzzer the 
gentleman running the elevator opened the door with a big smile 
that quickly faded because he became hip we were coocoo my aunt 
said theyre up in the air he said who is 
however gullible the audience this time around ossman whose 
baby son orson was present for the taping said he expected no 
hysteria instead of frightening people it will give them a lot

a demonstration by a group of skinheads 
sparked a shouting match with a group of young republicans who 
briefly were aligned against them with some anarchists in town for 
the gop convention 
emotions ran so high during the confrontation wednesday at 
lafayette square that 50 police officers stood twodeep to protect 
the skinheads while they held forth on a stage promoting their 
separatist beliefs 
one person was arrested later as the skinheads were escorted 
from the park by a phalanx of police 
the stage and a sound system were set up for demonstrations 
during the republican national convention but as has been the 
case all week neither gop politics nor presidential nominee 
george bush was a topic 
the afternoons bitter exchanges were the most heated at the 
stage in three days of demonstrations 
most of the protests have been uneventful with many of the 
90minute time slots for demonstrations going unclaimed 
the skinheads with shaved heads military boots and camouflage 
pants railed wednesday against minorities blaming blacks jews 
and hispanics for the worlds ills 
the crowd shouted back no fascists no kkk 
one cluster in the crowd carrying signs denouncing fascism and 
nazism was joined in chants by the collegeaged republicans some 
of whom were wearing suits with their green guest passes to the 
convention still hanging around their necks 
then about 20 members of a third group calling themselves 
anarchists showed up with antiracist leaflets and joined in the 
shouting 
the anarchists have been at the stage during the week with their 
own guerrilla theater advocating a dismantling of government 
in favor of community rule 
the exchanges grew more and more heated as the skinheads on 
stage harangued the audience with denunciations of minorities 
the young republicans jeered and called the skinheads communists 
the people on stage responded that those out front were 
ignorant prompting cries of nazi scum 
we stand behind our separatist beliefs a speaker retorted 
segregation is the only way 
a small number of passersby laughed in disbelief 
after the demonstration ended about 25 of the police encircled 
the halfdozen skinheads and escorted them safely to their cars two 
blocks away 
earlier the young republicans had jeered gay activitists who 
called for steppedup efforts to fight aids

texas sen phil gramm one of the potential 
leaders of the republican right wing delivered a blistering 
declaration to party delegates that michael dukakis would wimp 
america and endanger peace 
the senator from bushs adopted home state praised george bush 
as the greatest vice president this nation has ever had as he 
placed bushs name in nomination wednesday before the convention 
roll call 
but gramm a democratturnedrepublican widely assumed to have 
presidential aspirations turned the focus back on the democratic 
nominee on a night that was otherwise devoted to bush 
he taxed the poor taxed the rich taxed the young taxed the 
old and taxed the middle class gramm said of dukakis he taxed 
businesses and he taxed families 
he said dukakis broke his promise to voters in his first term as 
governor of massachusetts by raising taxes and in his second term 
increased state spending and brought on massachusetts 400 million 
deficit he said dukakis has opposed every major new weapons 
system that we have deployed 
gramm elicited loud shouts of no from the delegates as he 
asked 
given his record is there anybody here who doubts that a 
president dukakis would raise our taxes 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis 
would spend our workers into poverty 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis 
would cut defense wimp america and endanger peace 
gramms selection to deliver bushs nominating speech added a 
touch of texas to the republican convention as a counterpoint to 
the heavy texas influence of the democratic convention in atlanta 
last month it was the texas delegations vote by arrangement 
that gave bush the delegate majority and the presidential 
nomination during the roll call 
in atlanta the podium was filled with texans in the democrats 
calculated effort to win that major electoral state in the fall a 
plan capped by the selection of gramms senior colleague in the 
senate lloyd bentsen as the democratic vice presidential nominee 
gramm best known nationally for the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law became a republican only five years ago he 
bolted the democratic party as a congressman rejecting it as not 
conservative enough and won election to the senate in his new 
party 
he was disqualified by the us constitution from joining the 
ticket as bushs running mate by their shared texas home as a 
favorite of many in the gops most conservative wing gramm is 
considered a likely presidential candidate in 1982 should bush 
falter although bushs elevation of running mate dan quayle to 
the upper reaches of party leadership may displace him 
the nominating speech delivering gramm a primetime television 
audience and his most visible party platform triggered a planned 
flagwaving demonstration on the floor of the massive superdome 
convention hall as 50000 bright balloons fell from the high 
ceiling

byelorussian newspaper about the discovery of the graves in kurpati 
forest outside the byleorussian capital of minsk had stirred 
the whole republic 
from 1937 to 1941 every day they shot people who were brought 
here by cars according to moscow news a weekly at the forefront 
of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness 
the thickly forested area of about 32 acres was surrounded 
during the 1930s and 1940s by a solid wood fence topped by barbed 
wire witnesses said

terrible place where from which day and night were heard shots 
screams cries and pleadings moscow news said 
one witness was quoted as saying people were shot in batches and 
that dogs guarded the area

the minuteman statue a symbol of revolutionary 
readiness appears to have retreated a bit under a barrage of heat 
and humidity 
a black resinous substance has dripped from the musket of the 
113yearold statue making it appear as if the minuteman melted 
beneath the 90degree plus heat officials said wednesday 
when it gets hot and i expect the inside of that statue must 
be very hot the substance liquefies said bob nash 
superintendent of the minute man national historic park in concord 
the most likely explanation is that a material applied to the 
monument in 1975 to make a protective plaster casting of the 
monument seeped into the statue and has been liquefied by heat and 
humidity said ed mcmanus a national park service conservator in 
boston 
its rabbit skin glue that got into the interior of the 
gunstock the musket stock when molds were made to reproduce the 
statue in plaster mcmanus said the rabbit skin glue is 
soluble so thats dissolving and dripping out 
the glue was often used in the 1970s to generate casts of 
delicate sculptures the substance is applied as a liquid and then 
hardens creating an impression that is then transferred to plaster 
this summer is the second time the substance has leaked nash 
said 
mcmanus said rainwater has built up in the statue which was 
cast in sections and the resulting humidity made the resin run he 
said the substance doesnt pose any threat to the monument but the 
statue probably will be cleaned out 
its primarily a cosmetic problem he said 
the minuteman statue was sculpted in 1874 by daniel chester 
french who later designed the statue of a seated abraham lincoln 
at the lincoln memorial in washington dc 
the concord statue depicts the citizensoldier a musket in one 
hand and a plow in the other surveying the old north bridge in 
1775 a small group of minutemen nicknamed for the time it took 
them to prepare for battle drove british soldiers off the bridge 
concord draws on the battle for its claim as the birthplace of 
the american revolution

the northern spotted owl an elusive denizen of 
virgin forests in the northwest has emerged to silence chain saws 
in big sections of ancient timber stands of washington and oregon 
prodded by environmental groups the us forest service intends 
this fall to approve a ban on logging and other development in 
347700 of the 13 million acres of oldgrowth forest within 13 
national forests in the two states government and environmental 
officials said wednesday 
the plan aimed at protecting the spotted owl and other wildlife 
from the effects of logging in their unique forest habitat has 
drawn sharp criticism from the timber industry 
timber spokesmen contend that the spotted owl needs no such 
protection and that the move is just one of several environmental 
steps to cripple or shut down the industry which is in the midst 
of a record cutting year 
oldgrowth timber which is anywhere from 200 to 600 years old 
is prized by the industry for its higherquality grain oldgrowth 
species include cedar hemlock douglas fir and spruce 
i see it as one more thing by those who are trying to put the 
timber industry out of business said bob dick a spokesman for 
the washington forest protection association a protimber 
organization based in olympia when is enough enough when do we 
stop setting things aside and start managing what we have 
an environmentalist said steps to protect the owl which will 
nest only in the ancient trees and its forest habitat probably 
will protect neither in the long run 
the future of the northwest ancient forests is dire unless 
forest service policies are changed said jean durning the 
northwest regional director of the wilderness society there is 
far less ancient forest left than the forest service has recognized 
and clearcuts are being plopped into the middle of extensive 
stands so fast that in very few years we will have no major intact 
stretches of ancient forest 
logging companies this year expect to equal last years alltime 
highest yield of nearly 5 billion board feet from the national 
forests of washington and oregon which produce up to half the 
timber taken from the nations public forest lands 
the owlprotection plan is scheduled to be signed soon by forest 
service chief f dale robertson said grant gunderson an agency 
wildlife biologist based in portland ore who helped write the 
plan a 30day period in which the public may comment began aug 11 
the forest services goal is to protect the native habitat of 
not only the spotted owl but a broad array of other wildlife 
gunderson said 
the owl is the focus of the forest services plan because it is 
viewed by federal wildlife biologists as as the best indicator 
species if the owls habitat is protected then many other 
wildlife in the same ecosystem also will thrive they said 
despite warnings from environmentalists the us fish and 
wildlife service does not include the spotted owl on its list of 
endangered species the forest service believes that about 1600 
pairs live in northwest forests 
the owl and other wildlife in oldgrowth forests already are 
protected from development in 751000 acres of oldgrowth forest 
designated as federal wilderness areas or set aside for research 
said sandy knight another forest service biologist who is based 
in washington state 
the forest service chose to set aside additional acreage to 
protect the owl only after several environmental organizations 
filed a complaint with the department of agriculture in 1984 
contending that failure to protect the spotted owl would violate 
the national forest management act of 1976 by failing to maintain 
viable populations of native wildlife durning said 
the timber industry however considers closure of the areas in 
question an overreaction we see this as just one more chink in 
the land base we have to have to meet timber demand dick said 
the forest service calculates that the net effect of the 
protection plan will reduce by about 5 percent northwest forest 
land available for timber harvest for a loss of 163 million board 
feet

in the battle of insults the democrats are 
ahead to stay republican convention scriptwriters say thats all 
right claiming they have sworn off namecalling in favor of 
something called comparative comment 
the gop line is a fine one invisible in fact 
comparative discussion on the issues is not negative said 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager comparative discussion means 
that before denouncing michael dukakis republican orators speak 
highly of george bush 
at their atlanta convention the democrats volleyed insults at 
bush he was born with a silver foot in his mouth he was a 
toothache of a man bush was born on third base and thinks he 
tripled 
where was george the democrats chanted 
republicans said their convention would skip epithets in favor 
of substance an admirable resolve and probably a good idea since 
they show little knack for pithy putdowns 
the quotable political insult is a oneliner republican insults 
tend to take longer 
sen bob dole of kansas did manage a quickie wednesday night 
calling the democratic presidential nominee one of those liberals 
with strange ideas dukakeyed ideas yes dukakeyed ideas 
about the way the world works 
but dole is the republicans wisecracker he said hed called 
sen dan quayle the youthful gop vice presidential candidate and 
found him shaving for the first time 
more typical are orators like alexander haig the defeated 
presidential candidate who told the convention that the democratic 
ticket is like a bat flying erratically for brief periods at low 
levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark damp 
caves up to its navel in guano bush monitors tried to get haig 
to tone down his talk but he wouldnt 
or the double bank shot of sen phil gramm of texas who said 
the democrats werent nasty to bush because theyre tacky nasty 
lowrent people but rather because they are trying to avoid the 
real issues 
jerry curry running for congress in virginia beach va got a 
moment on the platform and used it to say i suspect that neither 
dukakis nor jim wright ever met a communist they didnt love 
that harks back to themes of another unpleasant political era but 
it passed with scant notice 
the question is not wheres george said sen alan simpson 
of wyoming the question is whos mike that invited a chant 
but there was none apparently these republicans are not into 
responsive readings 
dukakis said he didnt think the gop shots would do him any 
political harm hes already unloaded what atwater called the 
oscarwinner of offensive remarks blaming president reagan for 
ethical shortcomings in the administration the fish rots from 
the head first dukakis said 
that is the yardstick said atwater ill guarantee you 
will not see that kind of invective coming out of here 
but outrage scripted outrage is another matter ill be 
damned if i will stand by and let anyone with a smirk and a sneer 
discredit george bush former president gerald r ford told 
the convention in rebuttal to sen edward m kennedys where was 
george taunt 
later ford said he hadnt identified kennedy because i 
couldnt remember the name of that creature he also called 
kennedy some nonentity those are not memorable gibes but 
its a beginning 
new jersey gov thomas kean the keynote speaker who didnt get 
to the microphone until the convention was half over used a show 
business simile for his keynote insult the dukakis democrats 
will try to talk tough he said but dont be fooled they may 
talk like dirty harry but they will still act like pee wee herman 
dirty harry is the tough cop played by actor clint eastwood pee 
wee herman is a squeakyvoiced movie and television weakling or 
wimp 
while keans was a betterthanaverage gop taunt the need for 
an explanatory footnote illustrates one of the insult problems in 
new orleans snide political remarks lose punch when they have to 
be explained gop remarks often need explanation 
sen gramm placing bushs name in presidential nomination 
wednesday night seized the dreaded wimp issue making the word 
into a verb and using it to slap the amnesia merchants of the 
democratic ticket 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis 
would cut defense wimp america and endanger peace he asked 
score two for gramm because that is inventive as well as 
insulting until he commandeered wimp the w word had been 
used by bushs detractors and avoided by his fans

a new study indicates that changes by the 
federal government and efforts by the blue cross and blue shield 
health insurance plans to contain hospital costs may be working 
according to the study released wednesday the private payers 
reduced their payments to hospitals by 48 billion over a 
threeyear period 
the study appears to counter claims made in 1983 when the 
federal government changed the way it reimbursed hospitals for 
medicare patients and experts predicted that would result in 
hospitals recouping losses from private insurors such as blue cross 
richard scheffler a california health economist who conducted 
the study covering the years 1983 to 1986 said hospitals tended 
to apply the guidelines set under medicares prospective payment 
system to their private patients as well 
it the prospective payment system ended up profoundly 
changing the overall operation of the hospital scheffler told a 
news conference 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he said some of the savings realized by blue cross and blue 
shield plans resulted from medicaredriven changes at hospitals and 
some from the private insurorss own costcontainment strategies

soprano angelina reaux confidently mixes acting 
with singing kurt weill songs in stranger here myself now 
running at the offbroadway susan stein shiva theater in the public 
theater complex 
her fullbodied operatic voice is sure and attractive and her 
acting isnt overdone her show is effective to a degree but isnt 
a completely rewarding evening of theater the ingredient thats 
missing is the ability to convey the emotion of the songs through 
the sound of her voice 
the stage is set as a hotel room with a few small tables lamps 
a chair and a red spread on the bed miss reaux wears a black 
dress has a small battered suitcase she sings one song after 
another not making a story line but acting each of them 
in the barbara song from the threepenny opera when she 
recounts saying no to men but not saying no to macheath she lies 
on the bed and grabs the headboard as though shes in bondage 
in the title song im a stranger here myself with its 
catchy melody and lyrics by ogden nash from one touch of 
venus shes tipsy while really delivering the song the next 
surabaya johnny has her whimpering reaching toward a bottle 
of pills apparently considering suicide then she lightens the 
mood again with foolish heart also from one touch of venus 
her operatic voice is perfect for lonely house from street 
scene but lowdown irony is needed for solomon song from 
threepenny opera and miss reaux doesnt deliver it 
there are survivors in kurt weill songs theres tragedy 
heartbreak abuse hopeless love daydreams of ships coming in and 
rescuing a life theyre greatly to be enjoyed by people who like 
strong songs instead of wimpy ones theyre enjoyed less by people 
who prefer upbeat sentiments and situations 
miss reaux has sung a great deal for conductor leonard 
bernstein which is a strong recommendation her show which had 
three instrumentalists was directed by christopher alden 
however anybody who has heard teresa stratas also an opera 
singer sing weill knows that she can be bawdy despairing 
misguided hardhearted or swaggeringly stoical just through the 
sound of her voice that has a stronger impact that miss reaux 
singing as she acts out the songs sentiments

us and soviet officials say their 
historic joint nuclear weapons test explosion could be the first 
step toward a world without atomic bombs 
wednesdays joint verification experiment was the culmination of 
a fouryear effort to slow the nuclear arms race and a product of 
better ussoviet relations 
it was the first time soviet scientists joined their american 
counterparts in the control room at the topsecret nevada test site 
to monitor a nuclear weapons explosion fortyfive american 
scientists and diplomats will gather similar data sept 14 at the 
soviets semipalatinsk test site 
the detonation beneath this picturesque 7500foot mesa had 12 
times the force of the hiroshima bomb the scientists watched the 
surface affects of the underground explosion 30 miles away by 
television 
it was a resounding success said james magruder the test 
controller for the experiment dubbed kearsarge 
the blast registered 54 on the richter scale of ground movement 
at the national earthquake information center in golden colo and 
caused some highrise hotels in las vegas 100 miles away to sway 
c paul robinson the us ambassador to the negotiations that 
led to the test called the test a step down the road to a more 
stable world 
how far we go depends on what we negotiate on weapons 
themselves robinson said i hope we can take the process to 
the point where there is no need for weapons at all 
igor palenykh head of the soviet delegation to the talks in 
geneva told reporters that the soviet unions goal is a total ban 
on nuclear testing 
as far as the soviet union is concerned we are prepared at any 
time to cease nuclear testing along with the united states he 
said through an interpreter 
about 35 antinuclear protesters turned out at the gates of the 
1350squaremile site and 12 were cited for trespassing or 
blocking traffic then released 
the size of the blast was listed officially as between 100 and 
150 kilotons 
the ability to measure the size of us and soviet tests is 
critical in monitoring treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 limiting 
the size of nuclear tests to no more than 150 kilotons the 
treaties were never ratified by the us senate 
thirty seconds after detonation viktor mikhailov leader of the 
soviet scientific team answered a phone and raised his right hand 
with an ok signal indicating the soviets had received the data 
they were seeking from their monitoring equipment mikhailovs 
signal was greeted with applause 
us and soviet scientists monitored the test with sophisticated 
equipment housed in unmanned trailers a few hundred yards from 
ground zero 
later mikhailov joined scientists diplomats and military 
officials from the two superpowers at a crowded news conference 
mikhailov said he had been apprehensive about coming to the 
united states and meeting his counterparts but he said he grew 
to trust and respect the americans and felt the feeling was mutual 
we have cut a window into their hearts he said of the us 
scientists he has worked with since spring 
the test he said could play a major role in the path leading 
to a nuclearfree world 
the soviet scientists first visited las vegas and the test site 
last january a month after an agreement by president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev cleared the way for such exchanges 
reagan had been trying for nearly four years to orchestrate the 
joint verification tests 
the soviets returned in march living at a test site base camp 
in mercury 65 miles northwest of las vegas

a george bush aide said wednesday that dan 
quayle was asked before being selected as running mate whether 
strings were pulled to get him into the national guard and avoid 
service in vietnam quayle said none were the aide recounted 
the question was i believe was there any pull or some 
influence in some way for him to get into the national guard my 
impression is the answer is absolutely not robert teeter told 
reporters 
he at some point said i simply applied like anyone 
else said teeter who oversaw bushs vice presidential 
selection process 
quayle himself in an interview on cbs said he was almost 
certain that the governor or lieutenant governor of indiana were 
not asked to help him get in the national guard in 1969 
many of us got in he said adding that he was speaking on 
the basis of recollections that are 20 years old 
at the time men quayles age were being drafted into the army 
and many were sent to vietnam 
in an interview with abc news quayle said he chose the national 
guard rather than risking the draft because that course allowed 
him to fulfill his military obligation and still attend law school 
but if his national guard unit had been called up none were 
during the vietnam war he said he would have gone and served 
very proudly 
and he told cnn i was willing and ready to serve my country 
i chose to serve my country in the national guard like millions of 
other people 
the question arose as every aspect of quayles life came under 
intense scrutiny following his surprise selection by bush tuesday 
an nbcowned washington dc television station wrctv said 
quayle may have received help from then indiana gov edgar 
whitcomb citing republican sources it did not name the station 
said quayle was working as an administrative assistant in the 
governors office in 1969 and whitcomb moved quayle to the top of a 
lengthy waiting list for enrollment in the guard 
however quayles biography showed that he had not started 
working for whitcomb until 1971 two years after he joined the 
national guard 
jeff nesbit quayle press secretary told of the television 
stations report said i can say nothing more than what he 
quayle said basically some of the other folks he went to college 
with wanted to get in and most of them got in what he said has to 
stand at this time

the israeli army partially lifted a threeday 
curfew in the gaza strip today after deporting four palestinians 
and ordering 25 more expelled in an effort to break the uprising in 
the occupied lands 
israel televison said a 9yearold palestinian girl was killed 
in the west bank on wednesday when soldiers put down a riot and 
hospital officials said they treated 105 arabs beaten by israeli 
troops in gaza 
the army reported three palestinians wounded in the strip and 
hospital officials and israel radio said six palestinians were 
wounded in the nablus area of the west bank the army said it had 
no reports from nablus 
the fatality brought to 248 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 8monthold uprising against israels 21year occupation of the 
west bank and gaza four israelis also have been killed 
the curfew in the seaside gaza strip which had confined about 
650000 arabs to their homes remained in effect in several refugee 
camps and towns affecting about 160000 people 
more than 70000 palestinians remained under curfew in the west 
bank 
the army described the four gazans deported wednesday as members 
of outlawed palestinian guerrilla groups and inciters of the 
uprising 
the four mohammed gharableh yusri al hums ahmad abu muailek 
and fathi shakaki were taken to lebanon and offered 50 dollars 
which they refused 
we shall return to the land from where we were expelled 
shakaki vowed upon arrival in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley 
the expulsions brought to 33 the number of arabs deported since 
the revolt began dec 8 
the united and other countries oppose israels deportation 
policy which israel defends as the most effective means of 
deterring violent protests 
the army also handed deportation orders to 15 more arabs from 
the west bank and 10 from gaza accusing them of taking direction 
from terrorist organizations one other west bank palestinian 
awaits deportation 
fifteen of the 25 were described as leaders of the palestinian 
local committees or their operational arm the striking forces 
which the army statement said strive to undermine the israeli

leonard bernstein says he would trade his 
considerable conducting and composing talents for a good voice 
if i could get up on the stage and sing one phrase of verdi or 
bizet or wagner so that people would be moved i would give up 
everything for that the nations bestknown composer said 
wednesday 
i can sing but i empty rooms he confessed 
the composer of west side story and candide held a rare 
news conference at the tanglewood music center to talk about the 
fourday extravaganza planned there next week in honor of his 70th 
birthday

balloon tanglewood officials said 
bernstein however played down the festivities that organizers 
have promised will be one of the music worlds great occasions 
im not celebrating anything im just at tanglewood he 
said chainsmoking and sweating after a vigorous hour spent 
conducting the student orchestra in preparation for sundays

the soviet union will make available millions 
of nazi documents photographs and other records of the holocausrt 
captured in eastern europe by soviet troops at the end of world war 
ii for inclusion in the us holocaust memorial museum according 
to officials planning the museum 
the us holocaust memorial council on wednesday announced that 
the materials will be made available for the first time to western 
scholars investigators and legal experts through an agreement 
signed with the soviets in moscow on july 29 
were obviously thrilled said miles lerman chairman of the 
committee of international relations for the council 
we have tried before to get this information but were always 
unsuccessful added lerman who led a sixperson delegation on a 
visiting tour of soviet archives for two weeks in july 
the accord will give the council access to the materials for 
copying and inclusion in the us holocaust memorial museum which 
is to be located near the mall and expected to open in 1991 
council officials estimate that 30 percent to 40 percent of the 
material currently available about the holocaust is scattered in 
dozens of archives in the soviet union 
lerman credited the new spirit of glasnost for soviet 
willingness to make the records available 
until now the soviets would only release information requested 
for specific cases like an identity card used as evidence in the 
case against former concentration camp guard john demjanjuk who was 
sentenced to death in israel in april

police increased patrols in a tense 
neighborhood after a reputed local leader of a los angelesbased 
gang was killed in a gun battle authorities believe was perpetrated 
by the groups main rival 
joseph ray winston 17 died early wednesday in a small 
dimlylit park near a public housing project known for its gang 
activity he became the first gang member killed in a driveby 
shooting in portland where the los angelesbased crips and bloods 
have been active for about two years the gangs were depicted in 
the movie colors 
shortly after the shooting of the crips leader here more than 
two dozen officers many with their guns drawn dispersed a group 
of about 25 gang members in what police called an extremely tense 
situation 
winston who had told police he was a leader of the crips at the 
columbia villa housing project was sitting in the park about 1230 
am when an unknown number of people opened fire from a passing 
car said police sgt bob kauffman 
police believe winston or others in the park returned fire more 
than 25 shots were were fired police said shell casing were found 
scattered over a twoblock area 
two teenage girls who were near winston were wounded 
about the same time a shot from a passing car was fired into 
the housing project police werent sure if the shootings were 
related 
members of the gangs had argued tuesday police said 
we dont know what the friction was about said homicide 
sgt larry neville this is going to be a difficult investigation 
because no one wants to tell us anything 
the crips and bloods originated in southern california in the 
1960s and 1970s police say they are heavily involved in selling 
crack a highly addictive form of cocaine 
the gangs lured by the prospect of untapped markets for crack 
have been moving into other parts of the country authorities say 
authorities have identified about 90 transplanted californians 
among the estimated 600 people in portland who consider themselves 
gang members 
city officials recently announced an antigang program 
we were afraid something like this would happen said mayor 
bud clark thats why we took the steps we did 
a reporter at the scene said that shortly after the shootings 
about 100 residents gathered near the park and scuffles broke out 
about 25 crips members emerged from the housing project and 
pushed through the crowd authorities said they shouted that 
winston was our home boy and that someone was going to pay 
for his death authorities said 
the gang members ignored a police request to disperse the 
officers then formed a semicircle and began walking toward the 
crowd shining flashlights at them several officers had police 
dogs and many had their guns drawn witnesses said 
the officers again told the gang members to disperse the group 
moved away but stayed in the general area 
police were worried about a retaliatory attack by the crips who 
reportedly outnumber the bloods in portland 
we are going to have a very high level of uniform presence in 
areas where we know gangs are active said deputy police chief 
dan noelle we are also going to be taking some tactical steps 
which i cannot discuss we want to make it uncomfortable to be a 
gang member 
police said they had no suspects in the shootings

sen bob dole hailed the selection of fellow 
senator dan quayle as the republican vice presidential candidate 
while assailing michael dukakis as the massachusetts liberal 
who would undermine the nations defenses 
dole 65 who came to the republican national convention 
believing he had a chance to be tapped by george bush for the 
tickets no 2 spot showed no sign of disappointment wednesday 
night as he pledged to work for bushs election and portrayed 
quayle as articulate and dynamic 
the kansas senator said dukakis bid for the white house should 
be rejected by the nation because he is one of those liberal 
doomsayers who believe that america cannot be trusted who is 
uncomfortable when america stands on the side of freedom 
in a speech that was just four pages long dole called dukakis a 
liberal 17 times six times calling him the massachusetts 
liberal 
dole the senate minority leader ran for vice president in 1976 
and vainly sought his partys presidential nomination this year and 
in 1980 he described himself as ready and eager to serve as george 
bushs point man in the senate next january 
i promise to beat back any democratic schemes to raise your 
taxes or any effort to weaken our national defense he said 
he then launched his attack on dukakis sharply criticizing the 
democratic nominees inexperience in foreign policy and his 
declared opposition to military aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
newmodel nuclear missiles the b1 bomber and the star wars 
strategic defense system 
he asserted that dukakis is ready to throw the monroe doctrine 
away when it comes to confronting communism and soviet influence 
in nicaragua and central america 
he speaks spanish freely on the campaign trail but he is not 
concerned whether spanishspeaking people in central america have 
the right to be free dole said 
the governor is one of those liberals who is suspicious of 
americas strength embarrassed when america asserts its rights 
uncomfortable when america stands on the side of freedom he 
declared 
dukakis is one of those liberals with strange ideas 
dukakeyed ideas about the way the world works he said 
dole said dukakis does not understand that recent us foreign 
policy successes were made possible only by the rebuilding of the 
nations military strength 
liberals like the massachusetts governor dont understand 
that a strong america keeps the peace and a weak america invites 
danger he said 
in the world according to mike america needs an ok from the 
united nations before it can act he declared 
dole contended that improved relations with the soviet union 
resulted because president reagan said no to aggression 
knowing when to say yes and when to say no he said it 
separates leadership from mere office holding it separates leaders 
from technocrats 
kansas delegates staged a brief but enthusiastic demonstration 
on the superdome floor when dole was introduced by sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan 
the kansans brought more than 800 dole signs into the arena 
distributing them among other delegations for the demonstration 
dole reciprocated by going to the kansas section following his 
speech and sitting with the delegation shaking hands and posing 
for pictures he stayed until gov mike hayden cast kansas 34 
votes for bush in his firstballot nomination

the nations secondlargest city wanted a 
monument to rival the statue of liberty and architects responded 
in southern california fashion with some farout designs that 
would make lady liberty drop her torch 
the entries unveiled this week include a giant transparent bird 
and a 4blocklong dollar bill but they seem unlikely to knock the 
pyramids off the seven wonders of the world list 
the west coast gateway committee received 150 designs in all 
including a towering baseball mitt and giant naked statues in plain 
view of hundreds of thousands of daily freeway commuters 
judges on an international committee formed by mayor tom bradley 
whittled the selections down to five this week with semifinalists 
including the gargantuan bird with an egg that lowers onto a 
surface street 
the jurors certainly chose the unexpected nick patsaouras 
chairman of the gateway committe said wednesday 
we wanted a symbol of los angeles said patsaouras and we 
wanted it to stand the test of time into the 21st century im 
very happy with our entries 
backers hope that the final design will be built over the santa 
ana freeway near city hall with 40 million in corporate donations 
raised in the way the 1984 los angeles olympics were funded 
the 100000 contest was financed by a japanese real estate 
company that owns two los angeles skyscrapers 
bradley was credited with putting the monument plans in motion 
deciding just as new york celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 
statue of liberty last summer that los angeles should have its own 
monument to welcome newcomers to us shores 
in february bradley kicked off the contest for a design 
calling the monument drive uniquely a los angeles project 
monument official david jay flood promised it would be singular 
and not be a statue that would probably only be appreciated by 
pigeons 
the architects who responded did not let them down the plans on 
display at the california museum of science and industry burst with 
imagination 
and while the temptation is to label the collection typically 
californian only one semifinalist is from california the others 
are from massachusetts new york austria and the soviet union 
the baseball mitt design was accompanied by a giant bat and a 
giant white baseball and a regulationsized baseball field 
the jury turned it down and rejected a giant bald head that 
peers down on the freeway and a design of four giant hands colored 
red yellow black and white 
another monument was a rainbow one had a large butterfly 
floating overhead attached by guy wires 
some designs had so many wires and sails and metal rigging that 
they looked like the wreckage of a wright brothers plane 
except for the bird monument designed by vilen kunnapu of the 
soviet republic of estonia the four other semifinalists were 
mechanicallooking structures functional and hightech 
the design by austrias irmfried windbichler combined towering 
fountains of water a landmark to be seen for miles by 
approaching motorists 
dagmar richter of cambridge mass termed her semifinalist 
project a linear structure and part vessel for social 
gathering 
hani rashid of new york put forward a stagelike structure 
praised for its theaters galleries and general use of open 
spaces 
los angeles neil denari had a large video screen with the face 
of george washington sticking out on the design it is accompanied 
by the message the measurement of the american dream is the 
dollar

the first antibaldness drug that has 
received federal approval for sales will reach stores within six 
weeks but a consumer publication is questioning the substances 
effectiveness 
upjohn co announced the us food and drug administrations 
approval of presecription sales of rogaine on wednesday 
were very pleased said lawrence c hoff president and 
chief operating officer for the kalamazoobased company the 
development of rogaine represents the first largescale scientific 
study of a pharmaceutical agent for hair growth 
in washington fda spokesman bill grigg confirmed late wednesday 
that the agency had approved use of rogaine the fda allowed upjohn 
to make the announcement at the companys request grigg said 
upjohn said it has tested rogaine on about 2300 balding 
individuals at 27 medical centers it said 39 percent of those who 
twicedaily applied the 2 percent minoxidil solution experienced 
either dense or moderate hair growth 
the formula will reach stores within six weeks price hasnt 
been determined the company said rogaine is available in 44 
countries including canada and mexico 
despite approval rogaines effectiveness has been questioned by 
consumer reports magazine 
the independent consumer magazine in its september issue said 
upjohns tests may exaggerate how well bald spots respond to the 
formula 
the study excluded men who were very bald those with hair 
only on the sides and a smooth billiard ball appearance on 
top the magazine said 
while a small portion of participants did see some regrowth of 
hair and a shrinking of their bald spots no one grew back a full 
head of hair consumer reports said 
company officials said rogaine wont work for everyone adding 
that continued use for up to four months is necessary before hair 
growth can be noticed 
because rogaine is a treatment not a cure cessation of 
rogaine treatment in patients with hair growth will lead to the 
loss of the hair within a few months said richard devillez 
director of dermatology at upjohn 
upjohn said it will continue to conduct tests on the 
effectiveness of rogaine 
because its a first its important to us to monitor and 
analyze its use and acceptance in the medical community to do this 
we will be conducting a postmarketing surveillance survey hoff 
said

had trouble putting the key into the ignition of his car 
solving the disability is easy enough this palsy is relieved 
by using another cutting instrument royden reported

candy sugar and clothes he got in us relief packages as a child 
has found a way to say thanks over and over again an annual picnic 
for thousands of senior citizens 
from the day i walk into this country thats about 37 years 
ago i never had a sad day yet restaurateur lou pappan said at 
his 14th summer picnic wednesday i never met a person in this 
country i did not really like

become a summertime tradition for senior citizens in beaver county 
a depressed patch of steel country about 25 miles west of 
pittsburgh 
its wonderful once a year you get out of the house and under 
the trees i think lous the most wonderful person in the world 
said elsie white 58 of coraopolis 
she has been to all of pappans picnics and this year brought 33 
senior citizens in a bus 
i enjoy the bingo said rudolph hiber 77 of aliquippa 
ive been on a pension for 17 years its nice to meet some 
people 
this years picnic featured spaghetti and meat sauce rolls and 
tapioca pudding served on covered picnic tables in humid 95degree 
weather county recreation director jack hilfinger said more than 
3000 people were on hand by noon and pappan said he had expected 
6000 through the evening 
he said the bash will cost him 30000 
volunteers many of them pappans employees began serving cold 
drinks at 9 am entertainment included a bluegrass band square 
dancing and contests for crafts food and paintings 
pappan 57 began throwing the picnics in 1975 to thank 
americans for helping greece during world war ii

countries i could have went to here i am i came to the united 
states the best country in the world

makrakomi greece where his father operated a restaurant he 
didnt speak english when he came to live with his uncle in beaver 
falls in 1951 
as a boy in the povertystricken greek village during world war 
ii pappan said he watched some of his friends die of starvation 
he searched the skies for american aircraft that would bring help 
they dropped big boxes full of clothing and also food he 
said in his thick greek accent we got sometimes white sugar 
sometimes brown sugar we even received sometimes chocolate bars 
it was a very big deal 
some of the clothing lasted years pappan said 
i remember a pair of pants and a shirt i used to wear in my 
high school days he said i graduated from high school wearing 
those pants 
after pappan enlisted in the us army during the korean war a 
sergeant who called him alphabet convinced him his greek name

beaver falls now about 1200 people work at his 18 roy rogers 
restaurants 14 pappans family restaurants and three specialty 
restaurants in western pennsylvania he says his food business will

here is a transcript of the speech by sen 
phil gramm of texas nominating vice president george bush for 
president at the republican national convention wednesday night 
thank you thank you thank you applause 
can you imagine can you imagine how hard it is to be the gramm 
of grammrudman 
trying to do the lords work in the devils city trying to 
balance the budget and always seeing those terrible headlines 
grammrudman cuts grammrudman slashes grammrudman denies 
im still waiting for the headline grammrudman saves taxpayers 
money 
and ive finally figured out why that headline is never written 
the people writing those headlines think that the money 
government spends comes from heaven so when government doesnt 
spend it its lost 
but you and i know the real story 
the money government spends does not come from heaven it comes 
out of the pockets of the working men and women of america and 
when government does not spend our money its not lost it stays 
with families to invest in the american dream and my friends 
thats what this election is all about 
do you remember what the world was like in january of 1981 when 
ronald reagan and george bush took the oath of office 
the amnesia merchants of the atlanta convention want us to 
forget that when the democrats left the white house inflation and 
interest rates were at the highest levels in american history 
prices outstripped wages workers grew poorer retirees saw their 
lives savings destroyed people couldnt build or buy their own 
homes or invest in their own businesses 
remember how we resented it when jimmy carter told us we had to 
learn to live on less of course that turned out to be the good 
part the bad part was that the tax and spend policies of the 
democrats forced us to do it 
the amnesia democrats of atlanta may have forgotten all that 
but we have not forgotten and so help us god we are not going to 
allow them to do that to america again 
under the leadership of ronald reagan and george bush weve cut 
taxes so that working people could keep more of what they earned 
we gave people incentives to work save and invest and they have 
worked and saved and invested 
with government off our backs and out of our wallets the genius 
of our people reemerged 
inflation the no 1 problem in the 70s has been virtually 
eliminated we have created 17 million new permanent taxpaying 
jobs with a future interest rates have plummeted and home 
ownership always part of the american dream is again part of the 
american reality 
but while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle the 
democrats call it a disaster they long for the failed policies of 
the past 
the chinese communists may be coming out from behind their 
ideological great wall to recognize that government is the problem 
and free enterprise is the answer and perestroika may be 
permeating the walls of the kremlin but the message of economic 
freedom and opportunity has yet to register with the democrats

for four years jimmy carter and the democrats slashed defense 
readiness and morale in the military sank pay lagged behind 
inflation and our young service men and women were forced to turn 
to welfare and food stamps to feed their children and the american 
flag drooped in shame 
our planes didnt fly and our ships didnt sail because we 
didnt have the spare parts or enough mechanics and all over the 
world the enemies of freedom were on the march 
under the leadership of ronald reagan and george bush all that 
has changed 
we have built and deployed new weapons we have recruited and 
retained some of the finest young men and women whove ever worn 
this the uniform of our country and they wear that uniform with 
pride all over the world tonight and we intend to keep it that way 
but the reaganbush program has done more than rebuild defense 
more than stop inflation more than put america back to work and 
more than rebuild our position of world leadership it has 
rekindled pride and confidence in our great nation something that 
many thought had been lost perhaps forever 
thats our record 
what is the michael dukakis record 
in 1974 in his first campaign for governor michael dukakis 
promised the people of massachusetts that he would not raise their 
taxes he broke that promise the next year with the largest tax 
increase in the states history people called it taxachusetts 
he taxed the poor taxed the rich taxed the young taxed the 
old taxed the middle class he taxed businesses and he taxed 
families by the time the voters turned him out of office in 1979 
they were carrying a tax burden 44 percent above the national 
average 
dukakis got a second chance as governor in 1983 this time he 
proved he could spend as well as tax state spending in 
massachusetts grew twice as fast as federal spending a billion 
dollar surplus turned into a 400 million deficit 
while ronald reagan and george bush worked to rebuild defense 
michael dukakis opposed every major new weapons system that weve 
deployed 
given his record is there anybody here who doubts that a 
president dukakis would raise our taxes crowd no 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis would 
spend our workers into poverty crowd no 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis would 
cut defense wimp america and endanger peace crowd no 
is there anybody here who doubts that a president dukakis would 
expand the power of government and its control over our businesses 
our families our churches and our lives crowd no 
no we dont doubt it and by the time this elections over the 
american people arent going to doubt it and thats why theres not 
going to be a president dukakis 
george bushs record of service to america spans nearly five 
decades from naval aviator to vice president george bush has shown 
again and again his love for his country his countrymen and the 
values that made america great and strong he has never failed to 
answer his nations call to service 
to each mission he has brought integrity determination and the 
skill to get the job done 
george left home and joined the navy the week he graduated from 
high school on his 18th birthday when he got his wings at the 
corpus christi naval air station george bush was the youngest 
pilot in the navy 
in the south pacific he flew 58 combat missions in those 
missions as in everything else hes done in his life george bush 
showed that quiet courage that texans and americans have always 
looked to at a time of crisis and danger 
when he took off during an attack on the fleet and his engine 
failed george bush didnt panic he didnt break radio silence he 
ditched the plane and led his crew to safety

on a bombing run at chichi jima his plane was hit both his 
crewmen were killed as flames swept over the wings and cockpit 
george bush remembered the first obligation of a leader is to 
accomplish the mission 
he stayed on his bombing run and dropped two tons of tnt right 
on the target he turned his crippled plane out to sea and bailed 
out the japanese sent boats to capture him but his fellow pilots 
hovered over him strafing the japanese to keep them back 
with blood streaming down his face with a 38 revolver in one 
hand he paddled away from the shore with the other hand to be 
rescued by a submarine 
let me read from his citation for the distinguished flying cross 
by his superb airmanship courageous actions and loyal 
dedication to duty lieutenant bush reflected great credit upon 
himself and upheld the highest traditions of the united states 
naval service signed franklin delano roosevelt 
my friends my friends when michael dukakis vetoed that bill 
providing for the pledge of allegiance to the american flag in 
massachusetts public schools he did not represent the views of 
george bush 
we will never have to worry about george bushs willingness to 
stand up for america 
he knows from real life experience that peace comes through 
strength not through wishful thinking 
the commitment of george bush and ronald reagan to a strong 
national defense has brought peace it has brought the soviets to 
the bargaining table and produced the unprecedented elimination of 
a whole class of nuclear weapons 
under george bushs leadership we can keep america strong and 
at peace we can let the real competition begin a competition of 
vision and ideas 
building on the bedrock achievements of the reaganbush years 
we can move beyond simply maintaining the little freedom which 
exists on this earth 
the defense of freedom today begins in nicaragua and 
afghanistan but the competition of vision and ideas can never end 
until all the world is free including the people of central 
america and cuba and eastern europe and the soviet union itself 
george bush warrior when his country needed warriors came home 
from the war and married the girl whose name was painted on the 
side of his plane barbara 
he came home to continue his education and to put the american 
free enterprise system to work for him and for his family george 
took his family and moved to midland texas and started in the oil 
business 
he learned the business working for others and went into 
business for himself he met the payroll paid the bills and 
pioneered new technology used today around the world 
in time george bush turned again to public service being 
elected as houstons first republican congressman since 
reconstruction in the house of representatives he fought against 
excessive government spending and for civil rights 
he later served as ambassador to the united nations and when 
history was made with the opening of relations with communist 
china george bush was sent to peking to represent our nation

he came home to head the central intelligence agency where he 
strengthened the intelligence community while working to guarantee 
the rights of our citizens 
through it all george bush found time to be a devoted husband 
and a loving father to five children and grandfather to 10 
george bush is the greatest vice president this nation has ever 
had he has always made us proud 
when the soviet union targeted a new class of nuclear weapons at 
western europe destroying the military balance and threatening 
peace vice president bush flew to europe to meet with our nato 
allies 
prime minister thatcher of britain president mitterrand of 
france chancellor kohl of west germany and the others they know 
george bush they trust him they respect him 
and from those meetings came their decision they would deploy 
missiles in europe 
the threat was answered the alliance held and moscow 
understood and as a result today we have an inf treaty and the 
soviet missiles are being withdrawn and destroyed now thats what 
leadership is about 
as chairman of the south florida task force george bush put 
together this nations first really successful effort to protect 
our children from illegal drugs while michael dukakis opposes 
mandatory sentencing for the thugs who sell drugs to our children 
and opposes the death penalty for drug pushers who murder our 
police officers george bush knows that the only way you can deal 
with drug pushers is to grab them by the throat 
and with george bush as our president thats exactly what were 
going to do 
under his leadership we can and will rid america of illegal 
drugs 
america is not a great nation because brilliant and talented 
people came to live here america is a great nation because our 
system offers incentives and opportunities for greatness 
america has produced extraordinary results from plain ordinary 
common people like you and me 
the genius of americas success lies not in the brilliance of a 
few but in the spirit of enterprise work and family of all of us 
who call ourselves americans 
our program has rekindled that spirit to bring greater 
prosperity to more people than ever before but we have only 
scratched the surface of what america can be 
with george bush as our president with dan quayle as our vice 
president building on the success of the last eight years there is 
no limit to the future of the american people 
i am honored to place in nomination the name of a man who has 
served america in war and in peace who has the experience the 
character and the strength to lead this great land we love

here is a transcript of the speech by sen 
bob dole of kansas to the republican national convention wednesday 
night 
thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much 
thank you very much i accept the nomination as majority leader of 
the united states senate 
let me underscore my priorities for 1988 
first of all i am committed to electing george bush president 
of the united states in november 
i am committed to electing republicans to congress 
so tonight i am asking you to help us strengthen our party in 
the house and to help us regain the majority in the united states 
senate 
i am ready and eager to serve as george bushs point man in a 
republican controlled senate come january i promise to beat back 
any democratic schemes to raise your taxes or any effort to weaken 
our national defense 
let me congratulate my colleague dan quayle our next vice 
president 
i talked to dan yesterday i called to congratulate him i 
interrupted him he was shaving for the first time 
and i can say to my friends all across america i am proud to 
have been his leader in the united states senate he is young hes 
dynamic hes articulate and hes already had 12 years experience 
in congress if only the democratic nominee had had half as much we 
would be in a stronger position 
this years election represents a crossroads for america the 
alternatives have never been more obvious or the consequences more 
important 
the issues will be defense and deficits and detente and drugs 
but the bottom line question is what kind of country will america 
be as it enters a new century will we be truly strong or barely 
strong enough will we be selfconfident or selfdoubting will we 
be on the march or at a standstill 
strength and security the founding fathers saw these two words 
as an essential link between them 200 years ago and we republicans 
see it today we are secure as individuals only when the country we 
live in is strong and confident and when our country is weak and 
uncertain and lacking in will we are all vulnerable 
the link between the strength of our nation and the security of 
our people seems obvious but there are always some and there are 
some out there now who never get the picture 
these people the liberal doom sayers believe that america 
cannot be trusted they believe that the disarming of america is a 
noble goal they do not understand that america must be strong if 
america is to be free we understand all of us in this hall in 
this party and across the country and of course george bush 
understands and george bush has understood for a long long time 
the importance of freedom 
but the democratic nominee does not he is undoubtedly a fine 
man he did an excellent job in gaining his partys nomination he 
will work hard between now and november but unfortunately he is 
one of those liberals who does not know where to draw the line and 
this puts america at risk 
he seems willing to throw away the monroe doctrine he says he 
can live with soviet client states in central america oh yes he 
speaks spanish freely on the campaign trail but he is not 
concerned whether spanishspeaking people in central america have 
the right to be free 
and thats the difference 
the governor is one of those liberals who is suspicious of 
americas strength embarrassed when america asserts its rights 
uncomfortable when america stands on the side of freedom 
one of those liberals who knocks our president questions his 
principles and assails his policies one of those liberals who 
suffers a sudden lapse of memory when it comes to the outrages of 
the ayatollah colonel gadhafi comandante ortega and other third 
world tyrants

<TEXT>
one of those liberals with strange ideas dukakeyed ideas 
yes dukakeyed ideas dukakeyed ideas about the way the world 
works 
and think about the last time this kind of liberal occupied the 
white house think about the four years of malaise and 
mismanagement of disaster 
think about all the countries that fell into the soviet orbit 
think about cambodia where marxism led to genocide and think 
about ethiopia where marxism led to famine and nicaragua where 
marxism has led to a soviet beachhead in the americas and think 
about all these places where the liberals did not know where or 
how to draw the line 
and then and then think about grenada where ronald reagan and 
george bush did draw the line and where its people now have a 
democracy and think about libya where reagan and bush drew the 
line and they silenced the terrorists and think about 
afghanistan where by drawing the line this administration ronald 
reagan and george bush helped a courageous people survive and kept 
alive their dreams of freedom 
and think about angola and because we backed the freedom 
fighters in angola a negotiated settlement is possible that could 
result in the departure of 40000 cuban mercenaries 
and yes think about the persian gulf think about the persian 
gulf because we insisted you insisted that the american navy 
should draw a line protecting freedom of the seas and because of 
that the end of the iraniraq war is in sight 
now i ask you this question would this have happened if the 
liberals had been in the white house crowd no 
would there have been an improvement in relations with moscow 
and an inf treaty crowd no 
you got it right both times 
and youre right and ill tell you why because these liberals 
define arms control this way the soviets arm while we control 
and liberals like the massachusetts governor never get the 
picture they fail to understand that a strong america keeps the 
peace and a weak america invites danger 
harry truman understood where to draw the line in 1947 and 
because he did greece is a free nation today 
john f kennedy understood where to draw the line in 1962 and 
because he did the soviet missiles were yanked out of cuba 
and those kind of mainstream democrats who still believe in a 
strong national defense are now outcasts in their own party and 
todays liberals led by jesse jackson and michael dukakis will 
never understand they dont have a clue 
for them its always mourning in america mourning with a 
u a time to mourn americas recovery a time to mourn 
americas strength a time to mourn americas new sense of purpose 
but on the other hand george bush understands that strength and 
freedom are two sides of the same coin 
and as a young pilot he risked his life for his country in the 
skies of the pacific as ronald reagan stated monday evening he 
has helped give this country eight of the best years it has ever 
had thats why im proud of george bush thats why george bush is 
going to be elected in november of this year 
and george bush and dan quayle support sdi because it provides 
defense against the accidents that cause war and this keeps the 
peace he supports the b1 bomber and the stealth bomber and the mx 
and midgetman missiles because they deter aggression and this 
too keeps the peace 
george bush and dan quayle support freedom fighters around the 
world and what does the democratic candidate support what 
programs to keep america truly strong and free 
let me list them for you pause 
i havent lost my place i just cant think of any theres 
gotta be one out there somewhere 
his idea of national defense is one if by land and two if by 
sea if you can get through the polluted waters of boston harbor 
in the world according to the massachusetts liberal defending 
liberty is dangerous and it costs too much 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP880818-0076 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
but theres a real world out there where america must provide 
real leadership 
in the world according to the massachusetts liberal america 
should get an ok first from the united nations before we ever do 
anything 
but theres a real world out there and sometimes america must 
act on its own to protect our interests and your interests and 
your childrens interests 
and in the world according to the massachusetts liberal 
communism and terrorism and drugs are just issues to be managed 
but theres a real world out there where america must defend the 
freedoms we cherish and stand against those who would take those 
freedoms away 
and finally let me remind americans all americans 
republicans and democrats and independents there is no owners 
manual for the oval office you dont learn to lead a nation 
through onthejob training or by having harvard professors come to 
washington for a seminar 
so this campaign really boils down to one thing keep one thing 
in mind in this campaign and thats leadership and leadership 
involves many things but chief among them is knowing when to say 
yes and when to say no 
theres nothing more important it is the mark of character in a 
leader it can change the course of history 
in the early 1980s for example the massachusetts liberal and 
his fellow liberals were saying yes to the nuclear freeze and 
george bush was saying no george bush knew that the freeze the 
massachusetts liberal supported would have frozen in place 1500 
nucleartipped soviet missiles aimed at the heart of europe and 
frozen out of europe our missiles 
the massachusetts liberal predicted that this would prolong the 
cold war 
well he had it exactly wrong it was only after our missiles 
arrived in europe that the soviets began to bargain and they 
bargained until all of the intermediaterange missiles were gone 
and the bargaining is not over yet 
because ronald reagan and george bush had said no to the huge 
soviet military buildup that took place the last time the liberals 
were in charge and no to the soviet expansionism of the carter 
years because they said no to soviet aggression ronald reagan 
and george bush were able to say yes to improved relations with the 
soviet union 
so knowing when to say yes and when to say no it separates 
leadership from mere officeholding it separates leaders from 
technocrats 
and so yes the 1988 election is very serious business 
were electing a president and also the next leader of the free 
world 
and i realized this fully just three months ago in moscow i was 
with president reagan as he put his final seal on his historic arms 
control treaty with the soviet union 
and while there i was seated next to mikhail gorbachev at a 
state dinner and for nearly three hours i had an opportunity to 
exchange views with him facetoface and let me tell you i was 
impressed gorbachev is smart hes shrewd and believe me he is 
committed to the goals of the communist world he leads 
after dinner as i was driven back to my hotel our car passed 
through red square and past the forbidding skyline of the kremlin 
and i thought about gorbachev i thought to myself and i thought 
what might lie ahead and i knew that the free world could not 
afford to deal with this hardasnails communist with an untested 
unprepared unsure president someone who did not know where to 
draw the line someone who did not know when to say yes and when to 
say no 
today we look at the world and our place in it and say thank 
god for ronald reagan 
four years from now well be meeting again we will think about 
the world again we will think how fortunate it was that the 
american voters republicans and democrats and independents 
didnt make a mistake in 1988 and well say in 1992 thank god for 
george bush 
thank you very much

mounting fines against yonkers have been further 
delayed while a federal appeals court decides whether the judge who 
imposed them exceeded his authority to punish the city for 
resisting housing desegregation 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals continued a stay wednesday 
of potentially crippling fines leveled against the city and four 
city councilmen for refusing to approve the courtordered 
desegregation plan 
the threejudge panel did not say when it would rule on whether 
to uphold the contempt citation and fines imposed by us district 
judge leonard b sand on aug 1 the council refused by a 43 vote 
to endorse the affordable housing plan that would integrate the 
states fourthlargest city the plan calls for 200 units of 
lowincome housing and 800 units of moderateincome housing to be 
built in the predominantly white east side 
the escalating fines against the city began at 100 doubling 
daily the fines would surpass the citys entire 337 million 
budget in 22 days the citys fines had accumulated to 26500 when 
the appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week pending 
the appeal of the contempt order 
the appeals court also stayed sands 500aday fines against 
the four councilmen who were to be jailed on aug 11 before the 
2nd circuit stepped in 
the city council again rejected the housing desegregation plan 
early tuesday by the same vote 
at the hearing before the appeals court wednesday yonkers 
attorney michael w sculnick said sand had exceeded his judicial 
discretion in imposing the crippling fines 
calling the council hopelessly divided sculnick said the city 
should not be made to suffer he said sand should have bypassed the 
council and deemed the housing plan approved himself or else 
appointed a housing commission to implement the plan 
the city is stuck it is incapable of complying with the 
federal courts order said sculnick he said the four councilmen 
had their own political agendas and were playing what amounts to 
a game of chicken waiting for the other guy to change his vote 
linda thome an attorney for the justice departments civil 
rights division said the fines must be reimposed because it is 
essential that the city be required now to comply with the federal 
courts order

music lovers attending tonights performance by 
the chicago symphony winds can expect to hear the american premiere 
of a new work of mozarts 
then again maybe not 
the question of the authenticity of the score a wind band 
arrangement titled harmoniemusik which is part of mozarks 
opera the abduction from the seraglio along with that of 
other scores found periodically remain the topic of scholarly 
debate 
the piece was discovered last year in west germany by bastiaan 
blonhert a dutch musicologist 
in a letter to his father dated july 20 1782 mozart wrote that 
he hoped to complete a wind arrangement of the opera quickly or 
else someone will step in front of me and reap the profit 
whether he actually completed the work is not known however 
musicologist hc robbins landon said that a newspaper article 
written in august 1782 advertises a wind band performance of the 
work noting that tickets are available from the lemonade seller 
at the new market 
the copy found in west germany is not in mozarts handwriting 
nor is it in the handwriting of any of the copyists mozart was 
known to employ 
while more evidence is certainly in order landon said i find 
a great deal in the music itself that leads me to believe that this 
is mozarts work 
whoever crafted the work landon noted was certainly not a 
hack

a housewife who admitted she helped her 
late husband hijack a plane to cuba nearly two decades ago says she 
was a severely battered wife at the time and was driven to the 
crime partly out of terror 
linda joyce grinage of albany pleaded guilty wednesday in us 
district court to the least of three charges against her that of 
interfering with the crew of an eastern airlines jet bound for 
miami from new york on jan 2 1969 
i knew what my husband had planned mrs grinage said i 
was terrified of my husband if he told me to walk off the side of 
a building i would have done so 
but the 39yearold woman who is also known as haziine eytina 
said in response to a question by judge jacob mishler that she 
voluntarily participated in the crime during which a 2yearold 
boy was taken hostage 
i went into the cockpit and obstructed everyone from leaving 
the cockpit she said in a barely audible voice 
the bespectacled woman wearing a white dress and a pink bandana 
on her head was accompanied by her attorney and her second 
husband mylo eytina also an attorney 
grinage also was charged in an indictment with air piracy and 
interference with a flight crew with a deadly weapon both of those 
charges which are expected to be dismissed at an oct 28 
sentencing carry maximum life terms 
she admitted to the least of the charges interference without 
the use of a weapon grinage who is being held without bail at the 
metropolitan correction center in manhattan faces a maximum of 20 
years in prison and a 10000 fine 
grinage and her first husband tyrone ellington austin of new 
york city were accused of diverting the plane to havana after 
taking a 2yearold long island boy hostage putting a gun to his 
head and threatening to kill him the child his mother and the 
other 146 people on board were freed unharmed when the plane landed 
in havana 
grinage and austin remained in cuba for an unknown period of 
time 
austin was killed in manhattan in 1971 in a gunfight with police 
during a bank robbery 
grinage has been living in the albany area for about 10 years 
with her husband and five children she was arrested here last 
month after the fbi received an anonymous tip 
her attorney edward wilford said his client had wanted to turn 
herself in a number of times but just couldnt bring herself to 
do it 
she was not a fugitive wilford said outside the courthouse 
she lived in the open as a housewife she wasnt sneaking 
around 
he said her husband was shocked and amazed when he learned 
of his wifes involvement in the hijacking

a coalition calling for an end to corporal 
punishment in the nations schools says the most difficult obstacle 
may be the attitude of parents who practice it at home 
a study several years back found that 90 percent of parents 
use corporal punishment in their own homes that tells us weve got 
a lot of educating to do adrienne haeuser of the national 
association of social workers said wednesday as educators lawyers 
and doctors gathered for the first conference of its kind in a 
decade 
more than a million incidents of corporal punishment are 
reported in the nations public schools each year ranging from 
paddling to confining students in small spaces such as closets 
according to us department of education figures 
in large part the parents dont quite understand the 
consequences of corporal punishment at home ms haeuser said 
they learn from their parents and they figure if they got hit 
its ok to hit their own children 
keynote speaker bob keeshan known to millions of children as 
tvs captain kangaroo called corporal punishment a failed practice 
it rates an f because it does not meet its stated purpose of 
maintaining discipline and because it treats the symptoms and not 
the cause of the underlying unruly behavior keeshan said 
with that behavior a child is crying out help me help me 
and we answer with the compassion of the paddle 
the theme of the threeday conference which brought together 23 
prominent medical legal and educational organizations is the 
time is now organizer robert fathman said the groups are banding 
into a coalition to capitalize on a growing movement by state 
legislatures to outlaw corporal punishment 
eleven states and a number of school districts ranging in size 
from chicagos to that of seaford del which has a population of 
5250 have outlawed corporal punishment in schools since new 
jersey became the first state to do so in 1867 
but fathman said five states have passed measures banning the 
practice since 1984 six state legislatures have similar bills 
pending and another six will face the issue during their 1989 
sessions 
the purpose of this weeks conference fathman said is to 
provide organizational skills and information to parents educators 
and other interested people so they can campaign to eliminate the 
practice in schools 
fathman said black children who represent 16 percent of the 
countrys schoolage population make up a disproportionate 32 
percent of those punished and that children in the deep south 
are 4000 times more likely to be paddled than their counterparts 
in the northeast where connecticut is the only state without a 
law barring the practice 
in a joint statement preceding the opening of the conference 
the american medical association the american bar association the 
american academy of pediatrics and the american psychological 
association denounced corporal punishment and called on legislators 
to enact laws accordingly

worried by an increase in weapons found in city 
schools schools chancellor richard green has proposed buying 
handheld metal detectors and hiring new guards to make unannounced 
checks in five high schools 
the plan would cost 28 million far less than the 9 million 
estimate for an earlier plan calling for walkthrough metal 
detectors green said at a news conference wednesday the first 
proposal was deemed too costly he said 
green said more than 150 students were found carrying guns 
during the past school year the total number of weapons possession 
incidents last year was 1960 compared with 1495 in the 198687 
school year 
if the plan is approved by the board of education students who 
carry weapons or assault staff will be transferred to one of five 
outreach centers currently used for counseling dropouts the metal 
detectors will also be used there 
students now can only be suspended for five days twice in a 
school year and then usually transferred to another school 
returned to their home school or occasionally placed in an 
alternative program 
its going to go a long way in getting rid of guns and ending 
assaults on teachers said sandra feldman president of the 
teachers union 
but rob levy staff counsel to the new york civil liberties 
union said the metal detector policy was wrong searches should 
be based on individualized suspicion he said

president pw botha said today that 
african national congress leader nelson mandela may not have to 
return to prison from the hospital where he is being treated for 
tuberculosis 
botha said mandela had been cooperating with the government and 
he now expects positive results from his standing offer to free 
the 70yearold black leader in return for renunciation of violence 
in his speech to the provincial national party congress in 
natal botha did not explain what he meant by cooperation however 
it was seen as a strong suggestion of a change in the way mandelas 
case is being viewed possibly because he is being treated for 
tuberculosis at tygerberg hospital in cape town 
the outlawed african national congress is the major guerrilla 
group fighting the whileruled government and apartheid its policy 
of racial segregation mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is 
serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the 
government 
the government in a responsible way will consider the matter 
and if we get the cooperation we have so far got from mr mandela 
i believe we will get positive results botha said 
personally i dont think that at his age and condition it 
would be wise for him to choose to go back to prison and i hope he 
will make it possible for me to act in a humane way so that we can 
have peace in south africa 
bothas speech followed a meeting with justice minister kobie 
coetsee who visited mandela at the hospital on wednesday 
he appears to be comfortable and appears to have taken the 
first steps towards recovery he appears to be satisfied with his 
treatment and surroundings coetsee said of mandela 
he looks as though he is almost his old self and he is already 
enjoying jokes i think it will be in his own interest to remain in 
the medical care of the specialists who are attending him at the 
moment 
asked what cooperation mandela had given information minister 
stoffel said for example mandela did not try to use the 
occasion of his hospitalization last week as a propaganda stunt 
he said it was not mandela but his lawyer and friends who 
demanded outside medical attention and revealed the nature of his 
illness 
stoffel van der merwe the information minister said the 
government was not expecting mandela to sign anything or even 
publicly disavow the guerrilla groups policy but it expected that 
he would not participate in or promote violent activities 
tom lodge a university of the witwatersrand academic who is 
south africas foremost expert on the congress said in a radio 
interview i dont think mandela will accept anything other than 
unconditional release but he said that if he is ill it is 
unlikely that he would be involved in violence 
van der merwe said last month that mandela already had served 
enough time for his crime and security was the the only reason he 
was still in prison 
the government would like to see old men like him go out of 
jail van der merwe said today it cannot do that if the result 
will be lives lost in south africa 
mandela has rejected previous offers by botha to free him if he 
renounces violence responding that the government must end 
apartheid and legalize the african national congress 
in a major policy speech today botha said he was unwilling even 
to discuss the possibility of a black majority government in south 
africa 
we dont want to be a second rhodesia we dont want to be a 
second zaire we are standing here in a firm way he said to loud 
applause from the crowd of about 500 
last year the government unconditionally freed govan mbeki 77 
an elderly african national congress official who was imprisoned 
for life at the same time as mandela 
mbeki said he had not renounced violence or the congress after 
a few public appearances the government banned him from addressing 
audiences giving newspaper interviews or leaving his home of port 
elizabeth 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a drug used to treat patients complaining 
of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in 
four out of five heart patients according to a study published in 
todays edition of the new england journal of medicine 
surprisingly however the study found that the drug diltiazem 
increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose 
hearts pump abnormally experts said 
even so the results may trigger an increase in the use of the 
drug which is now primarily used to treat angina doctors said 
the drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the united states and 
canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack said 
dr arthur moss a clinical professor of medicine at the university 
of rochester and the principal investigator for the study 
the results suggest the drug may be quite effective in 
decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority 
of patients moss said but the study also surprisingly suggests 
that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given 
diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent 
heart attack 
we now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to 
moss said thats what this study was all about 
diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker the newest class of drugs 
to be introduced in the fight against heart disease nitrates and 
beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors 
the study involved 2466 heart attack patients who were given 
either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo patients 
were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months 
overall the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 
percent which was not statistically significant moss said 
but in patients who had normal or nearnormal heart pump 
function 1909 patients or 80 percent of the total group 
diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 
percent moss said 
in patients whose hearts had pumping problems the drug not only 
didnt help but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 
percent 
dr john schroeder a cardiologist and professor at stanford 
university said he was surprised that the drug increased the 
chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were 
not higher 
but the bottom line is that this is the first study to show 
that diltiazem can be effective schroeder said i think it 
will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on 
a longterm basis 
dr george beller a cardiologist and professor at the 
university of virginia said he was also somewhat surprised about 
the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary 
congestion 
this is one of the first reports that seems to identify 
that he said 
diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced 
in the past decade beller said and research into how effective 
they are in various applications is in its early stages 
nitrates have been used for more than 50 years and beta 
blockers were developed in the 1960s

proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
holding at least two american hostages said today they will not 
release any captives unless all their demands are met 
the typewritten statement from islamic jihad was delivered to 
the beirut office of the reuters news agency along with a 
blackandwhite photograph of american hostage terry anderson 
islamic jihad or holy war has admitted holding anderson and 
thomas sutherland a total of 18 foreigners including nine 
americans are missing and believed kidnapped in lebanon 
anderson 40 of lorain ohio is the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he is the longestheld 
foreign captive kidnapped in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 
andersons photograph was released with the arabiclanguage 
statement in the groups normal way of proving the statement is 
authentic 
the photograph the 10th of anderson released by islamic jihad 
showed the captive from the chest up with a bushy beard and an 
untrimmed moustache he was wearing a sweatshirt and looking 
straight into the camera without his glasses 
on wednesday night a telephone call to reuters purportedly 
from islamic jihad said british hostage terry waite an anglican 
church envoy may be freed on a shiite anniversary monday if the 
british government shows good intentions 
the developments came during speculation that iran might use its 
influence on its supporters in lebanon to release the hostages a 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war is scheduled to start saturday and 
iran has been making conciliatory statements toward the west since 
accepting the unsponsored ceasefire on july 18 
but the islamic jihad statement released today said none of 
the captives will be released until our demands are met in full 
the statement outlined the demands as 
the release of all our mujahedeen holy fighters from all 
arab and foreign prisons including 17 shiites convicted in the 
1983 bombings of the us and french embassies in kuwait and now 
held in kuwaiti prisons 
the release of all lebanese and palestinian mujahedeen from 
the prisons of israel and its surrogates in the southern lebanese 
security zone and christian east beirut 
the unconditional withdrawal of all the israeli forces and 
their allies from south lebanon 
the reconstruction of south lebanon and beirut which have been 
devastated by the americanisraeli plot and compensation for our 
oppressed people in lebanon for all the losses it suffered 
the statement said any expected rapid release of the hostages is 
a mirage assumed to be water by a thirsty man 
we are the only side that decides the fate of the captives be 
it at the level of releasing them executing them or maintaining 
their detention 
the wednesday night caller said in arabic british hostage 
terry waite is alive and we might release him if the government of 
british prime minister margaret thatcher showed good intentions 
waite 48 disappeared jan 28 1987 after leaving a west beirut 
hotel to negotiate the release of hostages with representatives of 
islamic jihad 
there was no way to authenticate the telephoned statement which 
would be the first admission by islamic jihad that it holds waite 
no group has formally claimed responsibility for his abduction 
in addition to anderson the group has admitted holding 
sutherland 57 of fort collins colo sutherland acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut was abducted june 
9 1985 
islamic jihad repeatedly has warned not to trust the 
authenticity of telephone statements attributed to it 
but a man claiming to speak for islamic jihad announced the 
release of three french hostages in a may 4 telephone call to the 
east beirut headquarters of the christian radio station voice of 
lebanon the three were released in moslem west beirut less than an 
hour later 
the telephone caller said wednesday that waite would be released 
on the occasion of ashoura a shiite anniversary of the 7th 
century killing of imam hussein the prophet mohammeds grandson 
and one of the sects most revered saints the occasion falls on 
monday 
britains ambassador to lebanon alan ramsey said he had no 
information related to the phone statement 
the british government this month sent a highlevel diplomat to 
tehran for talks archbishop of canterbury robert runcie the 
spiritual leader of the anglican church met in london with a top 
iranian diplomat in an effort to gain the release of waite and two 
other british hostages in lebanon

extensive surgery to correct his condition has been declared a male 
in an unusual court ruling a move he hopes will end a lifetime of 
sexual harassment 
ive always known inside that i was male but i wanted 
something tangible said scott brenatelli 28 who spent one 
month as a policewoman and was once sent to a female prison 
circuit judge nath doughtie issued the ruling tuesday based on 
medical evidence and testimony 
according to records brenatelli was born with hermaphroditism 
a condition in which a person has both male and female reproductive 
organs 
he said he was taunted as a child and tormented as an adult 
because of his birth defect because his gender was incorrectly 
listed as female on his birth certificate brenatelli spent much of 
his life as linda schaefer an unpopular and unruly girl who 
dressed in boys clothing 
now maybe i can finally get my birth certificate and my life 
straightened out said brenatelli who has served prison time for 
convictions of insurance fraud grand theft and failing to appear 
in court he was released from prison in may and has lived near 
gainesville since then 
bernatelli was hired as a police officer in cocoa in 1980 under 
the name linda schaefer he was fired a month later and sued the

work stoppages today crippled four 
coal mines in southwestern poland and spread in the key baltic port 
of szczecin where bus workers joined longshoremen on strike 
opposition activists said 
the protests which began tuesday with an occupation strike at a 
major mine in jastrzebie were called to demand pay raises and 
legalization of the banned solidarity trade union movement 
more than 2000 workers at the andaluzja coal mine went on 
strike today solidarity leaders said the mine is about 40 miles 
from three other coal mines closed by strikes its director henryk 
pyka confirmed a strike had begun 
solidarity leaders said about 600 bus workers in szczecin also 
launched a sympathy strike today paralyzing public transportation 
in the city solidarity spokesman wojciech maziarski said about 
1000 dock workers were on strike there in the second day of a 
stoppage 
workers at the moszczenica mine near jastrzebie refused to pick 
up their tools late wednesday declaring support for other striking 
miners said adam kowalczyk a solidarity leader 
kowalczyk said about 700 workers were occupying the mine which 
employs about 11000 workers and is one of the nations largest he 
said workers put up a huge solidarity banner over the front gate 
and demanded louspeakers 
witnesses said police moved in to seal off the area 
the coal mine is in the rich mining region of silesia where 
workers at the july manifesto mining complex put down their tools 
tuesday witnesses and solidarity officials said there were about 
5000 miners in the complex today 
more than 400 miners struck for a second day at the morcinek 
coal mine 12 miles away near the czech border 
 
there is a strike mood in many parts of the country said 
bogdan lis a solidarity leader one should expect that there 
will be more strikes 
the strikers are demanding legalization of solidarity along 
with improved working conditions and higher pay to offset 60 
percent inflation and nationwide price increases of 40 percent 
communist authorities coping with the second serious wave of 
strikes this year declared the stoppages illegal and appeared to 
have cut off telephone lines to several key solidarity spokesmen 
the staterun pap news agency in a dispatch late wednesday 
said the governing politburo discussed general labor unrest issues 
at a meeting tuesday 
pap said that while the government must conduct constant 
dialogue with workers strike blackmail which is accompanied by 
calls to repeat a situation of complete chaos in the life of the 
country can only deepen economic problems 
there can be no return to anarchy pap said in an apparent 
reference to strikers efforts to revive solidarity which was born 
eight years ago this month during a nationwide strike wave 
solidarity was declared illegal in 1982 
solidarity leaders said a third round of talks at the july 
manifesto mine wednesday proved inconclusive 
strike leaders and management discussed the creation of an 
independent union that would not be called solidarity but no 
agreement was reached solidarity officials said 
jan kostecki a solidarity leader in szczecin said dock workers 
went on strike after a fruitless round of talks with management 
there about 7000 people are employed in the port polands second 
largest after gdansk 
we support all of the demands of the july manifesto mine 
workers said andrzej andrzejczak head of the strike committee 
at the morcinek mine which has about 2300 workers 
police sealed off the july manifesto mine on tuesday after about 
4000 workers refused to pick up their tools about 9000 workers 
are employed at the july manifesto mine one of polands largest 
and a key producer of highgrade export coal it is 280 miles 
southwest of warsaw 
miners leaving the july manifesto facility early wednesday said 
the wage demands were based on hardships caused by polands 
economic situation 
polands miners are paid nearly twice the national average wage 
which in july was 106 a month at the official exchange rate they 
receive extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the 
nations economy 
poland is the worlds fourth largest exporter of coal and its 
mining operations are essential to its steel power and 
shipbuilding industries 
five strikes in poland from april 25 to may 10 and brief work 
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places constituted the 
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown 
the workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of 
solidarity along with wage increases

a design error will force workers to take 
down and rebuild the center section of a partially completed 16 
million bridge near downtown minneapolis the state department of 
transportation has confirmed 
the mistake will cost up to 200000 take three to four weeks 
to correct and force an overnight shutdown of interstate ramps 
leading to minnesota highway 12 a department spokesman said 
its not that uncommon on a project this size but correcting 
it usually does not involve taking the steel down said al pint 
state corridor manager for the i394 project 
the bridge will carry car pool van and bus traffic between 
i394 downtown minneapolis and i94 interstate 394 a freeway 
running west from minneapolis to wayzata is scheduled to be 
completed in 1992 construction began in 1984 
a state survey crew discovered the design error aug 8 when it 
conducted a required steel erection inspection 
pint said the states design consultant edwards amp kelcey of 
edina inadvertently included a rise in camber in a 30foot section 
of the bridge which is more than a halfmile long bridge 
specifications called for a lowered camber or convex curve 
pint estimated that correcting the error could cost 100000 to 
200000 which the state might have to help pay because it 
accepted the faulty design

police investigating a burglar alarm at 
night shot and killed a man in his home who jumped an officer after 
mistaking him for an intruder a lawyer for the officers said

vincent said wednesday the preliminary indications are that this 
was a case of mistaken identity by the homeowner and mistaken 
identity by the police officers 
leonard bontekoe 31 was killed sunday night after he 
apparently mistook ypsilanti police officer eugene rush for a 
burglar jumped on him and grappled for his gun vincent said the

on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated

a burglar alarm that went off during a thunderstorm sunday night

jumped by bontekoe 
he was knocked backward out of the door while this man 
grappled for the officers gun vincent said officer justice 
fired in defense of himself and in defense of his partner

raincoat and justice in a yellow rain slicker had identified 
themselves as police 
police have said bontekoe who was nearsighted wasnt wearing 
his glasses when he saw a man come through his back door

a small earthquake rattled central utah early 
today but there were no reports of damage or injury 
the quake struck at 644 am and registered 46 on the richter 
scale of ground motion according to the us geological surveys 
national earthquake information service at golden colo it was an 
aftershock of an earlier temblor 
initial reports of the quake came from price east carbon and 
helper the quakes epicenter was 34 miles south of price 
the carbon county sheriffs office said it received numerous 
calls and the emery county sheriffs office also received a few 
calls from residents asking about the earthquake 
the central utah area was hit by three quakes on sunday the 
largest of which was 56 on the richter scale the temblors caused 
minor damage and were followed by about a dozen aftershocks on 
monday 
seismologists had said aftershocks could continue through 
midweek 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 45 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 35 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in a populated area and a 4 can cause moderate damage in the 
local area

george bush savoring victory after a 
10month quest for the republican presidential nomination said he 
was upbeat and ready to go today preparing an acceptance 
speech billed as thoughtful quiet and personal 
aides said bush has been working on tonights speech for weeks 
and was expected to sandwich some lastminute practicing into a 
full day of events at the republican national convention 
press secretary sheila tate characterized the speech as 
thoughtful quiet personal 
during the campaign bush said today at a breakfast for texas 
delegates he will spell out differences between his views and 
those of democratic rival michael dukakis differences i think 
are so fundamental that the american people will find them hard to 
believe 
but thats only half the equation putting his record in 
shape bush said the other half is spelling out with clarity 
what i want to do as president of the united states 
and yes ive been a loyal vice president but now the gears 
shift tonight and im going to be the nominee of this party for 
president and im going to set the agenda 
he told the cheering delegates im upbeat and ready to go 
bush had been expected to appear at the breakfast with his new 
running mate sen dan quayle of indiana but he said quayle was 
elsewhere in the hotel working on his own acceptance speech 
bush also planned to attend a rally for his wife barbara and 
then a 1000perplate luncheon at the convention center expected 
to raise 4 million for the republican national committee 
the vice president watched the tally that handed him the 
nomination on television in his hotel suite with barbara and other 
family members including six of his 10 grandchildren 
it is a special moment the conclusion was foregone but its 
special bush told reporters as his oldest son george w bush a 
texas delegate announced the vote that clinched the nomination 
all five of bushs adult children are delegates to the 
convention and wednesday nights session looking at times like a 
bush family production included a seconding speech in spanish 
from his mexicanborn daughterinlaw columba 
asked about his acceptance speech bush said all ready feel 
comfortable about it ready to go 
it will be bushs first appearance before the convention 
although he spent about 30 minutes wednesday morning testing the 
equipment on the podium while the superdome convention hall still 
was empty 
id like to do it without my specs bush said claiming he 
planned to remove the wirerimmed glasses he usually wears for 
speaking engagements as he reads from the teleprompter on the 
podium 
well do all right ill do ok bush said of the speech 
aides appeared intent on lowering expectations for what could be 
the most important speech of his life 
were a little nervous about the teleprompter hes not used 
to it said media adviser roger ailes 
added press secretary tate he says hes not william jennings 
bryan the fiery late 19th century orator and threetime 
presidential candidate 
however she said he will give a good speech the michael 
dukakis speech lacked any specifics george bush feels strongly 
that he needs to lay out where he will lead 
speechwriter peggy noonan who has been working on the speech 
with bush since midjuly said that bush was continuing to 
finetune the speech which so far has been through at least four 
drafts 
bush aides said wednesday that after the convention bush and 
quayle would set out together on a campaign trip through indiana 
ohio and illinois the latter two states key industrial 
battlegrounds in the fall election bush will go on alone for 
campaign stops in the pacific northwest followed by a midweek 
appearance with president reagan in southern california 
at a news conference with quayle on wednesday bush said they

president pw botha vowed today to 
oppose black majority rule as long as he is in power and said 80 
percent of white voters would support segregated residential areas 
in a referendum 
in a policy speech at the governing national partys congress in 
natal province botha said he was prepared to hold a referendum 
among whites to determine whether they wished to retain segregated 
residential areas he said 80 percent would vote in favor 
equally i have reason to believe that if such a referendum is 
held among the indian and colored mixedrace communities some 70 
percent will favor the protection of their own residential areas 
botha said i invite the coloreds and the indians to prove the 
opposite 
when parliament reconvenes next week it is expected to take up 
three new bills relating to segregation they would allow the first

here is some of what newspapers abroad had to say this week on 
republican presidential nominee george bushs choice of sen dan 
quayle as his running mate in the november presidential election 
</TEXT>

corriere della sera of milan moderate quayle has 
satisfied a strong and restless right wing with a man who has the 
energy of a 40yearold and the ideas of an 80yearold 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
il messaggero of rome moderate quayle adds a touch of 
youthful energy to bushs fortunes in the midwest he is 
strikingly telegenic and his impetuous oratory is accompanied by 
wide and vigorous gestures which have earned him many admirers but 
also ironic smiles from those who contest his inexperience and his 
ambition 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
le monde liberal in his appearances on television sen 
quayle showed that he knows very well how to use his blue eyes and 
his natural ease to impose his presence 
</TEXT>

the guardian liberal the younger one michael dukakis 
went for the old man sen lloyd bentsen 67 while the older 
one bush has gone for the boy 
dan quayles rightwing politics seem likely to count for more 
than his youth on the campaign trail bentsen is there to do that 
for dukakis but that makes more sense george bush clearly 
assesses the mood of america as still reaganite seeking 
continuity not movement towards the center 
he feels his best hope of making it one more for the gipper 
is to offer more of the same but with added youthful good looks 
</TEXT>

the daily telegraph conservative by passing over better 
known and more powerful republican figures and choosing a young 
brash 41yearold senator of limited experience as his election 
partner george bush has taken a gamble 
sen lloyd bentsen dukakiss running mate and 26 years older 
than quayle has said drily that he looks forward to comparing 
their respective records of accomplishment well he may 
in reality the reagan years have been distinguished not so 
much by their conservatism as by the force of new ideas mr bush 
has not so far shown himself to be gifted in this respect and it 
is a main weakness it is very hard indeed to see this weakness 
being redeemed by the amiable but lightheaded senator from 
indiana 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the financial times independent the midwest is going to be 
decisive and mr quayle is a proven local vote getter his youth 
and good looks might help close mr bushs large gender gap with 
women though his opposition to abortion will not nor will the 
party platform if it is promoted seriously 
it is possible that mr bush has come up with a clever choice 
but it is a gamble and one wide open to counterattack mr quayles 
public record is very thin and it is impossible to say with any 
confidence that he is qualified to be the proverbial heartbeat away 
from the presidency let alone to sharpen the blurred image mr 
bush himself conveys to the public at large

a federal jury has indicated it could be close 
to a verdict in a multimilliondollar lawsuit accusing the hunt 
brothers of attempting to corner the silver market 
the sixmember civil jury late wednesday notified us district 
judge morris e lasker that it had answered all but one of the 27 
questions it had to resolve in order to reach a verdict 
the panel began its fourth day of deliberations this morning 
the jury indicated in a note to lasker that it was stuck on the 
question dealing with the issue of damages to be awarded 
because the 11page verdict sheet requires the jury to make a 
finding of some antitrust civil racketeering or fraud violation 
before considering damages trial observers said that seemed to 
indicate the panel had voted in favor of minpeco sa on at least one 
of its allegations 
minpeco a mineral marketing company owned by the peruvian 
government is suing the hunts for 150 million and seeking treble 
damages under federal antitrust and civil racketeering statutes 
the trial began in february 
minpeco said nelson bunker hunt 62 william herbert hunt 59 
who also has extensive real estate holdings and lamar hunt 56 
owner of the national football leagues kansas city chiefs 
conspired unsuccessfully with several middle eastern businessmen to 
corner the world silver market 
minpeco said the hunts bought unusually large amounts of silver 
bullion in an alleged effort to manipulate world silver prices 
between 1979 and 1980 in the failed attempt to corner the market 
the hunts denied the allegations they said that unstable world 
political conditions drove up silver prices and that they suffered 
enormous losses when the silver market collapsed in march 1980

a cartoonist hired by the ohio republican 
party to lampoon democrats says any similarity between his cartoons 
and those published by pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist jeff 
macnelly is strictly coincidental 
but macnelly who draws for the chicago tribune said he might 
turn the matter over to an attorney 
it concerns me enough that i think im going to call the 
tribune lawyer and have them call the ohio republican party and see 
what the deal is macnelly told the dayton daily news 
the daily news reported today that four cartoons drawn by ed 
wilson for the ohio gop are virtually the same as the macnelly 
drawings published four years ago except that the political 
figures have been changed in two others the artwork is strikingly 
similar but the subject matter is different the newspaper said 
the similarities were found by daily news staff artist randy 
palmer who saw some of wilsons cartoons last weekend and compared 
them with panels he saw in a book of macnellys cartoons the 
newspaper said 
wilson who is in new orleans for the republican national 
convention expressed disbelief when told of the similarities and 
said they are coincidental 
oh i dont think thats plagiarism the case wilson told 
the daily news why would i do that 
macnelly has not seen wilsons cartoons but they were described 
to him by an editor of the tribune who received copies of the 
drawings from the daily news 
one of macnellys cartoons shows president jimmy carter standing 
in a trash can while he speaks at a lectern an adviser is saying 
no no no stand on your record not in it now youve got it 
all over your suit 
wilsons cartoon features massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the democratic presidential nominee also standing in a trash can 
behind a lectern a voice from the auditorium is saying no no 
no stand on your record not in it 
macnellys cartoons are syndicated by the tribune syndicate co 
and were published in his 1984 book directions 
wilson who also worked for ohio gop in the late 1970s said he 
has seen macnellys work but not the cartoons in the book 
i didnt even know he macnelly had a book out to be honest 
with you wilson said 
wilson 41 who has been drawing cartoons for 10 years and was 
hired by the ohio gop six weeks ago has drawn about 30 cartoons 
for the republicans the cartoons have been attached to press 
releases and on at least two occasions handed out to the public

michael dukakis today congratulated george bush for 
winning the republican presidential nomination but then quickly 
criticized his fall rival as a leading player in the reagan 
administrations nonexistent war on drugs 
the democratic presidential nominee refused to answer directly 
when asked whether he thought indiana sen dan quayle bushs 
running mate should have served in vietnam instead of joining the 
national guard 
for them as for us this has been a long marathon dukakis 
said in congratulating bush and his wife barbara now we have 
the official nominees of both parties the fat is in the fire the 
campaign lies ahead 
dukakis then said that he was eager to debate bush and that one 
of the topics should be the federal governments antidrug efforts 
he criticized a white house order reportedly issued wednesday 
that told federal agencies not to cooperate with a congressional 
investigation into why suspicions that panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega was involved in drug trafficking were not passed on to 
congress and other federal agencies 
dukakis accused the reagan administration of stonewalling 
the investigation 
i think the white house does not want to cooperate because 
they are embarrassed by this they should be embarrassed by this 
dukakis said 
he promised tough druglaw enforcement and drug education in 
early elementary school grades and said reagans antidrug effort 
has failed because there is no drug czar directly accountable to 
the president and that an administration committee set up to 
coordinate antidrug programs has done little constructive work 
the vice president is on the committee he doesnt show up at 
meetings dukakis said this war against drugs is 
nonexistent 
dukakis has indirectly criticized the 41yearold quayle by 
listing the accomplishments of his running mate texas sen lloyd 
bentsen but dukakis chose his words carefully today when asked at 
a morning news conference about reports quayle may have used family 
influence to get into the national guard 
i can only speak for myself dukakis said i served my 
country i did so proudly dukakis was an army private in korea 
dukakis told a friendly audience of greekamericans that if 
elected he would restore pride and competence and respect for 
the law 
he attributed gop convention attacks on him to a pretty 
desperate republican party 
i dont think the american people are interested in this kind 
of thing the massachusetts governor said i think they want a 
president who is going to be strong and optimistic and confident 
about this country thats the kind of person i am 
then as he did earlier wednesday in minnesota dukakis touted 
the 18year senate experience of his running mate texas sen lloyd 
bentsen and implied quayle was not ready to be the nations no 2 
leader 
nobody has questioned whether lloyd bentsen is qualified for 
the job or ready to step into the presidency if that became 
necessary dukakis said 
he used that tack repeatedly to promote bentsen over quayle 
while dukakis aides were more direct in characterizing quayle as 
too inexperienced for the vice presidency 
today dukakis delivered his standard stump speech to a 
convention of greekamericans invoking the ancient athenian oath 
of public service he frequently adds to his speeches and promising 
if elected to strengthen nato and work for peace in cypress 
dukakis as he often does before greekamerican audiences 
devoted a significant portion of his speech to the issue of 
government ethics 
respect for the law is the most basic the most conservative 
and the most important principle of our democratic society 
dukakis said and its why i want to restore pride and competence 
and respect for the law to the highest office in the land 
dukakis was heading from miami to alabama where he was to tour 
the marshall space center in huntsville and then a baptist church 
in birmingham it is unusual for the nominee of one party to 
campaign during the other partys convention but bush broke 
tradition by campaigning during the final two days of the 
democratic convention

when randy callison objected to 
seeing police officers driving around in his confiscated corvette 
an officer said the department was just keeping it in condition 
im really steamed about it said callison 33 nobodys 
told me anything at all but theyre out driving my vehicle around 
hotrodding it 
the citys point is that it isnt callisons car anywmore 
hopefully within three or four months well have title and 
well sell it at a public auction medira beach city manager paul 
williams said 
callison said tuesday was the second time he saw his car on the 
streets since his arrest july 24 on a drug charge he thought it 
was sitting in an impound lot 
chief rr menard lt matthew mcshane and a detective have been 
taking turns driving the car to and from work to keep it in 
condition mcshane said 
in this particular case the point i have to emphasize is its 
not because its such a toy of a car mcshane said its such a 
specialty type of vehicle that for that car to sit up for any 
length of time would be far more detrimental to it 
williams said the city insured callisons corvette and uses it 
along with two other confiscated cars 
police said they seized the 1984 corvette after stopping 
callison for failing to use his turn signal and discovering trace 
amounts of a white powdery substance in a film container 
callison is scheduled to go to court sept 12 on a charge of 
possession of cocaine 
the car was confiscated under the florida contraband forfeiture 
act which allows seizure of cars boats and other valuables used in 
the commission of a felony before assuming ownership of 
confiscated property however an agency seeking forefeiture must 
prove its case in court

sen dan quayle scheduled to become the 
republican vice presidential nominee tonight is discovering that 
he has a tough task persuading his party of his worthiness for the 
job 
praised by george bush as one of the partys rising young 
stars the youthful indiana senator exulted in the spotlight 
wednesday but ran into some long shadows cast by questions about 
his experience wealth military record and a 1980 
sexandinfluence scandal 
today quayle was to have accompanied bush to talk to texas 
delegates but bush told the group his running mate was upstairs 
working on his speech 
quayle will deliver his primetime acceptance speech after his 
name is put into nomination by sen bob dole of kansas war hero 
and onetime bush primary opponent campaign sources said the rules 
were changed earlier this week to dispense with a roll call on the 
vice presidential nomination and approve the choice with a voice 
vote 
bush put in a pitch for the indiana senator texans will like 
this man he is going to be a great vice president 
while some delegates said they were thrilled with the choice of 
the conservative senator as bushs running mate others wondered 
what quayle brings to the ticket and whether he had skeletons in 
his closet 
we dont know much about dan quayle hes a very 
attractive and upandcoming young star they just brought him 
along faster than people thought said rhode island delegate 
william b anderson of barrington 
at a joint news conference wednesday with bush and in media 
interviews later quayle got a sampling of what concerns he will 
have to address 
he denied suggestions he had a sexual relationship with 
washington lobbyist paula parkinson in 1980 theres nothing to 
it he said however he declined to give a detailed accounting 
of the episode in which mrs parkinson said she shared a vacation 
home with several lawmakers including quayle he did say he has 
not seen her since the golfing vacation 
later wednesday during a combative interview on cable news 
network quayle said a questioner was trying to create something 
that doesnt exist as if something was wrong asked to elaborate 
on his activities that weekend quayle repliedi went down and i 
played golf and i came home and anybody that knows me thats 
exactly what i did 
a cheap shot is how quayle characterized questions about his 
decision to join the national guard after graduating from college 
avoiding the possibility of being drafted and sent to vietnam 
i have a deep affection for those men and women that have 
sacrificed their lives in vietnam to imply anything 
differently is just simply wrong he said 
he later told abc that he chose the national guard because it 
allowed him to fulfill his military obligation and still go to law 
school adding that if his unit had been called for service in 
vietnam i would have gone and served very proudly 
quayle who comes from a wealthy publishing family said reports 
that he was worth 200 million were not correct but he did not 
elaborate saying only that he would release tax returns that will 
show its far less 
as for suggestions that he lacks experience for the job quayle 
told reporters i know perhaps as much about national security as 
anybody with few exceptions 
he said his experience on the senate armed services committee 
and in national security matters gives me a very important 
background about what needs to be done to preserve the freedoms 
and the opportunities in this country i feel prepared 
a babyboomer who has demonstrated appeal among indianas 
bluecollar workers marginal democrats and women voters quayle is 
seen by bush strategists as the spark that can help ignite the 
ticket and bridge the socalled gender gap 
bush aides praise quayles campaigning skills painting him as 
an exuberant vigorous politician reminiscent of john f kennedy 
after the convention bush and quayle will set out on a joint 
campaign trip through indiana ohio and illinois the latter two 
states key industrial battlegrounds in the fall election 
but before that trip quayle must sell himself to many delegates 
skeptical about his youth and experience aides say much of his 
acceptance speech may well be extemporaneous comments praising 
bush attacking democratic nominee michael dukakis and stressing 
his own experience on national security and defense issues 
california gov george deukmejian called the choice of quayle 
bold and imaginative at quayles appearance wednesday before that 
states delegation afterward deukmejian said 
i think we have to see him out there speaking to many groups 
answering questions meeting with the media so i dont think today 
you can draw any conclusions on whether quayle will help bush in 
california an important campaign battleground

the soviet unions chief arms negotiator today 
accused the united states of refusing to discuss ways to monitor 
longrange sealaunched cruise missiles a main issue at strategic 
arms talks 
the envoy alexei obukhov said necessary prerequisites have 
been reached for completing a draft treaty halving both sides 
strategic nuclear arsenals but he again linked progress to limits 
on the sealaunched missiles 
a us official termed the soviet proposals quite 
unrealistic and obukhovs account misleading neither side has 
come up with adequate procedures for verifying this class of 
weapons said the official 
he spoke on condition of anonymity 
both sides still disagree over us plans for a spacebased 
missile defense system in the latest round in the strategic arms 
limitation talks which began july 12 obukhov told reporters 
washington wants to keep the sealaunched missiles outside the 
strategic arms treaty limits saying it is too hard to guard 
against cheating 
but obukhov said the verification issue is quite solvable 
and added this channel for continuation of the race in strategic 
offensive arms must also be reliably blocked 
he said the soviets have proposed several ways to monitor the 
missiles including inspections of ships and production sites 
we wait for the american side to participate in a businesslike 
discussion of these proposals he said as of now we still 
havent had this discussion because of the unwillingness of the 
american side 
tempo is important we shouldnt lose the high pace of the 
talks he said simply declaring ones readiness to work 
constructively is not enough 
obukhov reiterated the soviet position that a new commitment by 
both sides to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty must be part 
of a strategic arms treaty 
moscow says the planned us spacebased missile defense the 
strategic defense initiative violates the abm treaty the reagan 
administration has a more lenient view of the initiative popularly 
known as star wars 
obukhov said soviet officials will emphasize moscows rejection 
of that broad abm interpretation when the two sides meet for a 
regular review of the pact in geneva starting on wednesday

michigans amish dont have to mark their 
horsedrawn buggies with triangular orange slowmoving vehicle 
signs which they say violate their religious rights the state 
court of appeals has ruled 
overturning traffic tickets issued to three men the threejudge 
panel ruled unanimously wednesday that the state has failed to 
come forward with proof in court of a compelling state interest 
to override the mens right to exercise their freedom of religion 
david dreyer attorney for the amish said some of his clients 
felt they might have to leave the state if the court ruled against 
them 
they take it very seriously dreyer said 
the defendants are members of the old order amish estimated by 
dreyer at 100 to 200 families in michigan 
jerry m swartzentruber henry e troyer and amos p gingerick 
were ticketed in october 1980 for failure to display a slowmoving 
vehicle emblem on their buggies the reflectorized orange triangle 
is required on any vehicle going slower than 25 mph 
one defendant testified in district court that the amish 
attempted to lead a plain humble way of life he said that 
requiring the emblem would mean they were trusting in the symbols 
of man rather than in the protection of god 
the appeals court said prosecutors offered no proof that the 
warning signs improved public safety and said they didnt refute an 
amish proposal to use reflectorized tape and red lanterns as an 
alternative 
in future cases if the state does nothing more than rely on 
the statute in the face of the proposed alternative traffic 
citations may not be enforced the appeals court said 
paul pemberton city attorney for beaverton who prosecuted one 
of the cases said he may seek a rehearing seek permission to 
appeal to the supreme court or continue to issue citations against 
amish not carrying the warning sign 
in all likelihood thats what will happen because the 
citizens of the county deserve protection he said we have 
zero enforcement tool left this is a public safety issue as far 
as were concerned this is not a question of a fundamental 
religious tenet

thousands of people rallied today in 
burmas two largest cities to demand an end to authoritarian rule 
diplomats said and the government prepared to choose a replacement 
for the nations ousted leader 
an asian diplomat in the capital of rangoon cited reports that 
100000 people including students and buddhist monks marched 
along the streets of mandalay the nations secondlargest city 
350 miles north of rangoon according to 1984 figures mandalay is 
a city of 600000 people 
a western diplomat in rangoon said at least 1000 protesters 
were present at the start of a demonstration in front of rangoon 
general hospital it was the third straight day of demonstrations 
in burmas capital 
japans kyodo news service reporting from rangoon later put 
the number of rangoon protesters at 15000 it also said thousands 
rallied in mandalay 
security forces made no attempt to interfere with the peaceful 
protests in both cities said the diplomats speaking on condition 
of anonymity kyodo said soldiers armed with bazookas were seen in 
parts of rangoon along with tanks and armored personnel carriers 
meanwhile accusations mounted that rangoons security forces 
shot unarmed civilians last week during massive antigovernment 
riots estimates of those killed range from 95 to more than 3000 
security forces allegedly shot doctors and nurses outside the 
hospital during the rioting which ended the 17day rule of 
hardline president sein lwin 
sein lwin resigned last friday as state president and chairman 
of the burma socialist program party after five days of massive 
protests he had replaced ne win who resigned last month after 26 
years of authoritarian rule 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity cited reports 
that the partys central committee of the burma socialist program 
party has been meeting daily since sein lwins ouster to prepare 
for an emergency party session friday presumably to choose a new 
chairman 
the legislature also is to hold an emergency session the same 
day presumably to name a new president 
the staterun radio rangoon said 52 people arrested in last 
weeks rioting were freed today including 43 students according 
to official reports 155 people had been released in rangoon since 
tuesday 
several prominent figures arrested july 2930 still are being 
held they include the countrys leading dissident aung gyi sein 
win the burmese correspondent of the associated press also 
remains in custody 
us state department officials and a number of rangoon 
diplomats say they can at best estimate the number of dead 
nationwide as in the hundreds given the limited movement of 
diplomats last week in rangoon and elsewhere 
dozens of tourists and some journalists witnessed the mass 
demonstrations last week in rangoon but they returned with vague 
accounts of killings only one photograph of a corpse was seen in 
bangkok 
one senior western diplomat told newsmen that a grisly battle 
of the bodies accounted in part for the lack of information about 
numbers killed 
when someone is killed the protesters try to get it so they 
can display the bodies and government tries to get it to cremate 
it he said 
after demonstrations in march diplomats learned that the bodies 
of a number of young protesters gunned down by police had been 
taken swiftly to a cremation ground and burned 
bertil lintner a swedish journalist and burma scholar says 
3000 persons were killed in rangoon alone including 600 who died 
at the rangoon general hospital he was not in rangoon last week 
but cited witnesses to the demonstrations he later interviewed by 
telephone from bangkok

the call by vice president salvador 
laurel for new presidential elections has attracted little support 
and is widely regarded as an attempt to revive his flagging 
political fortunes 
on aug 13 laurel accused president corazon aquino of 
incompetence and suggested both step down so an election could be 
held she has not responded but said at the time that he did not 
support her during coup attempts in 1986 and 1987 
the vice president has met with opposition leaders including 
sen juan ponce enrile and members of former president ferdinand 
marcos new society movement 
marcos was driven into exile in february 1986 by a 
civilianmilitary uprising that enrile his defense minister 
helped lead enrile also was mrs aquinos defense minister until 
she fired him last november after a coup attempt involving some of 
his followers 
enrile says laurel has been asked to lead a united opposition 
previous attempts at an opposition alliance have foundered over 
personal rivalries 
no major political figure has endorsed laurels proposal for 
elections several politicians who had criticized mrs aquino even 
rallied to her defense along with the nations two roman catholic 
cardinals and nearly all the press 
laurels elder brother sen sotero laurel declared his support 
for the president in a speech to the senate 
some commentators speculated the vice presidents announcement 
indicated a secret alliance between opposition politicians and 
military dissidents who sponsored several coup attempts against 
mrs aquino laurel denied it 
political observers said the tepid reaction measured the slide 
in laurels political fortunes since the mid1980s when he was 
among the bestknown opponents of marcos 
salvador laurel was born into a politically illustrious family 
and seemed to have a bright future in a country where family 
connections carry great weight 
his late father jose was president of the japanese puppet 
government in world war ii and his brother jose jr was speaker of 
the house of representatives before marcos abolished congress in 
1972 and governed by martial law 
critics say the vice presidents impatience poor political 
timing and clear presidential ambitions have been his undoing 
columnist luis teodoro a professor at the university of the 
philippines wrote in the manila standard one of the reasons for 
medias antagonism is the perception that laurel is unpopular with 
the public at large no other politician can arouse as much 
antagonism among ordinary folk 
sheila coronel wrote in her manila chronicle column i think 
that laurel deserves to be taken seriously and it is not 
because he represents the second highest office in the land he 
symbolizes something far more important the mindlessness and 
opportunism of our politics 
laurels decline began when he agreed to shelve his presidential 
ambitions and become mrs aquinos running mate in the february 
1986 presidential election he was under pressure from the 
influential catholic hierarchy which feared he could not unite the 
opposition 
both mrs aquino and marcos claimed victory in the election 
which was widely viewed as fraudulent the marcoscontrolled 
legislature declared him the winner but the uprising drove marcos 
from the country 
mrs aquino also named laurel prime minister but then abolished 
the office he was foreign secretary but resigned in september 
citing a lack of influence and fundamental differences with 
mrs aquino 
i feel like a member of a basketball team who is supposed to 
be the captain because i was supposed to be the prime minister 
originally laurel said but they never passed the ball to me 
they benched me and its already the fourth quarter and im still 
on the bench 
after that laurel made highly publicized visits to military 
camps encouraging soldiers to demand that communists be purged 
from the government 
he later claimed to have a secret intelligence report naming the 
alleged communists it turned out to be a list of public figures 
the military deemed liberal or leftleaning 
his nephew and protege benjamin laurel was defeated for 
governor of the family stronghold province batangas four months 
later several leading members of his united nationalist democratic 
organization including senate floor leader orlando mercado left 
the party for proaquino groups 
the rev joaquin bernas a jesuit university president and 
aquino adviser described laurel as the master miscalculator of 
philippine politics 
this misreading of the peoples pulse could mean that he will 
end his political career not with a bang but with a whimper

the israeli government 
today outlawed palestinian popular committees saying every arab 
who continues to be a member of such committees or to assist them 
will be arrested and put on trial 
popular committees are grassroots groups carrying out the 
directives of the palestinian uprisings underground leaders the 
groups organize protests and patrols and supply food and medical 
assistance to needy palestinians 
the government accused the committees of being an arm of the 
outlawed palestinian guerrilla groups and of organizing violence 
the committees have a double aim to impose by violent means 
the orders of the plo and the uprisings leaders on the population 
and to undermine the israeli authoritiesand to create 
alternative mechanisms instead the defense ministry said in a 
statement 
the move followed deportation orders issued wednesday against 25 
gaza strip and west bank arabs mostly members of the popular 
committees and defense minister yitzhak rabins warnings of a 
crackdown on the popular committees 
meanwhile israel partially lifted a curfew in gaza and 17 
arabs were treated for beating injuries bringing the number of 
such cases to more than 250 in four days red cross and hospital 
officials said 
elsewhere israeli soldiers reportedly shot and wounded a 
palestinian teenager today during clashes in the west bank with 
arabs protesting the explusion wednesday of four palestinians and 
the deportation orders against the others 
the european community meanwhile officially protested the 
deportations 
the international committee of the red cross complained that the 
detention without trial of thousands of palestinians in a harsh 
desert prison violated international humanitarian agreements 
and a londonbased human rights organization amnesty 
international denounced the government policy of beating rioters 
the wounded youth said alshami 19 was shot in the right leg 
after palestinians in central nablus clashed with soldiers said an 
official at al ittihad hospital seven of the 25 palestinians to be 
deported are from nablus 
the army attempting to deal with the violence imposed curfews 
on nine refugee camps and towns in the west bank where 85000 arabs 
live it lifted a threeday curfew from parts of the occupied gaza 
strip but left the restriction in force against 180000 
palestinians in the area 
in half a dozen west bank cities palestinian merchants 
shuttered their shops to protest the deportations and the shooting 
deaths of two palestinians in a riot in ketziot prison this week 
a 9yearold palestinian girl died today from a rock injury in 
the head apparently sustained during a clash with soldiers in the 
town of jenin on wednesday night arab news reports said the army 
confirmed rasha artawi was killed by a rock but said it was 
unclear how the injury occurred 
the death raised to 248 the number of palestinians killed in the 
eightmonthold uprising four israelis also have died

even before the republican national 
convention ended thursday houston began campaigning to persuade 
gop officials to hold their next quadrennial gathering in texas 
largest city 
donald ward of the houston convention and visitors bureau was 
making the rounds this week distributing red white and blue 
stickers that read houston 92 convention and talking with 
various republican groups 
i think houston will host one of the national political 
conventions in 1992 i really do said ward who made a similar 
recruiting trip to atlanta for last months democratic convention 
ward said houston has one big thing going for it no matter who 
wins the november election a houston resident will be at the white 
house 
republican presidential nominee george bush calls houston home 
even if his current address is a hotel room and democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsens residence is a houston 
condominium 
surely the hometown factor gives houston a leg up ward said 
we are in a very unique position either way it goes the 
president or the vice president will be from houston he said 
houston made a determined pitch to win this years democratic 
convention although it was passed over for atlanta by democratic 
national committee chairman paul kirk 
ward said the city has several advantages to offer in trying to 
lure a convention 
first the new george r brown convention center is massive 
with 43 permanent meeting rooms and enough temporary rooms to give 
each state delegation its own he said both state party 
conventions were held there this year with the democrats sending 
some 10000 delegates and alternates 
in addition ward said houston has more than enough hotel space 
so no delegate would be more than 30 minutes from the hall

zoologists are heading to siberia to search for 
the abominable snowman while remains of a mammoth have been found 
elsewhere in the frozen expanse news reports said thursday 
the official news agency tass said fishermen from the siberian 
city of yakutsk discovered the fossilized mammoth in permafrost 
near the khroma and indigirka rivers scientists said the skeleton 
was well preserved because it had been frozen in the ground for at 
least 15000 years in northwestern siberia 
the remains soon will be taken to yakutsk where they will be 
assembled tass said 
the newspaper socialist industry reported that 12 scientists 
sportsmen and enthusiasts planned to search in the tyumen region of 
western siberia for the abominable snowman

explorer used several years ago the explorer vladimir pushkaryov 
disappeared in the region while interviewing residents who tell 
legends about the mysterious creature they call kompolen the 
newspaper said 
a group of tourists also disappeared in the area and the 
expedition will look for them as well as the abominable snowman 
the newspaper reported it did not say when the expedition would 
begin 
the hairy behemoth said to roam the snowy expanses of siberia 
and other areas is a favorite legend among supersititious soviets 
tass reported in january that the soviet culture ministry had set 
up a society of cryptozoologists to search for the snowman 
in march a newspaper said a mongolian adventurer claimed to 
have made plaster molds of an abominable snowmans footprints and 
photographed the creature sitting on a rock the sighting was

stillwater national wildlife refuge becomes 
the nations second western hemisphere shorebird reserve this 
weekend but the honor may be a hollow one for the ailing swamp 
things are looking pretty bleak right now said norm saake 
a waterfowl biologist for the nevada department of wildlife he 
predicts that 80 percent of the marshes in the 164000acre refuge 
will be dried up by the end of the summer 
racked by backtoback drought years that have distilled the 
wetlands to a suffocating toxinridden stew the refuge 60 miles 
east of reno has become a murky grave to more than 7 million fish 
and 2000 birds in the past 18 months 
steve thompson a wildlife biologist at stillwater estimates 
the marsh areas will barely total 3000 acres by dedication time 
if were real lucky were getting down to the last ponds now 
after 1986 the most recent year of heavy precipitation 
stillwater swelled to 23628 acres of managed marshland thompson 
said by the following year it had dwindled to onethird of that 
and now after two abnormally dry years barely 4000 acres of 
marshes remain 
its just a shadow of what it was thompson said its 
been a tough year 
saturdays dedication will make the refuge the fourth western 
hemisphere shorebird reserve in north and south america and the 
second in this country according to laurie hunter of the national 
audubon society in new york the other us site is the delaware 
bay shoreline in new jersey and delaware 
the selection was made by the western hemisphere reserve 
network a conservation group made up of government and private 
agencies including the audubon society 
its quite an honor thompson said i think part of their 
reasoning was to draw some attention to the place its in dire 
straits 
stillwater is one of the last remnants of prehistoric lake 
lahontan which once covered all of western nevada most of the 
former lake bed shriveled long ago into dry sinks that fill up only 
during very wet years 
the refuge drew wide attention in february 1987 when the 
increasing salinity of its evaporating waters killed an estimated 7 
million fish in the carson sink one of several former lakes that 
comprise the refuge an unrelated outbreak of avian cholera killed 
about 1500 water birds 
since then the lakes have shrunk to ponds finally killing even 
the most salttolerant fish the water thats left in the carson 
river by the time it reaches stillwater is also polluted by 
agricultural runoff and natural elements from the soil like 
arsenic boron and mercury 
while the fish can withstand the toxic levels during highwater 
years the concentration of chemicals loss of oxygen and growth of 
algae become intolerable as the water evaporates 
its just poor quality water thats killing these fish 
thompson said 
the situation is worsening for birds as well as fish avian 
botulism has claimed 650 birds in recent weeks and scientists 
search the refuge daily looking for dead and dying birds to be 
burned or buried in an effort to keep the disease in check 
while scientists are concerned about the possible effects of the 
toxic water and disease on this falls migrating waterfowl saake 
said the dying wetlands could discourage birds from making their 
usual stop at stillwater along the pacific flyway 
we dont have enough water to keep them attracted here he 
said 
for migrating birds stillwater is a critical stepping stone 
in the 6000mile route between arctic breeding grounds and 
wintering areas in the southern united states and central and south 
america ms hunter said 
because it is one of the most important inland staging areas 
for migrating birds in north america stillwater has worldwide 
ecological value she said 
efforts to win more water for the refuge chiefly by acquiring 
carson river water rights are pending in congress one measure 
calling for a federal environmental protection agency study to 
determine whether treated sewage could be routed to stillwater has 
passed and is on president reagans desk 
another measure still in hearings would shift 12 million 
earmarked for flood control work to buying farmers water rights 
for the sanctuary 
sen chic hecht rnev calls both of his proposals a start 
on the long road back for stillwater 
between hechts work in washington and efforts by private 
environmental and wildlife groups saake said stillwaters current 
peril and saturdays dedication as a shorebird reserve may provide 
the attention that could save it 
theres finally light at the end of the tunnel just because 
its so bad he said

told the newspaper that the indiana senator questioned him about 
aspects of the guard

took place surrounding quayles enlistment in the guard a move

vietnam 
i imagine i was talking to danny one day phillippi said 
he was a newspaperman you know we got to conventions together 
id known him and his parents and his wifes parents for many many 
years 
he wondered if it was subject to call phillippi said in a 
telephone interview with the newspaper 
phillippi who retired from the news in 1984 said he called on 
his multitude of friends within the guard when quayle applied 
in 1969 even though he had relinquished his command five years 
earlier 
later when personnel from the adjutant generals office sought 
his advice phillippi suggested that quayle should be given 
consideration 
i was asked about dan quayles abilities and capabilities and 
i recommended him very highly for acceptance in the national guard 
after i left the national guard as i did with many other men 
phillippi told the newspaper thats about all i know about it 
phillippi said he never talked to pulliam about his grandsons 
military service but the topic did arise in conversations with 
eugene s pulliam the son of eugene c pulliam and quayles uncle 
the younger pulliam was then assistant publisher of the news and 
the star he now serves as publisher of the news and the star 
lord i talked with gene every day phillippi said we 
discussed many people interested in guard duty if anyone was 
interested they were sent to me obviously we were interested in 
recruiting the best people and quayle was one of them 
eugene s pulliam said he does not remember any such 
conversation 
well i dont have any recollection at all of talking to 
wendell about that pulliam said i know he was very active in 
the guard but i have no recollection of mentioning danny or 
anybody else

even needed any help in getting into the national guard 
john s anderson a democrat and adjutant general immediately 
before quayle joined the guard said there was a waiting list for 
guard service john n owens a republican who assumed the position 
in january 1969 said there was room for anyone who wanted to join 
quayle born on feb 4 1947 drew number 210 for the year 1970

a marble head of achilles that was once 
regarded as one of the j paul getty museums significant 
antiquities has been determined to be a fake a museum spokeswoman 
said 
the marble head had been dated 350340 bc and was believed to 
have been created by the greek sculptor and architect skopas as a 
temple decoration depicting a trojan war scene at tegea 
following extensive research by our staff and outside 
scholars we have concluded that the head is not a greek original 
of the 4th century bc said lori starr the museums 
spokeswoman 
ms starr said the head was removed from display last september 
when there was sufficient doubt to warrant a thorough 
investigation 
in 1986 the museums handbook described the head as one of the 
few orignial greek sculptures in western european or american 
collections that can be placed within the context of a specific 
monument 
ms starr would not reveal details of the investigation pending 
a settlement with the anonymous dealer who sold the head to the 
museum in 1979 
the getty has also removed from its galleries a marble stele or 
stone slab identified as an archaic attic grave relief ms starr 
said the museum has been reconsidering the piece for several years 
the museum will publish a report on both items when research on 
the stele is complete ms starr said 
achilles was the mythological hero slain by an arrow to his 
heel attica is the peninsula of greece where athens was built

george bush today polished a speech to accept 
the republican presidential nomination as campaign aides tried to 
defuse a controversy about whether newly picked running mate dan 
quayle had used influence to get into the national guard during the 
vietnam war 
brushing aside the issue bush declared at a fundraising 
luncheon with quayle at his side i dont think i could have 
selected anybody thatll do more to help the election than dan 
quayle of indiana he is going to be outstanding on this ticket 
quayle told the enthusiastic crowd im darn proud to have 
george bush as our presidential nominee i cant wait to get out 
there i cant wait to take this campaign to the american 
people 
neither mentioned the controversy 
bush campaign chief james a baker iii said his staff was 
continuing to explore the issue with quayle marilyn quayle 
said her husband who was 22 at the time wasnt a draft dodger 
jeff nesbit quayles press secretary said it was the 
collective recollection of quayle and his father newspaper 
publisher james quayle that phone calls may have been made on 
his behalf 
a retired executive of the pulliam family newspaper empire 
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi who worked for quayles 
grandfather said he had contacted a multitude of guard 
acquaintances on behalf of quayle the indianapolis news reported 
today 
bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen said not a single 
thought is being given to dropping quayle from the ticket 
tonight bush goes before the republican national convention 
with a 20minute speech that he calls the most important one hes 
ever given senate republican leader bob dole himself a war hero 
was to nominate quayle a conservative 41yearold senator as 
bushs running mate 
im upbeat and ready to go bush told cheering texas 
delegates at a breakfast gathering on the final day of the 
republican national convention 
ive been a loyal vice president but now the gears shift 
tonight and im going to be the nominee of this party for 
president and im going to set the agenda he said 
recently revived in the polls bush still faces the challenge of 
defining his vision of the nations future and dealing with voters 
remaining questions about his ability to lead and what he stands 
for 
less than 24 hours after bush picked quayle questions were 
raised about his service in the guard 
quayle told nbctv that in 1969 he had let a number of people 
know i wanted to get into the national guard and added if 
phone calls were made i cant answer i dont know the specifics 
of that 
bush campaign chief baker appearing on abctv today said 
quayle basically said look i really wanted to serve in the 
guard i was anxious to do that i wanted to go to law school 
i was anxious to do that and if some people helped me they helped 
me 
added baker i think frankly hes talking about help from 
his family which really wasnt particularly unusual given the 
circumstances of the time given the attitude if you will of many 
baby boomers at the time toward that situation 
bush pollster robert teeter said quayle during the search for a 
running mate had said no one helped him get into the guard 
john owens adjutant general of the indiana national guard from 
january 1969 until august 1972 said indiana had vacancies 
galore in its guard units during his years however john s 
anderson adjutant general immediately before owens told the 
indianapolis news there was a waiting list for guard service 
reacting to the news rep tom tauke riowa said if they 
pulled strings to get him out of going to vietnam hes got a 
problem it happened 20 years ago but it is still a problem 
however senate minority leader alan simpson of wyoming said 
its a bunch of crap theres about 10 million people in the 
national guard who should be offended by all of this 
amid the final day convention celebrations bush attended a 
rally for his wife barbara before going to a 1000aplate 
luncheon expected to raise 4 million for the republican national 
committee 
introducing his wife earlier bush said strategists had told him 
he had to be more dynamic so here we go the introduction with 
feeling with demonstrable emotion the next first lady of the 
united states bush said 
acting like a television game show host he called out come 
on up sweetie pie come on up the audience laughed and 
applauded 
meanwhile there was encouraging news for him in a new public 
opinion poll several polls after last months democratic national 
convention gave democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
leads of 17 points or so but recent surveys have suggested the gap 
has narrowed to next to nothing 
the latest published today by the washington post showed a 
dukakis lead of 49 percent to 46 percent within the polls 
3point margin of potential sampling error the survey was 
conducted from aug 11 through tuesday the day bush named quayle 
among 1119 likely voters nationwide 
bush swept uncontested to the gop presidential nomination 
wednesday night in a balloonfilled celebration that ran past 
midnight before it was over thousands of people had already left 
the louisiana superdome 
for bush it was a family affair all five of his nowadult 
children were delegates to the convention and his mexicanborn 
daughterinlaw columba delivered the final seconding speech for 
his nomination in spanish 
by design bushs oldest son george w bush delivered the 111 
votes of the texas delegation that put the states favorite son 
and the worlds best father over the 1139 delegates needed for 
nomination 
from a hotel suite nearby bush watched the proceedings on 
television surrounded by grandchildren and other relatives 
it is a special moment he said the conclusion was 
foregone but its special all of his children and his 10 
grandchildren will be on stage with bush tonight to share in his 
moment of triumph 
the conventions first order of business will be to ratify 
quayle as the vice presidential nominee and applaud his acceptance

a george bush victory in november would 
likely pit bush loyalists against reagan administration 
officeholders in a mad scramble for government jobs republican 
party analysts say 
while the competition for such highranking jobs wouldnt be 
nearly as publicized as the scramble for the no 2 spot on bushs 
ticket the jockeying would be fierce 
the face of the cabinet would change as it does with any new 
administration but the most grisly competition would involve 
subcabinetlevel jobs like assistant secretaries and agency heads 
even before bush came to this city to claim the presidential 
nomination two longtime vice presidential associates former 
pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh and wall street investment 
banker nicholas f brady were put in the cabinet although brady 
is still awaiting confirmation 
the bush influence also was seen in president reagans 
nomination of texas tech university president lauro f cavazos as 
secretary of education since the vice president had promised a 
month earlier that he would put a hispanic in the cabinet 
both reagan and bush scoffed at suggestions the president was 
helping the vice president get off to a quick start on cabinet 
formation but it is not expected that thornburgh brady and 
cavazos would be asked to relinquish their jobs in a bush 
administration 
ed mahe a veteran republican party consultant and activist 
said cabinet changes are automatic when administrations change 
even if the incumbent party wins 
but he said the real battle lines will be drawn in the 
subcabinet positions such as deputy secretary agency chairman and 
so forth 
mahe said that for the most part it is standard operating 
procedure for such senior political appointees to offer their 
resignations and then let the president decide whether they 
remain 
in bushs case he said i would expect for him to have that 
opportunity to start from scratch he has every right to expect 
them to submit them resignations and even demand it 
mahe said the most intense competition will likely be between 
longtime bush loyalists and conservative reagan administration 
figures who started government services in lesser jobs but moved to 
key toplevel posts during the course of reagans two terms 
so i think there will be intense jockeying by bushtype people 
trying to get in and reagantype conservatives trying to stay 
in he said 
former attorney general william french smith a longtime reagan 
friend who is attending the convention as a delegate from 
california said there is always jockeying for jobs and theres 
not always rationality to it its a strange process 
it turns not just on the connection with the candidate it may 
turn on something entirely different such as the senate 
confirmation process he said 
alan punch green a convention delegate from portland ore 
said he expected that there would be major changes in the cabinet 
to match the bush personality 
you see it now in nick brady at treasury and dick thornburgh 
at justice and youll see it in jim baker going to the state 
department he said

the united states can afford a national 
day care program if fantasy programs like president reagans 
star wars defense plan are cut the wife of democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis said thursday 
kitty dukakis said the question is whether to pay for exotic 
weapons programs that have little chance of working or do we 
provide the best for our children whether its in day care or 
education 
our country is the only industrialized nation in the world 
without comprehensive child care policies mrs dukakis said 
mrs dukakis spoke to reporters following her visit to the day 
care center at st ambrose university where she sang songs and 
chatted with 12 youngsters aged 2 to 5 years 
mrs dukakis said her husband will create a national day care 
partnership program representing labor and industry business and 
education family and government 
he will establish a new office of child care which will have 
the job of assuring that quality affordable acceptable child care 
will be available for all who need it she said 
asked how dukakis would pay for the program mrs dukakis said 
i think you have to make tough choices and michael has talked 
about that whether we have a fantasy called star wars or we 
provide decent affordable day care 
in an interview with the associated press mrs dukakis said she 
does not intend to wield much influence over her husbands conduct 
of the presidency should he win it 
he doesnt need me coaching him we share a great deal we 
will continue doing that she said i understand he is the 
ultimate decisionmaker he is the elected officer and im 
comfortable with that 
mrs dukakis said her other interests as first lady if her 
husband defeats republican george bush in november will be the 
arts a national beautification and preservation program the 
homeless and a national substance abuse program 
i agree with mrs reagan that we have to say no to drugs but 
we have to increase funding for these other parts of her 
program mrs dukakis said 
mrs dukakis said the record of sen dan quayle rind bushs 
vice presidential choice is suspect 
i think women of this country are going to vote on the issues 
on records character mr quayle as senator voted against 
head start voted against the farm credit bill and the drought 
relief bill 
in terms of family issues when you are against the equal 
rights amendment and against money for head start then you have 
problems she said 
she said republican attacks on her husbands record as governor 
of massachusetts as a freespending liberal who would raise taxes 
to support new programs fail to point out his real accomplishments 
my husband has cut taxes five times mrs dukakis said 
they dont talk about that 
but no credible candidate can ever say he wouldnt raise 
taxes especially with the deficit situation she said

a security guard convicted of raping 
and killing a woman will get a new trial because of insufficient 
evidence that the rape occurred while the victim was alive a state 
appeals court has decided 
in a ruling filed this week the 4th district court of appeal 
said the 1979 bludgeoning and strangling of 22yearold savannah 
anderson was a most heinous murder but it reversed the 
conviction of robert lloyd sellars saying that jurors in his 1986 
trial were not instructed properly on the law regarding rape 
unfortunately the failure to properly instruct on rape 
tainted the firstdegree murder verdict as well presiding 
justice harmon scoville wrote in the opinion 
county deputy district attorney richard king said wednesday that 
he will challenge the ruling in higher courts and take sellars to 
trial a second time if necessary 
we are shocked and we are confused king said we feel 
this decision was clearly erroneous as a matter of law 
attorney jennifer keller who represented sellars said she 
believes the justices acted properly in overturning the conviction 
because the rape allegation was not supported by the evidence 
sellars who worked at the irvine apartment complex where ms 
anderson lived was arrested in 1984 five years after she was 
killed 
an orange county superior court jury found sellars guilty of 
firstdegree murder along with a specialcircumstance allegation 
that the offense was committed during the commission of a rape 
sellars was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole

a small earthquake an aftershock of a series 
of quakes on sunday was felt thursday in central utah but there 
were no reports of damage or injury 
the magnitude of the 644 am quake was 46 on the richter 
scale said jim pechmann a seismologist at the university of 
utahs seismograph stations 
a second tremor 10 magnitude was recorded in the same area at 
656 am the university said 
the carbon county sheriffs office said it received numerous 
calls and there were reports of the temblor being felt in emery 
and sanpete counties 
on sunday central utah and western colorado were rocked by 
three quakes the largest of which was about 56 on the richter 
scale of ground motion and caused some minor damage about a dozen 
aftershocks followed monday 
the tremors occurred in an area where there had been no known 
faults 
the epicenter of thursdays temblor was believed to be in 
approximately the same area as sundays about 34 miles south of 
price and 14 miles east of ferron pechmann said 
it was an aftershock of sundays quakes he said seismologists 
had said aftershocks could continue through midweek 
an aftershock of this size is not considered unusual given the 
size of last sundays main shock pechmann said 
every increase of one number on the richter scale means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

many in nasa responded to the challenger 
shuttle accident with a massive clamup that led to a feeling 
of mistrust by the news media toward the space agency a spokesman 
said thursday 
james mcculla director of media services for the national 
aeronautics and space administration said in a speech that 
following the jan 28 1986 challenger explosion there were orders 
from agency administrators that no one was to talk to the media 
about the possible causes of the accident 
this caused some of our nasa people to desert their usual 
openness with the press said mcculla you had a massive 
clamup like never before our reputation with the mass media was 
hurt 
he said there were stories alleging that nasa was attempting to 
cover up the causes of the challenger accident and there arose a 
feeling of mistrust toward nasa 
before the accident he said nasa enjoyed the reputation of a 
mission impossible organization an agency that could tackle 
the difficult assignments and accomplish success because it had 
the best and the brightest engineers and leadership 
but after challenger exploded and killed seven crew members the 
agency came under close scrutiny of the press a presidential 
commission and congress and you could see how the image of 
excellence disintingrated mcculla said 
some scientists and engineers in the agency were confused by the 
media spotlight and resented the criticism he said some of the 
technical leaders were proud of the job nasa had done in the apollo 
lunar program and the agencys other accomplishments he said and 
they couldnt understand why it nasa was being torn down and 
raked over the coals after the accident 
with nasa now in the final stages of preparation for returning 
the shuttle fleet to flight mcculla said the era of what he called 
nasa bashing news stories is over 
the stories now look toward the future he said 
mcculla said the space agency has not abandoned its plans to fly 
ordinary citizens in space one of the seven who died aboard 
challenger was christa mcauliffe a concord nh school teacher 
who had been selected as the first to fly in the citizeninspace 
program 
nasa public relations leaders fought hard for that program 
mcculla said and there still are plans to fly a teacher in the 
future but not until there is total confidence restored in the 
space shuttle 
after weve got that sort of confidence the teacher will go 
for a ride he said how far down the road that will be i 
dont know

twentyfive wideeyed kids from georgia 
beneficiaries of a man who took an airline promotion very very 
seriously began a fourday southern california fling thursday with 
a backstage look at hollywood 
clark howard a retired travel agent flew 26338 miles on 68 
flights in 48 days in a marathononwings to earn the free ride 
west in an eastern airlines promotion 
the 30member entourage 25 youngsters and five chaperones that 
included howard arrived at los angeles international airport at 
1108 am it was the first plane ride ever for many of the 
youngsters ages to 9 to 15 
at first i was nervous but after the plane settled down it 
didnt feel like it was moving it felt like it was just sitting 
there marcus williams 12 said inside the airport terminal 
i want to see all of the beaches and the ladies and disneyland 
and hollywood and the mansions and beverly hills said donald 
cunningham 11 
first stop on the tour was universal studios where frankenstein 
and woody woodpecker are the official greeters at the vip entrance 
we are giving them a very special day here at the tour said 
universal spokesman jim yeager adding that the tour includes 
backstage views of movie making and the miami vice star trek king 
kong and conan the barbarian action shows 
from there a caravan through hollywood and beverly hills and a 
swim at venice beach round out their first day west none of the 
youngsters had ever seen the ocean 
a daylong tour of disneyland on friday a trip to the san diego 
zoo on saturday and a visit to manhattan beach on sunday completes 
the excursion they leave for home sunday afternoon 
eastern offered 60 free tickets to anyone making at least 60 
flights totaling more than 25000 miles in 60 days as part of its 
60th anniversary celebration said paula musto at the airlines 
miami headquarters 
we sort of forgot about it we didnt think anybody would take 
us up on it she said the 30 round trip tickets would have cost 
about 9000 she said 
the children wearing partners against drugs tshirts were 
selected on the basis of their participation in the just say no 
antidrug program 
the entourage included 12 youngsters from big brothersbig 
sisters of metro atlanta and 13 children from the super program 
sponsored by the boys clubs of metro atlanta and the metro atlanta 
council on alcohol and drugs 
this trip may not change their entire lives said judy 
weisberg of the big brothers program but if it makes them feel 
good about themselves its worth every penny 
howard 33 said he decided to earn the free tickets as soon as 
he heard of the promotion because he wanted children to use them 
i want the kids to have a good time he said but what i 
think is much more important than that is that i want the kids to 
have a much greater feel for what this country is and whats out 
there for them 
howard describes himself as mostly retired although he does 
work as a consultant for a publishing house and as host of a travel 
show on wgst radio in atlanta 
i cant think of an air travel deal that occurred that i 
didnt do over the years he said 
the most intense period of travel for howard on this particular 
odyssey was eight flights a day between atlanta and columbia sc 
or charlotte nc for four consecutive days 
wgst will pay for the childrens hotel rooms in california but 
howard paid the 2110 for the 68 flights he took between may 6 and 
june 25 out of his own pocket he chose most of them for their low 
pricetags 
flight attendants who served howard going one way would do a 
double take when they saw him on a return flight a few moments 
later 
they dont know whether youre a company inspector a spy from 
a competitor or a drug courier howard said

an intentionally flawed space shuttle 
booster rocket was successfully fired today in the last of a series 
of tests for morton thiokols redesigned booster before resumption 
of manned us space flights 
the twominute horizontal test firing the fifth fullscale test 
of the booster sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in 
the air as hundreds of nasa and company observers cheered 
fantastic it looked really good this is it said john 
thirkill vice president of space operations for morton thiokol 
if engineers deemed the test a success after inspecting the 
prone rocket and national aeronautics and space administration 
workers can plug a tiny fuel leak in discovery nasa officials will 
be able to set a firm date in late september or early october for 
the first shuttle launch in 32 months 
kennedy space center workers today planned to clamp a 
4inchlong clamshelllike device over the gas leak and fill it 
under pressure with a sealing compound while discovery remained on 
the launch pad 
to reach the leak workers used a routing tool wednesday to cut 
two holes in the rear wall of discoverys 60footlong cargo bay 
and two more in the adjoining hull of the steering engine 
compartment 
the holes separated by structural supports enable a technician 
to put both hands into the compartment 
the tiny leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas was 12 inches from the 
newly drilled access panels on a fitting in a vent line the leak 
was detected more than a month ago and has been stopped by putting 
pressure on the line however it must be plugged before launch to 
prevent additional leakage 
because discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad the 
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground forcing the 
technicians to work on their hands and knees or on their stomachs 
the repair and subsequent testing are expected to take about a 
week said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
when the leak was discovered last month officials at first 
feared they might have to move discovery to a hangar for repairs 
which could have delayed the launch as much as two months but 
engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the fix on 
the pad 
the repair was delayed until the launch team conducted a 
successful test firing last week of discoverys three main engines 
powered by liquid fuel the leak is in a separate engine system 
used to steer the shuttle in orbit 
scores of improvements have been made to thiokols 126footlong 
booster but the main emphasis has been on reworking the field 
joints that hold together the rockets cylindrical segments 
the challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that 
allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through an oring seal and 
ignite the main liquid fuel tank 
for todays booster test two of the three field joints the 
casetonozzle joint and the ignitertocase joint were riddled 
with 11 intentional flaws to test the joints to their limits as the 
rocket burned 11 million pounds of propellant in 120 seconds the 
unflawed joint was a control 
among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive 
insulation that helps hold the joints together and channels that 
would allow the fiery gas to reach the joints middle oring one 
of three designed to contain heat from the burning fuel 
the joints also are equipped with heaters to keep their 
temperatures at a minimum of 75 degrees freezing air the night 
before the doomed challenger launch were found to have contributed 
to the joints failure 
with the exception of the flaws the rocket is virtually 
identical to a version morton thiokol successfully testfired on 
june 14 and to those now attached to discovery

a retired executive of the pulliam family 
newspaper company said today that he made phone calls to ease the 
way of republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle into the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
senior aides to george bush were continuing to explore the 
controversy even as quayles nomination approached campaign 
spokeswoman alixe glenn said not a single thought is being 
given to dropping quayle from the ticket 
in 1969 quayle was 22 no longer deferred from the draft and 
vulnerable to being conscripted and sent to vietnam national guard 
units were rarely activated for vietnam duty and many men joined 
the guard as a way to avoid the draft and likely vietnam duty 
quayle is a member of the pulliam family which controls a number 
of newspapers including the indianapolis news the question of how 
quayle joined the guard arose as every aspect of quayles life came 
under intense scrutiny on the day he is to be nominated as bushs 
running mate at the republican national convention 
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi who was managing editor 
of the news and worked for quayles grandfather eugene c pulliam 
said he contacted guard acquaintances on behalf of quayle 
phillippi according to the news said he called on his 
multitude of friends within the guard when quayle applied in 
1969 
i was asked about dan quayles abilities and capabilities and 
i recommended him very highly as i did with many other men 
phillippi told the news in a telephone interview from his home in 
brown county ind 
marilyn quayle said her husband wasnt a draft dodger 
quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard 
duty so he could attend law school a bush aide said the matter was 
discussed with quayle during the process that led to his selection 
for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he used influence 
to gain admittance to the guard 
rep bob dornan cochairman of bushs campaign in california 
said it requires a checkerslike speech of contrition and he 
must do it must do it quickly before this gets out of hand 
well after midnight today the bush inner circle met to discuss 
sen quayles performance on the first day of his vice presidential 
candidacy a day dominated by questions about the indianans 
qualifications to be a heartbeat from the presidency and about his 
military record 
quayles press aide jeff nesbit sought this morning to describe 
the sequence of events in 1969 
on the issue of whether telephone calls were made to try and get 
quayle in the guard nesbit said the collective recollection of 
quayle and his father was that phone calls may have been made on 
his behalf he did not elaborate 
nesbit said the reason that quayle stumbled at questions about 
his military record was that his recollection of what happened 
back then is a little fuzzy 
robert teeter who oversaw the vice presidential selection 
process which resulted in quayles selection on tuesday had said 
wednesday that his military service had been raised during the 
interview process 
the question was i believe was there any pull or some 
influence in some way for him to get into the national guard my 
impression is the answer is absolutely not said teeter he at 
some point said i simply applied like anyone else said 
teeter 
if there were calls made on quayles behalf it may not have 
been necessary john owens adjutant general of the indiana 
national guard from january 1969 until august 1972 said the 
indiana had vacancies galore in its guard units during his 
years 
however john s anderson adjutant general immediately before 
owens told the indianapolis news there was a waiting list for 
guard service 
quayle told nbc that in 1969 he had let a number of people 
know i wanted to get into the national guard and added if 
phone calls were made i cant answer i dont know the specifics 
of that 
no one should be ashamed of guard service phillippi said 
and he quayle should not be called a draft dodger because he is 
subject to call at any time of the day or night during his entire 
enlistment 
bushs campaign chairman james baker iii appeared on abctv 
today and said quayle had basically said look i really wanted 
to serve in the guard i was anxious to do that i wanted to go 
to law school i was anxious to do that and if some people helped 
me they helped me 
added baker i think frankly hes talking about help from 
his family which really wasnt particularly unusual given the 
circumstances of the time given the attitude if you will of many 
baby boomers at the time 
baker promised there would be full disclosure of the issue 
we are continuing to explore it with him he said baker led 
the meeting of key bush strategists who critiqued quayles 
wednesday performance and discussed among other things how to 
defuse the national guard controversy 
george w bush bushs eldest son told reporters today that 
the thing thats important is he didnt go to canada 
remember in 1968 canada was an option he didnt go lets keep 
it in generational perspective 
the indiana senator was not a nationally known figure at the 
time bush tapped him 
on wednesday quayle called the questioning of his decision to 
join the guard a cheap shot i have a deep affection for those 
men and women who sacrificed their lives in vietnam more than 
58000 americans were killed in the war 
and he told cnn i was willing and ready to serve my country 
i chose to serve my country in the national guard like millions of 
other people 
former gov edgar whitcomb a republican denied a report that 
he had intervened for quayle 
no i never heard of it he said of quayles interest in 
joining the guard he said quayle who later was a junior aide in 
his office was not known to him at the time he was seeking a 
guard appointment 
i would say for sure no one contacted me about it and i had no 
letter from someone trying to get him into the national guard he 
said 
whitcomb said the guard was certainly no refuge for draft 
dodgers we had units called and they served active duty in 
vietnam quayles was not among them

wednesdays off have been a tradition since baileys country 
store opened for business and later developed a sideline into the 
longestrunning radio talk show in kentucky

except sundays and wednesdays 
i play only one record usually its an oldie something out 
of the 1930s and stuff you wont hear anywhere else said 
bailey who took over the microphone six years ago from his 
brother bart 
bailey broadcasts from one corner of the store at williamsburg 
just a few feet away are racks of clothing including bib overalls 
washboards and tubs nails lanterns and dozens of items that would 
be difficult to find in big city discount houses 
i can look around and see what bargains are available and tell 
people about them we dont sell groceries because wed probably 
eat up the profits said bailey whose show has five sponsors 
while he is on the air bailey may be interrupted by telephone 
calls from listeners with such questions as 
i want to buy a cow you know where ones for sale 
whens the best time to make sauerkraut 
other callers interested in astrology will telephone in 
advance to ask if the signs are right for weaning a baby or 
setting a hen to hatch 
bailey also handles announcements of yard sales and church 
meetings i receive lots of queries about lost dogs in fact i

the government thursday gave 
its strongest hint yet that it soon will free jailed black leader 
nelson mandela reportedly suffering from tuberculosis 
president pw botha praised mandelas cooperative attitude and 
said he hoped the 70yearold leader of the african national 
congress would not have to go back to prison from the hospital 
botha said he expects positive results from his standing 
offer to free mandela if mandela renounces violence 
other officials indicated the government was considering 
mandelas release more seriously than ever before 
the south african press association quoted unidentified 
government sources as saying the release was imminent the sources 
suggested that militant supporters of the guerrilla movement might 
start a campaign aimed at questioning whether mandela in the event 
he renounces violence was able to think for himself 
the congress is the major guerrilla movement fighting for 
blackmajority rule mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is 
serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the 
government surveys indicate he is the most popular leader among 
south africas blacks 
the mandela family had no immediate statement and the congress 
said it would comment after studying the text of bothas speech 
a close associate of the family speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that mandela recently 
reaffirmed his confidence in the congress and gave no indication he 
was prepared to accept a conditional release the source said mrs 
mandela was likely to visit her husband within the next day or two 
to discuss the developments 
wynand malan an antiapartheid member of parliament described 
bothas remarks as disturbing and regrettable and called for 
the presidents ouster malan said botha wants to strip an ill 
and ageing man of his credibility with his own people before he is 
allowed to go free 
information minister stoffel van der merwe also said mandela had 
cooperated since he was transferred aug 12 from cape towns 
pollsmoor prison to nearby tygerberg hospital 
he did not try to use the occasion as a propaganda stunt he 
said he noted that it was not mandela but his lawyer and friends 
who requested outside medical attention and disclosed the nature of 
the illness 
another official speaking on condition of anonymity reported 
progress in recent talks between mandela and senior members of the 
government he declined to elaborate 
botha addressing leaders of his national party in natal 
province said the government in a responsible way will 
consider the matter and if we get the cooperation we have so far 
got from mr mandela i believe we will get positive results 
personally i dont think that at his age and condition it 
would be wise for him to choose to go back to prison and i hope he 
will make it possible for me to act in a humane way so that we can 
have peace in south africa botha said 
botha met before his speech with justice minister kobie coetsee 
who visited mandela at tygerberg on wednesday 
he appears to be comfortable and appears to have taken the 
first steps toward recovery coetsee said of mandela he looks 
as though he is almost his old self and he is already enjoying 
jokes 
doctors said mandela probably will have a complete recovery 
van der merwe said the government was not expecting mandela to 
sign anything or even publicly disavow african national congress 
policy but expected that he would not promote violent activities 
however botha said in his speech i am prepared to release 
mandela if he would say he rejects violence as a means for 
political ends 
tom lodge a university of the witwatersrand academic who is a 
leading expert on the anc said i dont think mandela will 
accept anything other than unconditional release but he added 
if he is ill it is unlikely that he would be involved in 
violence 
van der merwe said last month that mandela had already served 
enough time for punishment of his crime and the only purpose in 
keeping him in prison was national security 
mandela has rejected previous offers of freedom if he renounced 
violence he has said the government must end apartheid legalize 
the african national congress and grant political rights to blacks 
last year the government unconditionally freed govan mbeki 77 
a congress official imprisoned for life at the same time as mandela 
mbeki said he had not renounced violence or the congress after 
a few public appearances the government banned him from addressing 
audiences giving interviews or leaving his hometown

a roy rogers television commercial that school 
cafeteria workers found demeaning for its portrayal of them as drab 
and lazy servers of unappetizing food will be pulled a spokesman 
for the chain said thursday 
i think theyve stooped to a new low by advocating that 
children ought to eat junk food on a daily basis said charles 
hughes president of local 372 of the state county and municipal 
workers aflcio which has more than 8000 school cafeteria 
workers 
hughes called the tv spot despicable and said he hoped 
schoolchildren will not wind up over the years like trigger who 
roy rogers has stuffed trigger was the screen cowboys horse 
the commercial starts with the tune see you in september 
and shows a series of cafeteria workers holding trays of 
unappealing food close to the camera 
the ad very clearly sends a message that one of the things you 
ought to be dreading as labor day approaches is a return to the 
school cafeteria said city councilwoman ruth messinger 
rick sneed public relations director for marriott which owns 
the roy rogers chain said the ad was intended to be a spoof of the 
way cafeterias were years ago 
sneed said the company got calls from food service managers 
complaining that thats not the way cafeteria workers look now 
and its also not the type of food served now macaroni and 
cheese sandwiches and so forth 
sneed said the company does not feel that the commercial is 
demeaning marriott has over 65000 employees that work in 
cafeterias and the last thing were going to do is try and offend 
somebody he said 
the ad began about 10 days ago and was to run until sept 9 but 
sneed said its our intent to pull it as soon as we can it will 
not run its full course

amin gemayels palace in suburban baabda after the session was 
called off they said there were no casualties

spokesmen refused to comment 
interior minister abdulla rassi accused the lebanese forces of 
forcefully preventing 15 members of parliament from attending 
the meeting the military denied that 
the parliament lacked a quorum preventing the election of 
suleiman franjieh a feudal lord opposed by the lebanese forces 
the main christian militia 
only 38 parliament members showed up with 51 required for a 
quorum 
gemayels phalange party and the national liberal party of 
israelileaning dany chamoun which back the lebanese forces 
boycotted the session 
i shall set a date for a new session after speedy and 
extensive consultations with parliamentary blocs house speaker 
hussein husseini told reporters 
the constitution stipulates that a president should be elected 
before sept 23 when gemayels sixyear term expires 
in washington us officials expressed regret at the 
postponement and urged balloting before the constitutional deadline 
we regret that a consensus candidate has not yet been found 
said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
after the session was canceled british ambassador alan ramsey 
told reporters some rethinking should be done in damascus 
he appeared to suggest that syria lebanons main powerbroker 
might reconsider its outright support for franjieh in his bid to 
seek a new term 
franjiehs campaign office said he would not drop out of the 
race 
rassi accused the lebanese forces of forcefully preventing 
more than 15 christian parliament members from reaching the 
session to vote for franjieh 78

deputies were detained rassi said identifying them as michael 
daher and elias hrawi both maronite catholics like franjieh 
daher was later released but i do not have any word about 
hrawis fate yet said rassi who is franjiehs soninlaw 
kazem khalil a shiite moslem deputy who lives in east beirut 
also said he was forbidden at gunpoint from leaving my house to 
go to parliament he said 
the lebanese forces commander samir geagea denied the charge 
saying rassi is merely trying to cover up for his fatherinlaws 
failure to get elected 
franjieh president from 1970 to 1976 alleges geagea led a 1978 
raid on his mansion that killed his eldest son and 30 bodyguards 
the lebanese forces had vowed to block his return to power 
saying he would certainly seek to rekindle the dormant civil war 
the christian milita maintains good relations with israel which 
controls a border enclave in south lebanon 
franjieh syrias closest christian ally in lebanon was the 
leading contender among two dozen aspirants the civil war erupted 
in 1975 while he was in office and he is widely disliked for asking 
syria to use its military to intervene syria has 40000 troops in 
the country

organization commented in an interview with the argus news service 
published thursday in the south african companys newspapers 
swapo has been fighting since 1966 for independence in namibia

ceasefire in namibia starting sept 1 and thereafter would fight 
only in selfdefense

would not delay the peace process by insisting that an independent 
namibia take possession of walvis bay a south african enclave 
which is only major port serving the territory 
nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the african 
national congress the main guerrilla movement fighting for 
blackmajority rule in south africa to maintain bases in namibia 
swapo is widely considered the likely winner of independence 
elections envisioned under the un independence plan 
nujoma interviewed in zambia was quoted as saying a swapo 
government might adopt a oneparty socialist system if there was 
enough public support but he said it would not launch a sweeping 
expropriation of private property

that the united nations prove its impartiality before independence

an occupational therapist was charged 
with assault after doctors secretly videotaped her smothering her 
1yearold son in his hospital bed and then reviving him 
authorities said 
the child had been hospitalized eight times since he was 7 weeks 
old for what authorities had thought were respiratory attacks and 
had suffered numerous similar attacks at home according to a 
police complaint 
jane swanson wilken 36 of south st paul was charged wednesday 
with thirddegree assault she is accused of blocking the breathing 
of her son matthew until he lost consciousness 
the incident was recorded on videotape in the sleeping 
laboratory at childrens hospital in st paul where doctors were 
diagnosing the childs recurring respiratory attacks 
the mother who knows cardiopulmonary resuscitation revived the 
boy on some occasions and paramedics revived him other times the 
complaint said 
hospital officials became suspicious of the mother after the boy 
was brought in for the seventh time on june 2 the complaint said 
doctors initially believed he suffered from a breathing disorder 
but tests proved negative 
video surveillance began on june 9 and was conducted for seven 
days on june 14 around 1030 pm videotape shows mrs wilken 
pressing her sons mouth and nose against her chest while he slept 
the complaint said 
the video shows the boy struggling to escape before he went 
stiff and then limp the complaint said when a respiration monitor 
alarm went off the videotape shows mrs wilken calling for help 
and giving her son mouthtomouth resuscitation 
tests indicate the boy has not suffered brain damage the 
complaint said 
according to police the boy was released from the hospital to 
the care of his father james wilken at the couples home mrs 
wilken was ordered to move in with her mother and father who is a 
physician 
ramsey county attorney tom foley said the case apparently 
involves a psychiatric disorder known as munchausen syndrome by 
proxy 
in this case everybody believes a small child has a serious 
illness and it brings attention to the mother foley said she 
acts like a model mother being able to take care of this sick 
child 
the disorder is derived from baron von munchausen an 
18thcentury german who became well known for elaborate lies 
john wodele executive assistant to foley said thursday that 
mrs wilken has cooperated with the investigation and is expected 
to surrender to authorities by early next week 
mrs wilkens lawyer linda gallant declined to comment beyond 
saying that her client is cooperating 
wodele said charges were not filed immediately because child 
protection measures were in place were also dealing in an area 
thats new to us he said

a ballot issue crucial to anchorages 
bid for the 1994 winter olympics will be decided in tuesdays 
election along with lopsided primary races in both parties for the 
states lone congressional seat 
anchorage is one of four cities in the running for the 1994 
winter games with the winner to be decided by the international 
olympic committee next month the other finalists are in norway 
bulgaria and sweden 
in 1985 anchorage voters endorsed the olympics bid by a 2to1 
margin but they were not told at the time that the city would have 
to sign a financial agreement tuesdays vote will determine 
whether they would back financial guarantees 
in july a poll sanctioned by the anchorage organizing 
committee the group trying to bring the olympics here showed 
voters evenly divided on the question 
if the referendum proposal passes the anchorage municipal 
government would agree to become jointly liable for the aocs 
costs should their efforts at private fundraising fall short but 
at the same time the proposal specifies that the committee is 
expected to raise the needed funds itself 
any bond issue to build stadiums or other olympics facilities 
would have to be approved by another referendum the proposal 
states 
earlier this year ioc president juan samaranch said that for 
anchorage to stay in the running there would have to be a 
significant margin of victory in the election to reassure the ioc 
that the city is committed to staging the games 
the aoc has said private money mostly from television 
contracts will cover the cost of holding the games 
supporters say the games would boost anchorages image but 
opponents say they doubt the games can pay for themselves and 
dismiss the image argument 
in the twin congressional primaries rep don young an 
eightterm republican and democrat peter gruenstein a former 
state prosecutor making his first try for statewide office both 
face only minor opposition 
gruenstein has been ignoring his primary competition to aim 
verbal jabs at young who admitted in a fundraising appeal june 30 
that this fall he will be embroiled in a tough reelection 
battle 
young for the third time is being challenged for the republican 
nomination by george johnston an arco alaska employee from 
anchorage whom young defeated by a 50to1 margin in the 1986 
primary 
gruenstein is opposed for the democratic nomination by eugene

jordan no longer views confederation with 
an eventual palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip as 
automatic a palace official said thursday 
the development makes us proposals for middle east peace more 
unlikely than ever before 
the palace official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
jordan no longer wants to be a screen separating the united 
states and israel from negotiating directly with the palestine 
liberation organization 
once the palestinian state is there we jordanians are going 
to look at the relationship and decide if we are going to accept a 
confederation the official said its a choice 
ever since the united states arranged the camp david accords 
between egypt and israel in 1979 us officials have said their 
middle east peace plans depend on jordan overseeing a palestinian 
entity on the territories israel captured in the 1967 middle east 
war 
until the war jordan considered the west bank part of its own 
territory and egypt held a mandate over the gaza strip 
only five months ago us secretary of state george p shultz 
told reporters in amman that he envisioned a palestinian ministate 
tied to jordan much as california and texas are tied to the united 
states 
but on july 31 king hussein renounced sovereignty over the west 
bank to honor arab summit declarations making the plo the sole 
and legitimate representative of the palestinian people 
after husseins announcement state department officials in 
washington insisted their peace plans were still alive 
the palace official said jordan was still involved in any 
arabisraeli peace efforts and noted that jordan shares israels 
longest border but he stressed that the plo was in charge of 
dealing with the palestinian issue 
the concept of a confederation between jordan and a palestinian 
state was enshrined in a february 1985 agreement between hussein 
and plo chairman yasser arafat 
most plo officials however insisted that an independent state 
should precede a confederation jordan argued for recovery of the 
occupied lands before settling their status 
jordan hoped a confederation would ease fears of an independent 
palestinian state on israels border and coax the united states and 
israel into an international peace conference to settle the long 
conflict 
it was an instrument to make the international conference 
work the palace official said 
most officials still regard some form of confederation as 
inevitable because jordan and the west bank have strong family and 
economic links and a separate west bank may not be economically 
viable 
while jordan has cooled on the confederation plan plo officials 
who conferred with leaders in amman this week reiterated their 
support for such a plan 
they told reporters privately however that they received no 
response from the jordanians 
ironically jordans decision to step aside in favor of the plo 
appears to have prompted plo leaders to consider the explicit 
recognition of israel 
us officials cite the plos formal refusal to accept israel as 
a key reason for refusing to deal with the organization 
plo officials say an upcoming meeting of the policymaking 
palestine national council probably will establish a provisional 
government and approve a declaration of independence for the 
west bank and gaza strip 
discussions on the form of a government are still under way 
within the plo but officials said it almost surely will be based 
on acceptance of un security council resolution 181 the measure 
that created israel and called for a palestinian state 
it would also sidestep clauses in the plo charter that demand 
israels eventual replacement with a democratic secular state 
plo officials hope such a plan will win western support and 
create a potential bargaining partner for israel and the united 
states in peace talks

the manchurian candidate was doing well in some areas but 
political movies such as all the presidents men the 
candidate with robert redford and advise and consent gathered 
dust on the shelves 
nor was there much demand for ronald reagans bedtime for 
bonzo or knute rockne allamerican the movie where he 
first asked his mentor to win one for the gipper 
people are pretty bored with the convention said sue 
granat salesperson at new york citys videoroom where rentals are 
up 25 percent 
there hasnt been a good convention since the democrats in 
1968 that had drama and violence she said

atlanta but the earlier convention at least had some electricity 
between jesse jackson and miachel dukakis store officials said 
at the video circus rentals were up 33 percent for the week 
everyone is complaining coming in here and saying they dont 
want to be bored said store owner frank lopez i guess its

izvestia which published a letter saying works of 
some former soviet leaders now in disfavor were being purged from 
libraries said thursday they were only being moved and would be 
readily available 
the government newspaper was seeking to quiet a storm that arose 
after the letter appeared tuesday saying librarians were ordered to 
take the works off their shelves 
the letter signed by i zavgorognyaya said the soviet union 
was creating new blank spots in its history by removing 
information that should be in libraries regardless of the authors 
current political status 
among those mentioned were leonid i brezhnev whose tenure in 
19641982 is being criticized by mikhail s gorbachevs kremlin as 
a period of stagnation and corruption 
izvestia quoted the ministry of culture on thursday as saying 
few people were interested in reading the works of brezhnev or 
konstantin u chernenko who led the soviet union for a year and 
was gorbachevs immediate predecessor 
according to izvestia the ministry said it could not use 40 
percent of its library fund because there is no space for new books 
any books removed from the shelves will be provided to readers 
at their first demand the newspaper said 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a regular 
news briefing thursday some libraries have dozens of copies of some 
books such as collected works of previous soviet leaders 
he said the libraries had been given permission to remove some 
copies in order to make space for new books

a chief deputy constable who banned officers in 
his precinct from working offduty security jobs at a theater 
showing the last temptation of christ said he did so because he 
believes the movie is sacrilegious 
chief deputy constable glen cheek of precinct 5 imposed the ban 
for deputy constables earlier this week the movie which has 
angered conservative christian groups and caused protests in other 
cities opens friday in houston at one theater 
i feel the film is simply in bad taste and sacrilegious and i 
just didnt want them working there cheek said 
cheek imposed the ban without consulting constable steve radack 
who was in new orleans for the republican national convention but 
radack said wednesday he supports the decision 
it is my personal opinion that the movie is sacrilegious 
radack said 
constables are officers of the court who serve warrants and 
other legal papers and also have powers of arrest 
the film by director martin scorsese which has drawn good 
crowds despite vehement protests was scheduled to open in eight 
more theaters across the country this weekend after opening in nine 
last weekend 
because of the protests officials of cineplex odeons spectrum 
theater in west houston sought extra security when cheek rejected 
the request the theater sought to hire harris county deputies 
however harris county sheriffs chief deputy tommy thomas said 
the theater was within houston city limits and therefore not within 
the jurisdiction of county authorities 
radack said he understood that one deputy from precinct 5 
normally works at the theater weekdays and two on weekends but 
that six had been requested for the opening of the last 
temptation of christ 
houston police deputy chief bill gaines said he was unsure 
whether officers would be allowed to work at the theater 
normally we would not let offduty people work where there is 
likely to be a confrontation or unruly crowds gaines said

two people died of injuries suffered when a 
passenger train speeding from leningrad to moscow derailed and 
caught fire raising the death toll to 24 a local official 
reported on thursday 
soviet media differed on the probable cause of the incident 
tuesday evening near bologoye about 180 miles northwest of moscow 
tass news agency said a preliminary investigation indicated 
bologoye stationmaster v khrustalev prematurely raised a speed 
limit imposed when inspectors discovered a deviation in the track 
the government newspaper izvestia said repairs had been 
completed on the section of track but were poorly done 
izvestia said 83 people remained hospitalized thursday 
boris a petrov deputy communist party head of the kalinin 
region where the accident occurred said in a telephone interview 
that two of the 107 people initially hospitalized after the crash 
had died 
petrov said the only foreigners among the 760 passengers aboard 
the aurora were a group of 32 brazilian tourists and that none of 
them was hurt 
an official of the brazilian embassy in moscow however 
speaking on condition of anonymity said 34 brazilians were aboard 
and some suffered minor cuts from broken window glass 
the route between moscow and leningrad the soviet unions two 
largest cities is one of the busiest in the country and trains 
typically operate at capacity 
media reports said it is the only highspeed route in the soviet 
union normally posted for speeds of up to 120 mph 
tass said in a russianlanguage report that three hours before 
the accident khrustalev had removed a 60 kilometerperhour just 
over 37 mph speed limit imposed a day earlier by an inspection 
crew that had noticed a deviation of about one inch in the track 
the motive for his decision still has to be clarified whether 
he received inaccurate information or he himself thought that 
there no longer was any danger in either case the repair work 
carried out by senior engineer n gavrilov was not completed 
tass said 
it said the locomotive engineer spotted the variation in the 
track and tried to brake but too late the locomotive passed over 
the spot but the passenger cars tore away and derailed 
fire broke out immediately and engulfed the train investigators 
believe it was caused by leaking fuel from the restaurant car 
medical specialists from moscow leningrad and other major 
soviet cities were flown into bologoye to help the reports said 
about 15 trains were delayed in moscow stranding hundreds of 
people but in leningrad buses took tourist groups to the airport 
for a special flight to moscow

citing the states interest in promoting 
marriage the california supreme court refused thursday to allow a 
man who saw his lover killed in a car crash sue for emotional 
distress and loss of her companionship 
although a lovers emotional injuries may be as real and 
foreseeable as those suffered by a spouse or a parent who have the 
right to sue society would suffer an intolerable burden if 
suits were not limited to relationships recognized by law the 
court ruled 
the 61 ruling did not repeal the courts landmark 1976 decision 
allowing one member of an unmarried couple to bind the other to an 
implied promise of financial support 
the state has a strong interest in the marriage 
relationship wrote justice stanley mosk for the majority to 
the extent unmarried cohabitants are granted the same rights as 
married persons the states interest in promoting marriage is 
inhibited 
he also said allowing a suit by a lover would impose a 
difficult burden on the courts which would have to decide 
whether the relationship was stable and significant and 
contained the emotional attachments of the family relationship 
such an inquiry would also threaten a massive intrusion into the 
private life of the partners mosk said 
in dissent justice allen broussard said there was no legal or 
social reason to prevent one member of a couple living together to 
sue for emotional damage caused by seeing the other partner injured 
such emotional injuries are to be expected given the 
widespread reality and acceptance of unmarried cohabitation 
broussard said 
he also noted that the ruling effectively forbids such lawsuits 
by members of homosexual couples who cannot legally marry 
the suit was filed by richard elden who was injured in a 
december 1982 crash in pasadena that killed linda ebeling with 
whom he shared a home 
elden sued robert sheldon the driver of the other car accusing 
him of running a red light he sought damages not only for his 
physical injuries but for his emotional trauma caused by seeing 
ms ebeling killed and for loss of love companionship emotional 
support and sexual relations 
his lawsuit for physical injuries was later settled but the 
second claim was dismissed by los angeles superior court judge 
george xanthos whose ruling was upheld by a state appeals court 
those rulings and thursdays supreme court decision rejected 
rulings by a few appellate courts allowing suits by one member of a 
couple who claimed a stable significant relationship 
equivalent to marriage 
mosk said the number of unmarried couples living together had 
increased dramatically and that there was no doubt some of these 
couples are bound by emotional ties as strong as those that bind 
formally married partners 
however he said a ban on lawsuits by unmarrieds was justified 
by public policy and by the need to limit the range of lawsuits 
that can be filed for an act of negligence 
married couples are granted significant rights and bear 
important responsibilities toward one another which are not shared 
by those who cohabit without marriage including duties of 
financial support mosk said

the leader of the guerrilla 
movement seeking independence for namibia says he believes south 
africa is sincerely committed to ending its rule over the territory 
sam nujoma president of the southwest african peoples 
organization commented in an interview with the argus news service 
published thursday in the south african companys newspapers 
swapo has been fighting since 1966 for independence in namibia 
also known as southwest africa south africa said this month it 
would begin implementing a un independence plan for namibia if 
agreement was reached on withdrawal of cuban troops from 
neighboring angola 
nujoma was quoted as saying his guerrillas would observe a 
ceasefire in namibia starting sept 1 and thereafter would fight 
only in selfdefense 
let us believe that this time the south african government is 
serious he was quoted as saying 
the report said nujoma made a major concession by saying swapo 
would not delay the peace process by insisting that an independent 
namibia take possession of walvis bay a south african enclave 
which is only major port serving the territory 
nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the african 
national congress the main guerrilla movement fighting for 
blackmajority rule in south africa to maintain bases in namibia 
swapo is widely considered the likely winner of independence 
elections envisioned under the un independence plan 
nujoma interviewed in zambia was quoted as saying a swapo 
government might adopt a oneparty socialist system if there was 
enough public support but he said it would not launch a sweeping 
expropriation of private property 
south african president pw botha in a policy speech today 
endorsed the peace initiative but said his government would insist 
that the united nations prove its impartiality before independence 
elections in namibia 
in namibias capital windhoek police on thursday blocked all 
entrances to the highrise building that houses the university of 
namibia arrested two students and said they wouldnt leave until 
leaders of a class boycott were handed over 
police arrested 37 students from the campus after peaceful 
demonstrations on wednesday some of the 2000 students have been 
participating in a fourweek boycott in sympathy with pupils in 
northern namibia 
the students in northern ovamboland have been demanding that 
south african troops move their bases away from schools which may 
be caught in crossfire between the soldiers and swapo guerrillas 
in washington the state department said that the government of 
congo will host the next round of fournation talks on the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola and independence for namibia 
the talks will be held in brazzaville starting aug 24 and the 
us team will be headed by assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs chester crocker said spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
representatives of angola south africa cuba and the united 
states will seek to consolidate the gains they made in their fifth 
round of talks in geneva earlier this month and will work on 
timetables for the cuban withdrawal she said

million thursday at an elaborately staged fundraiser loaded with 
lawmakers corporate chiefs all manner of celebrities and leo 
nadeau 
youre wondering who the hell is leo nadeau the 
silverhaired man on the stage at the new orleans convention center 
told approximately 4500 mystified guests most of whom paid 1000 
apiece for their seats 
the answer he was george bushs tailgunner 45 years ago when 
bush served as a navy pilot in the pacific theater during world war 
ii we were just a couple of kids nadeau said but we became 
men overnight

bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana at the 
fundraising luncheon which the republican national committee 
called one of its most successful ever 
a final tally was not in but spokeswoman katherine murray said 
the event raised 42 million to 44 million for the committees 
operating budget double what the rnc raised at its gala at the 
1984 convention in dallas 
while it was the committees bestever showing for a 
1000perplate event it was not an overall fundraising record 
the rnc pulled in 58 million at a higherpriced dinnerdance in 
1984 murray said 
the luncheon was staged on a road to victory theme with a 
strip of black carpet leading from a huge mockup of a riverboat to 
a mockup of the white house bush quayle and their wives arrived 
in a antique fire engine led by a marching band celebrities in the 
audience ranged from muhammad ali to sen strom thurmond of south 
carolina

seat nine corporations underwrote the luncheon with 100000 
donations 
quayle in his remarks called the republican party the party 
of the great middle class and bush rewarded the crowd with a 
preview of his acceptance speech saying he would seek to 
illustrate the record of his opponent gov michael dukakis and to 
lay out his own plans to take over from president reagan 
tonight we shift gears tonight i will be the nominee the 
standard bearer of this great party he said and i will spell 
out with clarity where i want to lead the united states 
bush also stressed his fidelity to quayle who was embroiled in 
a controversy over whether he used family connections to join the 
national guard in 1969 at a time when he was eligible for the 
vietnam draft 
for his part nadeau spoke of his and bushs wartime experience 
as he introduced the vice president 
there are millions of americans like me men and women whove 
seen the face of war he said when we elect our next commander 
in chief we will have made sure he is someone who has the courage 
and experience we can depend on for our lives and our livelihoods 
bush rose and hugged his old war buddy

nearly 400 american and chinese psychiatrists are 
in beijing to trade ideas on mental health a discipline once 
regarded as irrelevant in the socialist wonderland of marx and mao 
this is very important to the development of chinese 
psychiatry said yang deson vice president of hunan medical 
university of the fourday conference this week on advances in 
psychiatry 
ninety percent of chinas top psychiatrists are here he 
said 
about 170 american psychiatrists from the american psychiatric 
association and more than 200 chinese are attending the seminar 
which takes up such topics as schizophrenia depression child and 
geriatric psychiatry and counselling patients with aids 
the chinese psychiatrists are presenting papers on such topics 
as drug abuse in beijing child mental health in conjunction with 
chinas onechild population policy and the use of traditional 
herbal medicine in treating chronic mental illness 
dr melvin sabshin medical director of the washingtonbased 
association said he was impressed with the quality of chinas 
epidemiological studies and the emergence of younger 
bettertrained psychiatrists 
sabshin who is making his sixth visit to china since 1978 said 
it was his impression that since the cultural revolution there 
has been more of an acceptance of psychiatry 
marxist ideologues have long regarded mental illness as an 
outgrowth of class oppression and dismissed psychoanalysis and 
counselling as bourgeois indulgence 
during the rabidly leftist 196676 cultural revolution the 
study of psychiatry was suspended and many psychiatrists were 
persecuted china now acknowledges that mental illness cant be 
treated with political dogma and has encouraged the study of 
mental health 
but according to yang china today has only 7000 
psychiatrists less than half of whom have graduated from 
fullcourse medical universities by comparison the united states 
with onefourth chinas 1 billion people has 35000 psychiatrists 
yang said older practitioners like himself who went to school 
before the cultural revolution were trained in soviet methodology 
although chinese now recognize the united states as leader in the 
field pavlovian theories of stimulus and response are still 
carefully studied 
very few chinese are trained in freudian psychoanalysis partly 
because of past political condemnation of freuds ideas on sex 
yang said 
chinese psychiatrists are also hampered by social attitudes 
toward the mentally disturbed yang said counselling is still 
regarded as shameful a stigma and most of his patients suffer 
from major psychoses that neighborhood committees the powerful 
community overseers responsible for settling social discord are 
unable to handle 
sabshin noted that this narrow definition of the psychiatrists 
role is prevalent throughout the third world he said he had often 
seen barefoot doctors dispersing medicine to people with 
anxiety depression or sexual problems while only those with 
permanently severe psychosis are sent to mental health 
specialists 
china has about 350 mental hospitals but only 100000 beds for 
an estimated 10 million people suffering from mental illness while 
there is no record as in the soviet union of confining political 
dissidents to mental hospitals chinas public security bureau has 
warned that the mentally ill are a growing source of crime and has 
set up 16 of its own asylums 
yang said mental problems in china such as emotional and 
personal conflicts family disharmony and sexual problems are 
similar to those in the united states one new element in china is 
mental illness related to business pressures and failures as china 
abandons socialist egalitarianism for marketoriented reforms yang 
said 
with young medical students still reluctant to pioneer work in 
chinese psychiatry its going to be very hard to meet the nations 
rising mental health needs he said china yang said needs 10 
times as many psychiatrists

strikes spreading through poland 
crippled production at five vital silesian coal mines thursday and 
paralyzed szczecins port and public transport opposition leaders 
said 
workers demand higher wages better working conditions and that 
the outlawed solidarity trade union federation be made legal again 
strikes that began tuesday when employees occupied the july 
manifesto mine near jastrzebie in southwestern poland spread to a 
fifth mine thursday 
transportation workers in szczecin also walked out joining a 
shutdown by dock workers in the nations secondlargest port the 
largest is gdansk home of solidarity leader lech walesa who 
expressed support thursday for the just struggle 
polands communist government which crushed and outlawed 
solidarity after imposing martial law in december 1981 declared 
the strikes illegal 
the law clearly states that a strike only can be proclaimed to 
defend economic and social interests of a given working group but 
it deems political strikes impermissible said the official news 
agency pap 
the latest labor unrest follows the pattern of five major 
strikes and 25 threats or brief work stoppages between april 25 and 
may 10 that constituted the worst labor unrest since martial law 
participants in those strikes also demanded legal status for 
solidarity 
workers at the jastrzebie mine at jastrzebie began a strike 
thursday according to mine director jerzy swiderski he said he 
did not know how many of the 8400 employees were involved but 
solidarity activists put the number at 1500 
about 600 bus drivers and other employees of szczecins 
municipal transport system stopped work thursday morning snarling 
public transportation 
witnesses said general cargo operations were said at a 
standstill on szczecins docks where solidarity spokesman wojciech 
maziarski said 2000 workers remained on strike 
in his first statement on the latest labor unrest walesa said 
i support the just struggle of the miners port workers and 
other strikers this is the only way to lead poland on the road to 
reforms the workers are defending solidarity because it is for 
them the key condition of preparing winning and carrying out 
economic and political reforms 
more than 2000 workers occupied the andaluzja coal mine in 
piekary slaskie on wednesday night mine officials and solidarity 
activists reported the andaluzja mine is 42 miles northeast of the 
four others now closed in silesia polands most industrialized 
region 
about 1000 workers at the moszczenica mine near jastrzebie also 
refused to pick up their tools wednesday night said adam 
kowalczyk a local solidarity leader the mine is one of polands 
largest employing about 11000 people 
police moved in thursday and sealed off the area witnesses said 
more than 400 miners remained on strike at the morcinek coal 
mine near the czech border they declared a sympathy strike 
wednesday with an estimated 5000 workers who have been holed up in 
the july manifesto mining complex near jastrzebie for three days 
strike leaders and management at july manifesto discussed 
creating an independent union that would not be called solidarity 
but no agreement was reached solidarity officials said 
no talks were held thursday according to mine officials and 
solidarity activists 
management and strikers said negotiations were at an impasse 
strikers want solidarity advisers allowed in the mine a demand 
management has refused 
czeslaw czerwiec a spokesman for the manifesto mine strikers 
said security forces hampered efforts by supporters and relatives 
to bring food to the mine 
were not getting enough to eat czerwiec said theyre 
making it tough for us 
he said miners would strike until their demands were met 
were fighting for everyone he said 
police on tuesday surrounded the july manifesto mine about 280 
miles southwest of warsaw after workers refused to pick up their 
tools about 9000 workers are employed at the mine which is key 
producer of highgrade export coal 
miners say wage demands were based on hardships caused by 
polands worsening economy which is strapped by a 60 percent 
inflation rate 
polands miners are paid nearly twice the national average of 
100 a month and receive extra benefits because of their role in 
the nations economy 
poland is the worlds fourthlargest exporter of coal and its 
mining operations are essential to the nations steel power and 
shipbuilding industries coal exports are also crucial because 
poland relies heavily on the sales to obtain hard currency to 
service its 39 billion foreign debt 
while workers continue to support the july manifesto strike 
there is no sign of widespread unrest of the kind that spawned the 
union eight years ago 
workers at the lenin shipyard in may declared a sympathy strike 
in support of steel workers in nowa huta who had shut down 
production there 
the solidarity commission in the lenin shipyard in gdansk has 
issued a call for workers to participate in a rally friday in 
support of the strikers

davy crockett is more than the king 
of the wild frontier to his descendants who are meeting at a 
state park that bears his name 
david was quite a man in his time said joy bland of paris 
tenn a greatgreatgreatgreatgranddaughter of the tennessee 
pioneer we think he made quite a contribution to our state in 
many ways 
more than 100 people who have traced their roots to crockett 
began gathering at david crockett state park near here thursday 
the reunion coincides with david crockett days an annual festival 
we want to keep the knowledge of him alive ms bland said 
i learn something different every reunion 
to be a full member of the fouryearold descendants of david 
crockett organization people must trace their lineage to one of 
crocketts six children two stepchildren or two wives those who 
are simply interested in crockett can join as associate members 
the man who historians say called himself david not davy 
crockett was born in northeast tennessee on aug 17 1786 he 
represented the region as a state lawmaker and then was a 
congressman in 182731 and 183335 he died in texas defending the 
alamo in 1836 
ms bland said crocketts record of public service often becomes 
lost in the folklore surrounding him but the frontiersman is 
partly to blame 
he liked to hunt and he liked to talk about it ms bland 
said he only shot big bears 
walt disney studios recently announced plans for a new 
television series about crockett in the 50s the orignal disney 
series starring fess parker had every kid in america wanting to 
dress in coonskin 
i really hope they will try to teach the public something 
about the man that he was said ms bland if children have 
heroes today it ought to be someone like him

the largest house on long island 
has been sold for 22 million or a bargain 170000 for each of 
its 130 rooms a newspaper reported thursday 
developer gary melius sold the otto kahn mansion two weeks ago 
to an unidentified japanese businessman according to newsday 
melius confirmed the sale but told newsday he had signed a 
nondisclosure clause the newspaper said it learned the selling 
price from a source close to the deal 
melius who bought the house in 1984 for 15 million and spent 
millions more restoring it said he was selling it at the request 
of his wife dropping plans to turn it into condos a tennis club 
or health spa 
it was too much money and too much time he said it was 
consuming us 
the mansion built on 443 acres overlooking cold spring harbor 
was dubbed oheka by its first owner otto herman kahn it was 
second largest house in the nation at the time of construction 
the home was sold in 1938 to the new york city sanitation 
department as a weekend retreat for employees it was a government 
training center during world war ii and later was a private 
military academy 
melius original asking price was 52 million with complete 
renovations he estimated that there was still 8 million to 15 
million worth of restoration work still to be done

an intentionally flawed space shuttle 
booster rocket performed successfully thursday in the last 
testfiring required before the resumption of manned us space 
flights officials said 
were ready to go launch alan mcdonald morton thiokol vice 
president for engineering said on examining the booster after the 
122second horizontal test 
the 20 million firing was a redundancy verification test to 
make sure the boosters new joints do what theyre supposed to 
contain superheated gases during launch the failure of the seals 
on one joint led to the explosion of shuttle challenger and the 
death of its sevenperson crew in 1986 
engineers deemed the test a success after preliminary inspection 
of the prone rocket if that evaluation holds and national 
aeronautics and space administration workers are able to plug a 
tiny fuel leak in the shuttle discovery the space agency will be 
able to set a firm date in late september or early october for the 
first shuttle launch in 32 months 
the fifth fullscale test of morton thiokols redesigned booster 
sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in the air as some 
300 nasa and company observers cheered 
fantastic it looked really good this is it said john 
thirkill vice president of space operations for morton thiokol 
we have had no indication of any anomaly said royce 
mitchell solid rocket motor project manager at the marshall space 
center in huntsville ala it looks like just an absolutely great 
test from top to bottom the end of september is still within 
our sights 
morton thiokol and nasa engineers planned to begin tearing down 
the motor monday and expected final test results within two weeks 
said company spokesman rocky raab 
mcdonald said preliminary indications were that every safety 
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no 
immediate evidence of problems in any of the four flawed joints he 
said he believed the joints were the safest parts of the shuttle 
launch vehicle 
the hardware and the data will tell us this booster is ready 
to fly mitchell said 
with the 470 million redesign and motor testing morton thiokol 
has run five or six times the number of tests that were done prior 
to the first shuttle launch and in half the time he said 
david ewing the companys deputy director of program 
management called the redesign result very very robust weve 
put on the belt and suspenders and weve even added garters 
the test firing at morton thiokols test bay 25 miles west of 
here capped the companys 2year effort to revamp the rocket 
blamed for the january 1986 explosion that destroyed challenger 
killed its sevenmember crew and grounded the nations space 
program 
scores of improvements have been made to the 126footlong 
booster most related to reworking the field joints which hold 
together the rockets cylindrical segments 
the challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that 
allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through an oring seal and 
ignite the main liquid fuel tank 
for thursdays booster test two of the three field joints the 
casetonozzle joint and the ignitertocase joint were riddled 
with 14 flaws intended to test them to their limits as the rocket 
burned 11 million pounds of propellant the third joint was left 
unflawed as a comparison 
were demonstrating that the motor is so faulttolerant that 
even with flaws that deliberately circumvent all the safety factors 
that weve built in its still a safe motor raab said 
among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive 
insulation that helps hold the joints together and channels cut 
with an exacto razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach 
the joints middle oring one of three designed to contain heat 
from the burning fuel 
the joints were equipped with heaters that maintain their 
temperatures at a minimum 75 degrees fahrenheit freezing 
temperatures the night before the doomed challenger launch were 
found to have contributed to the joints failure 
with the exception of the flaws the rocket is virtually 
identical to a productionquality version morton thiokol testfired 
june 14 and to the pair now attached to discovery 
the june 14 test said raab was an unequivocal success as 
were the three that preceded it in the past year thursdays test 
had been scheduled last month but was delayed when a worker 
overpressurized a joint causing slight damage that since has been 
repaired

on thursday said controversy swirling around republican vice 
presidential pick dan quayles military service is 
reprehensible 
i think weve got to give him a break robertson said he 
served six years in a branch of service and it was honorable 
service 
robertsons comments came as he toured state delegations from 
iowa and minnesota and was questioned by reporters about the 
quayle controversy 
quayle is being dogged by reports that influential family 
members interceded on his behalf to obtain a slot in the national 
guard in 1969 during an era when the guard was frequently used as 
a method of avoiding the draft and service in vietnam 
robertson is no stranger to controversy over military service 
california rep paul mccloskey who served with robertson during 
the korean war alleged that robertsons father a us senator 
used his influence to keep robertson from being posted in a combat 
zone 
the national guard is not something to be ashamed of 
robertson said thursday i think the national guard is honorable 
i think the army reserve is honorable

sewage networks have burst and contaminated 
water in khartoum the capital of sudan and up to a million people 
are threatened with deadly disease in the aftermath of devastating 
floods a cairo daily said friday 
government authorities and international relief agencies in 
sudan were reported to have stepped up efforts thursday to fight 
more than 5000 cases of disease caught by drinking unclean water 
the egyptian staterun newspaper alahram quoting unspecified 
sources said in its early friday edition that one person had died 
of cholera in omdurman across the nile river from khartoum 
egyptian television said in a thursday evening newscast that the 
sudanese red crescent reported 5211 people as suffering from 
severe diarrhea 70 percent of them young children 
the television said sudanese health authorites and international 
agencies identified the cases as typhoid malaria and cholera and 
increased their efforts to treat them 
the red crescent is the equivalent in moslem countries to the 
red cross 
dr nicholas ward a world health organization adviser 
predicted earlier that 400000 people most of them under five 
years of age would develop diarrhea and gastrointestinal 
diseases and 4000 of them probably would die 
left untreated as many as 40000 people could perish ward 
predicted 
ward a diarrheal diseases and immunization specialist went to 
sudan from his base in north yemen to help coordinate the 
governments response to the crisis resulting from the floods 
he said the government recruited 300 doctors and medical 
students for about 120 emergency clinics and increased staff at 127 
existing health units 
the price of water soared to 10 times its previous level since 
the floods those unable to pay have had to drink from huge 
brackish pools left behind by the rainstorms and contaminated by 
human waste from broken sewer pipes and swamped pit latrines 
torrential rains aug 45 left more than 15 people homeless in 
khartoum alone 70 people died 213 were injured and nearly 115000 
houses were destroyed another 21 people perished in accidents 
caused by the floods bringing the known death toll to 91 
international relief poured in from the united states europe 
and arab countries but osman omar sudans minister of public 
works was quoted by egypts staterun middle east news agency 
quoted as saying thursday that the amounts flown in met only 5 
percent of needs 
distribution of relief supplies handled by the government has 
been slow many affected areas in central eastern and northern 
sudan were isolated 
officials previously denied accusations that the government was 
witholding relief from some of those affected and compared the aid 
to a drop in the ocean 
omar stressed that any foreign relief would continue to be 
chaneled through the government the government is capable of 
bearing its responsibilities without any outside advice or 
intervention mena quoted him as saying 
besides flood relief scenes egyptian tv also showed swarms of 
locusts covering the sky in western sudan a potential threat to 
any remaining crops if the locusts flew on to central sudan

the united states syphilis rate last year was as 
bad as any since 1950 prompting federal health officials to call 
thursday for more emphasis on interviewing patients with venereal 
diseases and warning their sex partners 
final statistics for 1987 show 35241 cases of syphilis reported 
in the united states 146 per 100000 people equaling the 1982 
rate as the highest since 1950s rate of 167 the national centers 
for disease control reported 
reported us cases of syphilis have risen 30 percent in two 
years from 27143 or 115 per 100000 in 1985 the cdc said the 
number of cases in 1986 was not included in the report but was 
estimated at 28500 
the increase was greatest for blacks and hispanics 
groups for which incidence rates were already high the 
atlantabased agency said in its weekly report 
between 1986 and 1987 among americans 1564 the syphilis rate 
for black males rose 36 percent from 106 per 100000 people to 
145 the rate for black females shot up 43 percent from 56 per 
100000 to 79 
the rate for hispanic males rose 7 percent from 66 to 71 cases 
per 100000 while the rate for hispanic women rose 24 percent 
from 18 to 22 
in contrast the rate for white males dropped from 64 to 57 
cases per 100000 apparently due to a drop in syphilis among 
homosexual men and the rate for white females rose but still at 
small levels from 22 to 26 the cdc said 
previously reported drops in the sexually transmitted disease 
rates among homosexual men indicate changes in sexual behavior 
due to the spread of aids the cdc said 
the increases in incidence of syphilis suggest that 
efforts to achieve similar behavioral changes in minority 
populations have not been successful the agency said 
homosexual men have taken safe sex messages seriously 
said dr joel greenspan a cdc specialist in sexually transmitted 
diseases they have changed their behavior minority people and 
particularly heterosexuals have not gotten that message 
the increase in syphilis appears to be concentrated in a few 
urban areas 57 percent of all us cases last year were reported 
in florida california and new york 
in its report the cdc suggested several steps to curb the 
increase in syphilis including a move to reemphasize the 
traditional methods of syphilis control interviews and sex 
partner notification 
the agency also suggested screening for sexually transmitted 
diseases in highrisk populations assuring better access to 
medical care with speedy service and evening hours and further 
surveillance efforts to monitor the problem

george bush formally launched his quest for 
the white house thursday night depicting himself as the underdog 
in the race against michael dukakis and pledging to run hard to 
fight hard to stand on the issues 
and i mean to win he told the republican national 
convention 
bush crafted his primetime acceptance speech as his high 
command sought to quell a controversy over running mate dan 
quayles vietnamera stint in the national guard im proud to 
have dan quayle at my side said bush 
the script for the conventions final session called for 
quayles nomination followed by the 41yearold senators 
acceptance speech followed by bushs turn at the superdome podium 
followed by one more spectacular blizzard of balloons 
he began his prepared speech with a selfdeprecating promise 
saying ill try to keep my charisma in check and the son of a 
wealthy and influential connecticut family fashioned himself an 
everyman talking of his days living in a little shotgun house 
in texas where he lived the dream high school football on 
friday night little league neighborhood barbeque 
i am a quiet man he said he said he wouldnt attack 
dukakis by name but that didnt stop him from going after his 
rival 
my opponent wont rule out raising taxes but i will 
bush said in a speech that assailed dukakis policies without 
mentioning the democratic nominee by name 
congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no and 
theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and all i can 
say to them is no new taxes period 
bushs wife barbara preceded her husband to the convention 
podium continuing a bush emphasis on family to match dukakis in 
atlanta last month she praised her partner of 43 years as a man 
who is as strong and caring and decent as america herself 
vice presidential aides passed the word that there would be no 
news conference about quayle and questions over whether strings 
were pulled two decades ago to ease his way into the indiana 
national guard and avoid almost certain service in vietnam 
campaign chairman james a baker iii previously promised a 
full disclosure and said we are continuing to explore it 
with quayle 
dukakis campaigned in miami where he sidestepped questions 
about quayle but said he was proud to have served in the army in 
korea 
gop convention week polls charted a dwindling democratic lead in 
the fall campaign as bush addressed the delegates and a tv audience 
of millions 
im the one who favors the death penalty in certain drug 
cases he said im the one who opposes giving as weekend 
furlough to a first degree murderer 
an ebullient bush spent his day making the rounds of the 
convention city introducing his wife barbara to one audience as 
sweetie pie the party raised 4 million at a fundraiser at 
which the ticketmates lashed out against democratic failed 
liberal 
in his prepared remarks bush said america was at peace and 
prosperous after two great terms under ronald reagan now a 
change in leadership will be made he said adding when you have 
to change horses in midstream doesnt it make sense to switch to 
the one who whos going the same way 
bush sought to turn dukakis democratic convention rhetoric back 
on him dukakis said the election wasnt about ideology but about 
competence and bush saw an opening 
well its nice of them to want to play on our field he 
said but this election isnt only about competence for 
competence is a narrow ideal competence makes the trains run on 
time but doesnt know where theyre going competence is the creed 
of the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesnt for a 
second understand the magic of the machine 
said bush 
two parties this year ask for your support both will speak of 
growth and peace but only one has proved it can deliver two 
parties this year ask for your trust but only one has earned it 
the vice president said the night marked the beginning of his 
campaign 
i mean to run hard to fight hard to stand on the issues and 
i mean to win

newspaper requests for immediate 
unrestricted access to documents relating to the fbi search of 
unisys corp offices as part of the pentagon procurement probe have 
been denied by a federal judge 
us district judge diana murphy on wednesday denied the request 
by the star tribune and st paul pioneer press dispatch to see 
search warrants and supporting fbi affidavits about the fbi 
searches 
the fbi obtained warrants in midjune to search offices in three 
unisys buildings in eagan as part of the nationwide investigation 
into alleged defense contractor fraud 
the newspapers requests to unseal the information were turned 
down earlier by us magistrate j earl cudd his decision then was 
appealed to murphy 
murphy did order unsealed small portions of the documents 
mostly information the us attorneys office said it did not mind 
unveiling that included the names of fbi agents joseph glover and 
phyllis sciacca whose affidavits provided reasons for the warrants 
and the exact locations searched 
murphy also opened parts that provide information identical to 
what already has been unsealed in a similar dallas case the 
information is expected to be made available friday 
remaining under seal are details of what led the fbi to search 
the minnesota offices what information the government was looking 
for and any potential targets of prosecution cudds original order 
sealing that information until sept 14 remains in effect 
the newspapers argued that much information about the 
investigation already has become public and that potential targets 
of the probe already know about it 
the us attorneys office however said information specific 
to the minnesota searches has yet to be known publicly and that 
disclosure could prompt targets to destroy documents and otherwise 
avoid scrutiny 
the fbi conducted dozens of searches throughout the nation in 
midjune seeking information about alleged bribery of defense 
officials by defense consultants and the use by defense companies 
of improperly obtained contract information

george bush at long last claimed the 
republican presidential nomination thursday and portrayed the 
election as a choice between two very different ideas of the 
future america as a rising nation or one in decline 
in remarks prepared for delivery to the closing session of the 
republican national convention bush described himself as the 
underdog determined to run hard to fight hard to stand on the 
issues 
the vice president cited campaign themes of his democratic 
opponent michael dukakis and tried to turn them to his advantage 
some say this isnt an election about ideology its an 
election about competence said bush a reference to dukakis 
speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination 
but this election isnt only about competence for competence 
is a narrow idea said the republican nominee competence makes 
the trains run on time but doesnt know where theyre going 
on jobs he said someone better take a message to michael 
tell him weve been creating good jobs at good wages the need to 
create good jobs at good wages is a favorite dukakis campaign 
theme 
bush conceded that i may not be the most eloquent i may 
sometimes be a little awkward but theres nothing selfconscious 
in my love of country i am a quiet man but i hear the quiet 
people others dont the ones who raise the family pay the taxes 
meet the mortgage 
i hear them and i am moved and their concerns are mine 
he praised his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana under 
fire over his national guard service at a time when many draftees 
were being sent to vietnam 
he called quayle a young leader who has become a forceful in 
preparing americas workers for the labor force of the future 
im proud to have dan quayle at my side 
paying tribute to president reagan bush said he spent the last 
7 years helping a president conduct the most difficult job on 
earth 
ronald reagan asked for and received my candor he never 
asked for but he did receive my loyalty 
but the time had come he said when you must see me as i am 
the republican candidate for president of the united states 
he said the election was between not only two very different 
men but two very different ideas of the future 
my opponents view of the world sees a long slow decline for 
our country an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical 
forces 
but america is not in decline america is a rising nation 
he said he and dukakis have contrasting views on such questions 
as whether the pledge of allegiance should be required in the 
schools on school prayer the death penalty gun control abortion 
and taxes 
bush vowed to do whatever it takes to make the sure the 
disabled are included in the mainstream 
he pledged to stop ocean dumping and said our beaches should 
not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools 
bush said he would order the fbi to find out who was responsible 
for the recent dumping of medical waste that washed up on beaches 
in new york and new jersey 
he repeated his call for tougher ethical standards saying 
there are those who have dropped their standards along the way 
as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top he 
made no direct reference to the reagan administration officials 
accused of ethical violations 
earlier in the day bush appeared at a tribute to his wife 
barbara and said that he was told youve got to be a little more 
demonstrative after seeing michael dukakis and his wife kitty 
openly display their affection toward each other at the democratic 
convention in july 
recently bush has often said that he is not given to public 
displays of affection or emotion 
here we go he said looking at his wife who was seated to 
his right the introduction with feeling 
come on up sweetie pie 
with that mrs bush stepped forward and they hugged 
thank you very very much sweetie he said 
then she told the audience i hope you dont take your eyes 
off him and see if he looks at me adoringly 
later she said nobody ever had a better husband

the effectiveness of last winters influenza 
vaccine may have been reduced by a midseason drift in the 
predominant flu virus federal health researchers concluded in a 
report on the 198788 season 
health officials reported late last year that the predominant 
strain of flu ah3n2 one of the three major flu types appeared 
to be drifting or changing into a somewhat different form 
because these variations were not recognized until the fall of 
1987 the influenza vaccine which contains vaccine against all 
three major types could not be modified to include the new 
variant the national centers for disease control said thursday 
in its weekly report 
as a result the efficacy of the vaccine at least in certain 
highrisk persons may have been reduced the agency concluded 
cdc officials earlier this spring said the recommended 198889 
flu vaccine should contain a new formula to better protect against 
the new ah3n2 strain known as the sichuan flu

a 1982 dispute about an honorary degree for 
sen dan quayle was rooted in faculty members dislike of quayles 
conservative politics the former president of depauw university 
said thursday 
there was real strong sentiment about quayle because he was a 
conservative republican richard f rosser said i didnt care 
if he was a democrat or republican at that time at his age he 
was holding the highest public position of any depauw alumnus 
on thursday night quayle was unopposed for the republican vice 
presidential nomination 
faculty members initially rejected rossers request to give 
quayle a 1969 graduate of the small liberal arts college in 
greencastle ind an honorary doctor of laws at the 1982 spring 
commencement where he was the featured speaker 
the faculty later relented and approved the degree 
faculty members argued against the honorary degree by claiming 
quayle then 35 was too young and had unimpressive public service 
and academic records depauw professor o ralph raymond said in an 
interview wednesday 
it wasnt that his career was undistinguished it was just 
that it was such a short career said raymond a specialist on 
soviet affairs who opposed the degree award 
certainly there were some people quite bothered by the fact 
that we were honoring a person whose intellectual achievements were 
unimpressive we like to see students achieve a little bit more 
than he did 
rosser now president of the national association of independent 
colleges and universities in washington dc conceded thursday 
that quayle was no phi beta kappa he was not a distinguished 
student 
depauw has refused to provide quayles college records 
however rosser said quayles academic performance shouldnt 
have been an issue after his graduation quayle was being 
recognized for public service rosser said 
the degree spat was followed by another embarrassment for quayle 
when the two student radio reporters who broke the story were 
fired their student boss said they had reported on what rossner 
said was an offtherecord meeting 
quayle who once worked as a reporter at his fathers newspaper 
wrote to the university to urge the reporters reinstatement 
saying the firings could have a chilling effect on freedom of the 
press depauw was the birthplace of the society of profession 
journalists sigma delta chi 
the students did not get their jobs back raymond said

israel banned local committees that carry out 
leadership orders in the palestinian uprising and reports thursday 
said soldiers beat more than 250 arabs during four days of unrest 
in the occupied gaza strip 
palestinians began a twoday general strike in the west bank to 
protest israels policy of deporting those it considers activists 
in the 8monthold rebellion masked youths passed word of the 
strike some shouting through loudspeakers 
a threeday curfew was lifted from much of the gaza strip before 
dawn thursday but 180000 arabs in 11 refugee camps and 
neighborhoods still were confined about 85000 west bank 
palestinians from nine villages and camps were under curfew 
israel radio said soldiers wounded six palestinians in the 
occupied west bank four in the amari refugee camp and two 
teenagers in tamun village hospital officials said five 
palestinians were wounded in gazas camps including a 14yearold 
boy 
army spokesmen confirmed the tamun shootings and said the 
palestinians attacked an army patrol with knives 
an amnesty international report said soldiers had beaten 
thousands of palestinians in the past eight months the foreign 
ministry said it was checking the allegations but claimed that the 
londonbased human rights group consulted biased sources 
at least 247 palestinians have been killed since the rebellion 
began last dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians of the west 
bank and gaza which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war four israelis have died 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said outlawing the committees 
would create legal means of dealing with the activists of the 
uprising 
the defense ministry said every palestinian who serves on or 
assists the popular committees will be arrested and tried 
israel radio said punishment for conviction would be 10 years in 
prison 
popular committees carry out directives of the uprisings 
underground leadership organizing demonstrations and patrols and 
supplying food and medical aid to needy palestinians 
the government accused the committees of organizing violence and 
of being connected to outlawed palestinian guerrilla groups 
including factions of the palestine liberation organization 
the committees have a double aim to impose by violent means 
the orders of the plo and the uprisings leaders on the population 
and to undermine the israeli authorities and to create 
alternative mechanisms instead the defense ministry said 
the move followed deportation orders issued wednesday against 25 
gaza strip and west bank arabs mostly members of the popular 
committees 
outlawing the committees would create legal means of dealing 
with their activists and of course their leaders rabin told 
israel radio thursday 
rabin said 200 to 300 popular committees members were in jail 
without trial and estimated several hundreds more are still free 
police arrested a 17yearold israeli suspected of setting the 
fire near tel aviv earlier this month that killed three arab 
workers from gaza israel army radio said violent gaza riots last 
week were said to have been inflamed by news of the burning deaths 
the unrest resulted in the threeday curfew 
red cross and hospital officials in gaza said about 270 
palestinians were treated for beating injuries since the curfew 
began sunday night including 17 treated thursday 
of those about 40 arabs suffered fractured bones and most of 
the rest suffered bruises and contusions said an official at gaza 
citys shifa hospital where most of the injured were treated the 
official said most of the injuries came during overnight 
housetohouse searches 
israeli military officials said they did not keep exact figures 
but estimated the number of beating victims in the last four days 
at about 135 
most were curfew violators who suffered only light injuries 
one official said the beatings were a result of a tremendous 
effort we made not to endanger lives 
the hospital red cross and military officials spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
one victim fathi jamil 40 said from his hospital bed at shifa 
that soldiers chasing palestinian protesters in jabaliya refugee 
camp beat him up inside his home wednesday he showed a reporter 
bruises the size of oranges on his right arm and left leg and two 
cigarette burns on his chest 
another patient ahmed mahmoud salameh of gaza city said he was 
hit by rubber bullets after soldiers entered his home and dragged 
out his 15yearold son salameh 47 said he ran outdoors to stop 
the troops his right eye was bandaged and hospital officials said 
he lost it when he was struck by a rubber bullet 
the arabiclanguage daily al quds quoted sources as saying the 
plo was preparing to recognize israel and would announce a 
governmentinexile headed by mahmoud abbas a top aide to plo 
chief yasser arafat abbas headed a delegation that visited jordan 
last week 
this month israeli officials seized a palestinian declaration 
of independence from an east jerusalem office that called for an 
independent palestinian state

when dan quayle enlisted in the national guard 
in 1969 the united states was faring poorly in vietnam volunteers 
for active military service were in short supply and the nations 
college campuses were awash in protest 
and short of becoming a draft dodger the guard looked pretty 
safe if you could get in 
during the war the united states sent 34 million servicemen 
and women to southeast asia only about 9000 were in mobilized 
army and air national guard units by the time the fighting ended 
there would be more than 58000 american casualties 97 would be 
guardsmen in those mobilized units 
in 1969 346 million men and women were on active duty in the 
armed forces and to maintain that strength the selective service 
had to draft 283586 individuals by contrast 389000 individuals 
were in the army national guard in 1969 and most of those units 
werent expanding 
waiting lists to get into the guard became a reality 
nationwide during the vietnam war but it happened at different 
times in different locations said maj david super a pentagon 
spokesman and specialist on guard and reserve issues 
some units in some states were hard to get into others 
werent super said 
the national guard was a legal alternative to the draft and 
many chose to pursue it said dan donohue the chief spokesman 
for the national guard bureau at the pentagon 
quayle the republican vice presidential candidate has said he 
decided to join the guard in 1969 so he could attend law school he 
has dismissed questions about whether he was trying to avoid combat 
in vietnam as a cheap shot 
i was willing and ready to serve my country quayle said 
i chose to serve my country in the national guard like millions 
of other people 
accoding to reports thursday quayle received a highlevel 
endorsement that eased his entry into the guard but its unclear 
whether he needed the help 
john s anderson a democrat and adjutant general of the indiana 
national guard until 1969 said the guard service had a waiting 
list john owens a republican and successor to anderson said 
indiana had vacancies galore in his units 
whether quayle needed help or not retired maj gen wendell c 
phillippi who was managing editor of the indianapolis news and 
worked for quayles grandfather eugene c pulliam said he 
contacted his multitude of friends within the guard when quayle 
applied the news reported 
i was asked about dan quayles abilities and capabilities and 
i recommended him very highly as i did with many other men 
phillippi told the news later phillippi said he made only one 
call on quayles behalf 
ironically quayle could have attended law school without 
worrying about vietnam or the guard six months after quayle 
enlisted congress approved a draft lottery system and in december 
1969 quayle received a number high enough 210 to push him 
outside the induction zone 
quayle was 22 in 1969 when he graduated from college and lost 
his college deferment from the draft he enlisted in the guard in 
indiana as a private on may 16 1969 and was trained first as a 
welder then a clerktypist and later as an information specialist 
with the 120th public affairs detachment of the indiana guard 
he received an honorable discharge on may 18 1975 
at the time of quayles enlistment as is the case now national 
guard units were subject to mobilization but the policy of the 
johnson and nixon administrations was to rely on activeduty forces 
to fight the war 
the only exceptions occurred in 1968 shortly after the seizure 
of the us spy ship pueblo four tactical fighter squadrons from 
the air national guard were mobilized in january and then in may 
20 army national guard units were called up including an army 
ranger company from the indiana guard 
only a portion of the mobilized units were sent to vietnam and 
all were demobilized by the end of 1969 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said thursday the 
guard didnt look like too safe a place to me because those 
who were sent to vietnam saw combat and won 55 silver stars 681 
purple hearts one distinguished flying cross 16 distinguished 
service medals six legions of merit and over 1000 bronze stars 
i cant speak to the motives of any individual who volunteers 
for the guard who volunteers for active duty or whatever howard 
said im simply pointing out that the national guard served very 
honorably in vietnam

the white house announced thursday 
it will tell the general accounting office that it cannot provide 
information gao is seeking involving possible illegal activities by 
gen manuel antonio noriega of panama 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater added that the 
administration will respond in an appropriate manner if the 
gao reformulates its request in a manner consistent with its 
stautory authority and the legal principles involved 
fitzwater said the white house acted on the advice of the 
justice department 
the gao acting on a request by sen john f kerry dmass and 
rep bill alexander dark is making a study of ways that 
information about drug trafficking by foreign officials influences 
decisions by the united states on foreign policy 
noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by two 
federal grand juries in florida the united states has sought in 
vain so far to have him removed from power in panama 
the general accounting offices request for information on 
gen noriega asks for a broad range of sensitive intelligence 
material information from open law enforcement files and material 
reflecting the deliberative decisionmaking process of the 
executive branch the white house spokesman said 
he said administration officials had met with the gao in an 
effort to narrow the request but the gao declined to do so 
the white house informed the congressional watchdog agency on 
july 13 that we would need to complete a legal review of the 
issues raised by their request before responding fitzwater said 
the justice department has just completed that review and has 
concluded that the subject matter of the request is beyond gaos 
statutory authority he said 
fitzwater said that consistent with the legal advice we have 
now received from the justice department we will be informing gao 
that we cannot participate in the study as currently designed 
the administration is prepared to meet with gao to discuss the 
legal issues involved he said moreover if gao reformulates 
its request in a manner consistent with its statutory authority and 
the legal principles involved we will respond to any such new 
request in an appropriate manner 
in miami democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
accused the administration of stonewalling the general 
accounting office probe which potentially could delve into 
republican nominee george bushs knowledge about the noriega case 
administration officials argued they needed time to review the 
gaos requests for information 
i think the white house does not want to cooperate because 
they are embarrassed by this they should be embarrassed by this 
dukakis said 
nancy r kingsbury who is directing the study by the gao 
congress investigative agency said the administrations total 
lack of cooperation is unusual past gaoexecutive branch disputes 
focused on specific documents she noted 
the order not to cooperate until further notice came from 
nicholas rostow special assistant to the president and legal 
adviser at the national security council according to ms 
kingsbury and an administration official insisting on anonymity 
the white house order apparently will apply through most if not 
all of the presidential campaign in which questions have been 
raised about vice president bushs knowledge of noriegas alleged 
drug trafficking 
bush has played a central role in the administrations overall 
antidrug effort but has denied having early knowledge or 
suppressing evidence about any noriega ties to the drug world 
noriega for years provided intelligence information to the cia 
which bush once headed 
the gao is seeking information from the departments of defense 
state the drug enforcement administration the cia the justice 
department and the national security council 
all executive branch agencies have been instructed by the 
white house not to take any action on your request until various 
legal issues have been analyzed by the administration state 
department comptroller roger b feldman write ms kingsbury earlier 
this month feldman said that rostow is acting as the 
administrations point of contact on this matter 
rostows office said he was not available to comment 
in a letter made public by alexander rostow wrote ms 
kingsbury your request seeks access to sensitive law enforcement 
and intelligence files covering a substantial period of time 
the request raises important statutory and constitutional 
issues the administration is analyzing them now and when its 
deliberation is complete i shall reply further 
the administration official in california said the gao may 
eventually get some all or none of the information it seeks we 
have said we are going to review this and until we do the review 
we are not going to turn anything over he said 
ms kingsbury said the noriega study is part of a larger 
inquiry to examine how information about drug trafficking by 
foreign officials affects us foreign policy decisions 
we didnt anticipate the trouble with the administration 
said ms kingsbury who is gao associate director for foreign 
economic assistance programs 
if the stalemate isnt resolved she said the gao can issue a 
demand letter for the information and go to court in an attempt 
to enforce it 
she acknowledged the administration has wiggle room in areas 
like foreign intelligence gathering and law enforcement

college and at 22 years old he is facing the shared dilemma of his 
generation what to do about vietnam hes lucky he has options 
nineteen years later his decision casts a shadow on the republican 
national convention 
the bush campaign wanted a baby boomer they got one and he 
carries the baggage of his generation this is not world war ii 
were talking about this is the vietnam war and millions of kids 
were trying to avoid it 
in quayles case he is wrestling with the image of a rich kid 
who chose law school over vietnam and traded on his family 
influence to make his dreams come true 
stripped of the veneer of 1988 presidential politics it comes 
down to this from john decamp of nebraska a vietnam veteran and 
former state senator who is among 2277 delegates voting on 
quayles vice presidential nomination 
back there in the 60s you had boys with money and influence 
who didnt want to go to vietnam finding a way to get into the 
national guard 
and then you had other boys without so much money and some of 
them didnt want to go to vietnam but they volunteered or got 
drafted and they went and some of them like me got shot at a lot 
and a great many of them just plain got shot and killed 
some 153300 wounded 58153 killed 
lets face it the question is whether a rich kids family got 
him into the guard when other people were getting drafted decamp 
said 
thats one question anyway 
quayle is being dogged by several 
most important for him is to explain why given the opportunity 
and even the inevitability of serving in the armed forces in 
vietnam he chose to pursue a national guard appointment instead 
on top of that he hails from the immensely wealthy and 
influential pulliam family and revelations that a prominent 
pulliam employee interceded with the guard on quayles behalf 
raises the silver spoon imagery that the republicans prefer to 
avoid 
thirdly quayle presents himself as extremely tough on national 
defense issues and is eager to provide a contrast to democrats who 
he criticizes as not tough enough that wont be easy if he is 
forced to defend his military record 
in 1969 quayle wanted to go to law school after graduating from 
depauw university but he was losing his student deferment from the 
draft and the war was at a peak without some sort of intervention 
quayle would surely be drafted and probably sent to vietnam 
so the grandson of publisher eugene pulliam went to talk to a 
former indiana national guard commander who worked as managing 
editor of a newspaper the indianapolis news owned by his family 
he got in the guard and he went to law school 
the same year 283586 young men were drafted into the armed 
services thousands more volunteered 
yet even among defenseminded republican activists everything 
is relative 
the thing thats important is he didnt go to canada said 
george w bush the nominees eldest son remember in 1968 
canada was an option he didnt go 
lets keep it in generational perspective 
indeed quayle was nothing special for his generation in 1969 
vietnam was not a popular war and it took a nonstop draft to keep 
up the military 
if he got in the national guard to dodge the vietnam war that 
may be an issue with some vietnam veterans i dont know said 
gop delegate noble cody of cookeville tenn but ill tell you 
one thing if i had a son that age and knowing what i do now about 
that war id do everything i could to keep him out of it 
from oregon delegation chairman tj bailey i am a vietnam 
veteran and i truly do not resent dan quayle for not having 
gone it is a way a number of my lifelong friends opted we have to 
examine the sanity and wisdom of people who resent him for not 
being shot at 
jerry prevo chairman of the alaska delegation said i guess 
the question still remains if he didnt join the guard would 
he have been drafted i think a lot of people who had the potential 
of getting out of going to vietnam used that potential that 
connection in those years 
that was 20 years ago people make mistakes when theyre 
young if we held up everything we did as young people none of us 
would be considered worthy of doing something for our country 
baby boomers will understand but the older generation may 
hold it against him said samuel atkins a watkinsville ga 
attorney and pat robertson supporter i see it as a bruise but 
not something that will injure the man permanently

the younger brother of afghanistans 
sovietbacked leader has defected to the united states with his 
family and is being accepted as a refugee reagan administration 
officials disclosed thursday 
the afghan ruler najibullah and his brother saddiq were said 
to have been at odds for some time saddiq was under death threat 
and was protected for several months by an antigovernment faction 
that then spirited him out of afghanistan to pakistan said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the two brothers go by single names najibullah also goes by the 
name najib 
saddiq 37 his wife soraya and their two young sons reached 
the united states on wednesday from frankfurt west germany and 
have been given sanctuary the official said 
he was accepted in this country as a refugee the official 
told the associated press no special deals were made but the 
processing was expedited elaborate security precautions have been 
taken 
saddiq who was described as an intellectual apparently joined 
the forces of ahmed shah massoud the rebel field commander who has 
led the fight against afghan troops and soviet forces in the 
strategic panjshir valley 
he also was believed to have joined the jamiatiislami party 
one of the largest opposition groups 
some years ago a us official said saddiq served as 
afghanistans banking representative in hamburg west germany he 
broke with his brother and claimed he was kidnapped and forced 
back to afghanistan said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
it certainly doesnt do anything for the image of the leader 
of afghanistan for his brother who had a privileged position to 
defect the official said 
earlier thursday the state department expressing satisfaction 
with the pace of the soviet troop pullout from afghanistan urged 
moscow to withdraw all remaining soldiers by years end six weeks 
before the deadline set by the geneva accord 
we see no reason why the soviets cannot meet their 
oftenstated goal of completing the withdrawal by the end of 1988 
nine years to the month from their invasion the department said 
in a statement 
the soviet withdrawal is indispensable to the ability of the 
afghan people to determine their own future and of the afghan 
refugees to return home in safety and honor it said 
the geneva accords signed last april call for completing the 
soviet armys pullout by feb 15 half the troops were to have been 
removed by last monday a deadline the state department said the 
soviets met 
the vast majority of afghanistan is now free of soviet 
troops the statement said soviet combat units remain deployed 
in only two corridors in northern afghanistan the bulk of soviet 
troops remaining in that country are in the kabul area and along 
the road heading north from kabul to termez the soviet border 
town 
on wednesday after pakistani president mohammed zia ulhaq died 
in an air crash us and soviet diplomats held an unannounced 
meeting in washington zia had played a leading role in arranging 
the afghan troop withdrawal 
a us official who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified said the soviets assured the americans that the 
withdrawal would not be affected by zias death 
millions of afghan refugees are in pakistan the state 
department on monday accused the soviets and the afghan army of 
leaving 10 million to 30 million mines deployed making the 
refugees return difficult 
the soviets denied the allegation on tuesday there was no 
mention of the mines in the statement which was read by department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
she said us military assistance to the rebels would be 
continued and that the soviets had not stopped helping the afghan 
army 
i am not prepared to get into the question of the degrees or 
if they slowed down mrs oakley said what we are saying is 
they have not stopped therefore our assistance will continue 
the soviets had an estimated 115000 troops in afghanistan 
before the pullout began the statement did not give precise 
figures it said the soviets had withdrawn roughly half their 
combat units and an unspecified number of supply units 
the soviet union has evacuated all of its forces from roughly 
twothirds of the major garrisons at which troops were deployed 
three months ago the statement said

two men held captive by colombian rebels for 10 
months said thursday they tended gardens played chess and picked 
the banjo with their captors but still longed for their freedom 
jason mclachan 21 and stephan koneman 22 met with reporters 
at a hotel near ohare international airport for a morning news 
conference they were reunited with their families wednesday night 
the hardest part was waiting to be freed said mclachan 
for us its something that happened in our lives and were glad 
its over 
the two men both geography majors were canoeing down the 
amazon river last fall when they were captured by members of a 
leftist rebel group who believed them to be cia agents said elmer 
koneman stephans father the two were taken captive oct 4 
mclachan said the rebels men and women of varying ages never 
mistreated them but kept them isolated at different camps in the 
amazon jungle the rebels carried handguns and kept their captives 
under constant supervision 
a lot of people had been saying we disappeared mclachan 
said for us it was everyone else who disappeared 
the rebels members of the colombian revolutionary armed forces 
held the two until sunday koneman said 
their release was announced earlier this week 
mclachan said their captors wanted to know what these two 
gringos were doing down there after talking with the rebels the 
students convinced them they were not political agents 
my spanish is now muy bien he said but without steve 
it captivity would have been more difficult 
koneman recalling the rebels camp in the jungle said there 
was no way to determine whether the guerillas had attacked anyone 
or were selling drugs 
probably the two of us were the most bizarre thing there he 
said referring to their white skins 
koneman and mclachan said they were in good health and had 
never feared for their lives 
it never got tense that way mclachan said 
but after 10 months of a diet that included alligators toucans 
and piranha fish the two agreed that a homecoming hamburger was in 
order 
konemans father said earlier the families had all but given up 
hope 
we basically went through a period where for so long we felt 
that all was lost he said wednesday its a marvelous 
resurrection 
it wasnt until i saw him on television yesterday that i 
really thought my god this guy is coming home he said 
a roman catholic bishop negotiated with the rebels for four or 
five months before gaining the young mens release

the spokesman for the vietnam veterans of 
america said thursday that national guard service was regarded as 
cushy duty to avoid the draft and that questions about dan 
quayles military service were relevant 
mike leaveck director of public relations for the vietnam 
veterans of america said his organization has received several 
dozen calls from members upset about revelations about quayles 
national guard record 
but at least one medal of honor winner from the vietnam war said 
criticism of quayle and the national guard is a bum rap 
four of my very close friends in the national guard were 
killed in vietnam said george bud day a retired air force 
colonel and former prisoner of war from fort walton beach fla 
these guys that went to the guard were very good guys they 
got in there and served their country said day who headed 
veterans for reagan in 1984 i applaud this guy if thats the 
worst thing they can dig up on this guy they should make him 
president 
leaveck in a telephone interview from the groups washington 
headquarters said questions about what did you do during the 
vietnam war we think are very relevant for anyone in public life 
particularly of our generation 
 
 
a lot of people served in the national guard during those 
years a lot of them served in the national guard in order to avoid 
military service in vietnam thats a well known accepted fact we 
cant comment on what his motivations may have been a lot of 
people went into the national guard because they liked it 
but he added actually the national guard was considered 
cushy duty weve had a lot of calls from our members who are 
upset 
however a spokesman for the american legion said he was 
concerned that the impression will be conveyed that national guard 
service is somehow dishonorable john minnick legion spokesman 
in washington said the guard was important for national defense 
and also in domestic emergencies 
but minnick said quayles military service was a legitimate 
issue 
leaveck described quayle as nonsupportive of his groups 
position on veterans issues he said in particular quayle opposed 
continuation of veterans counseling center program opposed 
compensation for diseases related to agent orange exposure and has 
not supported legislation allowing court review of veterans 
administration benefit decisions which the vva backs but some 
other veterans groups oppose 
the vva has 35000 memers is congressionally chartered and 
composed entirely of vietnam veterans 
the american legion the largest veterans group with nearly 3 
million members including 800000 vietnam veterans it is based in 
indianapolis ind quayles home state minnick said service in 
the guard was not sufficient to qualify for membership in the 
american legion and that quayle is not eligible while bush and 
democrat michael dukakis are

george bush used the most important speech of 
his life thursday night to portray himself to the american people 
as a man who may sometimes be a little awkward who is 
reserved but who nevertheless can lead a nation 
what it all comes down to after all the shouting and the 
cheers is the man at the desk and who should sit at the desk 
said bush 
my friends i am that man 
accepting his partys nomination for president bush defined his 
vision for the job but also sought to expose the inner man by 
doing so he indirectly attacked the images attached to him 
the image of bush the boring speaker 
i may not be the most eloquent but i learned early that 
eloquence wont draw oil from the ground i may sometimes be a 
little awkward but theres nothing selfconscious in my love of 
country 
i am a quiet man but i hear the quiet people others dont 
the wimp image 
my life has been lived in the shadow of war i almost lost my 
life in one i hate war i love peace we have peace and i am not 
going to let anyone take it away from us 
the richkid image evoked at the democratic convention by 
keynote speaker ann richards of bushs being born with a silver 
foot in his mouth 
my parents were prosperous their children were lucky bush 
said but there were lessons we had to learn about life he 
learned them he said by moving to texas where he lived in a 
little shotgun house one room for the three of us worked in the 
oil business started my own 
bush said certain traditions guide him 
one is that there is a god and he is good and his love while 
free has a self imposed cost we must be good to one another 
bush said 
and he said 
i believe public service is honorable every time i hear that 
someone has breached the public trust it breaks my heart 
i want a kinder gentler nation 
i say it without boast or bravado ive fought for my country 
ive served ive built i will keep america moving forward 
always forward that is my mission and i will complete it

democrat lloyd bentsen pressed his vice 
presidential campaign among conservative oilcountry businessmen 
and then to jesse jackson supporters thursday and he refused to 
criticize republican counterpart dan quayles service in the 
national guard during the vietnam war 
im not going to question that said bentsen a world war ii 
bomber pilot im a strong supporter of the national guard and 
always have been one of my own sons served in the national guard 
bentsen passed up the chance to criticize quayle over reports 
that george bushs vice presidential running mate sought to enter 
the indiana national guard in 1969 and avoid being drafted for 
active duty in vietnam 
instead the senator and former houston businessman sought to 
explain to his east texas audiences about his dual candidacies as 
michael dukakis running mate and for reelection to the senate he 
reassured them he would remain committed to advancing their 
business interests if he is elected vice president on the ticket 
with democratic nominee michael dukakis 
in a speech before the east texas regional development group in 
longview bentsen said he rejected the old shibboleths about 
the vice presidency being an unimportant job now the vice 
president is in the loop he said 
bentsen shook hands as he strolled down the main street of the 
oil city of kilgore starting at larry tates stripper well and 
ending up at the worlds richest acre where there were once 24 
wells that produced more than 25 million barrels of crude oil in 
the 1930s through the 1950s 
city manager ron cox said there once were 1200 wells in kilgore 
but now there were only about 200 
standing in the moist east texas heat bentsen told local oilmen 
of his work to repeal the windfall profits tax which will be 
accomplished if president reagan signs trade legislation approved 
recently by congress 
i understand very much the kind of predicament were in here 
in east texas said bentsen chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
ronnie patton owner of the patton corp a supplier of drilling 
rigs and equipment said his business was bad 
the phones are dead there aint anybody calling he said 
rusty howell of marshall exploration told bentsen he hoped the 
trade bill would result in jobs and money dollars for east 
texas 
so whenever youre up there in the white house just remember 
stick some of that money down here to us he said 
howell told reporters afterward that he had mixed emotions 
about bentsen leaving the senate if hes elected vice president 
im definitely going to vote for lloyd for senator he said 
in all probability i will vote for him for vice president 
at the end of the day bentsen held a closeddoor meeting with 
the other end of the democratic party spectrum a group of jesse 
jacksons supporters in dallas 
juggling his two campaigns bentsen selected public events for 
vice presidential bid and met privately with senate supporters 
the senators staff said his entire nineday swing through texas 
was a vicepresidential trip but senate campaign buttons and signs 
were everywhere and dukakis name was scarce 
after dinner and breakfast with supporters of his senate 
campaign in nearby tyler bentsen said he had explained why he 
teamed up with dukakis a massachusetts liberal just as lyndon b 
johnson ran with john f kennedy in 1960 while simultaneously 
running for reelection to the senate 
im visiting with them as to why i went on the ticket and 
that i felt in this election we were playing for all the marbles 
he said 
quitting the senate campaign would automatically give a sixyear 
term to his opponent rep beau boulter rtexas 
im sure theyd like that but were not going to do that 
he said i certainly expect to win he said lyndon johnson 
did 
bentsens fellow senator from texas republican phil gramm who 
placed bushs name in nomination for the presidency at the gop 
convention in new orleans said thursday he thought republicans 
could win the white house without texas 29 electoral votes 
asked if he was surprised at gramms concession that the gop 
might lose texas in the november elections bentsen smiled and 
said i think hes made a very good forecast

police set off flash grenades on a 
crowded highway and opened fire thursday capturing two bank 
robbers who took more than 30 hostages in two days of gun battles 
and international chases that left three people dead 
a woman hostage was killed in the final shootout that also 
seriously wounded the gunmen and a second woman hostage and 
slightly injured a female accomplice a 15yearold hostage and a 
policeman were killed wednesday one day after the bandits robbed a 
bank in a small northwestern town and commandeered a bus carrying 
30 passengers 
at least three other people were injured in the twoday ordeal 
in which the pistolwaving bandits met with pursuing journalists 
several times letting reporters inside the captive bus in bremen 
and holding a roadside news conference in cologne 
the bandits hansjuergen roesner 31 and dieter degowski 32 
had traded the bus and all but two hostages for a bmw sedan after 
they crossed over into the netherlands 
officers stopped the sedan on a crowded autobahn at 145 pm by 
setting off exploding devices that emit a powerful flash of light 
said police spokesman horst fechner 
a police vehicle from a special tactical unit rammed the back of 
the getaway car and the two sides started shooting said juergen 
hosse president of colognes police department 
the criminals opened fire and we shot back hosse said 
adding that police dont know who fired the bullet that killed the 
woman hostage 
the other hostage received lifethreatening injuries said 
fechner a police spokesman in the northwestern german city of 
recklinghausen where a special command post was set up to 
coordinate police strategy he refused to identify the wounded 
hostage 
later thursday police spokesman harald treutinger said the 
wounded womans condition had improved 
police refused to say where they had taken the gunmen and their 
woman accomplice treutinger said an investigation had begun but no 
charges had been brought 
authorities said the inquiry could lead to charges of murder 
hostagetaking and other crimes with a maximum penalty of life in 
prison for the two gunmen it was unclear what charges the woman 
could face 
the ordeal began tuesday when the gunmen took two hostages 
during a bank robbery in gladbeck 50 miles north of cologne after 
daylong negotiations they fled in a car provided by authorities 
they carried with them about 227000 of which 162000 was 
provided by police to ensure the hostages safety 
they surfaced wednesday in bremen 135 miles northwest of 
gladbeck where police said they opened fire in a vegetable market 
no one was injured 
joined by a female accomplice the bandits commandeered a city 
bus and drove away with about 30 hostages 
four elderly passengers a child and the two original hostages 
were freed and the bus careened along the autobahn for several 
hours late wednesday and early thursday 
hermann wahl another recklinghausen police spokesman said an 
officer died in a crash pursuing the gunmen and the robbers shot 
to death a 15yearold italian boy aboard the bus wednesday 
wahl said the boy who was not identified was killed after 
police grabbed the robbers accomplice officials identified her 
only as marion irma l 
she later was allowed to rejoin the gunmen and the bus crossed 
the border into the netherlands near the dutch town of oldenzaal 
early thursday 
the gunmen demanded a highpowered bmw as an escape vehicle and 
threatened to shoot hostages and police provided the car 
the robbers shot and wounded two captives then freed all but 
two female hostages said dutch police spokesman jan houdel the 
condition of the wounded captives was not known 
a shootout ensued and the female accomplice was shot in the 
leg the gunmen their wounded companion and two women hostages 
then sped back to west germany 
after speeding through the ruhr industrial area the car stopped 
in the center of cologne on thursday morning and was immediately 
surrounded by journalists 
we arent going to negotiate with police any more because we 
know that leads to nothing said degowski i want to say 
through the news media that the police should back off 
he sat in the back seat of the bmw pointing a pistol at a woman 
hostage squeezed in beside him 
the woman said she felt good and added i was afraid 
before because i thought the police might move in and id be 
killed it was not immediately known if she was the hostage who 
later was killed 
roesner sat at the steering wheel and criticized the police he 
occasionally waved his pistol at the reporters 
the robbers ordered a cologne journalist to get into the car as 
a third hostage they released him before they sped into the trap 
set up outside bonn by the special police commando unit 
herbert schnoor interior minister of north rhinewestphalia 
state criticized the news media and said the interviews with the 
bandits endangered the hostages 
at no point did the police have the help of the media in the 
attempt to protect the hostages said schnoor whose state 
includes gladbeck 
but a poll taken by the respected wickert institute in tuebingen 
said 93 percent of the respondents could not understand why police 
did not act sooner to end the ordeal eightynine percent of the 
the 1708 west germans questioned said the top state politicians 
responsible for law and order should resign

a group of christian fundamentalists thursday 
challenged the requirement that children age 5 and older must have 
social security numbers to be claimed as exemptions on their 
parents tax returns 
a lawsuit by 137 parents filed in us district court contends 
that the requirement of the 1986 tax reform act violates their 
religious beliefs and is an invasion of privacy 
the ability to invade the privacy of american citizens in this 
age of computers is far more likely with this mandatory universal 
numbering system than with either universal drug testing or 
fingerprinting said the complaint 
the law requires that parents place the social security numbers 
of children age 5 and older on tax returns to claim each child as a 
dependent 
attorney michael p farris said most of the parents are 
bornagain christians many of whom believe that the requirement 
contracts with christs teaching to render under to caesar that 
which is caesars and render to god that which is gods he said 
they believe that god ordained parents as the ones who are to 
be responsible for children rather than the government farris 
said taxes belong to caesar but children belong to god 
another group believes that the social security number used as a 
law enforcement tool is a precursor to the mark of the beast 
prophesied in the bible he said 
according to the prophecy the mark is a number that every 
person would need to buy their soul in a world ruled by the 
antichrist farris said 
most of the parents claimed the exemptions on their tax returns 
but did not provide social security numbers he said but one 
family with nine children did not claim the exemptions just to be 
safe he said 
the internal revenue service sent warnings to these parents that 
the numbers would be required on their 1988 returns said irs 
spokeswoman ellen murphy 
failure to include the number will result in a 5 penalty but 
parents wouldnt automatically lose the 2000 exemption claimed 
for each child 
parents who dont comply in 1988 could be asked to prove their 
child is a dependent 
congress adopted the requirement when it raised the exemption 
from 1000 to 2000 as part of the taxreform legislation passed 
two years ago 
one of the reasons why congress changed the law was because 
through the years our taxpayer compliance measuring programs had 
indicated a fairly high incidence of parents who are living apart 
claiming their children on both returns murphy said 
with the increase in the value of the personal exemption 
obviously the revenue impact of the noncompliance was going to be 
increased she said 
farris said a number of the plaintiffs educate their children at 
home in violation of state laws that require attendance at public 
schools 
they fear that social security numbers could be used to 
crosscheck children to ensure they are attending school 
virginia for instance requires children to have social 
security cards to attend public school said farris who is a staff 
attorney for the home school legal defense association in great 
falls va 
the group helps parents in the homeschool movement but is not a 
party to the case 
murphy said the irs does not share social security numbers or 
any other tax information with other government agencies except 
for tax enforcement

voyages i seek the presidency to build a better america it is 
that simple and that big 
some say this isnt an election about ideology its an 
election about competence well its nice of them to want to play 
on our field but this election isnt only about competence for 
competence is a narrow ideal 
competence makes the trains run on time but doesnt know where 
theyre going competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes

of the machine 
the truth is this election is about the beliefs we share the 
values we honor the principles we hold dear 
things arent perfect in this country there are people who 
havent tasted the fruits of the expansion ive talked to farmers 
about the bills they cant pay ive been to the factories that 
feel the strain of change ive seen the urban children who play 
amidst the shattered glass and shattered lives and there are the 
homeless what we must remember if we are to be responsible 
and compassionate is that economic growth is the key to our 
endeavors 
look at the world on this bright august night the spirit of 
democracy is sweeping the pacific rim china feels the winds of 
change new democracies assert themselves in south america one by 
one the unfree places fall not to the force of arms but to the 
force of an idea freedom works 
the tremors in the soviet world continue the hard earth 
there has not yet settled perhaps what is happening will change 
our world forever perhaps not a prudent skepticism is in order 
and so is hope 
either way were in an unprecedented position to change the 
nature of our relationship not by preemptive concession but by 
keeping our strength

congress has approved a ban on 
production of nuclear weapons in brazil as part of the countrys 
new constitution which is expected to be finalized this year 
the twochamber congress doubling as a constituent assembly 
passed an amendment wednesday night specifying that all nuclear 
activity in national territory will only be allowed for peaceful 
ends 
but it rejected a clause that also would have banned the 
transportation storage or import of atomic weapons according to 
rep fabio feldman one of the amendments sponsors 
congress has been working since february 1987 on the new 
constituion brazils eighth 
brazil announced last year it had acquired uraniunenrichment 
technology which theoretically could give it the capability to 
build an atomic bomb 
the government repeatedly has said its nuclear energy program is 
only for peaceful ends but scientists and politicians have 
expressed concern about the destination of brazils enriched 
uranium 
brazil signed the tlatelolco treaty for nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons in latin america but failed to ratify it 
the uranium is processed at a navy base in ipero in 
southeastern brazil where the navy is developing a reactor to 
power a nuclear submarine 
the project was kept semisecret during military rule here from 
1964 to 1985 its existence was officially revealed last year by 
president jose sarney a civilian who took office in 1985 
navy minister adm henrique saboia said in an interview thursday 
with the rio newspaper jornal do brasil that the ban doesnt affect 
the governments nuclear program 
the country already has taken on the obligation and the 
political decision not to build an atomic bomb he said 
brazil and argentina are the only south american countries with 
nuclear technology although argentina is more advanced 
brazil has one finished nuclear plant a 626kilowatt reactor in 
angra dos reis 90 miles southwest of rio the plant broke down 
frequently after it started working in 1985 and was dubbed 
lightning bug because it goes on and off 
in 1975 brazil signed an agreement with west germany for 
construction of up to eight more nuclear plants and transfer of 
technology but only two were started and work on them has all but 
stopped because of budget cuts

democratic senate candidate bob kerrey who 
won the medal of honor and lost part of a leg in the vietnam war 
said thursday that dan quayle should be honest about his military 
service record 
dont drape yourself in a flag and forget what it was like to 
be 20 and what it was like for your number to come up kerrey 
said in a telephone interview 
kerrey said quayle a republican us senator from indiana and 
george bushs choice as a presidential running mate should admit 
that he wouldnt have joined the national guard unless he was under 
the threat of the draft 
i wouldnt have thought of going to canada or to jail or ask 
my dad to make some calls to the draft board said kerrey but 
i also was not overwhelmed by patriotic verve 
kerrey 44 enlisted in the navy were he became a member of the 
elite seals 
still the former nebraska governor said i dont have hostile 
feelings toward dan quayle because he got in the national guard 
instead of waiting for the draft 
however if quayle or his influential publishing family pulled 
strings to keep him out of combat thats a different story 
quayle a hardliner on defense said he sought guard duty so he 
could attend law school 
quayle was 22 in 1969 no longer deferred from the draft and 
vulnerable to being conscripted and sent to vietnam national guard 
units were rarely activated for vietnam duty and many men joined 
the guard to avoid the draft and likely vietnam duty 
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi who worked for quayles 
grandfather eugene c pulliam said thursday that he contacted 
guard acquaintances on behalf of quayle

catalonian separatists who said they 
were targeting heroin dealers claimed responsibility for a bomb 
attack that injured three people thursday officials said 
the bomb exploded outside the bar maite in barcelonas rundown 
el rabal neighborhood about 230 am it seriously injured a 
relative of the bars owner and a passerby a spokesman for the 
civil governors office said a 10yearold girl who had been 
sleeping in a back room was slightly hurt he said 
the basque terrorist group eta meanwhile claimed responsibility 
for a string of bombings in northern spain that damaged seven 
french firms and ripped up tracks along a railway line sunday 
the spokesman for the civil governors office said a caller 
speaking on behalf of the separatist group terra lliure told a 
local radio station the group had planted the bomb in el rabal 
because the bar had been a hangout for heroin dealers the 
spokesman demanded anonymity 
this year at least 100 people have died of heroin overdoses in 
spain 25 of them in barcelona 
police say the deaths are due to an abrupt increase in the 
purity of the heroin they blame international traffickers who are 
offering a highquality product to capture a wider share of the 
spanish market 
terra lliure stands for free land in the catalan language and 
supports independence for the fourprovince region of catalonia of 
which barcelona is the capital

language claimed responsibility for sundays bombings in a note to 
the daily newspaper egin

its attacks which have killed more than 600 people mostly 
police civil guard and military officers since the group took up 
arms in 1968

both sides in a strike involving 2000 
nurses hailed a tentative agreement reached thursday that would 
provide a 20 percent wage hike over three years and boost top 
annual pay for some nurses to 50000 
overall its a good solid contract and its one of the best 
contracts in the country said maureen anderson spokeswoman for 
the california nurses association 
were obviously very very pleased said karen henry chief 
negotiator for affiliated hospitals which represents the six 
hospitals that were struck 
the ninenurse negotiating team recommended union members 
approve the contract but anderson noted the vote was not 
unanimous a ratification vote was scheduled friday 
if the agreement is ratified nurses would end the twoweekold 
strike and return to work monday at st francis childrens 
marshal hale st marys and mount zion hospitals in francisco and 
seton medical center in daly city 
ratification by the nurses also would send about 1700 hospital 
service workers honoring the strike back to work striking licensed 
vocational nurses technicians dietary and housekeeping workers 
represented by local 250 of the hospital and health care workers 
union this week approved a new contract that ended their threeweek 
strike 
however they continued to honor picket lines at the six 
hospitals and at another hospital until the nurses settled their 
dispute 
under the proposed contract nurses would receive a 75 percent 
increase retroactive to aug 1 a 65 percent increase in august 
1989 and a 6 percent hike in august 1990 nurses with 10 and 15 
years experience would get an additional 2 percent hike 
a fulltime nightshift nurse with five years experience would 
earn 50000 by 1990 said anderson a similar nurse on the 
dayshift would earn 43541 by the final year of the contract

that hospital operations can return to normal as soon as 
possible said john g williams president of the affiliated 
hospitals board of directors and chief executive officer of st

defense secretary frank c carlucci was 
expected to accept the finding of military investigators that human 
error led the uss vincennes to mistakenly shoot down an iranian 
airliner on july 3 pentagon sources said thursday 
president reagan earlier said the united states accepted 
responsibility for the tragedy and was willing to compensate the 
families of the 290 people killed in the incident although many 
members of congress have expressed reluctance to make such payments 
the announcement by carlucci expected as early as friday would 
mark the first public acknowledgement by the pentagon that the loss 
of life was caused by us servicemen rather than an equipment 
failure or specific action taken by iran 
the report implicitly ascribes some blame for the incident on 
iran however by noting that since the tragedy iran has changed 
the manner in which its civilian aircraft operate over the persian 
gulf climbing to 25000 feet while over land the sources said 
in the past iranian civilian aircraft including the a300 
airbus reached 25000 feet as they travelled over the gulf itself 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said military 
investigators found that radar operators aboard the vincennes 
misread data and mistakenly identified the airliner as hostile 
the error stemmed from pressure on members of a crew facing 
their first experience in combat as well as confusing behavior by 
the iranian airliner said the sources 
the report was expected to differ with comments made on the day 
of the tragedy by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm 
willam crowe in finding that the plane was ascending or levelling 
off when it was hit and that it was in a civilian air corridor 
rather than outside it the sources said 
abc news said thursday evening that the report contradicts 
earlier pentagon claims that the airbus was putting out two 
identification signals one civilian and the other military 
instead it said the airliners transponder was transmitting only 
civilian signals and the military signals picked up by the 
vincennes came from a distant plane 
the report was expected to be consistent with crowes comment 
that the vincennes mistook the a300 airbus for an f14 fighter in 
part because the jet took off from a joint militarycivilian 
airfield minutes after the vincennes ended a surface engagement 
with iranian gunboats the sources said 
some mysteries remain why the airliner flew into a combat area 
and why it ignored repeated broadcast warnings by the vincennes 
in earlier versions of the report senior us military 
officials recommended that the servicemen responsible for the error 
not be punished it was not clear whether carlucci would take more 
drastic action according to the pentagon sources 
crowe who passed the report up the chain of command to 
carlucci recommended that the servicemen receive a nonpunitive 
letter of censure in their files a step that might damage their 
careers the sources said 
there was no indication that the pentagon would formally censure 
the commander of the vincennes capt will c rogers iii 
the investigation was carried out by rear adm william fogarty 
then given to gen george crist the commander of us forces in 
the persian gulf and then went to crowe for carlucci 
sources said that the report itself was about 70 pages long 
with an additional 1000 pages of documentation gathered by fogarty 
and his team 
the report is said to exonerate the sophisticated aegis radar 
and tracking system aboard the vincennes one of the most advanced 
ships in the navy

republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf on 
thursday attributed the controversy over vice presidential nominee 
dan quayles military service to the fact that quayle was a 
surprise candidate to the news media 
ive never see anything like it fahrenkopf said in an 
interview its almost like one reporter would talk to another 
reporter and they would come and ask another question it was like 
dominoes going down among the press 
it just started taking off and it had a life of its own 
saying that he was going to be removed from the ticket thats not 
the case 
i was with the vice president this morning between 9 am and 
10 am at that time he said he was firmly in support of the 
ticket and of dan quayle and this would all pass and at a luncheon 
he said it again later in the afternoon i was with him at no time 
was there any question yet the press was running around like it 
was a given fact 
so its just part of the convention process and a part of a 
candidate who was a surprise being named and people starting to 
look into his background

an injury victim has no right to sue the 
other partys insurance company for dragging out payments the 
california supreme court ruled thursday overturning a 
multimilliondollar 1979 decision 
the 52 decision bans such lawsuits in the future once the 
ruling becomes final it allows pending cases to continue but 
limits them severely by requiring proof of the wrongdoers 
liability before the insurer can be sued a restriction that 
eliminates most cases which are settled without an admission of 
liability 
a 1979 ruling in the royal globe case allowed an injury victim 
to sue the other sides insurance company for violating laws 
requiring claims to be handled in good faith with claims paid 
promptly once liability is clear 
such lawsuits often carry punitive damage awards far higher than 
the insurance benefits involved supporters viewed the lawsuits as 
a way to enforce the states largely toothless laws regulating 
insurers opponents in the insurance industry said the lawsuits 
were a form of legal intimidation and drove up insurance rates 
thursdays majority opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas said 
the royal globe ruling has generated and will continue to produce 
inequitable results costly multiple litigation and unnecessary 
confusion unless we overrule it 
in dissent justice stanley mosk the author of the royal globe 
decision said the court had replaced royal globe with a royal 
bonanza for insurance carriers total immunity for unfair and 
deceptive practices committed on innocent claimants 
the lawsuit involved parveni moradishalal who was hit by a car 
driven by a firemans fund insurance policyholder in 1983 her 
750000 lawsuit said the company made no effort to settle the 
policy claim for several months after being asked it settled five 
months after she sued the driver 
the high court dismissed her lawsuit saying it was not based on 
a determination by a judge that the other driver was liable for the 
accident

sen christopher dodd dconn said 
he received assurances thursday from the leftist sandinista 
government it will extend indefinitely a ceasefire with the 
usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
dodd made a brief stop thursday in nicaragua and met with 
president daniel ortega and his brother defense minister humberto 
ortega 
there are no preconditions on talks with the rebels known 
as contras dodd said at augusto cesar sandino airport shortly 
before leaving they said they would extend it the ceasefire 
indefinitely 
the sandinistas and contras signed an agreement march 23 to seek 
a negotiated settlement to the 7yearold war both sides suspended 
offensive military operations on march 21 the start of the talks 
highlevel talks broke off june 9 and each side charged the 
other with breaking the ceasefire which the sandinistas have been 
extending on a monthly basis the current ceasefire was due to 
expire aug 31 
ortega on thursday renewed his call for a new round of talks to 
take place in managua on aug 26 the rebels citing restrictions 
on their freedom of movement have said they will not return to the 
capital and asked the president to take part in any future 
discussions 
dodd said he discussed with the sandinistas the latest us 
senate package to provide humanitarian aid to the contras 
obviously they are not happy dodd said adding that the 
possibility of renewed us military aid to the rebels was very 
open and that the government should know about that 
the united states has backed the contras in their battle to 
overthrow the sandinistas since 1981 almost two years after the 
new government came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war 
us military aid for the rebels expired in february on aug 
10 the senate voted for a democratic proposal to provide the 
contras with 27 million in nonlethal humanitarian aid after oct

election of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
i have hope that if dukakis wins that the relations between

michael dukakis ventured into an 
historic baptist church in the deep south on thursday to ask black 
voters to join him in resolving that we will not rest until every 
form of bigotry and racism and religious intolerance is banished 
from this land 
the democratic presidential nominee promised the predominantly 
black congregation at the sixth avenue baptist church to reverse 
the indifference and blind eye of the reagan administration 
after eight long years this nation needs a president and a 
vice president who understand that civil rigths can never be a 
sometime thing said dukakis who was warmly received at the 
birmingham church 
the massachusetts governor came to alabama from miami where he 
termed the reaganbush war against drugs an illusion 
dukakis accused president reagan of stonewalling an 
investigation of panamanian leader manuel antonio noriegas alleged 
involvement in drug trafficking and said vice president george 
bushs antidrug efforts was a failure 
this war against drugs is nonexistent he told reporters 
dukakis said little about the controversy over gop vice 
presidential candidate dan quayles vietnamera service in the 
national guard 
some black leaders including jesse jackson had criticized 
dukakis for not using a recent appearance in mississippi to outline 
his views on minority concerns on thursday he cited a long list 
of problems demanding solutions including a lack of affordable 
housing job training prenatal care quality schools and antidrug 
programs 
we can remain frozen in the ice of our own indifference or we 
can invest in the prenatal care and early childhood education that 
will give every child in america a healthy start and a fair shot at 
the american dream dukakis told the congregation at the sixth 
avenue baptist church 
dukakis paid tribute to four young girls who were killed 25 
years ago in a racial bombing at a nearby black church 
we can turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took 
place or we can provide the moral leadership we need to banish 
racial and religious violence forever in this country he said 
and that leadership must begin in the white house 
dukakis saluted martin luther king jr jackson alabamas rosa 
parks and other civil rights leaders 
i am proud to be here tonight with hundreds of brave men and 
women in this congregation who have marched and fought and 
struggled against all odds to create a better world not only for 
your children but for all children everywhere dukakis said 
those of you who fought and struggled are true american 
heroes and while your names may not appear in history books you 
have made history 
he added what better time than now to resolve that we will 
not rest until every form of bigotry and racism and religious 
intolerance is banished from this land 
dukakis himself sought to steer clear of the controversy over 
whether quayle joined the indiana national guard to avoid combat 
duty in vietnam 
dukakis said however that he was proud to have served in korea 
in the aftermath of the korean war dukakis aides though pointed 
to the controversy to question bushs judgment in picking quayle 
dukakis congratulated bush on winning the republican 
presidential nomination and then harshly criticized reagans order 
wednesday that the state and defense departments and the cia not 
cooperate with a congressional investigation of noreigas alleged 
drug ties 
if were serious about fighting the war on drugs we cant 
have any stonewalling from the federal government or the white 
house dukakis said before he headed for campaign appearances in 
alabama 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress is trying to determine when us intelligence agencies 
first suspected noriega of involvement in drug trafficking and when 
bush and other administration officials were alerted 
i think the white house does not want to cooperate because 
they are embarrassed by this they should be embarrassed by this 
dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor was asked whether if elected 
president he would put his vice president in charge of antidrug 
efforts he replied that he would appoint a fulltime drug czar 
directly accountable to the president 
he noted that bush had served in that role as vice president 
it was a failure dukakis said whats the point of 
repeating failure 
dukakis at first refused comment when asked whether quayle 
should have enlisted for active duty in the military in 1969 
instead of entering the indiana nationl guard 
pressed on the issue dukakis said 
i can only speak for myself i served my country i did so 
proudly it was an important issue in my life i can only speak for 
myself 
touring the marshall space flight center at huntsville ala 
dukakis declared his support for the multibilliondollar space 
station program he also promised to revive the national space 
council a cabinetlevel agency that oversaw the us space program 
before it was abolished by president nixon 
in recent years our space program has lost the sense of 
purpose that made it such a source of accomplishment and pride 
dukakis said at huntsville 
we are no longer the unquestioned leader in space he said 
some have begun to doubt our ability to compete in this vast new 
frontier i dont buy that at all and i hope you dont either 
dukakis planned to spend the night at st louis and campaign 
friday in missouri illinois arkansas and texas his saturday 
schedule includes appearances in texas and tennessee

here is a transcript of the speech by sen 
bob dole of kansas nominating sen dan quayle of indiana for vice 
president at the republican national convention on thursday night 
thank you thank you 
mr chairman four of my congressional colleagues and i are here 
for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the united 
states 
we are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the 
republican party a man i am proud to say is my colleague the 
junior senator from indiana dan quayle 
you know senators get a lot of mail party leaders more than 
most and almost every one of these letters asks for help with some 
problem 
well three years ago i received a handwritten plea from a 
6yearold girl who after several days of long long senate 
sessions had a very special problem 
she wrote and i quote i have my secondgrade play tonight 
please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me 
i knew corinne quayle was from a political family because she 
invited me to come along too 
corinne and her brothers tucker and benjamin and their mother 
marilyn share dan quayle with the people of indiana and the united 
states senate 
dan quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family 
man 
and whenever i needed him whenever i needed him dan was there 
ready and willing to make the tough choices to cast the tough 
votes to transform president reagans vision of america into the 
law of the land 
whether it was the budget or defense tax reform or the inf 
treaty dan quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch 
supporter of the reagan revolution and now he is ready to carry 
that revolution forward 
and believe me he is ready and just let the democrats try to 
use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign just let them 
try 
now i dont mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks 
experience hes got plenty of experience plenty of experience 
experience in raising taxes again and again experience in vetoing 
the pledge of allegiance in public schools experience in 
increasing spending year after year after year in massachusetts 
and i just dont believe the american people want that kind of 
experience in the white house 
it sounds like a dukakeyed idea to me 
but dan quayles got experience too hes already spent 12 
years as a congressman and a senator tackling the vital national 
and international issues that affect the lives of all americans and 
the future of our country 
that is 12 more years of national experience than michael 
dukakis and he is running for president 
as i said at the start dan quayle is a man i know and trust i 
am honored to nominate him for vice president mr chairman 
and for the purpose of debate only i yield the balance of my 
time to the outstanding distinguished senior from indiana my good 
friend sen dick lugar

a new american medical association report 
concludes that only two chemicals used previously in pesticides are 
known to cause cancer in humans but an occupational health expert 
thursday called that finding questionable 
the report was written by the amas council on scientific 
affairs to inform physicians about the potential hazards of 
pesticides particularly as they affect farmers and other workers 
who come in frequent contact with them 
after reviewing the medical literature on the topic the 
reports authors concluded only the chemicals arsenic and vinyl 
chloride have been proven to cause cancer in humans 
vinyl chloride was used previously as an aerosol propellant but 
was removed from all pesticides more than a decade ago the use of 
arsenic in pesticides once common has dropped off considerably 
although it is now used in wood preservative 
the council report published in fridays journal of the ama 
said delayed health effects of pesticides on humans have been 
difficult to detect and called on the federal environmental 
protection agency to work harder to identify dangerous substances 
and eliminate them from the environment and the workplace 
it also acknowledged that many chemicals used in pesticides have 
been shown to cause genetic damage or cancer in animal and 
laboratory tests but said such tests are not reliably predictive 
of human carcinogenicity 
the authors concluded that the primary hazard of pesticide 
exposure is severe shortterm reactions to touching or inhaling 
very large amounts 
but samuel epstein professor of occupational and environmental 
medicine at the university of illinoischicago and a nationally 
recognized expert on toxic chemicals called the authors positions 
extreme 
the report fails to recognize an overwhelming consensus in the 
informed independent scientific literature as well as a wide range 
of national and international experts who believe that information 
derived from valid welldesigned animal carcinogencity tests 
creates a strong presumption of cancer risk to humans he said 
to dismiss such data pending confirmation in human studies is 
nothing short of irresponsible it took multimilliondollar 
research involving millions of subjects before evidence of the 
carcinogenicity of tobacco obtained in animal studies could be 
confirmed in humans epstein added 
ama spokesman dr alan engelberg defended the councils report 
saying medical literature on the subject is frequently conflicting 
this is a muddy area all the results arent in and thats 
why were calling for more study he said sometimes that 
looks like a smokescreen but very little is clear at this time 
epstein said the report also failed to address the fact that 
many pesticides producea wide range of other toxic effects in 
workers such as sterility 
and nowhere is there any mention of risk to homeowners 
concluded epstein people often dump a lot of this stuff on their 
lawns and there is a complete failure to discuss it 
but john mccarthy spokesman for the national agricultural 
chemicals association which represents pesticide manufacturers 
responded if its not an obvious problem with occupational 
exposure and thats what the study is saying it makes no sense 
that it would be a problem outside that group

here is a transcript of remarks by barbara 
bush to the republican national convention thursday night 
thank you i think youre about as happy tonight as i am and 
thank you my dear friend louis sullivan for that very kind 
introduction 
and thank all of you for that warm welcome 
you know ive always felt i was the worlds luckiest woman now 
i know it im married to an extraordinarily special man i have 
five well happy doing children all of whom married wonderful 
people and 10plus perfect grandchildren 
i have caring loyal friends such as yourselves 
ive had the opportunity to work for a more literate america 
and i care deeply about other problems such as leukemia the 
homeless and many other problems facing us 
you know ive loved george bush almost since the day i laid 
eyes on him now i realize that wont get him a lot of votes so 
let me explain why i respect him 
first of all george was always there when the children needed 
him 
by now you may be getting tired of hearing all the important 
jobs george has held and he has all those jobs have demanded 
tremendous energy and commitment from him 
but do you know what i respect about george in spite of all 
those jobs our family has always felt an enormous part of his 
life the children and i have always felt as important as the work 
he was doing and this has given our children confidence 
i remember i called george one day when the boys were small and 
i said im desperate i dont know what to do your sons in 
trouble again he just hit a ball through the neighbors upstairs 
window 
and george said wow what a hit and then he said did 
you get the ball back 
a reporter once asked what his proudest accomplishment was and 
he paused a moment and then said our kids still come home he 
meant it 
george is always there when someone needs him 
i wont give you great detail but let me give you an example 
once when he is business my husband had to fire a man who was 
an alcoholic he didnt pass this painful task off to someone else 
he did it himself 
but george just didnt fire the man first as support he went 
with him to tell his wife and she said thank heavens for 10 
years i have worried and wondered why no one knew it was as if a 
burden had been lifted from her 
and then do you know what george did he attended aa meetings 
with the man and today that man is a friend and supporter of my 
husbands he may be in the audience tonight 
george has always been there when i needed him too 
the hardest thing we ever faced together was the loss of a 
child i was very strong over the months we were trying to save 
her at least i thought i was maybe i was just pretending 
but when she was gone i fell apart but george wouldnt let me 
retreat into my grief he held me in his arms and he made me share 
it and accept that his sorrow was as great as my own 
he simply wouldnt allow my grief to divide us apart push us 
apart which is what happens so often when theres a loss like that 
as long as i live i will respect my husband for the strength of 
his understanding 
i guess what im really trying to say to each of you here 
tonight is that you should feel proud of what youve done at this 
convention 
and what youve done is this youve nominated for the 
presidency of the united states a man who is as strong and caring 
and decent as america herself 
thank you very very much

here is a transcript of remarks by illinois 
gov james thompson introducing vice president george bush at the 
republican national convention thursday night 
mr chairman my fellow republicans my fellow americans 
the nomination of a candidate for the office of president of the 
united states is more than the tribal roar in a convention hall 
more than the sum total of cold caucus days in the dead of winter 
on the prairie or in the mountains more than the raucous shouts 
and endless images of primary trails across a nation 
the presidential nomination of a political party represents more 
than the singular and personal triumph of one leaders voice amidst 
the chorus of philosophy and alliances and loyalties 
more than this the nomination of our presidential candidate 
defines the soul of our party and the character and common sense of 
the campaign which we now bring to the nation so that our fellow 
americans whose allegiance and approval we want may know who we 
are it is imperative that they know who george bush the man and 
the leader is 
the american people understand the triumph of the reaganbush 
years when america regained her voice and place in the world 
when an economy in shambles was rescued and revived when american 
competitiveness was brought back 
the american people understand that the world is a more peaceful 
place today because the reaganbush team brought those who used to 
bristle behind their missiles to the bargaining table so that 
generations of our children and grandchildren could live in peace 
the american people are grateful to ronald reagan and george 
bush for this and for much more but that is not what this election 
is about this election is about the future 
the george bush that i know believes that as we strengthen our 
economy we must not let the engines of that economy despoil our 
land and our air and our water the george bush that i know loves 
this land of ours and a bush administration will protect it 
the george bush that i know believes that the future begins with 
family he has always been sustained and strengthened by his 
family 
the george bush that i know wants hope and opportunity for all 
the children of america the chance to learn and the opportunity to 
earn to make their way in a world of equality but he knows that 
what government does is not a substitute for what goodhearted 
people can do with encouragement and selfhelp 
the other candidate for president believes that a new government 
bureaucracy can best tell us how to and where to care for our 
children but george bush believes that the american family and the 
american neighbor and the american church know best how to care for 
our children 
and the george bush that i know believes that freedom from 
criminals is more important than freedom for criminals 
the george bush that i know seeks peace but george bush knows 
that america cannot hide behind its own borders without the risk of 
the toxic waste of unchallenged tyranny may someday wash up on our 
shores if we shrink from defending freedom anywhere in the world 
maybe you dont need to be shot from the skies at the age of 20 
in the defense of your country or run the spies and the spooks 
from langley to know that its a dangerous world from decade to 
decade but my guess is it sure helped george bush knows that we 
have to be brave and strong and daring but we have to be 
careful out there 
my fellow republicans lets take a closer look at americas 
best hope for progress without risk for change and for growth 
without destruction of the accomplishments we have gained and the 
values that hold us together all of us as americans

chinas top communist party leaders have agreed 
on a fiveyear plan to press forward with price and wage reform 
reduce bureaucratic interference in business and attack public 
corruption and waste 
the tentative plan on price and wage reforms was passed at a 
threeday meeting this week of the politburo the partys top 
decisionmaking body 
the official xinhua news agency reported thursday the meeting 
was held at the coastal resort of beidaihe with general secretary 
zhao ziyang presiding 
the plan also called for strict measures next year to bring 
inflation under control especially by reining in spending in 
unauthorized new buildings and other capital construction 
details of the plan were not provided but it appeared to 
represent solid support for zhao ziyang and others who advocate 
more aggressive steps to reform chinas inefficient economy by 
shifting to a more marketoriented economic system 
speculation has arisen that zhao is encountering resistance from 
economic conservatives who feel the reforms are moving too fast 
creating unacceptable levels of inflation and fostering social 
instability 
chinas economy is full of vitality and is developing 
vigorously xinhua said the time is favorable to the price and 
wage reforms 
inflation the first half of the year approached 20 percent 
partly as a result of the loosening of price controls and 
producers inability to meet rising consumer demand 
xinhua said that in the next five years the state will continue 
to control prices of a few important commodities and labor but will 
liberalize prices for most goods and subject them to market 
regulation 
price reform will focus on correcting those exceptionally 
irrational problems in prices which seriously hamper the economic 
development and the growth of markets it said 
the report said the overall objective of wage reform is to see 
that the living standards of most wage earners do not drop 
the government acknowledged that last year when the inflation 
rate was said to be 73 percent about 20 percent of urban wage 
earners reported a decline in their living standards 
chinese sources said this week that china will soon give its 
workers large raises and link further pay increases to the 
inflation rate one source said the average worker who now takes 
home 910 yuan 246 a year will soon get an extra 30 yuan a 
month equal to a 28 percent raise 
the 17 politburo members at the meeting agreed that revamping 
chinas economic system was crucial to success in price and wage 
reforms 
a key goal for 1989 according to the plan will be to raise 
economic efficiency by making enterprise managers responsible for 
their profits and losses and by strengthening markets 
in a meeting with japanese journalists at beidaihe tuesday zhao 
said the government will give priority to enterprise reform he 
said the key to better efficiency lies in making all enterprises 
compete for markets promoting the better ones and eliminating the 
inferior ones communist chinas first bankruptcy law which draws 
up rules for the closure of losing businesses will go into effect 
nov 1 
china will also forge ahead with reform of its political system 
including the separation of party and government functions and the 
running of businesses xinhua said 
also in 1989 the government will reduce the purchasing power of 
government and semiofficial groups while taking tough measures 
to counter extravagance and waste to keep the party and government 
organizations honest the agency reported 
authorities will crack down on embezzlers bribetakers seekers 
of exorbitant profits speculators hoarders and those who impose 
economic blockades or local protectionism 
chinas current pricing system with its artificially low 
ceilings on the prices of many raw materials and food items has 
led to widespread corruption among officials who seize large 
quantities of hardtoobtain goods and sell them at far higher 
prices on free markets or the black market 
xinhua said the politburo at an earlier meeting decided to draw 
up the price and wage reform plan and on june 2 the party central 
committee formed groups of experts to study the matter 
the state council or cabinet discussed the plan at an aug 59 
meeting 
xinhua said the party central committee will take up the plan 
again at its full session next month 
zhao told the japanese journalists the plan will be ready for 
implementation by the beginning of 1989

before an uproarious republican national 
convention george bush claimed the presidential nomination 
thursday with a declaration that the election is a choice between 
two very different ideas of the future america as a rising 
nation or one in decline 
in remarks to the conventions closing session bush described 
himself as the underdog determined to run hard to fight hard to 
stand on the issues 
they call it a swiss cheese economy he said of his 
democratic opponents well thats the way it might look to the 
three blind mice but when they were in charge it was all holes 
and no cheese 
bush chuckled when some began singing three blind mice 
bush also addressed the desire for change after nearly eight 
years of the reagan presidency a desire the vice presidents 
campaign advisers believe is one of his biggest hurdles 
but when you have to change horses in midstream doesnt it 
make sense to switch to one whos going the same way he asked 
the new presidential nominee closed his speech by asking the 
delegates to stand and join him in reciting the pledge of 
allegiance to the flag 
his wife barbara was the first to join bush on the podium 
they kissed and then turned and faced the roaring crowd then came 
the four bush sons and a daughter and 10 grandchildren 
the vice presidential nominee indiana sen dan quayle his 
wife marilyn and their children joined the bush family on the 
podium 
it was the scene bush had promised the previous day when he said 
he would drop his reluctance to put his family in the spotlight 
for 10 minutes it was only family then the politicians joined 
them the men whom bush defeated in the fight for the nomination 
sen bob dole of kansas former gov pete du pont of delaware rep 
jack kemp of new york and television evangelist pat robertson 
thousands of red white and blue balloons and flakes of confetti 
drifted down on the celebrating crowd 
the demonstration died down after 15 minutes 
bush was introduced by gov jim thompson of illinois and by a 
videotape that showed him shaking hands with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev as well as playing with one of his granddaughters 
also featured on the video was president reagan saying i 
trust george bush america can trust him too 
the huge hall erupted into cheers and flagwaving with the 
announcement ladies and gentlemen the vice president of the 
united states and bush strode alone to the podium 
hundreds of young people who had filed into the hall during the 
video fueled the demonstration which went on for seven minutes 
it was a night bush had awaited for eight years ever since the 
1980 campaign when he lost out to reagan and ended up with the 
partys vice presidential candidate 
barbara bush watched her husbands speech from the vip box 
where she sat between the rev billy graham and greek orthodox 
archbishop iacavos also seated in the box were the vice 
presidential nominee indiana sen dan quayle and his family 
in his acceptance speech the vice president cited campaign 
themes of his democratic opponent michael dukakis and tried to 
turn them to his advantage 
some say this isnt an election about ideology its an 
election about competence said bush a reference to dukakis 
speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination 
but this election isnt only about competence for competence 
is a narrow idea said the republican nominee competence makes 
the trains run on time but doesnt know where theyre going 
on jobs he said someone better take a message to michael 
tell him weve been creating good jobs at good wages the need to 
create good jobs at good wages is a favorite dukakis campaign 
theme 
bush conceded that i may not be the most eloquent i may 
sometimes be a little awkward but theres nothing selfconscious 
in my love of country i am a quiet man but i hear the quiet 
people others dont the ones who raise the family pay the taxes 
meet the mortgage 
i hear them and i am moved and their concerns are mine 
he praised his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana under 
fire over his national guard service at a time when many draftees 
were being sent to vietnam 
he caled quayle a young leader who has become a forceful in 
preparing americas workers for the labor force of the future 
im proud to have dan quayle at my side 
paying tribute to president reagan bush said he spent the last 
7 years helping a president conduct the most difficult job on 
earth 
ronald reagan asked for and received my candor he never 
asked for but he did receive my loyalty 
but the time had come he said when you must see me as i am 
the republican candidate for president of the united states 
he said the election was between not only two very different 
men but two very different ideas of the future 
my opponents view of the world sees a long slow decline for 
our country an inevitable fall mandated by impersonal historical 
forces 
but america is not in decline america is a rising nation 
he said he and dukakis have contrasting views on such questions 
as whether the pledge of allegiance should be required in the 
schools on school prayer the death penalty gun control abortion 
and taxes 
bush vowed to do whatever it takes to make the sure the 
disabled are included in the mainstream 
he pledged to stop ocean dumping and said our beaches should 
not be garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools 
bush said he would order the fbi to find out who was responsible 
for the recent dumping of medical waste that washed up on beaches 
in new york and new jersey 
he repeated his call for tougher ethical standards saying 
there are those who have dropped their standards along the way 
as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top he 
made no direct reference to the reagan administration officials 
accused of ethical violations 
earlier in the day bush appeared at a tribute to his wife 
barbara and said that he was told youve got to be a little more 
demonstrative after seeing michael dukakis and his wife kitty 
openly display their affection toward each other at the democratic 
convention in july 
recently bush has often said that he is not given to public 
displays of affection or emotion 
here we go he said looking at his wife who was seated to 
his right the introduction with feeling 
come on up sweetie pie 
with that mrs bush stepped forward and they hugged 
thank you very very much sweetie he said 
then she told the audience i hope you dont take your eyes 
off him and see if he looks at me adoringly

here are excerpts from a transcript of the 
speech by sen dan quayle of indiana to the republican national 
convention on thursday night as he accepted the partys vice 
presidential nomination 
mr chairman fellow republicans i accept your nomination 
for vice president of the united states of america 
since 1980 i have been a united states senator from indiana 
and very proud of it before that i was a member of the united 
states house of representatives and proud of it and as a young 
man i served six years in the national guard and like millions 
of americans who have served in the guard and who serve today and 
i am proud of that 
i would have been quite happy spending my life in 
huntington in the newspaper business watching my kids grow 
seeing a community with plenty of opportunity to go around but i 
looked around me in the mid70s and i saw threats to the future of 
my family and to the values that could once be taken for granted in 
our country 
beyond my town there were communities torn by crime and drugs 
and there were neighborhoods where the very word opportunity 
didnt exist because there were no jobs 
i decided to try to change these things to make opportunity 
replace despair and to make the future just as good as the past 
for the families of the many huntingtons of great our land 
that was 1976 when i was first elected to the house of 
representatives in those jimmy carter years the people 
running things thought government was the answer instead of part 
of the problem they thought high taxes and big spending would 
solve anything i think you know the rest none of their policies 
worked and the american people knew it 
we do not need the future the democratic party sees the 
party of george mcgovern jimmy carter walter mondale crowd 
boos just wait it gets better ted kennedy and now his 
buddy michael dukakis that future has america in retreat that 
future has higher taxes and a guaranteed loss of job opportunities 
and that future has more government intervention in the lives of 
all of us 
the future under george bush means peace and economic 
opportunity for all 
i am privileged to be the first person of my generation to 
be on a national ticket i dont presume to talk for everyone of my 
generation but i know that a great many will agree with me when i 
express my thanks to the generation of george bush for bringing us 
to an era of peace and freedom and opportunity 
my generation has a profound debt to them we will pay it by 
making sure that our children and the generations that follow will 
have the same freedom the same family values and a future bright 
with opportunity for all 
thank you very much good night god bless you lets go on to 
victory

the main iranian rebel group claimed 
thursday the government in tehran has executed thousands of its 
activists and supporters in recent weeks and secretly buried them 
in mass graves 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors said in a 
statement telexed from its headquarters in baghdad capital of 
iraq that most of those killed had spent years in prison 
it added that hundreds of civilians in western iran were 
publicly hanged for supporting rebel forces that pushed into the 
region from bases in iraq last month 
there was no independent confirmation of the claim which the 
mujahedeen khalq said was based on reliable reports from iran 
but the financial times of london reported from tehran on wednesday 
that systematic executions of leftwing prisoners had been 
carried out since april 
edward mortimer the correspondent said the executions 
accelerated after the mujahedeen khalqs national liberation army 
of iran moved into western iran after iran announced july 18 that 
it would accept a un security council ceasefire resolution 
mortimer said families of executed prisoners wre jamming behesht 
zahra cemetery in tehran where the slain were buried in special 
plots he said 58 bodies were buried between july 27 and aug 10 
some iranian leaders including chief justice mussavi ardebili 
publicly demanded that imprisoned rebels be executed 
ardebili said on tehran radio aug 5 there is no need for any 
trial the crime is clear and the punishment is also clear i 
pray to god that all of them are destroyed 
irans former revolutionary prosecutor habib ladjevardi 
criticized authorities recently for showing clemency to political 
prisoners who repented ladjevardi helped send hundreds of alleged 
government opponents to their deaths 
the mujahedeen statement said iranian authorities carried out 
the mass executions in retaliation for widespread support given the 
rebel invaders 
it said the governments purpose is to slow down the process 
of its inevitable overthrow a process that has accelerated in the 
wake of the regimes acceptance of the ceasefire 
according to the financial times another reason for the 
executions was an official desire to placate angry radicals after 
the ceasefire 
both the paper and the mujahedeen statement said executions were 
most numerous in kerend in southwest iran where townspeople 
welcomed the invaders 
attacks by liberation army into western iran have increased in 
recent months and iranian leaders have publicly acknowledged rebel 
incursions 
iran claimed the army killed 4800 rebels last month and drove 
the rest back into iraq its official islamic republic news agency 
reported in recent days that scores of captured mujahedeen fighters 
were publicly hanged in several western towns 
another iranian opposition group the outlawed promoscow tudeh 
communist party said group after group of mujahedeen 
activists political prisoners and collaborators were executed 
in the past month 
the mujahedeen khalq was allies of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
in the islamic revolution that ousted the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi in february 1979 but the fundamentalists later turned on 
the mujahedeen and other leftist and liberal factions 
in its latest statement the rebel group said about 70000 
people have been executed in iran since khomeinis revolution 
amnesty international the human rights group based in london 
lists about 6000 but says it believes the true figure is much 
higher

democrat michael dukakis socialist 
agenda could wreck the us economy former arizona gov evan 
mecham told a conservative youth group wednesday 
the former governor also told the mostly collegeage young 
americans for freedom he might try to win back the office he lost 
through impeachment conviction in april 
responding to questions mecham a george bush delegate to the 
republican national convention acknowledged that many people were 
not enthused about the prospect of a bush presidency 
i suggest that they look at the alternative of absolute 
disaster that would be wrought upon america and the world by a 
dukakis presidency mecham said 
i assure you that the dukakis socialist agenda will so 
unsettle investor confidence that it will wreak havoc on our 
economy in unprecedented proportions he said 
later mecham told reporters he might seek to regain the 
governorship in 1992 if there wasnt somebody better to run that 
i could support 
mecham was convicted on impeachment charges of misusing 80000 
from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto

republican fundraisers facing true 
competition from their democratic counterparts for the first time 
in decades are striking back this week by trying to raise 4 
million at one event 
were concerned about it said fred bush chief fundraiser 
of vice president george bushs campaign there seems to be a lot 
of interest in fund raising on the democratic side ive never seen 
that before 
fred bush no relation to the vice president is squaring off 
against vaunted democratic money man robert farmer who has pledged 
to raise 50 million for democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis effort in the fall campaign 
it remains to be seen if farmer can deliver that sum would be 
unprecedented for a democrat but he has succeeded in instilling 
newfound fervor in republican campaign donors 
our guys understand they know whats going on out there 
fred bush said in an interview this week a lot of them have come 
to us and said i dont want the democrats to beat us on fund 
raising what can i do 
for one thing they can attend a 1000perplate lunch at the 
city convention center on thursday to benefit the republican 
national committee the goal is 4 million compared to 25 
million at the dallas gala in 1984 
its our one big gala every year said rnc spokeswoman 
katherine murray its an opportunity for us to honor the new 
nominee and vice presidential nominee its a celebration of our 
all being here together 
its also a chance for corporations to get in good with the gop 
by reserving tables at 100000 each and its a way for the 
republicans to stroke their wealthy supporters with a personal 
appearance by the nominee 
but thursdays lunch is by no means the only event for 
fundraisers this week more than 600 contributors of 10000plus 
are in town fred bush said and theyre being treated to a full 
plate of parties and receptions 
theres also some hard business a 1hour meeting for about 200 
top fundraisers to organize gop efforts in each state with 
campaign chairman james baker as host of the event 
so far the republicans have done well at raising money fred 
bush said the republicans already have collected the 83 million 
limit to supplement the bush campaigns federal financing of 46 
million about 7 million of a 25 million goal for state party 
accounts to be spent in coordination with the presidential 
campaign and several million more for general partybuilding a 
separate item is the rncs operating budget beneficiary of 
thursdays gala 
our goal is to keep pace with the democrats said fred bush 
all this big money theyre raising were trying to do it too

democrat michael dukakis on wednesday 
criticized republicans for using their convention for a trip down 
memory lane while ignoring gop policies that have hurt american 
families and failed to help economically depressed regions 
dukakis during a lakefront rally on minnesotas iron range 
also touted the qualifications of his running mate texas sen 
lloyd bentsen and implied that indiana sen dan quayle the 
certain republican vice presidential nominee was not qualified to 
be president 
nobody ever asked any questions about whether lloyd bentsen 
was qualified to be president of the united states dukakis said 
a day after george bush tapped quayle a 41yearold conservative 
to fill out the repubican ticket 
dukakis told the rally the republicans were using their 
convention in new orleans to celebrate the reagan presidency 
because they did not want to discuss rising interest rates the 
soaring trade and budget deficits and economic distress in the 
midwest and other parts of the country 
the republican party has been celebrating the past he said 
when you think about whats going to happen to them in november 
you cant blame them 
while theyre partying on bourbon street were talking to 
people on main street dukakis said while theyre talking 
about labels were talking about jobs while they take a trip down 
memory lane were looking to the future 
in boston the massachusetts governors campaign office issued a 
statement saying dukakis was saddened by the plane crash that 
claimed the lives of pakistani president mohammed zia ulhaq us 
ambassador to pakistan arnold l raphel and 35 others 
president zia will be remembered for his steadfast opposition 
to the soviet occupation of afghanistan and for ensuring that 3 
million afghans had a place of refuge in pakistan dukakis said 
in the statement 
dukakis on the first day of a fourday campaign trip designed 
to help him steal some of the spotlight from the gop gathering 
went to great lengths to praise bentsen 67 
referring to legislation to give workers 60 days notice before 
a plant closing dukakis told the rally weve got to have a vice 
president who led the fight and didnt oppose the fight quayle 
opposed the plantclosing measure along with reagan and bush 
reagan allowed it to became law without his signature 
at a news conference after the rally dukakis used praise of 
bentsen to criticize quayle 
i think senator bentsen is a tremendous asset to me and to the 
democratic ticket because he is so steady and so mature and has 
demonstrated a capacity for leadership dukakis said 
the democratic nominee said thats a judgment the american 
people are going to have to make when asked if he thought quayle 
was qualified to step in as president in the event of a tragedy 
but he then left little doubt about his true feelings 
i would just point out that nobody ever asked any questions 
about whether lloyd bentsen would be qualified to be president of 
the united states the massachusetts governor said 
he cited bentsens leadership in winning passage of the 
plantclosing law a major trade bill welfare reform and 
catastrophic health care legislation something dukakis referred to 
as a legislative grand slam 
among those appearing at the rally with dukakis were former vice 
president walter mondale rep james oberstar and hubert h 
skip humphrey iii minnesota attorney general and senate 
candidate 
dukakis used the event to reiterate his support for oberstars 
national economic development act which would create a fund to 
invest in economically weak areas of the country dukakis has 
endorsed spending 500 million on such a program 
prosperity in some places and depression in others is not 
acceptable said dukakis who earlier had mentioned the loss of 
8000 jobs on the iron range in the last 10 years thats 
something the republican party might want to take a look at 
the rally was interrupted for several minutes when an 
antiabortion protester screamed what about the unborn into an 
amplified bullhorn 
heres someone who wants to debate dukakis said as a secret 
service agent and several people at the rally forcibly removed the 
man from the crowd maybe we can get the vice president to 
debate 
from the iron range dukakis flew to minneapolis for a private 
fundraiser for the democratic national committee and then was 
headed to miami where he was to spend the night before addressing 
a greekamerican organizations convention 
other stops on his trip this week include alabama missouri 
illinois arkansas texas and tennessee he returns to boston on 
saturday night

a mormon who is a now highranking fbi 
official tried to destroy a hispanic agents career for racial and 
religious reasons the agent testified wednesday in a 
discrimination suit against the bureau 
sammy martinez testifying in a class action by hispanic agents 
said he was falsely accused of wrongdoing by john walser now 
executive assistant director of the fbi when walser was his boss 
in mexico city in 1986 
i know there was a contract on me martinez said explaining 
that in fbi jargon a contract means someones out to get you 
and sabotage your career 
martinez testified that he had been discriminated against and 
that he did not believe the incident would have happened were he 
nonhispanic or mormon walser did not return an associated press 
phone call to his office wednesday 
the 311 hispanic agents who have joined the lawsuit being tried 
in us district court contend the fbi discriminates against 
hispanics in hiring promoting and disciplining they want damages 
and a change in the way the fbi promotes agents and handles 
discrimination complaints 
about 400 of the fbis 9000 special agents are hispanic or 44 
percent nationally 8 percent of the population is hispanic 
martinez said walser accused him of a security violation the 
agent did not specify what it was martinez was demoted and 
assigned to los angeles a post he asked not to be assigned to 
because i knew hispanic agents there had complained about mormon 
superiors 
before martinez was transferred from mexico city he filed an 
internal equal employment opportunity complaint protesting walsers 
actions he said he found out later that the chief of the equal 
employment opportunity office mailed the confidential complaint to 
walser 
martinez said he appealed his demotion and transfer and the fbi 
did not resist he was reinstated to his previous grade and 
transferred to washington where he works in the same division as 
walser he said 
when defense attorney alan ferber reminded martinez that walser 
has adopted four mexican children and that his brotherinlaw is 
hispanic martinez said he studied mormon theology to further 
understand walser 
the book of mormon says mexicanamericans are cursed with dark 
skin and are defiled martinez said it says when they are 
brought into the church they become white and delightsome 
martinez said he believes walser is biased against hispanics 
but that he did not know whether the alleged bias is based on 
religious belief 
ferber said walser likely will be called as a defense witness 
next week in his opening arguments monday ferber prominently 
mentioned walsers adoption of four mexican children and implied it 
would be a central argument in the fbis defense 
plaintiff cocounsel hugo rodriguez said wednesday that other 
agents with complaints about mormon superiors are expected to be 
called

chinese leader zhao ziyang said the politburo was 
working on a fiveyear economic plan that would allow staterun 
enterprises more autonomy but he added that inflation threatens 
reform news reports said wednesday 
zhao general secretary of the communist party also said the 
first chinesesoviet summit meeting in three decades is possible if 
moscow first urges vietnam to withdraw its troops from cambodia 
the statement represented a softening of previous chinese stances 
vietnam has announced plans to withdraw 50000 troops half of 
its force from cambodia by the end of the year and the rest by 
early 1990 
zhaos remarks came tuesday in an interview with shinji sakai 
president of japans kyodo news service at the coastal resort of 
beidaihe they were reported wednesday by kyodo staff members who 
attended and the official chinese xinhua news agency 
zhao a leading proponent of economic reform with senior leader 
deng xiaoping said the politburo was convened monday to discuss 
the comprehensive fiveyear program the politburo is chinas 
highest decisionmaking body 
the general secretary said the package would be adopted in 
principle by the politburo and could be put into effect starting at 
the beginning of next year 
zhao said the government will give priority to reform of 
staterun enterprises giving them more independence and making 
them liable for losses the key to better efficiency lies in making 
all enterprises compete for markets promoting the better ones and 
eliminating the inferior ones he said 
chinas staterun enterprises operate under the control of local 
party officials and central planners the nations private 
enterprises already enjoy a large measure of autonomy 
zhao also told the japanese that price reform another key goal 
cannot succeed unless the economy becomes more efficient 
the government is moving to lift price controls and let prices 
be determined by market value but producers cannot keep up with 
rising demand he said the problem helped push consumer inflation 
rates to near 20 percent in the first half of the year 
whether we can in the course of reform check excessive price 
rises will be the deciding factor in whether the reform program for 
the next year is carried out smoothly zhao said sharp 
inflation could erode peoples confidence in economic reform 
the government raised interest rates on loans and savings 
accounts tuesday in an effort to discourage capital investment and 
encourage personal savings state banks have also announced they 
will curtail loans to cool off the economy which grew at an 
excessively rapid pace of 11 percent in the first half of the year 
zhao denied reports in the foreign press that the annual summer 
policy meetings at the beidaihe resort broke down in late july 
because of a split over how to handle rising prices 
we didnt even have a meeting then he said how could we 
suspend it 
the general secretary said in regard to chinesesoviet relations 
that the soviet stance on vietnams withdrawal from cambodia 
remains the key to whether a chinesesoviet summit will take place 
in the near future 
in saying that a summit hinged only on moscows urging vietnam 
to leave cambodia zhao appeared to tone down chinas past tough 
conditions for highlevel talks previously china stressed that 
the soviet union must first bring about an actual withdrawal by 
exerting its influence 
zhao said he was confident senior leaders from the two countries 
will meet when conditions are ripe 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has sought an end to decades of 
hostility between the two communist giants and proposed a summit 
with deng and other chinese leaders 
deng however has said he will meet gorbachev only when the 
kremlin removes what china calls the three obstacles 
particularly soviet support for vietnams invasion of cambodia 
the other two obstacles now being lifted are soviet troops in 
afghanistan and military tensions along the chinesesoviet border 
china the main backer of the communist khmer rouge and other 
resistance forces fighting the 10year occupation by vietnam and 
the soviet union will meet with chinese leaders later this month to 
discuss the cambodian question for the first time 
zhao said he hoped the vice ministerlevel talks would resolve 
differences between the two countries in one session he gave no 
date

polish folk dancer sigmund irinauch came out of 
hiding wednesday and said it was harassment not love that caused 
him to defect to israel 
in his first public appearance since he disappeared in haifi 
israel on aug 9 the 29yearold irinauch said he left poland 
because authorities hounded his family after he helped organize 
labor strikes 
he denied earlier reports by israeli newspapers and haifa police 
that he defected because he fell in love with an israeli dancer he 
met two years ago at a folk dancing festival in canada 
i would like very much to return to poland but i think it 
will be better both for me and for my family if i stay here said 
irinauch who wore a white polo shirt and spoke through a polish 
interpreter on israel television 
the reasons for my defection have to do only with me and my 
family and they are much more serious than his reported 
romance 
the womans friends said earlier she told him she was engaged 
before he came to israel but he decided to defect anyway they 
said the woman and her fiance agreed to help irinauch defect 
irinauch said his problems with communist authorities began 
after he helped organize workers strikes in april and may in his 
native krakow 
i was a law student and we organized protests he said i 
was one of the chief organizers and was chosen to represent the 
rest before the authorities as a result the authorities started 
to harass not only me but my family as well 
he gave no details about what form the harassment took 
the krakow strikes were part of a 15day national wave of labor 
unrest security police put down the strike at the lenin steelworks 
outside krakow on may 5 arresting 38 people 
irinauch said his maternal grandmother is jewish which means he 
too is jewish by israeli law and therefore would qualify for 
automatic citizenship 
he said he decided to live at the ayelet hashachar kibbutz or 
collective farm in northern galilee and enrolled in an intensive 
hebrew class irinauch said he chose the kibbutz because it offered 
foreign volunteers work room and board 
irinauch came to israel with the 46member slovianki polish folk 
dancing troupe and was described as one of its star dancers 
troupe members who were performing at a folk festival in haifa 
searched for irinauch for hours before departing for poland last 
week the dancer left them a note telling them he was staying 
behind

tenyearold heather ostrom a rockmusic fan 
who likes singing to large audiences drew thunderous cheers at the 
republican national convention on wednesday with her rendition of 
the national anthem 
glad its over the bonney lake wash girl cried to her 
mother carolee when she bounced away from the podium i sounded 
froggy like peewee herman 
heather a professional singer since she was 5 belted out the 
starspangled banner a cappella with a country lilt when she was 
through she flashed a shy grin and the place erupted with 
applause 
she admitted to a slight case of nerves 
it was really a neat experience but when youre starting to 
sing it its scary you dont ever get used to it but when i got 
started it was just great she said in an interview after she 
joined the washington state delegation on the convention floor 
receiving hugs and congratulations 
i really like singing before larger audiences than to two or 
three people said heather a blonde clad in a new white knit and 
lace dress 
the national anthem is fun to sing because of all the high 
notes and isnt as difficult as many people think she said 
but she confided i do get a little tired of it 
heather often appears with her 11yearold sister kirsten and 
their mother the three sang for about 15 minutes as delegates 
arrived at the convention hall performing mostly pop and 
inspirational music 
heather said she prefers rock music probably will become an 
artist rather than an entertainer and listed my mom and my 
sister as her favorite singers 
she said her older sister wasnt jealous that she was invited to 
sing at the convention by republican national committee chairman 
frank fahrenkopf who learned of the family from state party 
chairman jennifer dunn 
it all evens out she got to do the david letterman show 
said heather who will be a fifth grader this fall

when lee horsley was starring in matt 
houston it just wasnt done for a tv actor to cross over into 
films 
now seems to be the wonderful time to cross over from 
television into feature films everybody seems to do it said 
horsley who will star this season in the cbs western paradise 
back when houston was on the air you couldnt get arrested 
if you were on television it was unheardof no one would touch 
you that was tough going out and trying to have a feature career 
after havin a television show 
so he cheered when friend and cotv detective hunk tom selleck 
finally scored last year with the feature film three men and a 
baby after several attempts at movie success 
toms great a neat neat guy and i was glad it happened 
horsley said 
horsley would still like to cross over into feature films he 
starred in the cult favorite the sword and the sorcerer but 
otherwise found tv miniseries such as crossings and theater 
more available he was interviewed in new york recently during a 
run with mack and mabel in new jersey 
horsley became popular in the detective series matt houston 
but actually started out in musical theater appearing in the road 
productions of west side story oklahoma and 1776 among 
others 
he was born in the quaintly named muleshoe a small west texas 
town but was raised in colorado and considers it home though he 
and his family live in los angeles 
hes an avid horseman and had wanted to do a western forever 
ive just been crazy for the western to come back and i hope 
that this is a ticket to it i really hope it will work 
horsley plays ethan cord a mysterious former gunfighter who 
inherits his late sisters four children sent to him in the 
depressed mining town where their mother thought he was a 
successful merchant 
the romantic interest is a local businesswoman played by sigrid 
thornton of the man from snowy river who is cool toward cord 
but begins to warm toward the children 
this particular show the reason its so exciting is it really 
has all the elements i like horsley said it has that 
possibility of going in those directions the good guy and the bad 
guy the code the relationship with the kids theres so many 
wonderful ways to round it out that i think is real special so im 
real excited 
to be able to work with two of my favorite things kids and 
horses thats not all bad either its outdoors which i love im 
a little bit claustrophobic the thought of going back to episodic 
television and being on a soundstage seven days a week did not 
appeal to me 
the show will have an uphill battle in the ratings cbs is 
putting it on thursday against nbcs hit comedy lineup its 
leadin will be the cbs news documentary series 48 hours which 
hasnt scored very high in the ratings 
horsley said hes been approached to do movie westerns but he 
turned them down its amazing how badly written some of these 
westerns are he said 
david jacobs and robert porter cocreated paradise 
they do not look like cowboys so i got a little concerned 
horsley joked but the dialogue is right on the money its 
better than anything ive ever come up with as far as the flavor 
and being a western buff myself theres not too much that gets 
by 
the show seems to have elements of shane in it not to 
mention the potential for the subtle romance of gunsmoke 
horsley said he was concerned about returning to the episodic 
triangle 
but i guess now i am ready to do it again and im especially 
excited about this show its one that hopefully if all goes well 
will be comfortable to run for a period of time 
being a period piece its certainly not going to get stuck 
with your standard privatedetective kind of syndrome it takes a 
long time to beat after you do something like that so i think all 
the right elements are there 
also im gettin older he said an older daddy and 
episodics pretty comfortable

its a song that nightly rouses theater audiences 
its also the title of eartha kitts impending book 
after four decades in a career filled with fame and misfortune 
kitt wants all to know im still here 
i sing the song because it relates to my own experience the 
veteran performer said of her secondact showstopper in 
follies stephen sondheims 1971 musical which has been 
running for more than a year at londons shaftesbury theater 
thats why its wonderful when i see young people coming 
around asking for an autograph it makes me feel as if im still 
here she said 
she joined the cast july 4 replacing dolores gray as the 
hardbitten carlotta a woman who turns the memory of her good 
times and bum times into a classic broadway hymn to resilience 
kitt has parlayed her own bum times into a career that rode 
out divorce and political harassment to find her making her london 
musical debut at what she thinks but isnt sure is the age of 60 
all i knew was i had to survive because i was being abused by 
everybody that came along and anybody i was thrown to she said 
her life has made headlines as often as her work 
kitt was born on a cotton plantation in south carolina the 
illegitimate child of a halfblack halfindian woman who was raped 
by the white son of the plantation owner when she was five she 
was sent to live with an aunt in harlem a time marked by poverty 
and hunger 
the difficulties continued even when her burgeoning career 
brought the money that comes with fame her marriage in the 1960s 
to william mcdonald ended in an acrimonious divorce 
in 1968 she denounced the vietnam war in front of lady bird 
johnson wife of the late president lyndon b johnson in a remark 
that led to a cia dossier denouncing kitt as a sadistic 
nymphomaniac with a vile tongue 
today thoughts of these events leave her bemused as much as 
bitter 
why did they make such a furor over a little person like 
myself she said pausing during the interview to focus on the 
needlepoint seat cushion she is making or to tend to her 
6weekold pet dove named folly 
i was ostracized for telling the truth she said youre 
asked a particular question and you expect them to want to hear 
your particular opinion and when the truth rings against their 
ears you get knocked out of the box 
kitt found work difficult to come by after the cia allegations 
but 1978 proved a turningpoint of sorts when she returned to 
broadway in the musical timbuktu and was invited back to the 
white house by president jimmy carter 
however the white house invitation failed to provide the 
necessary balm 
im still waiting for the government to say im sorry she 
said america is supposed to be run by the people for the people 
not by one schnook in the white house 
i dont think america should be run by one person anymore 
shes gotten too big and spread herself out too much she said 
shes dissipated herself from the inside and if she allows it to 
continue shes not going to have anything left for us the 
citizens of the country 
the marriage last year of her only daughter has left her feeling 
lonely and vulnerable 
i always worked because there was somebody i could do 
something for like my daughter said kitt dabbing at her eye 
with a handkerchief now shes gone and it hurts its one of 
the feelings im writing about in the book 
im still here is the third memoir she has written it is to 
be published in britain in september 1989 by sidgwick and jackson 
it never becomes remote no she said of her past the 
pains are too great 
but despite the emptynest syndrome kitt takes solace in 
her fans and her work and in being back in england 
paris and london are the places that made me realize there is 
an eartha kitt inside of me somewhere said the performer who 
first came to london in 1949 as a dancer with katherine dunhams 
troupe 
the british people helped me cultivate my own sense of humor 
and not be afraid of it youre not as easily forgotten in these 
countries as we are in america 
it amazes me that wherever i go the public is there she 
said believe me no ones more grateful than i am

never has the federal reserve board made an 
interestrate decision that wasnt controversial and its latest 
one a half percentage point increase to 65 percent in the 
discount rate continues the tradition 
perhaps the most controversial aspect of it was the timing 
right before a presidential election a sensitive time politically 
and economically and therefore a time when the fed usually does 
not jiggle the economic levers 
moreover it came just days after fed chairman alan greenspan 
extolled the economys health before congress offering little 
suggestion at the time that any quick action was needed on interest 
rates 
but as it was in the past and most likely will be in the 
future the most detailed controversy is coming not from politics 
but from the field of economics itself where seldom is heard a 
noncontroversial word 
among the disputes is whether the fed acted preemptively to 
rein in the economy before it began straining or after the fact 
that is merely to catch up with increases that already had 
occurred in other interest rates 
some say the feds constraint saved the economy others say it 
has given business a case of jitters that could curtail production 
some say it could pitch the economy headlong into its first 
official recession in six years 
if the intent of the discount rate increase was to settle down 
the market the fed missed the mark says dale stuard president 
of the national associaiton of home builders it overreacted to 
inflation he contends 
others such as wright investors service express a sense of 
confusion over the move observing that consumer spending already 
had slowed from an annual rate of 44 percent two years ago to just 
half that over the past year 
economic strength currently derives from business fixed 
investment and net exports they accounted for half the economic 
growth in the past year prompting wright to ask if these were not 
areas to be encouraged not stifled 
it was widely believed that such was in fact the feds policy 
and that it was being fulfilled that is the economy was in the 
process of shifting to manufacturing and exports from consumer 
goods and services 
a commonly expressed fear is that the fed conceivably might have 
focused undue attention on the inflation threat setting off a 
psychological reaction that could reinforce and accelerate the rise 
of interest rates 
as wright observes the inflation threat is not clearcut the 83 
percent factory utilization rate and the jobless rate of around 54 
percent are typical of levels that existed prior to 1970 a period 
when inflation was relatively tame 
not only had consumer spending been moderating but homebuying 
plans had turned mediocre a trend the national association of 
realtors termed a reaction to interest rate increases that already 
had taken place 
with such evidence of moderating pressure therefore why the 
sudden forceful and unexpected move by the fed pondering that 
question said stuard could produuce a good case of jitters that 
could push rates even higher 
paul havemann vice president of hsh associates of riverdale 
nj which calls itself the countrys largest publisher of 
mortgage information tends to agree 
the quick speed with which lenders raised their rates is 
something of an overreaction he said 
weve seen this happen before the stock market has trouble 
digesting two such events so they overreact that spills over into 
the credit markets and lenders closely tied to those markets 
are carried along 
the financial and economic people might continue to argue in 
this way never reaching a consensus on whether the fed was right 
or wrong but that is the nature of economics 
economists are used to an indefinite world it is the political 
people who want answers they will strive to understand the feds 
action but they might strive in vain 
the fed does not try to explain its actions

it was to have been the highlight of cardinal 
john oconnors peace pilgrimage to northern ireland an 
ecumenical service at the cathedral of st patrick where catholics 
and protestants historic antagonists in ulster would pray 
together for peace 
but when the new york archbishop and several hundred other 
american pilgrims arrived at the cathedral in armagh on july 25 
protestants were almost as scarce as the snakes patrick is reputed 
to have driven from the island centuries ago 
the only protestant on the altar was a retired church of ireland 
bishop and although several ministers sat with the congregation 
they asked that their names not be released 
on his flight back to new york however the cardinal said he 
was not surprised to explain he recalled his last visit to 
northern ireland in 1984 saying 
we had a dinner with a bunch of protestant clergy probably 20 
or 30 of us in all it was very amiable very constructive but 
before it was over one of them who appeared to be speaking for 
many said you know if my people even knew that i was having 
dinner with you they would disown me 
now i think enough of that continues so that those clergy 
who came to the service in armagh felt it was a little much at 
this time for them to go up into the sanctuary 
the armagh service showed that ulster is one of the few places 
in christendom where many protestants especially presbyterians 
still see ecumenism as a threat 
although oconnor had invested much hope in the pilgrimages 
three ecumenical services only the one in armagh occurred in an 
area where catholicprotestant relations are tense 
that however was where the protestant response was weakest 
possibly because the pilgrimage coincided with the anglican 
churchs lambeth conference in england which many protestant 
leaders attended as participants or observers possibly because of 
the pilgrimages distinctly catholic character 
whatever the excuse the fact remains that ecumenism remains a 
fighting word in northern ireland 
the provinces most famous politicianpreacher the rev ian 
paisley went to the vatican harlot city he terms it in 1963 
to protest the ecumenical council called by pope john xxiii and he 
marched illegally on belfast city hall to protest the lowering of 
the flag when the pope died 
when a presbyterian minister walked across the street five years 
ago to extend christmas greetings at the local catholic church he 
was nearly fired and his family was threatened paisleys 
followers accused him of ecumenical tendencies 
protestants like paisley regard ecumenism as a catholic plot to 
weaken protestant resolve and trick them into accepting the 
unification of the province which has a 21 protestant majority 
with the predominantly catholic irish republic to the south 
the pilgrimages other ecumenical services at the shrine of 
our lady of knock and at christ church dublin took place in the 
republic where interdenominational relations are relatively good 
the clergy here have no problems no problems at all dean 
james grant a local church of ireland minister said after the 
service at knock we get along here and if this is reported in 
the north it may help there but the north he allowed was 
something else again 
northern irelands troubles are really about economics and 
politics not religion but protestant has become shorthand for 
unionist one who wants ulster to remain part of great britain 
and catholic has become synonymous with nationalist one 
who wants a united ireland 
in dublin the pilgrims were offered a final reminder of how 
long protestants and catholics have been feuding in ireland when 
they attended mass at st marys procathedral 
asked what the term procathedral meant an oconnor aide 
said it was a temporary designation usually for a church that is 
being used while the cathedral is under construction or repair 
but st marys has been a procathedral since its construction 
in 1825 the original cathedral christ church was lost when the 
church of england broke with rome in the 16th century and the 
vatican has never revoked the cathedrals consecration 
so the catholic archbishop of dublin still sits in a 
procathedral four centuries after the protestant reformation in 
ireland thats only yesterday

young americans and soviets are getting 
together more and more these days at high school proms and 
conferences and in organizations that range from orchestras to 
peace groups 
its citizen diplomacy says valentin seveus a swede who 
runs a threeway exchange program for teenagers from the united 
states the soviet union and neutral sweden 
in the united states there is a wish to show that the russians 
are ordinary people like you and me he said it is an 
extremely important thing 
the soviets under mikhael s gorbachevs glasnost openness 
policy want to open their country to the outside world and their 
programs often are organized under the banner of peace said 
seveus who operates out of stockholm 
swedes who cultivate their nonaligned position to pursue 
issues like peace and disarmament actively promote such projects 
its always easy to reach people when you work with peace 
seveus said 
ussoviet exchange programs were cut off by the united states 
when relations soured after the 1979 soviet invasion of 
afghanistan the contacts were renewed under a cultural agreement 
signed by president reagan and gorbachev at the 1985 ussoviet 
summit meeting in geneva 
liza malott of reagans ussoviet exchange initiative said 
about 100000 americans are now going to the soviet union annually 
mostly on private tours in contrast to 10000 soviets who visited 
the united states last year 
the proportion is even more lopsided when it comes to youth but 
the number of youngsters is climbing on both sides ms malott said 
seveus 46 founded cooperation for peace in 1983 to promote 
student gettogethers through summer camps or conferences working 
through parallel soviet and us organizations teenagers from 
poland india and other countries also have taken part 
seveus latest program peace quest brought 50 teenagers 
together for six weeks visiting each others us soviet and 
swedish hometowns 
on a stopover in sweden the americans said their visit to the 
soviet union had changed some of their preconceptions they visited 
private soviet homes looked in on the supreme soviet of the 
republic of ukraine and met with representatives of the russian 
orthodox church and youth groups 
they took us very seriously and we freely discussed everything 
with straight answers said a group leader elisabeth 
bentley a nurse from barre mass 
peace work at this stage in the us is so new she added 
we would like them to go back home and get involved make 
speeches form clubs you know throw a stone in the water with 
all the ripples 
its been fantastic said one traveling youth andy de 
braber 17 of grand rapids mich in a few weeks so much has 
happened its almost hard to absorb 
ina dubovik 17 an english major from minsk ussr said she 
joined the tour as a way to fight for peace as the leader of 
her schools international club she said she was looking forward 
to reporting back on her experiences 
ms dubovik said the members of her group were leaders in soviet 
youth groups or international clubs 
another american group leader susanne sklar 30 of chicago 
called the soviet youth the future ambassadors and leaders of their 
country 
the soviet press closely covered the group she said and 
members were on soviet television and radio several times 
one of the breakthroughs in the youth exchanges was the case of 
samantha smith an 11yearold maine schoolgirl 
in 1983 she won the hearts of millions of soviets when she 
visited at the invitation of the late yuri v andropov then the 
soviet president whom she had written about her concerns of 
superpower tension she died in a plane crash two years later

professor josiah thompson is an expert on 
such noted philosophers as kierkegaard nietzsche and sam spade 
spade what in the name of humphrey bogart is going on here a 
career change thats what 
in 1976 thompson driven by a thirst for experience left 
his tenured position as professor of philosophy at haverford 
college a prestigous quaker school in pennsylvania came to san 
francisco and became a private detective 
he couldnt have picked a better city in which to set up shop 
san franciscos hills are steeped in the lore of dashiell 
hammett and his legendary sleuth sam spade the blond satan 
whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by humphrey bogart 
in the maltese falcon 
theres even a bronze plaque on a san francisco street 
recalling a murder that took place only in hammetts mind on 
approximately this spot miles archer partner of sam spade was 
done in by brigid oshaughnessy 
thompson whose previous writings were mostly limited to the 
academic world has recounted his metamorphosis in a book 
appropriately called gumshoe reflections in a private eye 
little brown 1795 
he was born 53 years ago in east liverpool ohio where his 
father sold dishes during world war i his father took a pair of 
field glasses from a dead german and gave them to the youngster 
thompson whose nickname is tink still uses the glasses on 
cases he keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them on 
stakeouts 
even though slightly built he played halfback in high school 
closing his eyes on every play later he was under fire in 
lebanon as an ensign with a navy underwater demolition team the 
elite frogmen 
why did he become a professor in the first place going from 
football bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of a 
college campus 
i had plenty of money when i got out of the navy with 
demolition and combat pay he said i was a good student in 
high school so i went to oxford and from there took the line of 
least resistance 
when that line became a culdesac he took a sabbatical and 
grabbed a job with an established detective agency in san francisco 
during his apprenticeship and as his own boss thompson has 
worked on such headline cases as the defense of black panther huey 
newton on assault and murder charges and the defense of william 
and emily harris in the patty hearst case 
there were also other less publicized capers ranging from 
recovering 30000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drug 
case to retrieving a kidnapped child from india 
thompsons wife nancy sells real estate they have two adult 
daughters and a son who plays soccer in college he never carries a 
gun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is mistaken 
identity 
i was taken for a spy on a case in morocco he said and 
one time in canada while working on a drug case word got around 
that a hit man was being brought in when people heard i was from 
california some of them thought i was the guy the bars would 
clear when i came in 
while honing his skills as a gumshoe thompson has become 
fascinated by hammett and spade so much so that on one case he 
took the time to interview some of hammetts relatives 
hammett through spade was a bit of a philosopher he says 
in order to love one must put off hardness and shiftiness 
thompson said the ability to lie effectively to appear 
different than one really is all the disguises essential in the 
world of power become in the world of love temptations artful 
excuses to avoid the nakedness love requires to avoid love 
hammett knew this he said 
thats why in the last line of the maltese falcon he makes 
spade shiver as he looks down the cold barrel of his future

in a television news commercial filmed in 
documentary style a camera takes the viewer into a hospital past 
waiting news reporters in the corridors and up to the rooftop 
heliport 
a trenchcoated reporter is interviewing an accident victim as 
he is being eased onto a stretcher and the victim has been brought 
to the hospital in the news teams helicopter 
watch wtnh in new haven conn and youll get the story ahead 
of everyone else the announcer explains especially the story just 
shown it never happened 
across the continent in los angeles viewers of knbc see news 
anchorman john beard and anchorwoman linda alvarez share a fan 
letter the fan says beard deserves a hug and a there there 
pat when hes telling folks bad news 
then beard reads a compliment for ducking under his desk during 
the oct 2 earthquake wrong anchorman that was morning news 
anchorman kent shocknekyo kent mail call beard says 
rapping the desk top 
promotions for television news shows cute coy or concocted 
have slipped out of the narrow restrictions that once dictated that 
such spots feature only the depth and capability of the news team 
the new generation of commercials are forged from years of 
behindthescenes wars between news and promotion departments did 
one side win 
i would say its kind of a meeting of the minds said jay 
curtis member services manager of the broadcast promotion amp 
marketing executives the advertisements are taking the content 
of news and fitting it into the form of promotion 
curtis estimated that concocted news events were featured in 20 
percent of the 600 news promotions the bpme received recently for 
its gold medallion awards 
although the scenario for the wtnh commercial was not based on 
a specific event it was indicative of things that happen at 
hospitals said wtnh promotion manager donald cohen he said 
there had been no negative comments from the public or journalists 
about the spot 
wtnh an abc affilliate has been running a neckandneck 
ratings war with wfsb the hartfordbased cbs affiliate cohen said 
i find that promotion directors use as a litmus test for 
themselves whether they can make their news no 1 curtis said 
adding that the tighter the market the tougher the promotion 
campaign when the news gets the numbers everything else falls 
into place 
they were a pretty boring station when they hired me said 
former knbc promotion manager vince manze now an executive vice 
president with steve sohmer inc my mandate was to put some life 
in the station the network had taken off the local station had 
not he said 
cohen said he was prepared for criticism of the wtnh commercial 
i was ready to explain the thinking that went behind the spot 
and we were prepared to put the word dramatization over it 
but cohen said the viewers of wtnh were sophisticated enough to 
understand the commercial was not a real event 
but we wanted to make sure we were doing something that was 
actually related to covering the news he said 
the commercial for knbc was one of several spots devised by 
chuck blore and don richman inc that involves oncamera reporters 
the first series of ads featured weather reporter fritz coleman 
and sports reporter fred roggin facing off on the basketball court 
or marathon course in the former coleman fries roggin with 
lightning after the sportscasters halfcourt razzle dazzle 
the newest knbc spot features knbc anchorwomen kelly lange and 
colleen williams discussing the propriety of anchormen and 
anchorwomen doing such a commercial the women decide not to and 
walk off the basketball court 
you cant play around with the news blore said in an 
interview he said his guidelines for promoting knbcs news forbade 
him from concocting events but had to grab the attention of the 
public he and knbc management settled on using personalities from 
the station usually in a scripted comedy piece 
a couple of years ago it would have been shocking to put news 
people in a comedy situation said blore i was even a little 
hesitant about it for one of the commercials blore associate 
bill mcdonald had to write 19 scripts before finding the right 
balance between promoting the news and avoiding perceived 
credibility damage 
the trend is not pleasing to everyone in the industry 
i think its easy to do bizarre and different and silly 
campaigns and avoid the nuts and bolts of what goes into the 
news said kabc los angeles director of advertising and promotion 
bob burris 
his station rated no 1 locally concentrates on the experience 
and recognition of its reporters anchormen and anchorwomen

the government says housing starts rose for the second straight 
month in july but some economists say rising interests rates could 
make the construction rebound shortlived 
the commerce department reported wednesday that new home and 
apartment construction was up 24 percent last month after rising 
44 percent in june 
housing starts dropped a sharp 121 percent in may and 
economists blamed rising mortgage rates for the slowdown 
the junejuly recovery was attributed to stabilized mortgage 
rates but that trend was thrown into question last week when the 
federal reserve boosted the discount rate the interest it charges 
for loans to member banks 
a variety of other interest rates including mortgage rates 
moved higher as a result of the fed action fixedrate mortgages 
averaged 1057 percent nationwide by the end of last week and 
analysts predicted mortgages soon would top 11 percent 
the commerce department report had little impact on financial 
markets 
bond traders brushed off the july figures and treasury issues 
closed narrowly mixed 
meanwhile the dollar surged against major foreign currencies 
despite action by the fed and the west german central bank to limit 
the dollars climb against the west german mark 
on wall street stocks finished mixed in a slow session the dow 
jones industrial average closed up 445 points to 202596 
the commerce department also reported wednesday that housing 
permits considered a good barometer of future activity fell in 
july by 54 percent to an annual rate of 141 million units 
economists were pessimistic about the construction report 
i believe we have seen the peak for housing starts this year 
as rising interest rates cut into sales said richard peach an 
economist with the mortgage bankers association a trade group 
sales of homes and other highpriced items usually are the first 
to fall off when the federal reserve tries to dampen inflation by 
raising interest rates 
michael sumichrast an economist and publisher of a construction 
industry newsletter said that if mortgage rates climb to 115 
percent or higher it could hit the housing industry hard he said 
home sales already have been hurt by big price increases in many 
parts of the country 
separately a private survey found fewer housing units were 
built during the second quarter of 1988 than the same period a year 
ago 
for the apriljune period new housing construction slipped 9 
percent to 406882 units compared with 446955 units built during 
the second quarter of 1987 the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill 
information services co said 
george a christie chief economist for fw dodge said most of 
the decline was in rental housing where high vacancy rates have 
hindered new apartment construction 
construction of singlefamily homes remained steady during the 
period he said

in keeping with the recent rise in the prime 
rate consumers can expect to see comparatively higher rates on 
bank products like certificates of deposits or money market 
accounts right 
not necessarily some experts say 
the consumer increasingly is losing out contends robert k 
heady publisher of bank rate monitor a north palm beach fla 
newsletter that tracks bank interest rates it seems to be a 
different ballgame in 1988 
heady says banks have been slower than usual this year in 
raising their cd and deposit rates to keep pace with increases in 
lending rates like the prime which is used to calculate a wide 
range of fixed and adjustablerate loans 
as an example he uses the period between may 11 the first time 
banks raised the prime this year and aug 10 the day before the 
latest halfpercentagepoint increase lifted the key lending rate 
to a threeyear high of 10 percent 
during the may 11aug 10 period the prime rose a full 
percentage point to 95 percent from 85 percent 
sixmonth cd yields rose on average a half percentage point to 
742 percent from 692 percent while 1year cds rose about the 
same amount to 772 percent from 723 percent 
the 2year cd average rose 039 point to 804 percent from 765 
percent and 5year cds increased an even smaller 028 point to 
840 percent from 812 percent 
yields on money market accounts which averaged 569 percent in 
may rose to around 583 percent heady says 
banks and most economist say the current spread is justified for 
many reasons 
to start with there is the cost of federal deposit insurance 
and reserve requirements with which banks have to contend and 
banks have to protect themselves from possible loan defaults 
besides banks and economists say yields on bank products like 
cds often are set by the prevailing rates in the credit markets 
the spread between long and shortterm rates there has narrowed in 
recent months 
you have to take into account the whole structure of interest 
rates said irwin kellner chief economist for manufacturers 
hanover trust co the actual cost of money to any bank depends on 
funding strategy over the past few weeks and few months 
its not just simply the latest cd rate subtracted by the 
prime rate 
moves in the prime rate typically lag changes of almost all 
marketrelated interest rates 
still edward yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache 
securities inc believes theres a little greed involved when 
it comes to some increases in banks lending rates vs their cost 
of funds 
but theres no conspiracy here he adds theres no evil 
motivation involved its just the way the market works 
if you see an opportunity to make a little money then youll 
do it

farm subsidies in the united states and europe 
that were enacted to cope with domestic gluts are continuing even 
though the drought has cut stockpiles and raised prices 
subsidies encourage overproduction keep farmers dependent on 
their governments for support hurt farm exports of developing 
nations and cost taxpayers billions of dollars 
the drought created an opportunity to phase out the subsidies by 
pushing up worldwide market prices closer to the prices that the 
united states and europeans guarantee to their farmers 
in fact though governments are not curtailing their subsidy 
programs one reason is that since the drought began the rise in 
world prices has made the programs more tolerable because they are 
less expensive to finance 
the drought in effect has lessened the budgetary urgency of 
curbing farm supports 
the durability of the farm programs helps explain why 
agriculture is such a contentious issue in world trade 
whenever weather conditions allow you to spend more for farm 
programs you will whenever weather conditions allow you to cut 
back on spending you dont its a ratchet effect said robert 
paarlberg a farm trade expert who teaches at wellesley college in 
wellesley mass 
if the weather returns to normal farm subsidies could become 
hugely expensive next year because this years higher prices are 
likely to encourage overplanting in europe australia argentina 
brazil and possibly north america 
if bumper crops push prices down programs that support prices 
will automatically pay heavy subsidies to farmers to protect them 
from the consequences of overproduction 
in contrast if next year is another drought year another set 
of farm policies aimed at reducing stockpiles could contribute to 
shortages and a runup in prices 
the us government has been reducing stockpiles to remove an 
overhang of inventories that depresses domestic farm prices 
but if crops are small next year a possible lack of adequate 
stockpiles could cause prices to soar 
the best evidence of the difficulty of reducing farm programs is 
the persistence of export subsidies which both the united states 
and europe use in an expensive battle for foreign customers 
the drought has led to a reduction but not an elimination of 
the use of the subsidies which benefit foreign consumers more than 
farmers at home 
the biggest beneficiary of the us export enhancement program 
has been the soviet union the soviets have bought nearly 13 
million metric tons of subsidized american wheat since 1985 when 
the program was begun to combat subsidies by the european economic 
community 
through the program the united states gives away food 
stockpiles that were purchased with tax dollars in order to help 
us exporters offer food at lower prices to customers who might 
otherwise buy subsidized european food 
since 1985 the program has aided in achieving 54 billion in 
export sales but of that the government contributed food bought 
with taxpayer dollars for 29 billion 
while the ostensible purpose of the export program is to keep 
us exports competitive in world markets the program is also used 
to get rid of excess farm products that would depress domestic 
prices 
for example the program has been used to ship more than 60000 
head of dairy cattle to such places as iraq indonesia egypt 
turkey morocco and algeria the cattle were exported because 
slaughtering them for beef would have depressed us beef prices 
because of the high cost of transporting live animals 
government subsidies have ranged as high as 1000 a head on cattle 
that are sold overseas for 1400 a head 
seventythree percent of all wheat exports this year have been 
subsidized under the export enhancement program making wheat the 
main commodity covered by it others have included barley rice 
sorghum eggs frozen poultry and vegetable oil as well as the 
dairy cattle 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng vowed in june that the 
united states would continue the export program in spite of the 
drought 
its impossible for us to make firm forecasts he said 
but ill tell you this that we will not neglect our export 
trade 
europeans deny they have been the aggressors in export 
subsidies the european economic communitys farm supports are 
being curtailed for budget reasons said derwent renshaw 
agricultural counselor for the trade blocs office in washington 
farm lobbyists are unenthusiastic about export subsidies because 
they depress world prices but end up supporting them because they 
promote exports and reduce stockpiles 
the national farmers union for example supports the program as 
a second best because the government did not require as large of a 
setaside for idling crop land as the group wanted 
talks on reducing farm subsidies are being conducted under the 
auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
genevabased body that overseas international commerce 
a midterm progress review on the talks is scheduled for montreal 
in december the united states has been hoping to come up with at 
least a framework for subsidy reductions by then but the outlook 
for that appears dim 
paarlberg faults the reagan administration for setting 
hopelessly grandiose goals in the gatt talks 
we could have had an agreement on export subsidies if that had 
been focused on he said 
progress in montreal is still possible but it will depend on 
conditions in the preceding weeks such as the weather and the 
european budget situation said leonard condon the deputy 
assistant us trade representative for agricultural affairs 
were talking about tough issues here and political leaders 
dont like to resolve tough issues until they have nowhere else to 
go condon said

dissident family shareholders pushing for a 
buyout of rp scherer corp say they are confident they won two of 
three board of directors seats considered instrumental in their 
attempt but are unsure of the third 
scherer stockholders cast proxy votes at a meeting wednesday to 
fill the three seats results were scheduled to be announced next 
wednesday said peter r fink the pharmaceutical capsule companys 
president and chief executive 
in national overthecounter trading scherer closed up 137 a 
share to 2625 
john s scherer and his sister karla scherer fink the estranged 
wife of peter fink have spearheaded the effort to win the three 
seats as a prelude to attempting to arrange a buyout of the company 
the two who are children of the companys late founder robert 
p scherer control 382 percent of the companys outstanding 
shares karla fink filed for divorce from her husband several 
months ago 
john scherer said he was encouraged by a state court of appeals 
ruling wednesday that barred the voting of a 98 percent block of 
the companys stock in the proxy contest 
schere and his sister are beneficiaries of a trust at 
manufacturers bank of detroit that holds the block and have sought 
to prevent the bank from voting the shares saying it had a 
conflict of interest because of business dealings with scherer 
the trustee had indicated it planned to back management in the 
proxy fight 
in a statement released after the meeting john scherer said the 
pair was confident our candidates had won the two board 
seatswe were not certain about the third seat but as the 
meeting progressed and we learned the bank could not vote the 
trust our optimism increased 
about 200 people attended the calm hourlong annual meeting at a 
troy hotel arguments for both sides drew applause 
karla scherer fink urged selling the company now in the wake of 
two yearas of record corporate earnings there is no guarantee 
this level of profitability will continue she said 
there are interested potential buyers watching closely what 
goes on here today she said but they will not come forward in 
the kind of hostile environment the management has created 
but peter fink said a stockholder who seeks full value for 
his or her investment in scherer will not find it on the auction 
block today 
the board determined after thorough analysis that shareholders 
would best be served if the company remained independent he said 
however fink also said there had been no offers to date to buy the 
company 
while management does not intend to put a forsale sign on the 
door he said if a bona fide offer were to emerge it would 
clearly be our boards duty to give it thorough and full 
consideration 
scherer which employs about 2800 people at 22 facilities in 13 
countries is the worlds largest maker of gelatin capsules for the 
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries the company 
had 2907 million in sales and 151 million in net income in its 
last fiscal year ended march 31 
karla fink and her brother control about 382 percent of the 
company the support of another shareholder cilluffo associates 
brought the total shares backing the pair to 399 percent

no one was willing to pay eastman kodak 
co its asking price for the profitable household products group of 
the recentlyacquired sterling drug co so kodak has decided to 
keep it 
kay whitmore kodaks president and executive officer said 
wednesday that kodak had decided not to sell the lehn amp fink unit 
of sterling which makes lysol disinfectant dcon pesticides and 
other products 
whitmore also said the unit is too important to lose 
kodak bought sterling drug for 51 billion earlier this year in 
a white knight maneuver to thwart a hostile takeover attempt of 
sterling by swiss pharmaceutical giant f hoffmanlaroche amp co 
published reports and rumors on wall street in recent weeks 
indicated kodak was planning to sell the montvale njbased lehn 
amp fink unit which had sales of 594 million last year 
many stock analysts believe that if kodak could have found a 
buyer it would have sold the unit with little hesitation 
im not surprised theyre keeping it said mark obenzinger 
an analyst with the brokerage firm wood gundy amp co in new york 
they couldnt get the price they wanted they paid top dollar for 
it so they have to get top top dollar for it 
eugene glazer an analyst for dean witter reynolds in new york 
expressed similar sentiments but noted that one reason kodak needed 
to get a higher price for the unit was to cover the hefty tax bill 
that would have been levied on the deal 
tax law changes in 1986 make it harder or at least more 
expensive for buyers to sell off the unwanted businesses of 
acquired companies glazer said 
because of the new law kodak would have to pay hundreds of 
millions of dollars in taxes if it sold lehn amp fink he said 
so kodak had to add that onto the price and i think that 
discouraged people from buying glazer said 
lehn amp fink still does not fit into kodaks strategic plans but 
analysts said it is a successful and wellrun company that will not 
hurt kodaks bottom line 
whitmore told lehn amp fink employees in montvale wednesday that a 
study about the relationship between kodak and the household 
products unit had turned up many positive things 
he said he envisioned lehn amp fink marketing products that might 
be developed by kodaks chemical division kodak using its strength 
in convenience store outlets to get lehn amp fink products onto more 
store shelves and kodak helping market lehn amp finks products 
overseas 
whitmore said that while kodak originally just had interest in 
sterling drugs pharmaceutical operations kodaks broader strategy 
always had included expansion of sterlings consumer products 
presence

amc entertainment inc announced 
wednesday it planned to sell about 40 percent of its screens for 
about 200 million to new yorkbased tpi enterprises inc 
the kansas city movie theater chain which owns almost 25 
percent of tpis stock will manage the theaters that are sold the 
theaters also are expected to retain the amc name and amc would 
retain its ability to negotiate films for all of the screens 
the amc sale which involves 605 of amcs 1549 screens is not 
expected to affect the companys estimated 7800 employees 
tpi operates a paging and mobile telephone business in puerto 
rico and recently acquired shoneys south inc a restaurant 
company 
analysts said that although the transaction immediately would 
pump muchneeded cash into debtburdened amc it was unclear how 
much revenue amc would lose in the long term because of the sale 
amcs debt has swollen to about 376 million due to an 
aggressive expansion that began a few years ago although amc grew 
under the expansion to become the countrys secondlargest movie 
exhibitor its debts and losses also have increased 
amcs losses more than doubled to 137 million in its latest 
fiscal year ended march 31 amc then reported that its 
firstquarter losses amounted to 76 million more than half of 
all of last years losses 
steven zell amcs senior vice president of finance would not 
say where the 605 screens were but he said they were in 90 
theaters mostly in the southeast all the theaters are in buildings 
for which amc has longterm leases he said 
zell said amc thought that it was important to reorganize its 
balance sheet and reduce the companys debt he said amc was 
expected to receive 150 million in cash and a 50 million note 
from tpi for the screens

a federal judge stunned the publishers of the 
detroit news and detroit free press by temporarily blocking todays 
scheduled merger of the newspapers business operations saying the 
plan would do irreparable harm 
us district judge joyce hens green issued an emergency order 
wednesday preventing the joint operating agreement between the 
newspapers from taking effect the joa will be postponed until at 
least sept 17 
former attorney general edwin meese iii approved the joa before 
leaving office last week both newspapers sought the agreement 
under an antitrust exemption of the newspaper preservation act 
william b schultz an attorney representing a group of 
advertisers and readers had argued that meese arbitrarily ignored 
an administrative law judges finding that neither daily qualified 
for the antitrust exemption as a failing newspaper 
green agreed with schultz contention saying consolidation 
of the free press and the news will harm their employees their 
advertisers and their customers as well besides being 
immediate these injuries will also be irreparable 
knightridder inc which owns the free press has said it will 
close the morning newspaper if the partial merger doesnt go 
through meaning the loss of 1500 jobs alvah chapman the 
companys chairman has said the free press sustained 100 million 
in operating losses since 1979 
i am very disappointed said free press publisher david 
lawrence it the decision seems to me to be so cruel to all the 
individuals involved 
the people of the free press have gone through 28 months of 
uncertainty and now they still dont know what will happen to them 
and this newspaper 
frank hawkins spokesman for miamibased knightridder said the 
parent company was studying its options 
louis weil publisher of the detroit news said he was stunned 
by greens decision issued in washington dc 
everything was ready to go weil said but now with the 
restraining order we will go back to what we were doing before and 
that is putting out a fine newspaper 
green scheduled a hearing for sept 8 
both papers rank among the nations 10 largest in terms of 
circulation but each has posted significant losses in recent years 
in a continuing battle to dominate detroits newspaper market 
since applying for the joint operating status in may 1986 the 
two newspapers together have lost 45 million to 50 million said 
philip a lacovara an attorney for the free press 
officials of knightridder and gannett co inc owners of the 
news said they expected the joa to return the newspapers to 
profitability 
under the partial merger the free press would remain a morning 
newspaper while the news which has published as a 24hour paper 
would publish evening editions on weekdays the papers would 
publish joint weekend editions about 500 jobs at the two papers 
would be eliminated by the consolidation 
in 1987 the free press had a circulation of 639720 daily and 
724342 on sundays while news circulation was 678720 daily and 
839319 on sundays according to the audit bureau of circulation

four months after leaving home richard and 
maureen johns are camped on the edge of despair living in a tent 
with their four young children and searching for the good job 
supposedly here for the asking 
the family remains unfazed by a summer of searing heat and 
sinking finances they came here from pittsburgh 2 months ago and 
have been sleeping in a 9by9foot tent and eating in a screened 
canopy at the western village park and campground while johns looks 
for a steady decentpaying job 
no no said mrs johns when asked whether her spirits had 
fallen im not depressed yet if were living here in 
november then ill be concerned 
as her husband talked with a reporter mrs johns prepared 
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the children mary 
katherine 7 ben 5 elizabeth 4 and brian 2 
bikes were scattered about the campsite some belongings were 
kept under a tarp next to the tent the familys 1976 ford station 
wagon was parked nearby 
johns said he moved his family out of their pittsburgh home june 
1 after reading news accounts about plenty of jobs around carlisle 
a small central pennsylvania town in an area with a rising economy 
the town sits near an important northsouth junction interstate 81 
and the pennsylvania turnpike 
coming from jobdepressed pittsburgh it sounded great he 
said 
once here johns 33 who has training in electronics could 
find only fastfood and truckdriving jobs he has worked several 
temporary jobs including one for the telephone company but has 
yet to come up with something permanent 
he has sought help from the state job service and local programs 
and had expected his search would end by this month 
experienced campers the johns enjoyed the prospect of a summer 
outdoors but now worry about how theyll meet another 235 monthly 
payment on sept 1 to stay at the campground 
the moneys getting tight johns said 
the site has electricity and restrooms relatives have given 
them a small refrigerator and electric skillet they drive about 15 
minutes away to a roadside spring for drinking water for a change 
of scene theyve driven to nearby state parks and a cousin gave 
them tickets to hersheypark amusement park 
the kids consider it a vacation johns said they love it 
they really enjoy it 
married eight years the johns endured similar frustrating job 
hunting in pittsburgh he said he sent out 240 resumes and got only 
one interview although they invested many improvements into their 
pittsburgh home they feel no point in returning and are trying to 
sell the house the real estate agent believes it will be tough 
with so many houses on the market they said 
the saying is the grass is always greener on the other 
side johns said back in pittsburgh the grass is dead 
he said he refuses to give up on central pennsylvania and feels 
it has an optimism about the economy that is missing in western

higher prices for droughtreduced commodities 
and cutbacks in subsidy payments will mean a twoyear saving of 
106 billion for major farm price support programs according to 
agriculture department projections 
when usdas proposed operating budget was sent to congress last 
february net price support outlays by the departments commodity 
credit corp were estimated at 177 billion for the current year 
and 171 billion for the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 
the revised estimates based upon a midsession review of 
usda budget figures are tentative and still subject to revision 
however as of now they call for commodity price support spending 
to drop this year to around 131 billion and in fiscal 1989 to 
111 billion 
spending on farm supports soared to a record 258 billion in 
1986 the first year of a new farm law passed in 1985 the law 
authorized gradual reductions in deficiency payments made to 
farmers when market prices are depressed it also allowed other 
adjustments including the lowering of basic price support loan 
rates for major commodities 
outlays for support edged down to 224 billion in 1987 but were 
expected to decline more in future years as lower adjustments were 
made in the laws various formulas including reduced dairy 
supports 
but rising exports followed by drought this year boosted 
commodity prices sharply that has lessened the need for large 
deficiency payments for some crops 
not all commodities have shared in the expected cost reduction 
some programs including cotton and rice will be more costly to 
operate in the coming year 
but the anticipated savings in direct payments to farmers was an 
important arguing point in favor of the recent 39 billion drought 
relief measure signed aug 11 by president reagan corn soybeans 
and spring wheat areas have been the hardest hit 
according to a summary provided at the request of the associated 
press most of the 106 billion in savings this year and next will 
come as a result of reduced payments to producers of feed grains 
which include corn sorghum oats and barley 
feed grains payments in fiscal 1987 totaled nearly 14 billion 
this years payments are expected to decline to 82 billion and in 
1989 those will drop to less than 273 billion according to the 
estimates 
last february usda budget analysts said feed grains payments 
might be about 126 billion this year and 111 billion in 1989 
some other payments and comparisons included 
wheat 284 billion in 1987 5569 million in 1988 and 6955 
million in 1989 earlier this years payments were forecast at 
108 billion and 1989s at 152 billion 
rice 9059 million in 1987 1246 million in 1988 and 1 
billion in 1989 the earlier forecast was 189 million in 1988 and 
320 million in 1989 
upland cotton 179 billion in 1987 7568 million in 1988 
and 261 billion in 1989 the earlier forecast was 42 million in 
1988 and 229 million in 1989 
dairy 117 billion in 1987 118 billion in 1988 and 6819 
million in 1989 the earlier forecast was 123 billion in 1988 and 
936 million in 1989 
wool 1521 million in 1987 1367 million in 1988 and 847 
million in 1989 the earlier forecast was 125 million in 1988 and 
127 million in 1989

agriculture department scientists say they 
have not forsaken the asian cockroach theyre still looking for 
ways to kill it 
the pest invaded florida two years ago and has been a target of 
usda eradicators since then the department said wednesday and the 
antiroach campaign will continue at least through the next fiscal 
year 
ralph a bram head of research on insects affecting humans and 
animals for the departments agricultural research service said 
that contrary to reports the agency has not closed out any 
research program aimed at controlling these pests 
bram said the agencys research budget next year is for 243700 
to be spent on cockroaches the same as this year the work is done 
at the agencys laboratory in gainesville fla in cooperation 
with the university of florida 
the agency said recent published reports implied that another 
usda scientist richard j brenner said the cockroach will spread 
to all of the contiguous 48 states 
bram said there is no way of knowing exactly how far north the 
cockroach will migrate because of winter temperatures he said it 
is doubtful the insect would survive father north than maryland on 
the east coast tennessee in the central area and lower washington 
state in the west

the agriculture department has announced 
allocations totaling 110 million for 46 projects under the 
targeted export assistance program for the fiscal year that will 
begin oct 1 
under the program various trade organizations get money to 
carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products 
the program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects of 
unfair foreign trade practices on us exports 
in most cases the sponsoring organizations put up some of their 
own money in carrying out a specific project although the amount 
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the 
department 
the 110 million for 1989 is the same as for this year a level 
set by congress in the 1985 farm law 
officials said wednesday the biggest amount 89 million will 
go to the us meat export federation to promote red meat variety 
meats and related products other leading recipients include 
american soybean association 88 million cotton council 
international 79 million and the california raisin advisory 
board 77 million

the state fair employment commission 
awarded more than 100000 to a former silicon valley saleswoman 
who accused her boss of making crude sexual jokes and forcing her 
off the job when she complained 
the fair employment commission in a unanimous decision ruled 
that sigma circuits inc of santa clara and sales manager charles 
dimick were guilty of sexual harassment of linda schultz a 
saleswoman from january 1983 to august 1985 
language humor and related activities that may be acceptable 
in the locker room do not belong in the workplace the commission 
said 
schultz claimed that dimick continually made crude sexual jokes 
laughed when she complained and forced her off the job leaving 
her a single mother without work for four months 
this shows what can happen if employers allow this kind of 
childish behavior to continue in the workplace jim ryden an 
attorney for ms schultz said wednesday 
the supervisors conduct made the work environment offensive 
oppressive hostile and intimidating said the commission which 
also said the company was legally responsible for harassment by a 
supervisor 
mondays ruling also rejected claims that dimicks comments were 
protected by freedom of speech or were a legitimate attempt to keep 
the workplace atmosphere loose and friendly 
ernest pinza lawyer for the electronics company declined 
comment and james thompson dimicks lawyer did not return 
telephone calls the ruling can be appealed in superior court 
according to the commission dimick regularly used profanity in 
the office told lewd jokes and made other comments that offended 
schultz including telling her and other employees to get under 
my desk or get down on your knees when they asked for price 
quotations 
after schultz complained dimick told her in august 1985 that it 
would be better if she found another job according to the 
commission schultz considered herself fired went home and 
appealed the next day to the company president who accepted 
dimicks version of the events and denied schultz severance 
benefits 
the company denied schultz had been fired but the commission 
said even if she quit the legal effect was the same because 
dimicks sexual harassment made her working conditions so 
oppressive and intolerable that she was forced to quit 
damages which were to be paid jointly by the company and 
dimick include 36000 in lost wages back pay and 25000 for 
emotional distress with interest the total award will exceed 
100000 said ryden a lawyer with the fair employment and housing 
department

one of more than 300 hispanic fbi agents 
who have joined a racial discrimination lawsuit says agency careers 
were stymied by a network of mormon agents that included the 
disgraced richard miller 
sammy martinez a special agent in new york testified wednesday 
that when he worked in the mexico city office in 1986 he was 
discriminated against for racial and religious reasons by his boss 
now a highranking fbi official 
martinez said he was the only hispanic and nonmormon in the 
mexico city office 
i know there was a contract on me martinez told us 
district judge lucius bunton explaining that in fbi jargon a 
contract means someones out to get you to sabotage your career 
in his testimony martinez charged his mexico city boss john 
walser of falsely accusing him of wrongdoing as a pretext to get 
martinez transferred out of the office martinez said the incident 
would not have happened were he nonhispanic or mormon 
walser who is now an executive assistant director in 
washington did not return a phone call wednesday from the 
associated press 
defense attorney alan ferber noted that walser has adopted four 
mexican children and has a hispanic brotherinlaw 
the 311 agents who have joined the lawsuit contend the fbi 
discrgeles for two years before his el 
paso transfer in 1984 
perez has contended that richard bretzing special agent in 
charge of the los angeles office criticized his performance as an 
administrator because of racial prejudice bretzing in the past has 
declined comment 
perez later testified in the los angeles espionage trial of 
former fbi agent richard miller that he told bretzing he should 
fire miller for incompetence miller was convicted of espionage 
bretzing and miller are both mormons and the bretzingperez 
fight led to charges of a mormon mafia in the los angeles 
office 
martinez said after his testimony that about 50 of 450 agents in 
los angeles are mormons 
because most mormon men serve as missionaries in their younger 
years a lot of mormons come into the bureau because of language 
ability martinez said theyre recruited supported and move 
up the career ladder because of the clique 
testimony is expected to last two weeks

us district judge robert aguilar has 
imposed a oneyear delay on apple computer incs landmark 
copyright violation case against hewlettpackard co and microsoft 
corp 
aguilar who set the trial date as aug 14 1989 gave no reason 
for the decision which legal experts said will hurt the strategies 
of microsoft and other companies including international business 
machines corp to bring macintoshlike traits to ibmcompatible 
computers 
the trial will decide whether microsoft violated its contract 
with apple which gave microsoft the right to use copyrighted 
elements of apples macintosh visual display in its software 
microsoft would like to get the issue resolved as soon as 
possible said g gervaise davis a monterey attorney 
specializing in hightech law 
the trial dates apply only to the question of the scope of the 
licensing agreement between microsoft and apple apples claims 
that microsoft and hewlettpackard have produced software 
infringing on its copyrights will be decided separately 
aguilar in june granted microsofts request to break apples 
suit into those two major elements the action was designed to 
speed up the trial and was considered a victory for microsoft

thanks to a strong economy britains persistently 
high unemployment rate has fallen sharply but critics claim the 
government is massaging the figures to make them look even better 
than they are 
opponents of prime minister margaret thatchers government agree 
that unemployment is down but say exaggeration in the degree of 
improvement is encouraging apathy toward the unemployed 
the jobless rate has been falling for two years reaching 82 
percent in july its lowest point in nearly seven years the 
department of employment says 
unemployment has fallen to 231 million people from a peak of 
115 percent or about 331 million in june 1986 
the decline is the fastest among major western industrialized 
nations the government says 
but the unemployment unit a private research and lobby 
organization says the rate would be 104 percent representing 
298 million people if the calculation method were the same as 
when the conservatives first came into power in 1979 
the british figures compare with a west german rate of 89 
percent in june which is unchanged from two years earlier and a 
french rate of 109 percent in may which is up from 107 percent 
two years before 
an employment department spokesman who requested anonymity 
said were still reasonably confident that it ours is an 
accurate measure of unemployment 
lawmaker michael meacher the opposition labor partys spokesman 
on unemployment said unemployment has indeed been going down 
over the last two years but only about half as fast as the 
government has been claiming 
peter kellner a columnist for the independent newspaper wrote 
if the calculations were done differently it is doubtful 
whether the government could claim or would receive anything like 
the credit that the media and the public now bestow upon it 
paul convery a director of the unemployment unit said britons 
have become a little bit anesthetized partly because they 
generally are feeling better off economically and partly because 
the government has scored several sizable propaganda victories 
national unemployment registers have been the source for 
unemployment statistics in all common market countries except 
spain portugal and greece the unemployment unit said 
in 1982 britain alone began basing its unemployment rate on the 
number claiming unemployment benefits rather than the number 
registered as unemployed it said 
since 1979 the government has made 22 changes in the way it 
measures joblessness all except one of which have reduced the 
official unemployment rate the unemployment unit said 
the government denies that it has made that many changes or that 
its alterations are designed to make the numbers look better 
in a recent monthly unemployment report the government said it 
began counting as employed those people who are in government 
training programs that reduced the unemployment rate by 01 
percent 
the unit said the government has removed from the unemployment 
benefit lists jobless men over age 60 who receive other kinds of 
benefits 
parttime workers whose numbers are increasing have always 
been counted as employed and many jobless married women arent 
eligible for unemployment benefits it said 
another way of measuring unemployment is to conduct surveys 
which ask adults questions about their employment status this 
method is used monthly in the united states 
in britain the government uses the method once a year and 
reveals the results a year later by the survey method britain had 
an unemployment rate of 107 percent in the spring of 1987 by the 
governments regular method the rate was 108 percent 
they are so close that it shows that our own measure is 
accurate the department spokesman said

created after the great depression the savings and loan 
industry provided a simple service locals deposited their 
paychecks in governmentinsured accounts and the bank lent it back 
in home mortgages 
vernon sampl was a smalltown thrift doing that smalltown 
business 10 miles below the oklahoma border there was hardly a 
safer more plainvanilla business 
in the late 1970s high interest rates sapped the profitability 
out of sampls though congress deregulated the industry loosening 
the restraints on what rates sampls could pay depositors and opening 
up new moneymaking services 
dixon bought vernon in 1982 moved its headquarters to dallas 
and offered high rates that attracted depositors from across the 
country the deposits were guaranteed by the fslic up to 100000 
and millions of dollars flew in vernon grew a staggering 1600 
percent in less than four years even though sampls are prohibited 
from growing more than 25 percent per year 
with all those deposits vernon went on a lending binge new 
rules allowed sampls into commercial developments the changes also 
allowed loans on projects with little capital behind them and no 
down payments qualifying for loans was a snap if you knew the 
right people and were willing to pay vernons heftier fees 
the officers of vernon conducted the real estate lending 
function of vernon in a way calculated to create as much loanfee 
income as possible without particular regard to use of sound 
lending practices former vernon chief lending officer jim wright 
said in an affidavit 
new rules also allowed vernon and other sampls to become a partner 
in deals by making direct investments a risky venture 
direct investment is heads they win tails the fslic 
loses said fhlbb member roger martin 
the fslic of course usually lost 
at the highflying sampls there were tales of developers lining 
up in bank lobbies to do deals ed mcbirney then chairman of 
sunbelt savings which was known as gunbelt savings conducted 
business at a local restaurant 
western savings association grew 5700 percent under its 
chairman jarrett woods who federal regulators say took 3 
million in salary and bonuses while his sampl plunged into the red 
as the frenzied lending continued and depositors interest 
earnings had to be paid bank executives raised the interest rates 
offered even higher so more money would come in and dove into even 
riskier ventures hoping for a big payoff 
the cycle has been likened to a pyramid scheme backed by the 
insurance of the government 
many of these high fliers used their sampls as private piggy 
banks the general accounting office reported 
officials also charge that sampl executives fudged their required 
filings with regulators to make thrifts look healthier at the end 
of 1986 vernon reported a positive net worth of 17 million but 
regulators say it actually was negative 350 million ninetysix 
percent of its loans were overdue 
the fhlbb estimates the cost of cleaning up texas is 15 
billion the national total grows about 1 billion a month 
according to government projections paying off depositors will 
cost twice what the reagan administration has spent on star 
wars officials say at least 40 billion and perhaps 100 
billion 
an fbi task force which now occupies an entire floor of a 
federal building here has subpoenaed records from 290 individuals 
so far 17 sampl officials have been charged collins expects more 
indictments this fall 
when you commit armed robbery at a bank alarms go off the 
police come and sometimes theres a chase collins said 
when you commit bank fraud nothing happens theres not much 
of immediate consequence

for six months new yorks tugboat workers have 
been on strike boycotting the passenger liners and cargo ships 
that negotiate the nations busiest port 
but no one notices there has been a sea change in the maritime 
industry 
a 12day strike in 1946 practically paralyzed the city fresh 
produce disappeared coal shortages forced the closing of public 
places army and navy tugs were pressed into action but the 1988 
strike the longest in history really hasnt had an appreciable 
effect on shipping said greg storey of the new york shipping 
association 
and the 2500 strikers men like capt vinnie hilser fear the 
walkouts ineffectiveness signals the end of a way of life 
ive never had another job said hilser a resident of 
langhorne pa i came out of the marine corps and went right to 
the tugs when youre that long in one thing what else can you 
do 
hilsers comrades face a doublebarreled threat their jobs have 
been taken by replacement workers who work longer hours for lower 
pay many of them veterans of the slumping offshore oil industry in 
the gulf of mexico 
but the tug workers also must deal with a changed industry 
after world war ii some 450 tugs plied the harbor now there are 
just 170 
container ships and oil pipelines have greatly reduced the need 
for seamen and longshoremen as well as tug and barge crews barges 
are bigger some are selfpropelled and tugs more powerful so 
fewer are needed and modern ships are bigger and cheaper to 
operate they can almost berth themselves 
the liner normandie launched in 1935 needed 14 tugs to dock 
the queen elizabeth ii needs only one 
still tugs run to boston down the intercoastal waterway to 
virginia up the hudson river to the erie canal 
tug men many of whom have crewed together for years often on 
the same vessel are gone from their families for up to a fortnight 
at a time 
before the strike the usual tour was a week on a week off or 
two weeks on two weeks off winter or summer in calm water or 
heaving waves the men were aboard 24 hours a day and worked 12 
hours a day in intervals of six hours on six hours off 
the cook worked 12 straight hours serving three hot meals a day 
plus night rats or rations its the cook the union says who 
created an orderly life at sea it was he who woke the men up with 
fresh brewed coffee and put them to sleep with cookies and milk 
but the tug companies say the cooks are an extravagance and 750 
of them lost their jobs they installed microwave ovens in the 
galleys and urged the crew to take turns cooking as firefighters 
do 
cooks are not the only issue in a strike that began feb 16 the 
companies had demanded that 450 other jobs be eliminated that 
wages be cut up to 60 percent that overtime pay and weekend 
premiums be eliminated that holidays be cut back and that captains 
and mates lose union protection 
the union offered to cut labor costs 13 percent according to 
albert cornette head of local 333 of the international 
longshoremens association 
but the owners fresh from victories over tug unions in norfolk 
va baltimore and philadelphia rejected the offer there was no 
lastminute bargaining and some companies took preemptive action 
hiring security guards to eject crews days before the contract 
expired 
the replacement workers already had been hired their tours were 
stretched to 30 days on two weeks off 
the companies cut crews from six to four or five or even to 
three depending on whether the tug is making an inshore or 
offshore trip wages for deckhands dropped from 175 a day to 80 
engineers from 245 to 170 
it cost about 2100 a day to operate a unionmanned tugboat 
before the strike now operating costs have been slashed to about 
800 a day 
when they talk about how much money we make a day says cook 
richard anson they forget we work 12 hours but what about the 
other 12 hours we cant go home were shanghaied 
the owners dont want to sit and bargain the way we did with 
their fathers said frank gragnani a tug captain for 42 years 
and union leader they fell into money they dont know how to 
work for money 
there have been no talks since the start of the strike the 
national labor relations board issued a complaint against the 
owners alleging failure to bargain in good faith and set an oct 
27 hearing 
company officials through lawyers declined numerous interview 
requests 
picket lines at remote piers are few and limited in size by a 
federal injunction sought by employers in the early days of the 
strike to curb violence 
firebombs were tossed a shot was fired into a tugs wheelhouse 
fist fights erupted windshields were smashed and rocks thrown 
at the unions rundown storefront strike headquarters near the 
staten island wharfs they track turncoats on the war 
board which lists more than 150 men who returned to work this 
scum sold out their union friends shipmates and family a sign 
says 
after six months the strike is taking its toll some strikers 
have sold their cars or taken out second mortgages others have 
taken jobs we have people painting flipping hamburgers doing 
things they would never have done said gragnani who charged a 
1000 cash loan to his credit card 
the strikers are not entirely shackled to the land a small 
picket boat accosts tugs manned by those who cross picket lines 
patrick egan a tug cook enjoyed jeering through a megaphone as 
the boat pulled alongside a barge owned by one of the struck 
companies 
how much did they cut your pay you slimy turncoat you scab 
you galley roach egan shouted 
its not that we like to curse but we cant help it 
gragnani explained screaming lets you get your animosity out if 
you hold it all in you get sick

despite the cropwithering drought in 
the united states european farmers are unlikely to take many new 
customers away from americans in the fiercely competitive export 
market analysts say 
the united states is expected to draw down on surplus stocks so 
that it can continue its export push and hold onto clients 
indeed the droughts major impact on europe may be to 
strengthen the negotiating hand of europeans who have been 
resisting us demands for dramatic changes in agricultural 
policies that heavily subsidize farmers 
the dry weather has sent world commodity prices soaring 
with higher world prices the european economic community the 
trading bloc that handles much of the agricultural policies for 12 
european nations will have to pay out less in subsidies mostly 
those to push foreign sales 
that will ease the money pressure on the community analysts 
said to scale back its farm aid program as the reagan 
administration would like 
it couldnt have come at a worst time said a us 
government source who demanded anonymity it takes away a lot of 
financial pressure because the eec next year will be swimming in 
budget resources 
the only real beneficiary will be the eecs farm 
budget said tim odell international economist at the london 
brokerage of phillips amp drew 
the amount of subsidies the european community farm budget has 
to pay farmers will have to be reduced he said 
roger brinner chief economist at the consulting firm of data 
resources inc in lexington mass agreed since world prices 
have risen to a certain extent the european governments have to 
make up less of the shortfall to farmers 
the drought could translate into savings of at least 15 
billion to 2 billion in subsidies for grains and oilseeds in the 
eecs 1989 farm budget the us source estimated 
nico wegter a spokesman for the trading bloc said there was no 
official estimate of the impact of the drought on the farm budget 
budget ministers of the eecs member nations recently approved a 
draft budget that calls for funneling 315 billion to farm 
payments in 1989 under the spending outline those payments would 
drain off 59 percent of the trading blocs total budget 
the eec provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million farmers 
through guaranteed prices for many of their crops 
in addition the community gives exporters help so costlier 
european agricultural products can compete internationally 
the exporters receive refunds which amount to the difference 
between the price they must pay to buy the european goods and the 
lower price they earn for the products on the world market 
the united states complains the export subsidies have helped the 
eec to increase its share of world market sales and has responded 
with its own export enhancement program 
the program designed to stimulate overseas sales pays surplus 
farm commodities held in government bins to exporters the trade 
bill recently passed by congress extends the program for two 
years with a 25 billion price tag 
analysts for the us department of agriculture have said that 
although the drought is hurting crop production it will have 
little effect on exports this year 
brinner predicted that european farmers would make no 
permanent inroads into the export markets 
in agriculture he said you dont lose a customer forever 
if you have the goods theyll buy from you 
however if the drought continues next year and stocks are low 
the united states could not keep up the same level of exports 
the eecs extensive farm support system has been a sore point 
between the trading bloc and the united states which is pressing 
the europeans to get rid of tradedistorting subsidies by the year 
2000 
community officials have rejected the reagan administration 
proposal 
it would be absolutely unreasonable to think we could leave 
the bulk of the farmers to market conditions wegter said 
some european officials argue the drought proves the weakness of 
the us argument it shows they say the weatherdependent 
agricultural sector must be handled gingerly 
you cant just deal with it in the same way as the industrial 
sector said wegter it needs to be treated in a specific way 
in february european leaders began the politically sensitive 
task of curbing payments to farmers they agreed to limit the 
maximum annual amount of expenditure on price guarantees over the 
next five years 
us officials maintain the measures were not extensive enough 
to alter a fundamentally flawed policy 
the thorny issue will receive fresh attention in december in 
montreal at a review of the uruguay round of international trade 
negotiations the talks are held under the auspices of the 
96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade which seeks to 
liberalize trade among countries 
the eec is made up of belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands 
portugal and spain

delta air lines is in the market for a new 
longrange aircraft and hopes to place an order by the end of the 
year but its size and the type of plane have yet to be decided a 
delta spokesman said 
jim lundy a spokesman for atlantabased delta made the 
comments after the wall street journal reported thursday that the 
airline was considering placing an order for as much as 6 billion 
in new planes 
if made the order would be a record for commercial plane sales 
the biggest on record is a 46 billion order placed with aircraft 
maker boeing co earlier this year by international lease finance 
corp of beverly hills calif 
what i can confirm for you is that we are indeed in the market 
for a new longrange airplane lundy said the size of the 
order will depend on which airplane we select and what we see as 
our longrange need it really is too early to say 
the journal reported that delta is considering rival offers from 
boeing and mcdonnell douglas corp for a transaction that would 
include as many as 30 to 40 jumbo jets and 70 to 100 smaller 
twinjets 
lundy confirmed that delta is interested in exploring propfan 
technology on its new jets propfan engines combine propeller 
technology with traditional turbofan jet engines to produce a 
quieter more fuelefficient engine 
lundy noted that when delta placed 80 orders and options for 
mcdonnell douglas md88 plane two years ago a required condition 
was being able to retrofit the aircraft with propfan engines 
deltas interest in propfans hinges on whether the performance 
of the engine and the fuel savings and noise reductions turn out to 
be as good as the predictions lundy said 
without being specific lundy said delta is interested in new 
planes not just to replace existing aircraft but as part of an 
expansion program on foreign routes delta currently serves more 
than 150 cities including three in the pacific rim and seven in 
europe 
david jimenez a boeing spokesman in seattle would not comment 
on the journal report citing the companys policy never to comment 
on sales efforts until a sale is finalized 
boeing officials early this year discussed how their 7j7 program 
to develop a fuelefficient propfan plane was delayed for at least 
a year because of lack of airline interest 
boeing was to decide last august whether to go ahead with 7j7 
development for a 1992 introduction but the decision was delayed 
setting the program back at least a year boeing later scaled back 
its 7j7 workforce from 900 to 300

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended aug 8 the 
federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 30255 billion from 30263 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38248 billion from 38218 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 7819 billion from 7842 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30163 billion a 57 
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 38033 billion up at an annual rate of 57 
percent while m1 rose at an annual rate of 63 percent to an 
average of 7772 billion 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent

percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987

whatever action there was thursday seemed confined to takeover

limited to professional investors who locked in small gains by 
selling late in the day

lackluster is that they wind up the rumor mill said philip c 
puccio senior vice president and manager of institutional trading 
at dillon read amp co in new york its the only thing that gets 
the adrenalin pumping 
some analysts were slightly more optimistic about the market 
prospects based on what they called the resilience of prices in 
the face of disappointing news on the trade deficit earlier this 
week that suggested most selling had been drained from the market 
and buyers could step in 
paul campbell a vice president at nikko securities co 
international in new york said he believed the dow average might 
take a swing at 2050 but that should about do it

for the rally were unrealistic 
elsewhere frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily 
limit most livestock futures gained copper and precious metals 
moved up crop and energy futures were mostly higher and 
stockindex futures advanced 
the weather has been dry in brazil the worlds largest 
coffeeproducing nation but thats not unusual analysts said 
they normally get barely any rainfall between may and august 
and the fact that theyve had maybe a little less than barely any 
is really having very little impact on the crop said sandra 
kaul coffee market analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york 
she said the brazilian coffee crop would not enter its flowering 
stage the next phase of development in which normal rainfall is 
essential until midseptember 
arthur stevenson coffee market analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york said the current dry spell might have 
reminded traders of a drought that damaged the brazilian coffee 
crop in the fall of 1985 
i suppose some people are looking for a repeat performance but 
the market is anticipating something that hasnt happened yet 
stevenson said 
more likely other analysts said traders holding positions 
obligating them to buy coffee at a future date were talking up the 
possibility of drought damage in hopes of driving prices higher so 
they could sell at a profit 
coffee for delivery in september settled 392 cents higher at 
12209 a pound 
frozen pork belly futures soared the daily 2centsapound limit 
on the chicago mercantile exchange in a rally motivated by 
technical rather than supplyanddemand factors analysts said 
theres still a big supply of bellies available and theyre 
moving right now but theyre supposed to said michael murphy 
an analyst in chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
the strong belly market supported hog futures while most cattle 
futures gained on reports of continued strength in the cash cattle 
markets he said 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 47 cent higher with august 
at 7122 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to 30 
cent higher with august at 82 cents a pound hogs were 35 cent 
lower to 85 cent higher with august at 4740 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with august at 
3670 cents a pound 
copper futures moved sharply higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange on supply concerns linked to a strike at the sudbury 
ontario facilities of the canadian mining company falconbridge 
ltd analysts said 
world inventories of copper have been fairly tight for more than 
a year and while falconbridge is not a major producer any signs of 
futher tightening tend to prod this sleeping bull market said 
george anagnos an analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
copper for september delivery settled 295 cents higher at 9725 
cents a pound 
gold and silver futures advanced slightly in featureless trading 
on the comex

board of trade with support stemming from rumors the soviet union

northrop corp has announced plans to 
restructure its debt by converting up to 450 million of shortterm 
bank loans to intermediateterm notes sold privately to investors 
the wall street journal quoted unidentified sources wednesday as 
saying the private placement represented a change from earlier 
plans to sell notes to the public and said the switch was brought 
about by concern over investigations into the companys dealings in 
south korea 
but northrop spokesman tony cantafio denied wednesday that plans 
for the debt offering had been changed saying the company had been 
considering various alternatives for converting the debt since 
first announcing its intention to do so in april 
we explored a number of financing alternatives available to us 
and the private placement plan was adopted in july cantafio 
said 
plans for a private sale of notes were revealed in the companys 
secondquarter report 
the journal quoting an unidentified investment banker who had 
dealt with northrop on the matter said the company originally 
planned to sell notes to the public 
the investment banker said the public offering had been ruled 
out for fear approval of the offering could be delayed if the 
securities and exchange commission decided to study the companys 
activities in south korea 
a private placement involving sale of notes to institutions and 
wealthy individuals would be exempt from registration with the sec 
a congressional committee and a federal grand jury in los 
angeles are looking into payments the company made to korean 
companies and individuals in 1984 and 1986 in connection with 
attempts to sell its illfated f20 fighter jet to the south korean 
government northrop denies any impropriety 
the sale of notes is intended to reduce the risk that rising 
interest rates could push up the cost of servicing the companys 
905 million worth of shortterm floatinginterestrate bank 
loans the notes would have fixed interest rates
