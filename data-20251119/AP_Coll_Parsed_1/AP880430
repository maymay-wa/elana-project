juveniles cause more than 60 percent of the crime 
in china the crimes they commit are becoming more violent the 
official china daily reported today 
the newspaper quoted xu jian vice president of china research 
association of juvenile delinquency as saying the rate of juvenile 
crime is 12 per 10000 of the same age group 
he said that was more than double the overall crime rate of 5 
per 10000 people but still much lower than in developed countries 
xu gave no figures for juvenile crimes or what age group is 
classified as juveniles 
he said youths who in the past mainly committed minor offenses 
such as petty thefts and fighting are now engaged in robberies 
violent assaults and rapes xu attributed the rise in juvenile 
crime to the lack of proper laws the spread of pornography the 
increasing numbers of working parents and divorce 
girls mainly involved in hooliganism a general term for 
unsocial behavior or sex crimes made up 186 percent of juvenile 
criminals in 1985 up from 10 percent in 1983 he said

future and called for a national network to educate and prevent 
youths from committing crimes

opec moved one major step closer today to 
an agreement that could slightly increase oil prices and set the 
stage for closer coordination with oil producers outside its ranks 
but clinching the deal required the approval of oil ministers 
from saudi arabia and its three persian gulf arab allies who said 
they needed to consult their governments first 
a meeting of all opec oil ministers was set for tonight at 
cartel headquarters but it was not certain a final decision would 
be made then 
eight of the 13 members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries agreed in a meeting that ended early today to a 
proposed 2 percent cut in opecs total oil production according to 
oil ministers from iran and venezuela 
the cuts would be for may and june only said venezuelan oil 
minister arturo hernandez grisanti 
the saudis earlier indicated they opposed production cuts 
believing prices would rebound soon anyway since oil demand is 
likely to rise this summer 
saudi king fahd said in a newspaper interview thursday that opec 
should simply stick to its current set of production quotas which 
often are exceeded he did not explicitly rule out cuts as small as 
those proposed in vienna 
besides saudi arabia the others saying they wanted to think it 
over were kuwait qatar and the united arab emirates 
iraq which is not party to opecs existing agreement on 
production limits was not expected to take part in the proposed 
cuts hernandez said 
the eight that tentatively accepted the deal this morning were 
iran algeria libya nigeria gabon venezuela ecuador and 
indonesia the proposal was put on the table by algeria 
the proposed cuts in output in conjunction with similarly small 
cuts by a group of six independent oilproducing nations would 
remove a total of 500000 barrels a day from the world oil market 
the goal is to lift oil prices to opecs target of 18 a 
42gallon barrel from the range now of between 14 and 16 
oil prices on the open market moved erratically in nervous 
trading friday prices fell more than 60 cents a barrel in europe 
but recovered in later us trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange june contracts for west 
texas intermediate the main us grade of oil closed at 1799 a 
barrel up one cent from thursday at one point the price was off 
43 cents but then recovered 
the proposed opec cuts are so small that analysts said the main 
effect on the market would be psychological for opec the 
principal benefit would be establishing closer ties to rival oil 
producers who in recent years have weakened opec by taking away 
its market share 
opec and nonopec producers have never before formally agreed to 
mutual cuts in production although mexico has informally sought to 
align its policies with opec 
the nonopec countries involved in the current proposal are 
mexico egypt china oman malaysia and angola 
representatives of these independent producers were in vienna 
earlier this week for talks with a committee of six opec oil 
ministers they left before opecs meeting began thursday so it 
was not immediately clear if they would be satisfied with the 
proposed cut of 2 percent or 300000 barrels a day in opec 
production 
the nonopec group stipulated it would cut its oil exports by 5 
percent or 200000 barrels a day only if opec made similar 
proportional reductions it was not more precise about the 
reciprocity 
regardless of the outcome of the talks on production cuts opec 
intended to step up contacts with the nonopec group in hopes of 
establishing a regular dialogue that could lead to more 
coordination of production and pricing policy in the future 
several oil ministers said 
we must send a positive signal to them said gholamreza 
aghazadeh the oil minister of iran

panamanian opposition leaders are reacting 
angrily to a proposed deal under which military strongman manuel 
antonio noriega would resign his post but remain in panama at least 
temporarily instead of going into exile 
us officials confirmed friday that noriega agreed during 
negotiations with the reagan administration to step down as 
commander of the defense forces but that he had rejected us 
efforts to persuade him to leave the country immediately after 
resigning 
the washington post said noriega is expected to step down in a 
matter of weeks and would prefer to live in the dominican republic 
if he is forced into exile 
panamanian ambassador juan b sosa a leader of the antinoriega 
forces in washington reacted sharply to word of the proposed 
agreement he accused the united states of going beyond its 
authority in trying to negotiate panamas political future 
that issue he said in an interview has to be negotiated by 
panamanians 
he said noriega by remaining in panama would be able to 
wield his considerable influence because of the many 
panamanians in the defense forces and in other key positions who 
are loyal to him 
a us official insisting on anonymity acknowledged that the 
arrangement was less than ideal because it does not contemplate 
noriegas shortterm departure from panama 
sosa has remained on as panamas ambassador to the united 
states refusing to relinquish the embassy to a replacement envoy 
named by panamanian president manuel solis palma 
sosa and the united states share the view that president eric 
arturo delvalle deposed on feb 26 by noriegas supporters 
continues to be the legitimate authority in panama 
in miami roberto eisenmann exiled publisher of the closed 
independent newspaper la prensa said this sounds like a 
surrender with cosmetics this is the same mistake all over again 
the united states intervening in panama ignoring totally the 
political forces of the country 
gilberto mallol miami representative of the panamanian 
opposition umbrella group the civic crusade agreed 
this cosmetic solution will only take the country down the 
road to disaster said mallol the reagan administration has no 
right to decide noriega can remain in panama 
mallol disputed us contentions that noriega will be out of 
power as soon as he is out of uniform obviously this deal shows 
noriega is making conditions he will continue to interfere and 
continue the militarization of panama 
mallol warned that the deal could backfire on the united states 
causing a wave of antiamerican sentiment among noriega opponents 
the administration has been seeking noriegas ouster since he 
was indicted in early february on drug smuggling charges by two 
florida grand juries 
spain has offered to give noriega political asylum and as an 
inducement to him the administration has said it would make no 
effort to extradite him if he accepted the spanish bid 
the administration has refused to recognize panamas 2monthold 
government and has frozen panamanian government assets in the 
united states among other measures these steps have contributed 
to the collapse of the panamanian economy

the reagan administration is expanding the 
us military role in the persian gulf saying it will not stand 
by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed in attacks on 
neutral ships 
under a policy announced friday by defense secretary frank c 
carlucci us forces will go to the aid of noncommunist neutral 
ships that are fired on and ask for help 
previously the umbrella of us protection had covered only 
americanflagged vessels and 11 kuwaiti oil tankers that were 
allowed to register last summer as usflag vessels 
the new policy approved by president reagan at a white house 
meeting friday is aimed chiefly at iran which us officials 
blame for nearly all of the attacks on ships outside declared 
warexclusion zones however carlucci said the policy should not 
be viewed as a tilt in either direction in the nearly 
eightyear war between iran and iraq 
reagans order came 11 days after american warships and aircraft 
clashed with iranian forces in the gulf sinking or disabling six 
iranian vessels the battles erupted following a navy attack on 
iranian oil platforms in retaliation for the mining of a us 
frigate 
describing the new policy carlucci said we are not the 
policeman of the gulf nor do we wish to be 
for over 200 years us policy has been to help protect 
freedom of navigation in international waters this new 
assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events 
in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this 
principle 
we cannot stand by and watch innocent people be killed or 
maimed by malicious lawless actions when we have the means to 
assist and perhaps prevent them we do not intend to describe our 
specific rules of engagement or the methods we plan to use in 
rendering this assistance 
carlucci said the new policy will be provided to friendly 
innocent neutral vessels flying a nonbelligerent flag outside 
declared warexclusion zones that are not carrying contraband or 
resisting legitimate visit and search by a persian gulf 
belligerent 
an administration official said the policy will put a little 
more pressure on iran to accept a ceasefire and withdrawal to 
prewar borders 
most of irans attacks on ships have been in open territorial 
waters that will be covered by the new policy said the official 
declining to be identified by contrast iraqs attacks have been 
confined largely to socalled exclusionary zones that are not 
covered 
the official noted that the protective coverage does not apply 
to ships from communist countries and emphasized that skippers 
must request aid before an american ship renders assistance 
currently the navy has 17 ships in the gulf including six 
minesweepers and 10 others in nearby waters the current 
protective effort costs 1 million a day 
carlucci said that he does not anticipate the new policy will 
require an increase in us forces 
the marine corps meanwhile declared that two officers who were 
listed as missing after the fighting 11 days earlier were killed 
in action and disclosed that they had reported a hostile radar 
had locked on their helicopter gunship before it disappeared 
in a statement the corps refused to say the ah1t cobra gunship 
flown by capt stephen c leslie 30 of new bern nc and capt 
kenneth w hill 33 of thomasville nc had definitely been shot 
down by iranian forces as iran has claimed

the house says the reagan administration ought 
to talk with nato countries and japan about spending more for 
defense but has rejected calls to bring american troops home if 
that isnt done 
the decisions were part of the democraticcontrolled houses 
effort to write a pentagon budget bill for the fiscal year starting 
oct 1 
the house voted 3590 late friday afternoon to approve a 
proposal calling for the administration to initiate talks with 
japan and nato member nations about sharing the burden for defense 
the house vote came as the pentagon released its 1988 report on 
allied contributions to the common defense an annual 
assessment mandated by congress 
the report was accompanied by a personal pledge from defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to press at every opportunity for 
progress in sharing the burdens of the alliance 
carlucci said the reports principal conclusion is that the 
allies are making more of a contribution than they receive credit 
for but he said there are substantial variations in performance 
among individual allies 
the house vote echoed a similar proposal approved last summer by 
congress but the administration hasnt yet pushed hard for the 
talks 
both house and senate members have criticized western europe and 
japan for failing to spend more on defense they note that the 
united states spends about 69 percent of its gross national 
product on defense a far larger share than other western nations 
despite the criticism congress has refused for three years to 
order sanctions against japan and the alliance a refusal that was 
continued friday by the house 
the united states has about 326000 troops stationed in europe 
and 63000 in japan 
by a 240120 vote the house rejected a proposal by rep john 
bryant dtexas to bring 30000 troops a year back from europe and 
7000 troops a year from japan starting in 1991 
minutes later it voted 33221 to reject a plan by rep tommy 
robinson dark to withdraw 70000 troops a year from europe 
lets get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect 
them to pay their fair share bryant said we are subsidizing 
their defense 
robinson made a similar appeal telling his colleagues the 
real purpose of this amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that 
weve had it these people are stealing our jobs because we have 
been suckered into paying for their defense 
but rep curt weldon rpa said the issue should be 
considered in a clear process and not on an emotional basis 
it is simply not possible to maintain the viability of a 
voluntary alliance of free countries if one of those countries 
tries to impose standards on the others said rep stephen 
solarz dny 
but rep david obey dwis said its time uncle sam quit 
being taken for uncle sucker 
the spending bill would authorize the pentagon to spend 2995 
billion in the fiscal year starting oct 1 which is the same 
amount proposed by the separate bill that will be considered next 
month by the senate differences between the bills eventually will 
be reconciled by a housesenate conference committee 
the pentagon report said that the 61 percent of gross national 
product spent by greece for defense in 1986 was the closest to the 
us share 
england was third with 51 percent followed by turkey at 48 
percent and france at 39 percent 
all of the remaining nations have shares of 32 percent or 
less the study found 
the report used 1986 data because that is the most recent year 
for which figures were available

a senate ethics panel says comments by sen 
david durenberger on an espionage case hurt relations between 
congress and intelligence agencies but durenberger says the harm 
already had been done by the late cia chief william casey 
durenberger was chastised friday by the senate ethics committee 
as it closed an investigation that began last year after the 
minnesota republican publicly discussed an espionage case involving 
the united states and israel 
the committee told durenberger in a letter the ethics 
committee has determined that your statements gave the appearance 
that you were disclosing sensitive national security information 
and such appearance jeopardized the mutual confidence which must 
exist between the congress and the intelligence community 
because the committee has concluded that your actions were not 
intentional deliberate nor attended with gross negligence and 
because of the particular facts of this case we will not recommend 
that the senate take institutional action against you however the 
committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your 
actions 
the ethics investigation centered on comments durenberger made 
at an event sponsored by the american israel public affairs 
committee in palm beach fla on march 15 1987 
durenberger reportedly disclosed to the group that casey in 1982 
had changed the rules under which allies did not spy on each 
other by recruiting an israeli military officer to spy on israel 
for the united states 
durenbergers comments were said to be aimed at giving context 
to the case of jonathan jay pollard an american convicted of 
spying on the united states for israel 
durenberger said he based his remarks on newspaper accounts and 
maintained that he exercised due care in preparation for the 
speech 
the former chairman of the select committee on intelligence 
issued a statement saying he was pleased that the committee had 
concluded its investigation and determined that no action was 
necessary but he added 
the late cia director william caseys fundamental disagreement 
over the philosophy of congressional oversight led to frequent 
clashes with the intelligence committee 
director casey was a strong leader loyal to his own view of 
the public interest but his belief that congress should play 
little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual 
confidence long before march 1987 
he added i respectfully disagree with the ethic committees 
conclusion that my statements gave the appearance that i was 
disclosing sensitive information 
sources present at the palm beach meeting and who said they took 
careful notes reported that durenberger said the cia recruited its 
israeli spy after israels 1982 invasion of lebanon the spy passed 
along sensitive information about the invasion durenberger 
reportedly told the group 
in a separate statement friday senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan said durenberger was an excellent chairman during one of 
the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight 
i had just as much confidence in dave before the ethics committee 
examination as i do right now 
the ethics committee letter was signed by sens howell heflin 
dala david pryor dark terry sanford dnc warren rudman 
rnh jesse helms rnc and nancy kassebaum rkan

the occupational safety and health 
administration wants employers to put warning tags on machinery 
that has been shut off to prevent injuries and deaths caused when 
the machines are turned on while being cleaned or serviced 
nine years and 1000 deaths after unions first pleaded for 
action on one of the single biggest causes of industrial accidents 
the agency issued proposed regulations friday on socalled 
tagouts and lockouts 
the proposals appeared in the federal register a week after 
senate labor committee chairman edward m kennedy dmass said 
the delay showed the reagan administrations decision to let 
workers die while waiting on a standard 
osha officials testified last week at a senate hearing chaired 
by kennedy that the proposed regulations had been completed by the 
agency in early 1987 but had languished at the white house for 
nearly a year 
about 7 percent of all occupational fatalities and 2 per cent of 
accidentcaused injuries in the workplace occur now because such 
equipment is inadvertently restarted while someone is working on it 
the agency estimated friday that the socalled 
performanceoriented regulations will save 122 lives and 
prevent 60000 job injuries a year but they would require 
employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and 
minimize the potential for inadvertently reactivating it 
very simple lockout tagout measures which taken only a few 
minutes can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries 
in some major manufacturing industries said assistant labor 
secretary john a pendergrass 
agency officials estimated it will be a minimum of another year 
before the regulations are actually enacted 
unions had begun petitioning the agency for the regulations in 
1979 
john molovich a safety specialist for the united steelworkers 
union predicted employers will ignore the guidelines and take 
the cheapest way out by using cardboard warning tags instead of 
locks to prevent a machine from being turned on 
there will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment 
wont start he said 
the regulations if adopted in current form will apply to only 
16 million employers and cover only 39 million workers most of 
them in manufacturing osha estimated the annual cost of compliance 
to businesses at 135 million 
exempted are millions of companies and workers in agriculture 
oil and gas drilling electric utilities the maritime industry and 
construction osha said protections for them will be included in 
other regulations to be proposed later 
james scully an osha official who worked on the regulations for 
more than a decade testified at the senate labor committee 
hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them 
back in 1977 
but osha took no serious action until 1979 when the united auto 
workers union reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in 
related accidents the previous five years formally asked the 
government for emergency action 
osha denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from 
other unions

tens of thousands of christian activists 
braved cold damp weather to hear a message of support from 
president reagan as they prayed for the sins of the nation and 
the scandalplagued evangelical movement 
it has been prayer which has strengthened this nation to 
weather storms both here and abroad reagan told the group friday 
in a videotaped message i am convinced that prayer has made it 
possible for me to continue in this office 
us park police estimated that the dawntodusk washington 
for jesus in 88 rally attracted 150000 people 
organizers emphasized the racial ethnic and religious diversity 
of the crowd they said they hoped the gathering would show all 
americans that christians remain as ardent and unified as ever 
despite the wellpublicized downfall of television evangelists 
jimmy swaggart and jim and tammy bakker 
the world thought the scandals of the last year brought the 
church to its knees james kennedy of coral ridge presbyterian 
church in florida said the church will arise from its knees 
cleaner and purer and stronger 
the gathering was meant to be nonpolitical which was why 
organizers said republican presidential candidate pat robertson was 
not invited robertson was one of the main speakers at a similar 
rally in washington eight years ago 
in fact reagan was the only national political figure to speak 
to the crowd 
today american society must face serious problems from 
within and without which threaten to steal our liberties and 
destroy our freedoms reagan said abortion child abuse 
pornography and drug addiction eat away at our most precious 
national resource our children 
yet we do not falter in the face of such evil for there is a 
wind of prayer blowing throughout our land 
earlier evangelist oral roberts of tulsa okla made a brief 
speech recalling how a man of god laid hands on him and cured 
him of tuberculosis when he was 17 
i stand here today 53 years later with my lungs sound and 
whole my body healed by the power of god he said as members of 
the audience applauded 
one of the first speakers of the day was the rev gerald 
derstine of bradenton fla who urged christians to offer 
prayers of repentance for the sins of the naion 
i am talking about drug addiction alcoholism and suicides we 
feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we 
believe abortion still is an issue derstine said 
such sentiments were echoed in the banners and signs carried by 
rally participants one banner said take drugs out of our 
schools and put god back in another sign said jesus forgives 
sinning let him 
one of the rallygoers michael goldbloom assistant pastor of 
full gospel tabernacle in philadelphia said he thought it 
significant that the rally was being held in the nations capital 
i believe a public display of prayer and repentence will let 
washington know and the country know that people still love god

an indicted new york city mobster says la cosa 
nostra families use murder to enforce their internal rules but 
insists we dont kill innocent people 
vincent the fish cafaro who was a soldier in the 
genovese organized crime family told senators friday the 
organization was very disciplined and members paid a high price 
for breaking the rules 
killings were mandatory for fooling around with another 
members wife and dealing in drugs he said 
when it comes to an amico nostras wife or junk there was no 
talk cafaro said an amico nostra is a member of a mob family 
and junk means narcotics 
cafaro said mob members also could get murdered for ratting 
refusing to go on a hit if asked or knowingly killing a cop or 
other law enforcement agent 
to win approval to carry out a murder cafaro said mob members 
had to go through the chain of command right up to the boss of the 
family 
but he insisted we dont kill innocent people 
unlike witnesses who spoke from behind a screen cafaro a 
thin balding man with glasses testified in full public view 
before the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations 
he currently is in custody while awaiting trial in new york on 
racketeering extortion and conspiracy charges after his arrest in 
1986 he cooperated with federal authorities and even carried a 
concealed microphone while talking to other mobsters 
but cafaro said personal safety concerns have persuaded him to 
end the effort and he was heavily guarded in the hearing room 
im fair game no question about it he said 
cafaro said he had worked for the mob since 1958 as an 
associate of fat tony salerno a major figure in the genovese 
family salerno who cafaro said was like a father to me is 
now on trial in new york on charges related to mob activities 
cafaro also told the committee headed by sen sam nunn dga 
that four organized crime families run the highrise construction 
industry in new york city through control over the concrete 
industry and construction unions 
he said bids were rigged and that contractors and unions 
winning construction jobs had to kick back 2 percent of the 
contract price to the mob 
cafaro said the system was arranged through the 2 percent 
club an organization run by the genovese gambino lucchese and 
colombo families 
he estimated that at least 50 percent of the highrise 
construction in new york had a mob connection and added 
legitimate guys aint got a chance to win contracts for those 
buildings 
cafaro said each of the four mob families had an expert on the 
construction business in the organization members read the dodge 
reports a construction trade publication that lists upcoming jobs 
he said 
the club members split up all of the jobs over 2 million 
he said but if the contract went over 5 million it went to a 
mobrun company s amp a concrete he said 
when the smaller contractors complained of the arrangement he 
said they won the right to split all jobs over 3 million 
as a mob soldier who turned down promotions because he didnt 
want the added responsibility cafaro said he preferred to run the 
numbers business in west harlem 
i had some bad years but in a good year i could make as much 
as 2 million or more he said 
when nunn asked if he kept the money cafaro said i spent it 
i gave it away i loaned a lot of money to people and never got it 
back the mobster said he only carried cash

a preliminary report for april shows that 
prices farmers got for raw products were unchanged on average for 
the second month in a row but were still 4 percent above a year ago 
but the report friday by the agriculture department also said 
that farm production expenses have crept higher in recent months 
prices were higher for soybeans cattle hay and oranges and 
lower for lettuce eggs milk and strawberries the departments 
agricultural statistics board said 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses were up 18 percent from january and averaged 37 percent 
more than in april 1987 
higher prices for feeder pigs fertilizer agricultural 
chemicals tractors and other machinery contributed most to the 
increase from january the report said 
department economists say net cash income of farmers set a 
record in 1987 of about 57 billion this years net the 
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses may be in the 
range of 50 billion to 55 billion 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent

according to the preliminary april figures based mostly on 
midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock products 
was unchanged from march but was up 07 percent from a year ago

crop prices overall were up 09 percent from march and averaged 
99 percent more than a year ago 
the price index for oilbearing crops which consist mainly of 
soybeans was up 33 percent from march and averaged 22 percent 
more than in april 1987 soybeans prices at 636 per bushel were 
up 30 cents during the month 
prices paid to commercial vegetable growers overall dropped 
44 percent from march and also were down 44 percent from a year 
ago 
the prices of most individual vegetables rose from march to 
april but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop 
for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices 
april farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base 
used for comparison according to the preliminary figures the same 
as in march and february a year ago the april index was 125 
percent 
the quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in april 
down two percentage points from the revised january reading of 53 
percent the revised parity ratio for april 1987 also was 51 
percent 
although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded 
because it doesnt take into full account changes in farm 
productivity others contend the ratio is useful in comparing 
yeartoyear changes 
under the parity formula prices farmers get for commodities are 
compared with prices they pay to meet expenses it then uses a 
191014 measurement to express what happened at 100 percent the 
indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying 
power as they had in 191014 
for example the average price of wheat in april was 281 per 
bushel according to the preliminary figures that was 40 percent 
of the parity price of 707 per bushel 
the report also said 
cattle averaged 6890 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 6830 in march and above the 6260 reported 
for april 1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as 
beef 
hogs averaged 4180 per 100 pounds compared with 4220 in 
march and 5080 a year earlier 
corn at 185 a bushel was down from 186 in march but was 
up from the average of 152 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 281 per bushel compared with 274 in march and 263 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 841 per 100 pounds compared with 879 in 
march and 363 a year earlier 
soybeans were 636 per bushel compared with 606 in march 
and 490 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 573 cents per pound compared 
with 577 in march and 504 cents in april 1987 
eggs were 455 cents per dozen compared with 508 cents in 
march and 548 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1170 per 100 pounds compared with 1190 in march 
and 1220 a year earlier 
broilers were 28 cents per pound live weight compared with 
275 cents in march and 292 cents a year ago

the senior prom returned to forrest 
city high school on friday more than 25 years after it was banned 
by school officials 
im gonna do da bump john williams an 18yearold senior 
said as he made his appearance at the forrest city civic center 
dressed all in white but for a black snapbrim hat and black cane 
the last prom was in 1962 said principal oscar collins who 
helped plan the last one as a senior class sponsor early in his 
career 
he said he didnt know what had prompted the ban i was just 
a teacher at the time noting that it wouldnt have been a 
racial issue because the first black student didnt enter the 
school until 1965 
that was before integration after that the board voted not 
to have them any more collins said 
however the student council officers decided not to have a king 
and queen for the new prom partly because the couple might be 
racially mixed the arkansas gazette reported friday 
the newspapers assertion was disputed by kaki dunn 17 
recording secretary for the council we decided not to have a 
prom king and queen because we feel that were all kings and 
queens she said we talked about it and said no we dont 
want to do that 
more than half the 355 seniors were expected to attend the dance 
in the forrest city civic center student council president 
tangella brown said 
assistant principal tom bridges said he expected the crowd to be 
about evenly divided between black and white students like the 
composition of the 1450student school 
i dont think thats even been thought about bridges said 
the town of about 14000 45 miles west of memphis tenn is 
about evenly divided between black and white 
the boys wore black white or gray but the colors of the girls 
gowns ranged across the spectrum and skirt lengths were anywhere 
between the ankles and the knees 
three couples stepped out of a stretch limouisine from a funeral 
home the driver holding the door then at the request of a tv 
crew they got back in and did it again 
jack mcnair 18 sharply dressed in an army junior rotc uniform 
came all the way from benton 125 miles to the west to escort his 
cousin lori martin 18 
precautions were taken to avoid any problems at the prom 
bridges said 
therell be strictly no drinking he said we dont allow 
smoking anyway at the school so therell be no smoking at the 
prom no drinking no drugs students who leave the prom will not 
be able to return he said 
and there wont be any press or anything like that bridges 
said its going to be strictly for the kids 
the forrest city school board voted last fall to allow the 
student council to sponsor a prom for 1988s graduating seniors 
we just thought it was time for us to do like other folks 
school board member bill baxter said after that meeting 
its a milestone said mayor danny ferguson a 1967 graduate 
of the school people in forrest city are pulling together to 
project a positive image 
no dances have been sponsored by the school since 1962 not even 
informal hops in the gym ms brown said this week 
theyve had them but they were provided by different 
fraternities or different sororities said ms brown 17 who is 
black but as for those provided by the school this will be the 
first 
the private dances collins said have been strictly black or 
white affairs none of them integrated 
the theme chosen for the prom was a night on the town said 
bridges 
theyve got skyscrapers and all that he said itll look 
pretty good

health secretary otis r bowen in a move 
acknowledged by the white house to be a little unusual is 
taking public issue with the assertion that the administration is 
winning the war on drugs 
generally speaking mr president i prefer optimism to 
pessimism as you do bowen told reagan and three cabinet 
colleagues at a meeting of the national drug policy board but 
today i dont know how i can honestly be very optimistic about the 
war on drugs 
bowen said reagans leadership has resulted in major gains 
were winning some battles he said but its difficult 
for me to say were winning the war especially when we consider 
drug dealing and use in our streets and our homes 
a text of bowens remarks at the private white house meeting on 
thursday was made public friday by the department of health and 
human services 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged afterward 
that it was a little unusual for a cabinet officer to go public 
with remarks delivered to the president in a private meeting 
but he sought to softpedal any differences between reagan and 
bowen 
thats the same thing the president said weve made progress 
but obviously we need to do more said fitzwater 
i dont know what hes up to fitzwater said of bowens 
action on the other hand theres nothing wrong with it 
reagan often has been upbeat about the war on drugs with all 
the headlines about how were losing the drug war lets keep in 
mind the progress weve made he told a white house conference 
for a drugfree america on feb 29 adding weve strengthened 
the laws and drug seizures are at an alltime high 
bowen backed the administrations call for tougher law 
enforcement in his thursday presentation but he also called for 
more attention to effective treatment and strong federal leadership 
to establish additional treatment clinics 
and he made clear there was a pragmatic political component to 
his appeal 
mr president there are political dangers as well said the 
hhs chief 
in a clear refererence to jesse jackson bowen said one of 
the two remaining democrat candidates for president is getting some 
of his highest marks for his passionate and creative oratory on the 
drug epidemic and is poised to steal from our party what has been a 
traditional republican issue law enforcement 
bowen supported aggressive law enforcement and other approaches 
such as first lady nancy reagans just say no campaign but he 
said some are using the first ladys campaign as a political 
football saying its an empty slogan however unfair that 
characterization might be 
he went on i believe as we approach the end of this second 
term we need to take a fresh look at what were doing to secure a 
lasting end to the demand for illicit drugs 
he called for more research to improve the efficiency of 
treatment strategies and expanded treatment facilities 
on the topic of treatment bowen said we also need to 
talk turkey with bigcity mayors councils and suburban 
jurisdictions as well who often knuckle under to pressure from 
those who are quoteunquote all for treatment as long as its 
not in my backyard 
communities and neighborhoods need to be willing to accept 
treatment facilities he said in some instances federal 
funding is available its just not being used 
among those at the thursday meeting were attorney general edwin 
meese iii education secretary william bennett and transportation 
secretary jim burnley

the gunmen who hijacked a kuwaiti airways 
jumbo jet for 15 days remain in algeria where the ordeal ended 
last week after a kuwaiti promise to give early release to a 
handful of shiite moslem prisoners according to a us account 
on thursday algerian ambassador mohammed sahnoun said the 
hijackers had left algeria without getting what they wanted and 
without obtaining any concessions for freeing the 31 remaining 
passengers 
but two us officials told the associated press on friday the 
hijackers had been promised that five or six of the 17 prisoners 
held in kuwait for bomb attacks on the us and french embassies in 
1983 would be released early 
however the prisoners have not been released and the gunmen 
who had been promised safe passage remain in algeria the 
officials said on condition of anonymity 
according to this account of the negotiations algerian 
intermediaries faithfully conveyed kuwaits promise to the 
hijackers but the officials said kuwait which has a firm policy 
of not yielding to terrorism may not have had any intention of 
letting the prisoners go in the first place 
they have stood so fast for so long they probably had no 
intention of letting them go early one of the officials said 
the fiveyear prison terms of three of the 17 shiite moslems are 
due to expire at the end of the year 
during the long ordeal the united states repeatedly urged 
kuwait publicly and privately not to yield to the hijackers the 
reagan administration was not aware of the terms to end the siege 
because they were worked out through algerian intermediaries the 
officials said 
the account was provided by algeria which has played a role in 
resolving several hijackings in diplomatic contacts with the 
united states in the aftermath of the hijacking 
sahnoun also said that while his government would have liked to 
apprehend the hijackers such a move would have damaged its 
credibility as a mediator in international crises such as attempts 
to obtain the release of the eight american hostages in lebanon 
sahnoun addressing reporters at the national press club here 
said the hijackers went back without achieving anything 
the kuwaiti press agency also said on april 20 that the 
hijackers there were believed to be eight or nine had probably 
been flown to lebanon or iran 
but the us officials told the associated press the gunmen had 
remained in algeria 
another us official interviewed separately said syria had 
assured the united states that despite reports to the contrary the 
hijackers had not been flown from algeria to damascus reports from 
algiers had said the terrorists were flown to damascus from where 
they made their way by land to lebanon 
the state department has identified one of the hijackers as 
hassan izzaldin and said he might have been involved in the 
killing of navy diver robert stethem in the hijacking of a twa 
jetliner in 1985 
he was charged by a federal grand jury in seizing the plane 
this raises a possibility of a us request for extradition 
also secretary of state george p shultz has said one of the 
passengers may have had dual us citizenship 
he condemned the hijackers last week as murderers 
the plane a boeing 747 with 112 passengers and crew members 
was hijacked april 5 on a flight from thailand to kuwait and spent 
several days in meshed iran and larnaca cyprus before flying to 
algiers 
two kuwaiti passengers were killed and their bodies dumped from 
the plane while it was in cyprus 
the hijackers principal demand was the release of the 17 
prisoners in kuwait the freed hostages included three members of 
the kuwaiti royal family

interpreter in his hotel room above all we want spain to be 
accepted by the united states as we are now spain is going to be 
economically sound by the end of the century 
the year 1992 gonzalez said marks spains awakening from 
francisco francos 36year rule that ended with francos death in 
1975 
in four years the summer olympics will be held in barcelona a 
worlds fair will take place in seville and the 500th anniversary 
of christopher columbus voyage will be celebrated in madrid 
the year 1992 also marks the completion of spains integration 
into the european economic community 
over the last 10 years that have gone by the economy has 
begun producing rapidly said gonzalez spain for over half a 
century had a hyperprotectionist economy but now that its opened 
up weve seen rapid development and economic growth this is what 
we want to communicate to the us 
on thursday speaking at harvard university gonzalez said spain 
was part of a growing political and economic union in western 
europe that could lead to a stronger nato alliance

for spain to recover from francos regime at present the per

a judge friday allowed tuskegee university 
to bar students who owe more than 300 in overdue fees from taking 
final exams a school spokesman said 
judge howard f bryan of macon county dissolved the restraining 
order he had issued wednesday against enforcement of the policy 
said jj johnson 
students who owe more than 300 on monday when final exams 
begin will not be allowed to take their tests johnson said 
university officials testified friday that 600 students owed 
more than 300 in fees said michael pintard president of the 
student government association the judge ordered tuskegee to open 
its business office all day saturday and part of sunday so students 
could make payments on overdue fees johnson said 
the university announced earlier that abuse of an installment 
plan had prompted it to enforce its policy barring students with 
overdue fees from attending class or taking exams officials 
estimated 2000 students owe almost 15 million 
the crackdown had sparked a week of protests including a sitin 
at the administration building last weekend 
student leaders said the university should have warned students 
earlier about the crackdown and should have allowed students in 
financial difficulty to work out a timetable for repayment 
pintard calling the judges ruling friday a serious 
miscarriage of justice 
university president benjamin payton said the ruling 
underscores the fact that when students make loans they have to 
pay them 
what everybody needs to be clear about however is this is 
not a case of tuskegee university fighting its students payton 
said its a case of tuskegee university insisting that students 
learn very important lessons for life

if youre crazy like a duck and dont mind 
cigar smoke harp music and horns theres only one place to be 
today fredonia 
thats fredonia with one e as in this western new york 
college town and not freedonia with two es as in the mythical 
kingdom of freedonia that served as the setting for the marx 
brothers 1933 movie duck soup 
if that seems confusing think how confused mayor harry b 
hickey must have been in 1933 when he sent a letter to paramount 
pictures complaining about the studios intentions in using the 
name of our city in your picture and got back the following reply 
from the marx brothers themselves 
your excellency our advice is that you change the name of 
your town it is hurting our picture what makes you think you are 
mayor of fredonia do you wear a black moustache play the harp 
speak with an italian accent or chase girls like harpo we are 
certain you do not therefore we must be the mayor of fredonia 
not you 
fredonia today celebrates the second annual freedonia marxonia 
film festival and symposium 
several hundred people wearing groucho glasses and noses are 
expected at fredonia state college for a group picture in the 
afternoon but thats not all 
there will be a speech by marx brothers expert paul g 
wesolowski and a duck soup recipe competition the local post 
office will cancel stamps with a mark that shows groucho harpo and 
chico and has the extra e in fredonia 
postmaster robert kaus says hes gotten about 150 requests for 
the cancellation some from as far away as belgium italy and the

old planning boards dont die or 
apparently fade away either thats what members of the regional 
solid waste planning board are discovering 
some members believe the board has served its purpose and should 
be disbanded but officials say they cant get enough people 
together for a quorum to officially close up shop 
im just tired of meeting here every few months to find out we 
cant do anything said roy jones board vice chairman the 
board is well on its way to melting away it should be terminated 
with the same dignity as it was formed 
the board with representatives from communities in the tulsa 
area was one member short of a quorum at its meeting thursday 
only 16 of 60 board members attended the previous meeting in 
february 
the board was formed in 1986 to investigate the areas solid 
waste situation and propose sites for landfills 
this conceivably could go on forever if enough member 
communities play the game of not attending meetings but not 
resigning said marilyn hinkle board chairman 
the board will try to meet again probably in september with 
disbanding on the agenda she said

the first california condor conceived in 
captivity hatched friday its keepers using tweezers and their 
fingertips to help the newest member of the nearly extinct species 
break free from its shell officials said 
its alive and it looks healthy said tom hanscom a 
spokesman for the san diego wild animal park its resting now 
we dont have any other details 
the hatching represents a tremendous boost to efforts to save 
the species it brings the known population of north americas 
largest land bird to 28 all in captivity 15 at the park here and 
13 at the los angeles zoo 
the squawking infant named molloko an indian word for 
condor was swaddled in a towel and placed in the same type of 
incubator used for premature infants 
early this morning there were 27 california condors left in 
the world said bill toone curator of birds at the park this 
afternoon theres 28 of them and we couldnt be more excited about 
that 
when the numbers are so low one bird is seen as a very big 
step away from extinction toone added 
although the tiny bird was not brought forth to meet the 
press its historymaking birth was recorded on videotape and 
shown at a press conference friday night 
earlier the chick had become stuck in dried membrane and 
albumen and could no longer rotate in the shell to peck its way 
out its keepers removed it cautiously because of the danger of 
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes 
a recording of vultures making hissing and grunting sounds was 
played at intervals to duplicate the sounds the chick would hear in 
a natural setting 
park officials had said they intended to intervene by saturday 
if the chick which began hatching wednesday hadnt emerged from 
the shell allowing the hatching struggle to continue would 
overexhaust the bird 
the chick conceived by the only known activing breeding pair of 
the california condor was expected to weigh about 9 ounces 
hanscom said the species has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at 
maturity 
the 10ounce bluegreen egg about 5 inches long had been under 
a 24hour watch since wednesday when keepers noticed pip 
cracks in one end signaling the start of hatching which can take 
three days 
after the egg was laid march 3 it was taken away from the 
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female 
bird would produce a second egg so far this has not happened 
it will be a while before the sex of the bird can be determined 
through a blood test officials said 
hanscom said that representatives of the chumash indian tribe 
had been enlisted to select the name for the chick upon hatching 
the tribe inhabited the santa barbara area that most recently 
served as california condor habitat and the bird figures 
prominently in the tribes religion

producer ray stark stung by negative reviews 
of biloxi blues from televison movie critics gene siskel and 
roger ebert has sent the two a letter calling them a critical 
version of laurel and hardy 
your thumb system is a clever bit of show business i suggest 
you sit on them stark said referring to the pairs trademark 
thumbs up or thumbs down method of evaluation 
siskel responded that someone perhaps had purloined starks 
stationery to write a rude note 
stark calling the two a critical version of laurel and 
hardy said he will suggest to fellow producers that they refrain 
from offering early screenings to the pair 
biloxi blues about an army recruit from brooklyn who gets 
his basic training in the deep south is based on a play by neil 
simon stars matthew broderick and was directed by mike nichols 
stark is the head of rastar productions which produced the film 
in an april 20 letter to siskel at the chicago tribune stark 
recounts several positive reviews of biloxi blues that appeared 
in the new york times time magazine the washington post los 
angeles times and the chicago tribune 
but there on television was roger ebert saying i realized to 
my shock that his nichols career has gone nowhere in recent 
years what has happened to him as a director hes just 
another one of the hacks brought in to direct another neil simon 
screenplay 
and there were you agreeing i think the word hack is right 
i was very shocked at how dull the film was stark wrote to 
siskel 
for such men of the world the two of you shock very easily 
said stark in the threepage letter listing a number of problems 
such as middle east tensions aids and homelessness 
the letter was sent to the heads of several major studios 
in a letter obtained by the washington post siskel replied to 
stark and referred to an earlier apparently friendlier letter 
i think you should know that someone using your name and good 
stationery has just violated the reasonable opinions of the earlier 
letter you sent me siskel wrote i suggest that you have 
someone stand guard at your desk to make sure that no crackpot gets 
ahold of your letterhead

workers glared with icy determination at 
platoons of plainclothes police as they streamed out through the 
gates of the huge strikebound lenin steelworks during a shift 
change 
striding toward a bus stop a few flashed the vforvictory sign 
once out of sight of police their strike at the plant in the 
krakow suburb of nowa huta has shaken the government at the highest 
level 
at the bus stop 100 yards from the gates a knot of workers 
began to talk freely with foreign reporters 
they have to give people what they deserve a beefy man in a 
shiny tan jacket said of communist authorities 
he punched the air angrily with his finger as he spoke we are 
working prices are going up we have no money 
others murmured agreement and nodded 
it was friday night and workers had occuped the plant for four 
days demanding pay raises the restoration of union rights and 
reinstatement of dismissed solidarity activists 
a worker on the edge of the group said he made 107 a month 
half of which he must spend on the maintenance and mortgage on his 
home we are working all the time on sundays too and we can 
hardly live 
prices have gone up 42 percent so far this year as the result of 
government reforms aimed at making the economy more marketoriented 
we dont believe them anymore a middleaged man with a 
quiet manner said of authorities they keep promising that 
things will get better and yet we cant earn in one day even 
enough for two kilos 4 pounds of herring 
they share millions and we are near starvation 
the workers have been inside the plant for 16 hours at a stretch 
during the strike the nations worst since martial law stifled the 
solidarity independent labor federation 6 yearss ago strikers 
spend their day at the plant sitting talking tinkering but not 
working 
they said some workers have not joined the stoppage and toil 
while their colleagues in a neighboring department sit idle

as spring returns to this rugged 
country plants bushes and trees that have evolved to live with 
fire are sprouting among ruined woodlands charred by oregons worst 
forest fire in 50 years 
one of the patches of color dotting the shiny blacks and dull 
browns of burned trees in the kalmiopsis wilderness is the pink 
flower of the kalmiopsis bush which needs periodic fires to 
survive 
it lives in some pretty rough places said lee webb a 
wildlife biologist for the siskiyou national forest maybe what 
happens is it lives where the fire doesnt hit you expect fire to 
burn places its been before 
it grows in the harshest sites because it cant compete as 
things go on and sites become better it loses ground to other 
plants when the fire comes through and it is growing in these 
little sanctuaries it has a competitive edge 
he and tom atzet a us forest service regional ecologist 
scrambled down a steep slope of crumbling rock recently to a dead 
canyon of live oak marked with white flags the clump of kalmiopsis 
that survived was sheltered by the seared leaves of the oak trees 
in other parts of the wilderness the forest is healing itself 
as loggers and environmentalists fight over whether to salvage the 
96500 acres of burned timber and replant the land or leave the job 
to mother nature 
atzet stopped to dig out a fawn lilly also known as a trout 
lilly blooming where just months before fire seared the soils 
surface 
the lillies are just loving it atzet said they store all 
their energy underground in this bulb whether there is a fire or 
not during the summer it doesnt care 
we are finding that leachates from the ash left by the fire 
stimulate these things to grow that gives them a competitive 
advantage against plants knocked back by the fire its a war out 
here for every bit of nitrogen and every bit of water 
madrone and sugar pine on one slope had been killed by a 
fastmoving wall of flame that roared down silver creek but now 
many of the plants show tiny green sprouts around the bases of 
their trunks 
throughout the north kalmiopsis roadless area of the siskiyou 
national forest these evergreen hardwoods valued as cleanburning 
firewood are grouped in rings evidence that fire has been a 
frequent visitor each time the sprouts return after a fire the 
ring grows wider 
where the fire overran the remains of a cleared area near 
chinaman hat new douglas fir seedlings already have been planted 
for a new forest 
atzet stopped again to drill into the bulging cat face of a 
sugar pine the cat face is a ring of bulging bark that has grown 
to heal a scar left by a previous fire because the healing bark is 
loaded with pitch it tends to burn more intensely each time fire 
sweeps past and the cat face grows 
ive found trees here that are 200 years old that have burned 
four or five times atzet said 
by examining the older trees atzet has found that fire returns 
to the kalmiopsis an average of every 50 years 
it could be 150 years or it could be 25 but the average is 
50 said atzet if we look at our records we find that there 
was a fire in the kalmiopsis area in the 1930s so this one was 
right on schedule 
he bored into a sugar pine that was blackened around the base 
but retained a green canopy he pulled out a core of damp wood and 
examined the largely undamaged cambium layer beneath the bark 
which allows a tree to form new bark and wood 
what fire he exclaimed

campaigns said jackson is spending 400000 on media in the battle 
for ohios 159 delegates to the democratic national convention this 
summer

south africa as a terrorist state for allegedly supporting rebels 
battling mozambique dukakis has rejected jacksons call to provide 
arms to mozambiques marxist government to fight the rebels

dukakis enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over jackson he is also 
beginning to win over committed delegates from the suspended 
campaigns of tennessee sen al gore and illinois sen paul simon

new employment after plant closings

and at an ohio state university spring football scrimmage 
bush said friday in interviews in indianapolis he is not worried 
about his campaign being hurt by current investigations into 
attorney general edwin meese iii and meeses business associates

i think the democrats are trying to make it that but we will 
have some fun too trying to look into what is going on in 
illinois or massachusetts depending upon which one wins the 
democratic nomination he said 
at a rally in indianapolis bush said let me throw this

michael dukakis is insisting its not 
all over and urging ohio supporters to ignore polls and other 
signs that he is advancing strongly toward the democratic 
presidential nomination 
dukakis expecting to add to his string of victories in ohio and 
indiana primaries on tuesday all but ignored his remaining party 
rival jesse jackson while campaigning across ohio on friday 
instead he focused on criticizing the reagan administration on 
trade legislation and other issues 
he was campaigning today in cincinnati and cleveland before 
traveling to nextdoor indiana where he planned events in 
indianapolis 
at every stop as he crisscrossed ohio dukakis told crowds i 
hope you wont pay attention to these polls he recalled his 1978 
race for reelection as governor of massachusetts when he lost 
despite a huge lead as much as 50 points at one point in the polls 
what i am concerned about dukakis said is people 
looking at polls and taking them seriously and assuming that its 
all over 
its not all over and i know that better than anybody from 
rather painful personal experience 
dukakis who holds a commanding lead in the delegate race and is 
the undisputed frontrunner has come under sharpened criticism 
from jackson over the past two days 
dukakis turned aside questions about his rivals charge that he 
would only manage president reagans ecomomic program not 
change it 
i just dont talk about those things dukakis said i have 
a record the white house would be very much surprised if they 
learned all of a sudden michael dukakis was going to manage 
reaganomics they dont believe that for one minute 
the massachusetts governor is seeking to make a major issue in 
industrial ohio of the presidents vow to veto the trade bill 
passed by the senate because of the provision requiring companies 
to give 60 days notice before closing plants he said a similar law 
in massachusetts had cushioned the blow and helped us to save 
thousands of jobs and hundreds of companies 
however because the massachusetts law requests but does not 
require companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before 
a plant closing dukakis administration officials in boston have 
been unable to offer evidence the notification provision has 
accomplished its goal 
massachusetts state officials say the plant closing law has not 
saved workers jobs but has helped some 24000 find new 
employment after plant closings 
ohios democratic gov richard celeste appeared with dukakis 
before a union audience in columbus but did not endorse him and 
planned to appear with jackson in cleveland on sunday 
celeste said he wanted to ensure an open enthusiastic primary 
in the state in which rev jackson knows hes as welcome as gov 
dukakis at every place including the governors office and his 
supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in 
the fall 
despite his insistence the race is not over dukakis struck an 
optimistic note as he urged a lunchtime crowd in dayton to help 
bring a large voter turnout if we do were going to win in 
ohio were going to win in indiana were going to win in west 
virginia and in california and in new jersey and win this 
nomination he said

rebel leaders dropped a demand that 
their fighters receive ammunition and weapons after moving into 
ceasefire zones removing a major obstacle in peace talks with the 
government 
also friday the leftist sandinista governments labor troubles 
persisted and police used rubber truncheons to quell protests by 
striking auto mechanics and construction workers arresting 11 
demonstrators 
the decision by leaders of the rebels known as contras not to 
demand arms supplies after their fighters move into the seven 
ceasefire zones removed a key barrier to achieving a lasting peace 
under accords signed march 23 
we have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and 
ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty 
and indivisibility of national territory top contra leader 
adolfo calero told a news conference 
the contras had also insisted that the ceasefire zones be 
autonomous 
calero said however that the contras rejected the governments 
demand that more than 17 million in humanitarian aid to the 
rebels recently approved by the us congress be channeled 
through the international red cross 
the aid was to be funneled to nicaragua through the us agency 
for international development 
under the march 23 agreement signed in the southern border town 
of sapoa only neutral parties may distribute the aid 
the rebels have been supported by washington since 1981 when 
they mounted the insurgency that has claimed more than 26000 
lives the sapoa accords promise them a role in the political 
process in a more democratic nicaragua 
earlier friday the rebels turned down a government proposal to 
extend by a month a 60day ceasefire that began april 1 they said 
the sandinista offer showed a lack of good will to fulfill the 
agreements 
in washington president reagan said friday he would continue to 
apply economic sanctions against nicaragua to counter the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the united states posed by the sandinista regime 
in a semiannual report required by law reagan said trade 
sanctions complement the diplomatic and other aspects of our 
policy toward nicaragua 
one of the two labor protests in managua on friday came outside 
the general workers confederation an umbrella group for 
antisandinista unions where 38 construction workers and auto 
mechanics went on a hunger strike sunday 
on friday night about 80 university students staged a march in 
sympathy with about 1500 workers from both industries who have 
been on strike for higher wages since feb 25 
the students passed near the union headquarters chanting a 
free fatherland riot squads standing by did not interfere but 
the police cordoned off the buildings entrance 
a banner strung across the building said we prefer to die of 
hunger fighting with dignity than to die working as slaves 
meanwhile jose castillo osejo an opposition leader and 
director of privatelyowned radio corporation claimed interior 
minister tomas borge summoned him to his office berated the radio 
for its reporting of the demonstrations and punched him in the 
mouth 
castillo a leader of a private human rights group and the 
opposition conservative party said borge later apologized

officials of south africa and angola will meet 
for the first time to discuss a peace settlement that will include 
the possible withdrawal of cuban forces from angola when they join 
delegates from the united states and cuba in london next week 
the delegations also will confer on other regional issues 
including the status of a parallel effort to bring about 
independence and black majority rule in namibia or southwest 
africa which is under south african administration the state 
department said friday 
the american delegation to the may 34 talks will be headed by 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker state department 
spokesman charles redman said cuban officials will join the talks 
as part of the angolan delegation 
south african and angolan forces have been intermittently 
involved militarily since the marxist government assumed power in 
maputo in 1975 
south africa sent troops into angola last summer in support of 
unita angolas usbacked rebel movement south african officials 
have said the number of troops has been sharply reduced from a peak 
of 3000 
the united states has given high priority to reaching an 
agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of the estimated 40000 
cuban troops in angola a close ally of the soviet union 
us officials were encouraged last january when angola and cuba 
agreed for the first time to the principle of a total cuban 
withdrawal from angola there has been no agreement however on a 
timetable 
angolas main interests are an end to american assistance to the 
rebel movement in angola and to the withdrawal of south african 
forces in angola 
a delegation from the organization of african unity met with 
crocker two weeks ago and said the united states should end all aid 
to the angolan rebels as a means of helping the peace process but

jesse jackson says he intends to raise the 
level of the campaign debate as he takes on democratic 
presidential rival michael dukakis over fiscal and foreign policy 
in an uphill bid to close in on dukakis widening delegate lead 
jackson is painting the massachusetts governor as a candidate who 
has not shown a strong willingness to undo president reagans 
legacy 
campaigning under clevelands cold rainy skies for votes in 
tuesdays ohio primary jackson hit dukakis on two issues 
southern africa and reaganomics 
he said dukakis lacks understanding about southern africa 
particlarly in mozambique where jackson said dukakis is to the 
right of president reagan 
jackson also vowed friday to intensify his quest for the 
nomination after a string of primary losses to dukakis 
he told a labor rally in cleveland im not behind im so far 
in front of where i started weve come too far from where we 
started and i dont feel no way tired were going all the way 
it was clear jacksons strategy is to paint sharp distinctions 
between himself and dukakis criticizing his rival as lacking in 
clear policy positions 
he said dukakis would not give military aid to mozambique in the 
face of southafrica backed rebel brutality against civilians that 
is someting even reagan favors jackson said 
jackson told reporters traveling on his campaign bus that 
dukakis does not understand the policy options in africa but that 
he was not questioning the governors motivation 
his intention im convinced would be to end apartheid 
jackson said but we need a plan and a commitment to end 
apartheid it is clear when he takes a position to the right of 
reagan that is bad judgment he does not understand the options 
in southern africa 
its my intention to raise the general level of the foreign 
policy debate 
also on friday jackson campaign manager gerald austin said the 
campaign will unveil a new television commercial sunday and monday 
he said the campaign will spend 400000 on media in ohio 
the ad consisting of a series of still shots will have a 
voiceover saying that vice president george bush wants to stay the 
course mike dukakis wants to manage the damage and jackson

in a rowdy and contentious 
convention the governing christian democratic party chose wealthy 
businessman julio adolfo rey prendes as its candidate in next 
years presidential elections 
the choice friday set off a controversy that could split the 
party 
rey prendes a former cabinet minister was chosen by 
acclamation as the sole entry in the convention marked by insults 
boos whistles and catcalls 
fidel chavez mena his bitter rival and a former foreign 
minister boycotted the convention and so did president jose 
napoleon duarte 
the president the partys honorary chairman had urged both 
contenders to step aside in favor of a unity candidate 
the two rivals as well as the convention ignored a dramatic 
appeal earlier in the week to put aside their differences and back 
abraham gonzalez a party veteran in order to maintain unity 
within the centrist organization 
duarte warned that a rift in christian democratic ranks will 
weaken the party and leave the field wide open to its chief rival 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance which has already won 
control of the national legislature and a majority of mayorships in 
midterm elections march 20 
by law duarte could not run for a second fiveyear term he won 
the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the 
ussupported conservative government that began in 1980 and 
continues 
months ago rey prendes wrested control of the party machinery 
from the duarte and chavez mena factions so chavez mena was at big 
disadvantage throughout the race 
aquilino duarte a nephew of the president and member of the 
partys 10member directorate predicted the choice is going to 
shatter the party 
also addressing the delegates before the acclamation vote 
roberto vieira another directorate member warned amid boos if 
we make this decision and the party splits the people will not 
have a democratic option in the presidential election 
rey prendes expressed hope there will be no split 
im sure that once tempers cool well all be together again 
in the struggle let the anger end today he said in an 
acceptance speech 
my arms are open there is no need to exclude anyone he 
said in what was taken as a reference to chavez mena 
rey prendes is a former presidential press spokesman a 
cabinetlevel job a former mayor of san salvador and a member of 
the directorate he and chavez mena helped found the party in 1960

vice president george bush says that if the 
democrats want to talk about sleaze he is prepared to have some 
fun with corruption in their own backyards 
bush was campaigning today in ohio planning stops in cleveland 
and at an ohio state university spring football scrimmage 
bush who has already amassed enough delegates to capture the 
republican nomination spent friday in indiana which like ohio 
and the district of columbia holds its primary tuesday 
before more than 4000 supporters who packed the indiana 
convention center in indianapolis friday evening bush promised to 
bring new people to washington people who come there to serve 
and not to profit 
but in interviews with indianapolis reporters bush said he is 
not worried about his campaign being hurt by current investigations 
into attorney general edwin meese iii and meeses business 
associates 
i hear the democrats talking about it but there is plenty 
of evidence to kind of go into a guiltbyassociation mode where we 
can find in massachusetts politics or campaign staff or things of 
that nature said bush in a thinly veiled reference to democratic 
presidential frontrunner massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
i hope we dont have to do it he said 
asked by television reporters if the sleaze issue hurts him 
bush replied i dont think so i dont think anyone has ever 
accused me of any conflict of interest i think the democrats are 
trying to make it that 
but depending on whether dukakis or jesse jackson wins the 
democratic nomination we will have some fun too trying to look 
into what is going on in illinois or massachusetts bush said 
he added weve got some cannon fodder if you want to get 
into that 
at the big convention center rally bush also responded to 
dukakis criticism of his backing a threatened veto by president 
reagan of the trade bill passed this week in congress 
were not talking about pink slips were not talking about 
closing factories were talking about opening factories until 
every man and woman that wants a job has a job 
its going to be the classic confrontation between one who 
respects the federalist approach and one who wants to see a return 
to the misery days said bush clearly spoiling for the general 
election fight during a campaign stop in fort wayne indiana 
i didnt like the primary part i didnt like going out 
nitpicking trying to find minutiae differences with my fellow 
republicans he added 
at a fundraising breakfast in fort wayne bush said dukakis 
waffled on whether to support president reagans retaliatory strike 
against iran in the persian gulf and he accused both dukakis and 
jackson of being soft on penalties for drugpushers 
let me throw this challenge down to dukakis and jackson 
bush said i favor the death penalty for narcotics kingpins now 
will the democrats join us on that or not 
he defended reagan admistration efforts to cut off the supply of 
drugs but told reporters im taking a look now at changing the 
whole structure of how the government is set up to wage the drug 
fight 
asked why president reagan has not yet endorsed him bush said 
im sure he has in his mind as long as there is any vestige of 
the primary i expect he wont i think he will give me full 
unqualified support at the appropriate time 
the bush campaign has a major rally scheduled in washington for 
tuesday and there have been reports reagan may announce his 
support for bush there bush aides said friday that was not yet 
certain

here is the text of the statement released 
friday by defense secretary frank c carlucci announcing a change 
in us policy regarding the protection of commercial ships in the 
persian gulf 
the president has decided to provide assistance under certain 
circumstances to ships in distress in the persian gulf and strait 
of hormuz in keeping with longstanding timehonored navy and 
maritime tradition 
such aid will be provided to friendly innocent neutral 
vessels flying a nonbelligerent flag outside declared 
warexclusion zones that are not carrying contraband or resisting 
legitimate visit and search by a persian gulf belligerent 
following a request from the vessel under attack assistance 
will be rendered by a us warship or aircraft if this unit is in 
the vicinity and its mission permits rendering such assistance 
with this assistance we anticipate no increase in our current 
force levels 
we are not the policemen of the gulf nor do we wish to be 
for over 200 years us policy has been to help protect 
freedom of navigation in international waters this new 
assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events 
in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this 
principle 
we cannot stand by and watch innocent people be killed or 
maimed by malicious lawless actions when we have the means to 
assist and perhaps prevent them 
we do not intend to describe our specific rules of engagement 
or the methods we plan to use in rendering this assistance we see 
no reason to give advantage to those who wish us ill 
with regard to mines i have consulted with our allies who 
were attending the nuclear planning group meeting in brussels this 
week we all agreed that we should provide each other mutual 
support and cooperation in the interest of keeping the 
international waterways free from this threat 
finally this policy should not be construed as a tilt in 
either direction in the war 
our policy has been and will continue to be one of strict 
neutrality we along with the rest of the civilized international 
community want this war to end 
in this respect we strongly support implementation of un 
security council resolution 598 and passage of a second resolution 
imposing an arms embargo on that belligerent that does not accept 
598 as a means to reach a diplomatic settlement of this tragic war 
we also want to see an end to the wanton waste of human life 
that has characterized this war in that regard we especially 
deplore the use of chemical warfare by either belligerent which 
has become one of the most regrettable developments in this 
protracted conflict 
this policy will go into effect once we have informed those 
free world nonbelligerent countries that maintain shipping 
interests in the gulf

months no injuries were reported despite calls for protests to 
honor the 175 palestinians killed in the antioccupation violence

week have claimed the intefadah arabic for uprising 
was fading

of the uprising called for more general strikes and days of 
confrontation with occupation forces 
it also named four israeliappointed mayors who have refused the 
undergrounds demands to resign urging our masses to strike the 
severest blows against those who are violating our wills and 
orders 
the leaflet singled out the mayors of the west bank towns of 
hebron ramallah el bireh and jericho 
scattered protests were reported following moslem noon prayers 
friday 
in gaza city soldiers fired tear gas to disperse several dozen 
youths who hurled stones after prayers arab reports said troops 
also fired rubber bullets at worshipers in the nearby jabaliya 
refugee camp the reports said 
in jerusalem friday hundreds of moslem worshipers waved 
outlawed palestinian flags on the sacred temple mount chanting 
jews leave the prophet mohammeds army is coming 
the protesters chanted praise for khalil wazir the plo military 
leader who was gunned down april 16 in tunis israeli sources have 
confirmed that israeli commandos were responsible but the

guerrillas were killed in a clash after the arabs crossed into 
northern israel in a second incursion wednesday two guerrillas

rachaiya el foukhar four and six miles north of the israeli 
border to question residents about the attacks security sources

a structural failure not a bomb likely 
caused the big bang that ripped open an aloha airlines jet 
injuring 61 people and apparently sucking a flight attendant from 
the cabin to her death a federal official said friday 
the boeing 737 which was cruising at 24000 feet on an island 
hop from hilo to honolulu made a safe emergency landing at kahului 
airport thursday after flying about 15 minutes with 20 feet of its 
upper fuselage just behind the front passenger door torn away 
to the floor witnesses said one engine was on fire 
there was a big bang when it happened and everybody looked up 
and we were looking at blue sky said passenger bill fink of 
honolulu 
at a news conference late friday night a member of the national 
transportation safety board said investigators believed the cause 
of the accident was a structural problem with the aging jet 
i think its fair to say the focus of the investigation is on 
the structure itself the hole itself and what if any causes might 
have been to create hull fractures or hull fatigue said ntsb 
member joseph t nall 
the possibility of a bomb having exploded aboard the aircraft 
has been ruled out said one source in washington speaking on 
condition of anonymity however nall said we cant rule 
anything in or anything out 
the federal aviation administration had ordered a close 
inspection of the upper skin of older model boeing 737s including 
the aloha jet in october because of cracks near where sections of 
sheet metal overlap and had warned such cracks could cause rapid 
cabin decompression according to faa officials in washington 
we are in full compliance with the october directive 
stephanie ackerman an aloha airlines spokeswoman said friday she 
said the inspections have been done as outlined by the faa and 
turned up nothing unusual 
faa records also showed that the aloha plane had extensive 
repair work done to mend cracks and corroded metal twice in 1983 
but most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the 
plane which seemed not to be involved in thursdays incident 
a source close to the accident probe in washington said 
investigators are focusing on whether a structural failure such as 
metal fatigue or corrosion might have caused the airplanes skin to 
tear causing rapid decompression 
one theory is that strong winds may then have ripped away the 
huge upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front door 
to within a few feet of the wing sources said 
investigators also believe that it is unlikely that an engine 
failure played a significant part in the plane tearing apart a 
source said 
meanwhilea coast guard cutter and helicopter searched the 
pacific ocean south and southeast of maui for anything associated 
with the explosion of flight 243 according to spokesman brad 
nelson 
searchers had been unable to locate flight attendant clarabelle 
b lansing of honolulu a 37year veteran with the airline or any 
debris from the plane nelson said 
aloha officials said they believe lansing was sucked out of the 
plane when it rapidly decompressed after the explosion 
passengers held onto another flight attendant so she would not 
be sucked out of the open plane according to passenger dan dennin 
a honolulu salesman 
seven of the injured remained at maui memorial hospital on 
friday one was in critical condition and one in guarded condtion 
george harvey federal aviation administration area coordinator 
for honolulu said some national transportation safety board 
investigators arrived at kahului airport on thursday and would hold 
a news conference friday 
harvey said he could not confirm whether investigators suspected 
a structural failure caused the fuselage to tear away from the 
airplane 
it stands to reason that theyre checking everything 
structure failure explosive devices harvey said 
the plane was carrying 89 passengers five crew members and an 
air traffic controller when the explosion occurred around 145 pm 
hst the plane traveling about 345 miles per hour was 25 miles 
southeast of maui 
there was a blast a whoosh like someone popped a bag 
and the air rushed out immediately said dennin a third of the 
roof was gone i looked up and saw blue sky 
everybody screamed he said however it was very brief 
the panic the rest of the plane was intact i think that 
people realized the plane was still flying and they quickly went 
about the business of doing whatever they could do to save their 
lives 
passenger alice godwin of boulder city nev said she put on a 
life jacket and put her head between her knees i sang all the 
hymns i knew she said that kept me busy 
mark eberly a ramp supervisor at the airport said he dropped 
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its 
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing i saw hair 
flying in the wind and arms dangling he said 
kevin hildebrant a tour van driver who helped take the injured 
to the hospital said he was struck by the silence of the 
passengers after the plane landed 
i guess everyone was so shocked out everyone was silent 
hildebrant said they were very calm i guess to compensate for 
what they went through 
passengers praised the pilot capt robert l schornstheimer a 
12year veteran of the airline for a remarkable job in making a 
safe landing 
he brought that plane down so smoothly said passenger john 
lopez 40 of hilo it was just like riding in a cadillac 
a spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes the main subsidiary 
of the boeing co said there were no fuel lines or other potential 
sources for an explosion in the front of the airplane 
to have it just explode in the air is just unheard of said 
boeing spokesman tom cole 
he also said that in the unlikely chance that a turbine blade 
tore loose from the engine and ripped into the fuselage it would 
not have hit forward of the wing 
aloha president a maurice myers said at a news conference in 
honolulu that nothing is stored in the area where the fuselage was 
ripped apart 
the boeing 737 was delivered to aloha in 1969 and apparently has 
been in service ever since according to cole 
the 737 is one of the oldest of the 737200 series planes in 
service he said the first of the series was put into commercial 
service in february 1968 at united airlines he said 
the faas directive for inspection of the earlymodel boeing 
737s was issued last year because cracks were discovered during 
routine inspections near fasteners that join sections of sheet 
metal in three aircraft the same inspections also found fuselage 
tear strips coming loose on some of the planes because the 
lamination was no longer holding 
the repair work needed on the aloha jet included fixing in 1983 
and several other times since then cracks and corrosion on the 
wings according to faa records a section of the right wing was 
replaced last year when cracks were found in the wing spar

valery a legasov a physical chemist who led the 
commission the investigated the chernobyl nuclear disaster has 
died at the age of 51 the official soviet news agency tass 
announced 
neither tass nor the evening television news broadcast vremya on 
friday gave the cause or place of death 
tass said legasov died wednesday a day after the second 
anniversary of the april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the 
nuclear power plant in the soviet ukraine in which at least 31 
people were killed 
it was not known if legasov was exposed to dangerous levels of 
radiation while investigating the disaster the worlds worst 
nuclear power accident 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and other top communist party 
officials and scientists signed the obituary carried by tass 
legasovs name had been absent from the dozens of soviet media 
reports on tuesdays anniversary of the accident at the nuclear 
facility 80 miles north of kiev 
legasovs foreign colleagues in nuclear power research had 
praised his openness in discussing the causes and effects of the 
chernobyl accident in contrast to initial soviet delay in 
releasing information about it 
the accident spread radioactivity worldwide 
legasov was first deputy director of the iv kurchatov 
institute of atomic energy and a member of the presidium of the 
soviet academy of sciences the official obituary praised his work 
with inert gases and in the use of nuclear reactors to generate 
electricity

disaster of the viennabased international atomic energy agency 
in august 1986 he made a fivehour presentation of the soviet

a federal appeals court has asked for the view 
of a district of columbia court on whether makers of handguns like 
the one used to shoot president reagan can be sued for deaths and 
injuries when those guns are used 
the legal issue was referred friday to the district of columbia 
court of appeals in a case involving thomas k delahanty a former 
district of columbia policeman one of three people wounded by 
presidential assailant john w hinckley jr in the 1981 shooting 
delahanty had tried to sue the gun manufacturer 
the action by the us circuit court of appeals in washington 
raises the possibility that delahanty and former white house press 
secretary james brady may revive lawsuits against roehm 
gesellschaft the west german manufacturer of the 22caliber 
pistol used by hinckley 
the federal court sought the dc courts view because federal 
courts must apply the laws of the states in which they are located 
to civil suits 
the court noted that maryland law should be consulted since the 
district of columbia was carved out of maryland when the nations 
capital was formed 
a 1985 ruling by marylands highest court made gun makers and 
sellers liable for injuries and death caused by the criminal use of 
socalled saturday night specials 
the federal courts requst an advisory opinion is merely a 
suggestion and does not require a ruling by the dc court 
richard gardiner assistant general counsel of the national 
rifle association said of fridays advisory opinion its 
obviously disappointing that this court didnt simply say this 
theory is so outlandish that were not going to pay any attention 
to it 
the advisory opinion came a year after the same appellate court 
upheld the dismissal of bradys suit against roehm and its us 
subsidiary rg industries 
in that ruling the court held brady did not raise a valid 
negligence claim because gun manufacturers were not obligated to 
prevent criminals from using their products

a house committee says states seeking the 
super collider atom smasher will not have to put up at least 500 
million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued research 
installation 
the space science and technology committee on friday in a 
2011 vote rejected the minimumfunds amendment offered by rep 
ron packard rcalif for the 44 billion superconducting super 
collider 
committee members also voted 1614 against an alternative that 
would have required the secretary of energy to report to the 
committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning 
state should pay 
the amendments were offered to the 31 billion energy 
department research authorization bill 
as it stands the bill would authorize 16 billion over the 
next three years for the collider of which 148 million would be 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but with no construction 
funds until oct 1 1989 
several amendments to the bill remain to be considered 
including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider 
authorization or eliminate it altogether and to make a 25 percent 
foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant 
atom smasher

a top us counterterrorism expert says there 
is likely to be a surge in palestinian terrorism as a result of the 
uprising in the israelioccupied territories and the killing of a 
palestinian guerrilla chieftain 
ambassador l paul bremer said friday that libya continues to 
plan international terrorist attacks but is looking for such 
surrogates as the japanese red army to do its dirty work 
in an interview bremer said there is a possibility of a 
measurable increase of palestinian terrorism in the coming months 
because of the fivemonthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and the killing of 
khalil wazir the secondincommand of the palestine liberation 
organization by israeli agents 
the rapprochement between plo chief yasser arafat and syrian 
president hafez assad following the assassination of wazir also 
known as abu jihad may contribute to a terror campaign although 
it is too soon to assess the impact of the thaw he said

radio disc jockey bob rivers thought the idea 
of spending a day or on the air two waiting for the hapless 
baltimore orioles to win sounded like a challenge

orioles defeated the chicago white sox 90 to break an record 
21game losing streak 
this is a chicago blowout rivers said friday night on his 
show at station wiyyfm as the game neared its conclusion im 
extremely happy and happening im going home tonight 
throughout the city of baltimore friday fans celebrated around 
television sets or let loose on the streets where they set off 
fire works although police reported no problems 
it has been outrageous people have been going nuts said 
mike coster a bartender at balls a sports bar what a win its 
almost like the 83 world series here the orioles once known as 
a powerhouse team won that series 
rivers 31 who had promised to stay on the air until the 
orioles triumphed popped open a bottle of champagne and drank from 
a plastic orioles beer cup shouting aint the beer cold 
the morning deejays song lineup reflected his new mood his 
first was im free by the who then came two songs by the rock 
group queen we will rock you and we are the champions 
marking an upbeat change from the rolling stones lyric you cant 
always get what you want that he played during the darker hours 
as the orioles rolled up loss after loss to set an american league 
record 
rivers helped rally baltimore fans and through a blitz of 
national publicity got fans from other cities supporting the home 
team his vigil broken by occasional naps on a cot in a corner 
office dubbed the rivers hilton was celebrated on national 
television talk shows and magazines 
wbaltv sportscaster vernon glenn marked his liberation as well

the losing streak which had gained national attention and brought 
ridicule to the team

everybody wanted them to lose to break the record some people were 
disappointed but im still very happy were no longer losers 
said peter milligan a baltimore stockbroker and lifelong orioles

more than a year after turkey asked to 
join the european economic community its membership prospects are 
distant frustrated by its rivalry with greece 
talks collapsed this week after a greekinspired quarrel over 
the presence of 29000 turkish troops in cyprus 
relations between greece and turkey two nato allies that almost 
went to war last year over rights to explore for minerals in the 
aegean sea are so poor that one diplomat of the western alliance 
told a reporter at its brussels headquarters dont ask me about 
greece and turkey in this building 
on monday a meeting in luxembourg of eec and turkish officials 
was canceled at the last minute following the fight inspired by 
greece an eec member since 1981 
the bid to revive ties with turkey ended in vituperative 
exchanges between greek and turkish officials at dinner one 
source said 
a session afterwards with foreign ministers was abruptly 
canceled 
i dont think any one of us expected this to happen said 
foreign minister jacques poos of luxembourg 
it was not a failure said foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher of west germany the meeting simply did not take place 
mesud yilmaz the turkish foreign minister refused to accept 
the eec view contained in a statement that the presence of 
turkish troops in northern cyprus affects the relations between 
it and turkey 
yilmaz said the turkish troops on cyprus are none of the eecs 
business turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 to protect the turkish 
cypriot minority after a proathens coup there 
but cyprus like turkey has an association accord with the eec 
and also aspires to join the common market someday the accord 
gives turkey trade privileges development aid and a forum to 
discuss eec membership 
the accord was suspended after a 1980 military coup in turkey 
freezing an 748 million aid deal 
the cancellation of mondays meeting was embarrassing for west 
germany turkeys staunchest eec ally 
it has had good relations with turkey for more than 100 years 
in the 1930s many thousands of germans fled their countrys nazi 
regime to find exile in turkey 
the collapse of the eecturkey talks was all the more surprising 
as it followed recent meetings between andreas papandreou and 
turgut ozal the greek and turkish prime ministers who agreed to 
step up cooperation 
it was hoped a new meeting on the issue can be held before june 
30 on that day west germany hands over the eecs rotating 
presidency to greece for six months dimming hopes for progress even 
further 
turkey is eager to join the eec it prides itself in having a 
rapid economic growth and liberal economic policies and sees itself 
as a bridge between europe and the volatile middle east

clarabelle lansing 57 who had worked 37 years for aloha airlines 
she was just handing my wife a drink william flanigan said 
she had stopped and told us this was the last call we were going 
to be descending 
and then whoosh she was gone their hands just touched when 
it happened 
sixtyone people were injured thursday in the accident aboard 
flight 243 federal investigators said they were focusing on 
possible structural failure in the 19yearold plane 
passengers praised capt robert schornstheimer 42 who flew the 
badly crippled plane for about 15 minutes before making an 
emergency landing on maui after leaving the plane many of those 
who were uninjured sought out the pilot and shook his hand 
its tremendous how he controlled the plane passenger

said he said youre calm about it when youre doing it but 
afterwards you start thinking about it 
he says it was just something else all of a sudden there was 
this noise and the planes flying funny and theres a big drag on 
it so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at 
the maui airport which was closest and he was able to get it in 
and land it schornstheimer said

sons actions were all in a days work 
hes pretty calm under pressure he said he said he was 
calm and did what needed to be done just like any other pilot

same circumstance but of course hes skillful enough and trained 
well enough to do it 
passengers also praised other crew members

passenger told a reporter while being wheeled into maui memorial 
hospitl for treatment

a japanese man linked to a terrorist group 
traveled about 7000 miles in the month before he was arrested on 
charges of carrying three powerful pipe bombs in his car according 
to federal documents 
yu kikumura 35 pleaded innocent friday to all charges on the 
12count federal indictment he was arrested april 12 along the new 
jersey turnpike and is being held without bond in new york city 
his lawyer william kunstler accused federal prosecutors of 
creating an atmosphere of hysteria and paranoia by trying to link 
kikumura to the leftwing japanese red army terrorist group 
im not saying we can win on all counts kunstler told 
reporters outside the courtroom they made it so unfair to start 
with 
theres been a lot of innuendo about mr kikumura causing a 
great deal of prejudice kunstler told us district judge alfred 
j lechner jr references to the red army are bad in a country 
already fearful of terrorism 
us attorney samuel a alito jr dismissed kunstlers charges 
this case has a lot of international implications and we have 
had some contact with foreign police agencies alito said later 
in a telephone interview im quite sure that hell be able to 
get a fair trial 
the japanese foreign ministry has said it suspects kikumura of 
being a member of the red army which was blamed for the recent 
bombing of a uso club in naples italy authorities have said they 
are investigating whether kikumura was linked to the group 
court documents filed friday revealed new details about 
kikumuras activities in the united states 
the documents said kikumura traveled about 7000 miles between 
march 14 and his arrest april 12 staying in numerous hotels and 
motels and in a trailer at a west virginia campground 
the fbi filed a request to thoroughly search kikumuras car and 
said three mechanics at a new york auto dealership reported seeing 
a revolver when kikumura brought his brown mazda in for servicing 
march 14 
no gun was found during a search of the interior and 
authorities suspect it may be in a hidden compartment 
kunstler hugged kikumura when federal marshals brought the 
defendant into the courtroom in leg irons and handcuffs 
the lawyer and his associate ronald kuby said federal 
attorneys motivated by political considerations against suspected 
leftists built up the number of counts by charging kikumura for 
each pipe bomb he allegedly carried 
this is virtually a triple indictment kunstler said 
authorities say kikumura would face a 90year sentence if convicted 
on all 12 counts which also include charges involving 
improprieties with a passport and a visa

thunderstorms swirled through the lower mississippi valley today 
after hitting central texas with baseballsized hail and 11 
tornadoes that uprooted palm trees overturned trailers and ripped 
roofs from several homes 
there were no reports of serious injury most of the damage 
friday was near corpus christi and san antonio where wind tossed 
trash cans through windows toppled power poles and damaged cars 
i saw it theres no question in my mind it was not a major 
tornado but it was a regular one it was loaded with stuff and it 
was doing its zig zag around said bill easley whose 4monthold 
daughter suffered a leg cut when a traffic light smashed through 
his windshield 
the thunderstorms swept across the lower mississippi valley 
early this morning but there were no reports of severe weather 
other thunderstorms were reported over the central gulf coast 
region early today bringing heavy rain a flash flood watch was

mayor teddy kollek sent a telegram to the los 
angeles times protesting a cartoon published in the paper that 
depicts jesus being turned away from jerusalem by israeli troops 
the mayors spokeswoman said 
in the telegram sent earlier this week kollek objected to the 
implication israeli authorities closed jerusalem to nonjews 
spokeswoman sevannah meryn said friday 
in all its history jerusalem has never been freer or more 
open to visitors to holy places as it is now meryn quoted the 
telegram as saying half a million christians visit jerusalem 
each year as well as some 120000 moslems from countries 
technically at war with israel 
even though a cartoon is only a cartoon it must be based on 
some reality and not only on doubtful hostile impressions and 
opinions it said 
the cartoon by the newspapers paul conrad published march 30 
shows jesus arriving at the gate to jerusalem on a donkey followed 
by several robed figures holding palm branches an israeli soldier 
blocks his path saying jerusalem is a closed military area 
the cartoon was an apparent reference to the frequent closures 
imposed by the military in the occupied territories in an effort to 
quell the 5monthold arab uprising 
israel radio said the cartoon was one of two that angered 
israels consul general in los angeles eitan ben tzur the radio 
said ben tzur proposed to the foreign ministry that israel revoke 
the press credentials of the los angeles times reporter in israel 
dan fisher 
yossi beilin the ministrys director general was quoted as 
calling the proposal a stupid idea because fisher had nothing 
to do with the cartoons 
the second cartoon published april 27 depicts an israeli 
soldier holding a smoking rifle standing atop a pile of 
bulletridden bodies the caption reads im willing to talk 
peace but there arent any palestinians to talk peace with

a large sinkhole quickly swallowed a house 
and two others teetered on the edge in a subdivision near this 
central florida town authorities said today 
just two hours after it opened friday evening the hole had 
grown to 70 yards wide and 15 feet deep witnesses and officials 
said no injuries were reported highlands county sheriffs 
dispatcher kathy buchanan said 
every once in a while you can hear a crack as it widens 
said john davis a 15yearold who lives a few blocks from the 
sinkhole the first home was completely in the hole 
the sinkhole also swallowed a garage and was expanding toward 
two homes next door ms buchanan said 
the roofs almost even with the road around it davis said 
dr barry beck a geologist in orlando who directs the florida 
sinkhole research institute at the university of central florida 
said he was surprised to see a large sinkhole in the area 
we rarely if ever get any that far south he said 
sinkholes are largely caused by the altering of the water table 
in the limestone and clay under the soil experts say 
a sudden lowering of the water table because of irrigation or 
drought can weaken and collapse underground limestone caverns 
while too much water draining into the ground can dissolve 
claylike materials and rock below

a jewish refusenik said today he had been told he 
will be given permission to leave the soviet union temporarily to 
visit his wife in an american hospital 
vladimir tufeld 60 said he was called to the ministry of 
general machinebuilding friday and told he should be able to 
receive his passport on tuesday or wednesday 
the ministry has objected to the former electrical engineers 
emigration on the basis that it could damage state security but 
tufeld said the work the ministry cites is 15 years old 
he first applied to emigrate in 1977 
tufelds 57yearold wife izolda was granted permission in 
late december to travel to the united states to be treated for a 
brain tumor she is hospitalized at the johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore where she has had several operations 
the couples son igor who emgrated to israel a decade ago went 
to baltimore to be with his mother 
in a telephone call to the associated press tufeld said he 
planned to leave as soon as possible upon completing the soviet 
paperwork 
the ministry did not know for how long his visa would be valid 
he said 
tufeld said he also planned to seek medical treatment while in 
the united states doctors have told him he suffers from gallstones 
and either a herniated disc or a tumor in his back but soviet 
diagnostic equipment cannot distinguish which it is 
tufeld said the decision to allow him to leave the soviet union 
temporarily showed the inconsistency of soviet policy if he does 
hold information that could compromise soviet security there would 
be no sense allowing him to travel abroad he said 
emigration has increased recently but does not approach the 
level of 1979 when more than 51000 soviet jews left the country

the dissolution of parliament has 
voided a controversial bill to protect us copyrights a legal 
expert said today 
prime minister prem tinsulanonda dissolved his cabinet and the 
house of representatives on friday after political infighting over 
the legislation elections have been scheduled for july 24 
kramol thongdhamchart of bangkoks chulalongkorn university said 
the bill would have to be reconsidered by the next government since 
it had not passed through several required steps before becoming 
law 
on thursday the house voted 183134 to protect us copyrights 
of artistic and literary works which are widely pirated in 
thailand the united states had indicated it might retaliate 
economically if the measure did not pass 
the bill still needed approval by the senate and king bhumibol 
adulyadej the countrys constitutional monarch before becoming 
law kramol said 
supporters of the 67yearold prem who has served since 1980 
said the action was taken because political dissidents refused to 
play by the rules of the democratic game 
political opponents criticized the prime minister for avoiding a 
probable noconfidence motion in parliament next month 
sixteen ministers of the democrat party the main party of 
prems coalition government resigned friday after failing to stop 
party dissidents from voting against the governmentbacked 
copyright bill the dissidents said the legislation would force 
thailand to bow to american bullying 
the united states had indicated it would cut tax privileges of 
thai imports if the copyright bill was rejected 
radio thailand today quoted a senior government official as 
saying 357 house seats would be contested in the upcoming general 
election 10 more than in the last one in 1986 representation in 
the lower house is based on population 
anak sitthiprasart directorgeneral of the local administration 
department was quoted as saying that the polling would cost 99 
million 
prem a former army general is credited with providing thailand

intelligence police commissioner osvaldo granadillo said friday 
the spanishborn venezuelan priest jose luis gil fernandez 57 
was arrested at maiquetia international airport outside caracas 
wednesday night after police found the cocaine packed in his 
suitcases 
gil fernandez who for 24 years has been the parish priest at 
san mateo 36 miles west of caracas was headed for madrid 
a former priest juan rojano martinez 54 and his wife graciela 
ramos de rojano 46 were arrested hours later in caracas and are 
alleged to have drawn gil fernandez into the smuggling trade 
granadillo said 
i wouldnt say that the venezuelan church has been penetrated 
by traffickers but gil fernandez is a priest and he is involved 
in drugrunning granadillo said in a phone interview 
the priest told reporters thursday that he had smuggled cocaine 
to madrid on two previous occasions 
he acknowledged he was paid 9000 for the first cargo of 19 
pounds in 1984 and 32000 for a second load of about 30 pounds he 
did not say when the second operation took place

for a new chapel in san mateo a parish boarding school and 
decorations for the church altar and i helped out the children who 
needed the money so much i havent got a penny of it

had asked his church superiors in march to remove him from the 
parish because i was horribly afraid

conference said friday that the church is disconcerted and full 
of consternation and pain over the case

follow its course merino said

nefarious trafficking business he said

thursday to be close to him in these moments of confusion 
he said didnt know of any other cases of venezuelan church 
officials involved in drug smuggling

in a rare and highly publicized kremlin meeting 
with russian orthodox church leaders mikhail s gorbachev promised 
greater religious tolerance and sought support for his drive for 
domestic change 
the soviet leader also condemned past repression of religious 
activity 
he said a law now being drafted on freedom of conscience 
will reflect the tangible results of new approaches to 
statechurch relations in the conditions of perestroika 
restructuring and democratization 
fridays meeting was gorbachevs first with high church 
officials since he became communist party chief in march 1985 such 
a meeting is unusual because party doctrine professes atheism 
the encounter reported by the official news agency tass was 
the lead item on the evening news program vremya and a front 
page story in todays editions of pravda and other soviet dailies 
tass said church head patriarch pimen had requested the meeting 
with the communist party chief to discuss the june celebration of 
the 1000th anniversary of christianitys arrival in russia 
gorbachev said his campaign for the restructuring of society 
offers benefits to religious believers but also carries obligations 
that can be met during the 1000th anniversary celebration 
on the eve of this event i would like to express the desire 
that it is marked by the consolidation of our countrys believers 
all working people for the sake of our common great cause of 
perestroika of the renewal of socialism complete unfolding of its 
humanistic ethical potential tass quoted him as telling the 
church leaders 
gorbachev has said his overhaul of society and the economy faces 
opposition at many levels so the appeal to church leaders was seen 
as an effort to enlist the support of another element of soviet 
society 
he did not specify what the new law governing religion would say 
or when it would be completed but said it would reflect the 
interests of religious organizations 
the law now in effect dating back to 1929 requires 
registration of all religious groups and prevents charitable 
activities and religious education of the young 
archbishop kiril of smolensk told a news conference on march 31 
that the rewriting of the law will open the possibility for a 
fuller church life for all believers in the soviet union 
under soviet power the russian orthodox church has been subject 
at times to harassment and violent antireligious campaigns in 
1961 premier nikita s khrushchev predicted the complete 
elimination of religion in the soviet union by 1980 
pimen the 77yearold patriarch of moscow and all russia told 
gorbachev that soviet religious leaders ardently pray for the 
success of the restructuring process and strive to do everything 
possible for its development tass said 
however pimen said without elaborating that not all problems 
of church life receive their resolution so far 
in his talk with the prelates gorbachev acknowledged the 
suffering of religious believers under the late soviet dictator 
josef v stalin 
mistakes made with regard to the church and believers in the 
1930s and the years that followed are being rectified gorbachev 
said without referring to stalin by name 
religious believers were among the millions of people killed or 
imprisoned under stalin churches and their property were destroyed 
during stalins drive to establish collectives 
under gorbachev soviet media have been reporting extensively on 
stalins mistakes and repression 
the millenium of russian christianity has raised the question of 
a possible visit by pope john paul ii the polishborn pontiff 
head of the roman catholic church has frequently expressed his 
desire to visit soviet catholics but has publicly disclosed that 
he has been refused permission at least twice 
however a tass official said on april 20 that changing domestic 
conditions in the soviet union could pave the way for the popes 
first soviet pilgrimage 
i am absolutely sure that this climate conducive to a papal 
visit is being created anatoly a krasikov tass deputy 
director general told a news conference in rome

the group agopian founded and led the armenian secret army for 
the liberation of armenia accused turkey and imperialist 
allies friday of masterminding the killing greek newspapers 
published similar claims 
but turkish foreign ministry spokesman inal batu today said 
such claims are absurd turkey never used these methods in 
dealing with terrorism 
no one claimed responsibility for agopians killing 
one report from the armenian secret army in beirut lebanon 
said agopian was fired from the organization in late 1987 
the organization founded in 1975 has taken responsibility for

eastern turkey it also demands vengeance for what it says was the 
massacre of 15 million armenians by ottoman turks in 19151916 
turkish officials acknowledge 300000 armenians died after 
ottoman empire officials deported the countrys 14 million 
armenians to syria during world war i

the government today released two former 
underground solidarity leaders from prison in a secret deal with 
roman catholic church officials but the activists refused to leave 
the country family members said 
witnesses and relatives said the two were then returned to a 
warsaw prison but their status remained unclear a spokesman for 
the communist government declined comment 
the two kornel morawiecki and andrzej kolodziej were driven to 
warsaws airport to board a flight to rome but they decided to 
stay in poland after meeting with family members 
the two were released from warsaws rakowiecka prison early 
today in an apparent deal between the roman catholic church and 
communist authorities both men were leaders of a militant 
solidarity splinter group 
they were given multiple exitandentry passports and were 
supposed to go to rome for unspecified medical treatment 
but after meeting with relatives in an airport lounge and 
hearing of a new wave of strikes they decided to stay in the 
country relatives said 
they are staying morawieckis daughter anna told 
reporters at the airport they may go at a later date but they 
want to think it over 
morawiecki and kolodziej were driven back from the airport in 
two umarked cars witnesses who followed said they were returned to 
rakowiecka prison by security officials 
also present at the airport meeting were three priests from the 
episcopate and a lawyer the priests declined to comment 
speaking later to reporters in warsaw morawieckis daughter 
said she was surprised that the two men were taken back to prison 
at first they agreed to go abroad but there was no 
ultimatum she said they wanted to talk to the families to 
consult with each other because they had no such opportunity in 
prison 
she said the two men wanted at least 24 hours to make up their 
minds 
ewa maria stoja kolodziejs girlfriend said official documents 
indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of 
a commission of prison doctors due to the required urgent medical 
examination which may also take place abroad 
the two women said kolodziej suffered from ulcers and teeth 
problems while morawiecki had ulcer symptoms poor eyesight and 
heart and kidney ailments 
anna morawiecka said the release of the two men was arranged by 
church officials and that there had been some intervention by 
pope john paul ii 
morawiecki who was was arrested nov 9 was chairman of the 
militant splinter group fighting solidarity 
he had been in hiding since the december 1981 martial law 
crackdown on the labor group solidarity the next year he formed 
fighting solidarity which differs from the outlawed independent 
labor federation because it advocates anticommunist political 
goals solidarity emphasizes social and union issues 
kolodziej headed fighting solidarity from the time of 
morawieckis arrest until his own capture in january he had been 
in hiding since 1985 
authorities alleged that the two were part of a ring that 
attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use from 
sweden they were never formally charged 
in a statement in november kolodziej denied the allegations 
a third less prominent fighting solidarity activist krzystof 
szymanski was also released today 
in another development jan andrzej gorny the solidarity leader 
in the southern silesian industrial region was released after an 
appeals court on friday suspended his sentence solidarity sources 
said 
gorny was serving an 18month sentence at a prison in katowice 
after being convicted of failing to pay alimony and using false 
identity cards 
in september 1986 the government of gen wojciech jaruzelski 
issued a broad amnesty for political prisoners since then the 
political activists it has jailed have been held on criminal 
charges

a judges decision to throw out his 
temporary restraining order against tuskegee university means 
students who owe the school more than 300 will not be allowed to 
take final exams next week 
macon county circuit judge howard f bryan had halted the 
predominantly black private schools crackdown wednesday but after 
a sixhour hearing friday bryan dissolved the order 
university officials estimate there are 600 students who owe 
more than 300 each and argued that bryans original order had 
hampered their ability to collect students said the crackdown was 
issued without adequate notice and threatened those students who 
were having financial difficulties 
university president benjamin payton said he was deeply 
saddened that it was necessary to go to this length to make that 
point 
this is not a case of tuskegee university fighting its 
students he said its a case of tuskegee university insisting 
that students learn very important lessons for life 
bryan ordered the school to leave its business office open over 
the weekend so students can make payments before exams begin monday 
the universitys crackdown on overdue fees had sparked a week of 
protests including a sitin at the administration building last 
weekend 
michael pintard president of the student government 
association said the ruling was a serious miscarriage of 
justice 
pintard said university officials should have identified 
categories of students who couldnt make payments because of 
financial difficulties and worked out a timetable for those 
students 
bryan said he agreed with the students complaints on a personal 
level adding prohibiting students from attending class is an 
exceedingly drastic action with as little notice as was given 
but he said he had no legal grounds to stop the school policy 
because the students didnt show that the universitys policy was 
arbitrary or would irreparably injure them

the soviet union says it will withdraw red army 
troops from afghanistan but it appears that the kremlin is 
creating a buffer zone along the soviet border in the northern 
afghan area here is a report from the area 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mazaresharif afghanistan ap a northern strip of 
afghanistan rich in agriculture and natural resources is being 
transformed into a soviet buffer zone despite the planned 
withdrawal of red army troops 
all nine afghan provinces bordering the soviet union recently 
were grouped to form a new northern zone with a de facto 
capital in mazaresharif ostensibly to coordinate development 
programs 
virtually isolated from the rest of afghanistan by the towering 
hindu kush mountains the ethnic minorities of the north are closer 
in language and culture to the soviets across the border than to 
their fellow afghans in the south 
for several months there has been an escalation of 
sovietization of the north a foreign diplomat in kabul said 
thousands of young people have gone to school in the soviet 
union some come home with russian wives its a very classical 
colonization 
the diplomat who spoke on condition he not to be identified 
further said the soviet military withdrawal does not mean the 
kremlin is abandoning afghanistan while president najibs 
government is still under attack by ussupplied guerrillas 
the soviets do not want to lose afghanistan the north is a 
soviet zone he said 
he noted that the northern zone includes faryab province 
the afghan oil region and said faryab is already completely 
dominated by the soviet union 
the soviets have pledged to start withdrawing their 115000 
soldiers from afghanistan on may 15 under a unmediated accord 
signed with the united states two weeks ago in geneva 
mazaresharif the administrative center of balkh province 
sits on a flat plain 40 miles from the amu river that forms the 
soviet border 
almost every car in the dusty town is sovietmade shop names 
are written in the russian alphabet as well as in the 
arabicpersian script used by afghanistan sovietstyle posters 
extolling the virtues of work and socialism loom over the streets 
early this year references to the new northern zone started 
appearing in speeches and newspaper articles in kabul the afghan 
capital 
the main point behind such rearrangement was to coordinate 
projects and needs because this area enjoys rich natural resources 
gas coal others said mohammad sharif secretary of the balkh 
province central committee of the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
afghan officials quickly point out that other afghan provinces 
also have been grouped into regional zones but only the northern 
zone has its own deputy prime minister 
najibullah masir minister of mines and industry and former head 
of the afghansoviet friendship society was named to the post two 
months ago 
mazaresharif and kabul 180 miles south of the border are 
expected to be the last cities vacated by soviet troops before the 
feb 15 1989 deadline for final withdrawal 
according to afghan and western observers who spoke on condition 
of anonymity mazaresharif is one of the most pacified areas of 
the country 
in 1987 the official soviet news media acknowledged that 
antisoviet guerrillas had launched at least two attacks across the 
border on soviet soil according to a us state department 
publication the soviets retaliated with attacks that caused 
enormous civilian casualties 
sharif said the sovietbacked afghan government now controls all 
but 80 of the 433 villages in balkh province these figures could 
not be verified but 18 months ago afghan officials said only half 
the villages were under government control 
the nine northern provinces have an estimated 2 million to 3 
million inhabitants about onefourth of afghanistans total 
population 
nearly all the people belong to the uzbek kirghiz tajik and 
turkmen tribes the same ethnic minorities who live across the 
border in the soviet republics of uzbekistan kirghizia tajikistan 
and turkmenistan 
western sources in kabul say they strongly doubt the guerrillas 
or islamic holy warriors can take control of kabul but if it does 
happen they say the northern zone could serve as a refuge and 
restaging area for the najib government 
if the situation is very bad in kabul the government could go 
to the north for reconquest a nonamerican diplomat said but 
i should be very surprised if kabul falls i think kabul will be 
very welldefended by the afghan army with soviet advisers

at 315 pm most tuesdays and thursdays prime 
minister margaret thatcher marches into parliament for one of 
britains liveliest political traditions question time 
armed with a thick notebook of statistics she jousts with 
questioning lawmakers amid the roar of others frantic to make a 
point fifteen minutes later she departs and the house of commons 
begins its business for the day 
the public gallery is packed for question time and millions 
more hear the rhetorical fireworks later on radio and tv starting 
this fall theyll be able to see the action too following a 
commons decision to let in television cameras 
born in 1721 to allow lawmakers to obtain information question 
time has developed into a test of ministerial mettle and some say 
a publicity show in 1901 a house leader called it a scandal 
and today many say it is more furious than ever 
its turned into a kind of gladiatorial battle says london 
school of economics professor alan beattie a specialist in 
parliament its very noisy and very crude 
its become a waste of time says tam dalyell a laborite 
expelled from the house for five days last year for calling mrs 
thatcher a liar in parliament its hullabaloo 
the curtain rises on question time a mixture of ancient pomp 
and modern informality as 62yearold mrs thatcher takes her seat 
on the government side of the house lawmakers lounging on their 
green leather pewlike benches sit up alert 
question from ron davies of the opposition labor party 
in her endeavor to reestablish the bonds of family life has 
the prime minister ever given any consideration to the value of a 
wife is she aware that the forestry commission is offering in 
compensation two pounds 380 per week for each keepers wife 
given that the forestry commission pays the same keepers 45 
pence 85 cents a week for a ferret and 230 pounds 437 a week 
for a dog should she not intervene 
mrs thatcher replies i think the honorable gentleman will be 
aware that the budget set out considerably to help wives we on 
this side value them very highly 
the sound and fury rises steadily and by the time labor leader 
neil kinnock begins criticizing mrs thatchers welfare reforms 
the prime ministers voice is barely audible 
she calls kinnocks remarks utterly futile as lawmakers 
scream answer the question youre wrong and speaker of 
the house bernard weatherill cries order order 
mrs thatcher relies heavily on statistics for her replies 
while some of her predecessors have preferred barbed repartee 
the late winston churchill was once asked is the prime 
minister aware of the deep concern felt by the people of this 
country at the whole question of the korean conflict to which 
churchill sniffed i am well aware of the deep concern felt by 
the honorable member in many matters above his comprehension 
mrs thatchers neardecade in power has led to frustration in 
opposition ranks and her personality has caused more friction than 
perhaps any other british leader beattie says 
the strategy she adopts is that you dont worry if the 
opposition hates you you worry about whether your own side thinks 
youve won says beattie some say speakers tolerate more 
disorder both in debate and question time to ensure the protection 
of minority party rights but that tolerance has led to increased 
unruliness throughout the house 
one of the worst recent incidents occurred not during question 
time but at the end of a dramatic debate on taxation 
in a show of antithatcher rage labor hardliner ron brown 
dropped and dented the gold and silver mace the club that is a 
symbol of royal authority in the chamber he was expelled for 20 
working days after refusing to apologize 
however weatherill says he feels that generally the house 
proceeds in good order 
he told the british broadcasting corp he also believes question 
time may quiet down when television enters the chamber for six 
months this fall 
i think the new stars are likely to be the reasonable 
members he said 
opponents argue that tv will encourage showing off strathclyde 
university in scotland has offered to teach lawmakers how to 
perform for television for 285 a day but says no one has signed up

the birthplace of english had better mind its ps 
and qs and improve its english teaching methods at the same time 
according to a government study which criticizes how the language 
is taught in great britain 
the study released friday by a governmentappointed committee 
concluded that most english teachers in britain were not properly 
equipped for the job and recommended that many be retrained 
education secretary kenneth baker welcomed the report he said 
his department will incorporate its recommendations into a new 
curriculum planned by prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government in a major shakeup of the nations 
educational system 
most schools no longer teach oldfashioned grammar but little 
has been put in its place baker said last year when he 
established the committee to study the situation 
the 90page report follows a yearlong inquiry by the committee 
into how english is taught in britain panel members include peter 
levi professor of poetry at oxford university novelists antonia 
byatt and keith waterhouse broadcaster robert robinson and poet 
pj kavanagh they visited schools across the nation before 
writing the report 
the report says all teachers should be trained in english and 
that each school should have a teacher whose sole job is to ensure 
that the language is used properly 
it adds that national standards should be established to be met 
by children at the ages of seven 11 and 16 however the committee 
rejected a return to memorizing grammar rules 
were not anxious to go back to the idea that you simply learn 
these things by rote because all the evidence is that that doesnt 
in fact improve the effectiveness of the childrens use of the 
language said sir john kingman vicechancellor of bristol 
university and head of the committee 
kingman rejected the notion that the new standards would 
discriminate against pupils from ethnic minority groups 
of britains 56 million people about 245 million are 
nonwhites mostly immigrants from asia africa and the caribbean 
whose children were born and raised in britain 
the fact that they may speak a different language at home is 
irrelevant because the english language is the way they become 
full members of english society kingman said 
it is a way of ensuring that we do not have an underclass of 
nonenglish speakers who are cut off from getting a job and having 
a career 
the opposition labor party and the 184400member national union 
of teachers also welcomed the report 
but michael simon head of the inner london education 
authoritys english center said he was concerned about the notion 
that all pupils must conform to a standard form of english 
about 80 percent of pupils do not speak standard english 
although they speak something very close to it any attempt to get 
kids to speak standard english will just disable them as 
speakers he said 
kingman a mathematician said english teachers were not being 
trained well in britain and that children were suffering 
we take a fairly dim view of english teacher training he 
said 
the report said that by age 7 children should read passages of 
simple sentences understand the spoken language spell common 
words and write legibly by 11 they should use punctuation and 
paragraphs argue their case on an issue and be aware of dialects 
it said 16yearolds should be able to express feelings ideas 
and arguments in writing and speech make comparisions between 
english and other languages and use technical terms to describe 
language 
english is the first language of 320 million people around the 
world and is spoken daily by about a billion people

a college professor who once claimed to 
operate the cleanest massage parlor in california has been 
charged with conspiracy to maintain a house of prostitution law 
enforcement officials said 
hal mintz chairman of the business department at east los 
angeles college is to be arraigned thursday on the prostitution 
charge and two counts of income tax evasion according to deputy 
district attorney eldon fox 
the tax charges accuse mintz of failing to file a return with 
the state franchise tax board for 1985 and 1986 financial records 
seized at his home in san marino indicate he earned at least 
200000 each of those years fox said friday 
mintzs attorney anthony glassman said his client would plead 
innocent to the conspiracy charge 
hal may have been lax he may have been negligent in some 
things but he didnt know what was going on at the massage 
parlor glassman said 
the attorney said that while mintz had not filed state tax 
returns for 1985 and 1986 he was in the process of doing so when 
his records were seized 
the beverly hills massage parlor located across the street from 
the west hollywood city hall adjacent to upscale beverly hills 
was closed in february after authorities said it was being used as 
a house of prostitution 
six former employees of the massage parlor have agreed to 
testify against mintz in return for immunity from prosecution fox 
said 
a spokesman for the los angeles county community college 
district said the district is evaluating mintzs position at the 
college 
under the terms of the state education code the particular 
charge against mintz does not enable us to automatically suspend 
him said warren kinsler the districts general counsel

neither michael dukakis nor his friend and 
moneyraiser bob farmer assumed great success when they sat down at 
the massachusetts governors breakfast table one day in the fall of 
1986 
dukakis was casting an eye toward the presidency and he had one 
question 
he said look if i decide to go for this thing will the 
money be there to wage a credible campaign farmer recalled 
farmer responded with some optimism but a day later he had 
second thoughts he called dukakis 
im troubled by one thing he told dukakis ive never 
raised money for a guy whos at 1 percent in the polls 
as it turned out farmer underestimated 
dukakis has been underestimated all along in this presidential 
campaign much as his fall opponent republican george bush has 
been 
critics fault dukakis for a cold aloofness a lack of passion 
and a presence that creates barely a ripple outside a staged event 
not until pennsylvanias primary tuesday where he won by 2to1 
over jesse jackson did polls show that as many as half those who 
voted for dukakis actually supported him strongly 
this guy really is the rodney dangerfield of presidential 
politics said bob beckel who managed walter mondales 1984 
campaign this guy gets more criticism for a winner than anybody 
ive seen in modern presidential politics 
dukakis is a man who is easy to underestimate says his 
friend arkansas gov bill clinton but he is extremely competent 
and well disciplined and has good values and all that comes 
through to the voters 
dukakis had other advantages aside from money he was helped by 
geography and a primary calender that fit nicely with his bases of 
support 
and like any winner he was lucky he was a beneficiary of gary 
harts political selfimmolation the disasters and missteps that 
befell other opponents the reluctance of new york gov mario cuomo 
to enter the race and the lack of national stature of his 
opponents 
dukakis announced his candidacy on april 29 1987 with a direct 
shot at the then frontrunner hart and his campaign of new 
ideas 
ask more than whether we have new ideas dukakis said ask 
whether we have already made new ideas work 
he called himself a longshot when he entered the race but 
within a month all that was altered by the revelations of harts 
relationship with a young woman 
i dont think you have any real sense at the time you make 
that kind of announcement whats likely to happen dukakis said 
in a recent interview with the associated press i said at the 
time its a very very long shot i meant it were all long shots 
i mean who knows its a very unpredictable business 
i thought that if we could organize well and raise sufficient 
funds and really work at it as i always have there was a 
possibility that we could do it its never more than a possibility 
when you start 
dukakis sustained his theme for a year never mind the charisma 
here was a politician who had made government work 
he offered as evidence the massachusetts economic turnaround 
notwithstanding critics who said he did no more than stay out of 
the way of a boom that was coming anyway 
i dont think people are all that naive i dont think 
anybody really thought he created the massachusetts miracle out of 
whole cloth said clinton but they knew that hed been a part 
of it and that hed seen the future they wanted to achieve 
dukakis campaigned in iowa with the knowledge that he had a sure 
win a week later in new hampshire his neighboring state he 
campaigned in the south potentially hostile territory by leaving 
dixie to jackson and sen albert gore jr and concentrating on 
atypical southern voters jews and retirees in south florida 
hispanics in texas liberals throughout the region 
he was credited with a strong organization and was able to 
withstand the loss of his campaign manager and top aide john 
sasso in the flap over sassos role in campaign sabotage that 
revealed sen joseph bidens plagiarism and lapses of judgment 
he was also lucky that his third place showing in iowa wasnt 
viewed as the setback it might have been dukakis campaign chairman 
and longtime friend paul brountas said his iowa finish was 
perceived as a strong showing 
part of the plan was to do well enough in iowa so you could 
preserve the geographic advantage you have in new hampshire he 
said had he not done well in iowa his support in new hampshire 
may have softened 
critics and supporters will argue over whether dukakiss belated 
emergence was a triumph of money over message but it is 
indisputable that his financial success made much of it possible 
farmer who had been treasurer for john glenn in 1984 initially 
thought he could raise 65 million by the iowa caucuses in early 
february 
his figure was in line with what the wealthiest of the other 
democrats were able to raise but the dukakis campaign raised 17 
million by iowas caucus night a financial triumph that gave 
dukakis an enormous advantage over his rivals and paved the way for 
his emergence as the likely democratic presidential nominee 
his bankroll allowed him to run campaigns everywhere and to 
keep staff in place while opponents were collapsing their efforts 
into iowa and new hampshire 
he was prepared as a result when the campaign moved into the 
foreign territory of the south and he was able to survive 
consecutive losses in illinois and michigan he headed north after 
super tuesday with 2 million in the bank while his opponents were 
broke or in debt 
how was dukakis able to do it and not the others one reason was 
the network farmer built asking not just for contributions but for 
each significant donor to produce 10000 in contributions from 
their friends 
he got enthusiastic support from greekamericans around the 
country tapping an igorned but often affluent community that 
contributed close to onefifth of his total 
importantly dukakiss own state had a booming economy and 
active democrats accustomed to giving 
the race for money in fact can be considered one of the major 
contests of 1988 and dukakis won it going away 
it isnt that candidates lose heart its that they run out of 
money farmer said money is the winnowing factor in this 
process 
former rivals and current supporters alike say the critics of 
his dispassionate style have missed something that voters found in 
dukakiss cool temperament 
mark mellman polltaker for gore said research done for that 
campaign found a startlingly positive reaction among voters to 
dukakis on television particularly in his commercials 
he communicated mellman said an inner strength a quiet 
passion an intelligent commitment to substance 
that is not the typical interpretation thats put on the guy 
but im convinced of it from research that we have done mellman 
said not sort of riproaring tablethumping passion but deep 
concern and deep conviction that speaks well of him that 
establishes a bond of trust with the voter

water rationing begins sunday but city 
residents wont discover how much water they will be allotted for 
another two weeks 
beginning may 15 customers will receive notices telling them 
how much water they can use the san francisco water department 
said friday 
we are asking people to wait until they get their allotment 
before they start saying they wont have enough water they should 
wait until they know said james cooney general manager at the 
water department 
i would encourage them to start saving water now and not panic 
until they see how much they will get cooney said 
reduced rain and snow has lowered reservoirs from northern 
california into oregon and washington 
the rationing program adopted thursday by the citys public 
utilities commission is aimed at reducing consumption by 25 
percent compared with 1987 
among other things the new rules prohibit washing sidewalks 
operating decorative fountains and serving water to restaurant 
patrons except on request 
the rationing program will depend on public cooperation and the 
only penalities will be increased rates for excessive use and 
possible installation of flow restrictors for big wasters said

from george bushs viewpoint the american 
economy couldnt be friendlier consumer spending is booming 
unemployment falling and the prospects of inflation too ethereal to 
stir much worry 
in fact the economys prospects appear so bright that one 
leading economic forecasting firm has an economic model showing 
bush will win the presidency on nov 8 with 53 percent of the vote 
that forecast by data resources inc uses a computer model which 
combines what is already known about the economys performance over 
the past six months with the firms expectations for growth and 
inflation between now and election day 
using an economic model to forecast an election still six months 
may be going out on a limb but economists said the exercise does 
highlight the importance economic issues play in voters decisions 
the model has been correct in the past people do vote their 
pocketbooks said david wyss chief financial economist at dri 
when things are going well they want more of the same and that 
is what mr bush is promising 
at the start of the year things did not look as promising for 
the republicans the 508point stock market plunge on oct 19 had 
spawned widespread fears that the country would fall into a 
recession in the early part of 1988 
in the three months following the collapse consumer spending 
fell by the biggest amount since 1980 when jimmy carter was 
president consumer spending accounts for twothrids of overall 
economic activity and that decline toppled the country into a 
brief recession which is cited as one of the factors leading to 
carters reelection defeat 
but this time around the economy kept rolling the government 
reported last tuesday that consumer spending propelled by strong 
auto sales rebounded nicely in the first three months of the year 
providing the momentum for 23 percent growth in the overall 
economy as measured by the gross national product 
the economic expansion which has now lasted for a peacetime 
record of 64 months has driven the unemployment rate down to a 
nineyear low of 56 percent 
the unexpectedly strong growth this year and the big gains in 
employment are raising some concerns that inflation is about to 
become a problem again economists are worried that with job 
markets growing tight and many industries operating at high 
capacity rates demand will start to push prices higher 
prices at both the retail and wholesale levels took a big jump 
up in march raising fears in financial markets that the federal 
reserve will be forced to step in with a dose of higher interest 
rates aimed at cooling off demand 
some analysts believe the central bank has already tightened 
slightly and they predict interest rates will be pushed up another 
notch if next fridays unemployment report shows the jobless rate 
dipped further to 55 percent in april 
but many analysts believe the increases in inflation and 
interest rates likely to occur over the next six months will be so 
small that they wont prove worrisome to voters 
donald straszheim chief economist at merrill lynch predicted 
that interest rates will only increase by onehalf to one full 
percentage point and this will not be enough to curb what he 
expects will be generally good economic growth this year 
if the economy does as well as expected between now and 
november that should be awfully good news for the republicans 
because presidents get the credit or the blame for the economys 
performance whether they deserve it or not straszheim said 
the democrats can be expected to try to focus the campaign on 
such problems as the huge budget and trade deficits and the unease 
americans feel about the countrys slide in the past eight years 
into the status of the worlds leading debtor nation 
questions about whether the united states will be able to 
compete in the future and what americans living standards will be 
should affect the outcome as well said lawrence chimerine 
president of the wefa group another economist forecasting firm 
but other analysts said these issues remain distant abstractions 
when compared to such pocketbook matters as jobs and inflation 
analysts also said that president reagans exceptional luck with 
the economy appears to be rubbing off on his vice president 
while the country had to endure the steepest recession since the 
depression in 198182 the recovery was well underway by the time 
reagan had to run for reelection 
many economists are predicting the next downturn will begin in 
1989 leaving plenty of time for the recovery to start before the 
next presidential election 
it is almost magical the way the economy has performed the 
right way for reagan at just the right time said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co bush is a lucky man to be 
second in line to the luck of the irish

cuba has quietly expanded its troop commitment 
to angola by up to 10000 over the past five months while taking an 
increasingly active role in southern africa peace negotiations 
according to us officials 
the officials made the disclosure as cuba along with the united 
states south africa and angola prepared for a new round of talks 
on an array of southern african issues 
the talks scheduled for tuesday and wednesday in london mark 
the first time that south african and angolan representatives have 
agreed to sit at the same negotiating table to discuss a peace 
settlement the two countries have been military rivals for more 
than a decade 
cuba had not taken a direct part in southern africa peace 
negotiations until january when cuban officials joined angolan 
negotiators for talks with a state department delegation in angola 
the us officials who asked not to be identified said that 
cuba is believed to have had between 35000 and 37000 troops in 
angola as of last november since then 8000 to 10000 cuban troops 
have been sent to angola bringing the total to between 43000 and 
45000 the officials said 
this is believed to be the largest number of cuban troops 
deployed in angola since they were first sent there in 1975 when 
angola won its independence from portugal 
if the cuban and us populations are compared the current 
cuban troop commitment in angola is proportionally far greater than 
the american military involvement in vietnam in 1968 when 525000 
us servicemen the alltime high were stationed there 
since early march about 5000 cuban troops have been sent to 
the western angolan city of benguela the officials said the area 
is not close to any combat zones in angola and us officials said 
cubas motives for the buildup are not clear 
the cubans generally have stayed away from combat zones in 
angolas civil war but a cuban defector rafael del pino diaz has 
said that cuba has suffered about 10000 casualties since 1975 
cuban troops were initially sent to angola that year to protect 
the countrys marxist government against attacks from south africa 
recently south african forces have been assisting the 
usbacked unita rebel group in angola this is one of the issues 
delegates from the four countries will discuss at this weeks 
meetings in london 
angola is eager for an end to the south african presence as well 
as a suspension of us aid to unita 
the highest priority for the united states and south africa is 
an agreement for the early withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
south africa has said that once that hurdle is cleared it will 
implement a united nations resolution calling for independence and 
black majority rule in namibia angolas southern neighbor which 
has been ruled by pretoria since early in the century 
however there has been no agreement on a timetable for the 
mutual withdrawal of foreign forces from both angola and namibia 
the head of the american delegation at geneva will be assistant 
secretary of state chester crocker who has been attempting since 
1981 to negotiate both namibian independence and a cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola

born poor in greenville sc 46 years ago 
jesse jackson has capitalized on his role as the nations most 
prominent black leader to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and 
accumulate sizable wealth all without holding elected office or 
drawing a regular paycheck 
he has kept busy even without his portfolio as leader of 
operation push the civil rights group he founded and led until 
before his 1984 presidential campaign 
in recent years his income has run into six figures and before 
his current campaign jackson traveled the world far and wide 
acquiring foreign policy experience during trips financed in large 
part by black church groups and business supporters and in some 
measure by sympathetic political groups or foreign nations 
the democratic contenders most recent financial disclosure 
form which presidential candidates are required to submit shows 
he had assets worth a minimum of 347010 and possibly much more 
he owns modest houses in chicagos south side and in washington 
dc and the greenville home his mother occupies his wife owns 
stock worth at least 250000 records show 
and according to spokesman frank watkins jackson has signed a 
contract with simon amp schuster that brought a 350000 advance for 
his soontobe published autobiography some of that money will be 
shared with people helping write the book watkins said 
with the eager assistance of black churches business 
supporters special interest groups and host governments jackson 
has managed to travel the world as a selfmade diplomat on missions 
of his own making 
he has embraced plo leader yasser arafat in lebanon accepted a 
cigar from fidel castro in cuba conferred with pope john paul ii 
in rome advocated antiapartheid civil disobedience in south 
africa and persuaded syria to release navy pilot robert o goodman 
jr whose plane was shot down over lebanon by syrian gunners 
he even showed up at the first summit meeting between mikhail 
gorbachev and ronald reagan gorbachev gave him an audience 
the democratic presidential contender says he has visited at 
least 35 countries and met with about 60 heads of state 
the question who pays for jesse jackson is difficult to 
answer partly because jackson has not released his recent income 
tax filings or other financial data beyond what is required by 
federal election law 
but no matter where jackson goes someone else often pays 
on the campaign trail jackson loves to tell how he allied 
himself with the workingman by standing with the striking 
meatpackers in cudahy wis in their hour of turmoil in april 1987 
he doesnt mention that he was paid 2000 plus expenses by the 
united food and commercial workers union for making that appearance 
when he registered voters and laid the groundwork for his 1988 
campaign jackson was on the payroll of the national rainbow 
coalition which he founded during his 1984 presidential bid to 
promote voter education between 1986 and 1987 the group paid him 
18750 jacksons financial disclosure shows 
at home in chicago between his 1984 and 1988 campaigns jackson 
was protected and chauffeured by two city police officers because 
he has received many death threats police escort him when he 
visits washington too 
the antinuclear activists in sanefreeze a peace group paid 
his fare when he jetted to geneva in november 1985 for his informal 
meeting with gorbachev as the soviet leader awaited reagan 
all of jesses thing has been a sort of whoeverwillhelp but 
thats the nature of the civil rights movement says bishop hh 
brookins a jackson supporter and leader in the african methodist 
episcopal church his whole thing is a kind of getasgetcan 
hes not one of these guys whos got it built in 
black churches across the nation always have helped underwrite 
jacksons trips abroad and his work at chicagobased push people 
united to serve humanity brookins said 
says jackson their congregations are supportive of our 
efforts so if we need 8000 or 18000 we just indicate what we 
need 
the rev jim holley for instance said he has helped jackson 
finance his foreign diplomacy 
there are certain ministers that jesse can call and ask for 
1000 and well give it to him without any questions asked said 
holley pastor of little rock baptist church in detroit we have 
a network i remember when push couldnt make its payroll one time 
i had three hours to raise 8000 and i did it because of the 
cause 
to illustrate his point holley said that in 1984 the rev 
jasper williams of salem baptist church in atlanta regularly 
donated money to help support jacksons family while the candidate 
was campaigning and not drawing a salary 
when a trip abroad was planned holley said a telephone 
conference call was set up with jackson and several ministers 
all of us would say how much we can raise and ask him things 
like are you sure thats enough who do you want to take along 
with you holley said 
jackson also has accepted the hospitality of foreign governments 
to defray the costs of his hotel accomodations food and incountry 
travel during some of his trips abroad 
in august 1986 for instance as world attention focused on 
rioting in south africa jackson toured nigeria angola botswana 
tanzania mozambique zambia and zimbabwe and met with their 
leaders 
nigerian president ibrahim babangida provided an airplane 
jackson said his hotel accomodations food and other expenses were 
provided by the host government in each country he added 
interest groups also have helped finance jacksons diplomacy 
in december 1986 jackson flew to japan where he met with prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone and to south korea where he visited 
dissident leader kim daejung who was under house arrest at the 
time 
rev joseph ahne a chicago pastor who helped organize the trip 
said the air fare and other expenses for jackson and five others 
were paid by a coalition of human rights groups from japan the 
south korean leg of the trip was paid for by that countrys 
national council of churches ahne said 
usually when we go abroad we are the guests of some human 
rights organization or some church or are at the courtesy of some 
government jackson said or if we must pay we simply target 
the money for that particular trip and raise it

vice president george bush having clinched 
the republican presidential nomination is moving quickly to fill 
key campaign posts and to assert control over the party structure 
for the fall election 
although bush closely identifies with president reagan on 
issues he is putting his own stamp on his campaign organization 
casting a wide net in assembling a convention and general election 
team 
and while bush talks frequently about involving new people 
many of his key choices are old political pros that date back to 
earlier administrations and campaigns 
a major casualty of bushs reshaping of the party apparatus 
appears to be gop consultant william e timmons who had been under 
contract with the party for help on the 1988 convention 
timmons who oversaw both the 1980 and 1984 republican 
conventions has effectively been replaced by frederic v malek a 
wealthy washington businessman and former nixon administration 
official picked to head bushs convention effort 
we wanted to have our own guy running it said a bush 
campaign official who insisted upon anonymity the official said 
malek was chosen for his managment abilities 
malek is a senior marriott corp executive as a special 
assistant to nixon in 1972 malek oversaw a program of redirecting 
federal grants to reap political gain for nixon dubbed the 
responsiveness program the scheme was roundly condemned by the 
senate watergate committee 
malek was selected for the convention job even before bush 
clinched the gop nomination last tuesday with the pennsylvania 
primary which raised his delegate total to over the 1139 
delegates needed at the convention in august in new orleans 
political consultants charles black and james lake who played a 
role early in reagans 1980 primary campaign but left before he won 
the nomination will be given major posts in the bush effort 
campaign sources said 
lake helped out in the reaganbush 1984 reelection campaign 
black most recently had been a senior political adviser to rep 
jack kemp who withdrew from the gop contest in early march 
meanwhile bush deputy campaign manager richard bond has been 
assigned to be campaign liason to the republican national committee 
new people means people that arent necessarily the same 
people that had the same jobs in the conventions year after year 
said bush campaign manager lee atwater it doesnt have anything 
to do with who they supported in earlier elections the vice 
presidents an umbrella candidate 
said campaign spokesman peter teeley were not going to bring 
in a bunch of novices we want to bring in people who know what 
theyre doing 
at the heart of the bush campaign are six men upon whose advice 
bush relies heavily and who meet regularly to plot strategy 
they include atwater a former reagan aide who worked in the 
1984 reaganbush campaign robert teeter a gop pollster who has 
taken on the role of chief campaign strategist craig fuller who 
runs bushs vice presidential office robert mosbacher a wealthy 
texas oil industry executive 
also roger ailes a onetime media adviser to nixon who has 
prepared bush for debates and former sen nicholas brady of new 
jersey an investment banker and longtime friend of the vice 
presidents 
this inner circle is referred to at campaign headquarters as 
g6 an apparent inside joke that draws on the parlance of 
international econmics and anticipates the expected arrival to the 
campaign of treasury secretary james a baker iii 
baker who ran bushs 1980 campaign and oversaw the 1984 
reaganbush effort is expected to come aboard this summer as the 
campaigns senior adviser 
then the group will become g7 the same designation given 
to meetings of finance officials from the worlds seven major 
industrialized nations in which baker has been an active 
participant 
when will baker resin as treasury secretary to accept a campaign 
assignment any time hes ready to atwater says 
bushs press secretary teeley who has served with bush off and 
on for many years is also viewed as a key campaign strategist 
outside the campaign bush frequently seeks the advice of sen alan 
simpson rwyo

during his 1984 presidential campaign for instance jackson 
raised the money for two major trips to latin america he traveled 
to mexico city in june 1984 and to panama el salvador nicaragua 
and cuba the following month 
neither trip was paid for by jacksons presidential campaign 
supporters were asked instead to donate to a humanitarian fund 
set up by campaign attorney edward coaxum jackson said 
coaxum a cleveland attorney didnt return repeated telephone 
calls seeking further information and jackson spokesman watkins 
said he didnt know how much the fund raised or whether it was 
incorporated 
it isnt unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someone 
elses expense foreign governments frequently invite congressmen 
by themselves or in delegations to visit and absorb the costs 
candidates sometimes use funds from their political action 
committees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials 
while jackson has traveled abroad extensively he apparently 
hasnt drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head of 
push in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign according to 
his financial disclosure forms and push financial records 
from 1978 through 1980 he was paid about 50000 a year as the 
national president of push he received 54615 in both 1981 and 
1982 the last year that he drew a salary from the organization 
according to push records filed with the illinois attorney 
generals office 
in 1983 jackson made about 115000 according to income tax 
returns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign of 
that 1983 income jackson earned 37342 in speaking honoraria 
jackson has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominent 
source of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign 
according to his financial disclosure statement filed with the 
federal election commission 
in august 1984 he started personalities international inc a 
company run out of his chicago home to receive his speaking fees 
and other income according to his attorney john bustamante 
jackson was paid 192090 by personalities between january 1986 
and oct 6 1987 according to the candidates financial disclosure 
statement 
jackson also signed a oneyear contract in october of that year 
with agency for the performing arts a prominent hollywood talent 
agent the company agreed to deliver jackson 1 million in 
engagements for speeches along with television and radio 
appearances as well as a newspaper column the companys commission 
was to be 10 percent 
the agency sued jackson in november 1986 for 101 million 
alleging he reneged but the suit was settled out of court recently 
collecting speaking fees or honoraria is a common practice 
among politicians senators are allowed to keep up to 40 percent of 
their 89500 salaries in honoraria sen albert gore reported 
receiving 31950 in honoraria in 1986 
michael dukakis on the other hand reported on his 1986 income 
tax forms that his only earned income was the 85000 he received 
as governor of massachusetts 
before becoming a candidate dukakis traveled occasionally as 
governor attending meetings with other governors and making a 
foreign trade mission to china those trips were charged to the 
state 
occasionally dukakis charged trips to his political campaign 
committee which dissolved only after his presidential committee 
was established in april 1987 
jackson also disclosed that he has assets in bank accounts and 
owns stock worth at least 347010 the disclosure form doesnt 
require candidates to list the precise value of such assets 
one of the jackson familys most valuable holdings apparently is 
stock listed in his wife jacquelines name in inner city 
broadcasting corp a new york firm that owns seven radio stations 
the apollo theater a record company and a production firm that 
syndicates the television program its showtime at the apollo 
on his disclosure form jackson lists the icbc stock as worth 
more than 250000 but percy sutton the companys chairman and a 
longtime supporter of jacksons work at operation push refused to 
say how much the stock would be worth if it were sold 
sutton contended in a telephone interview that recent news 
reports quoting him as saying the stock was worth more than 1 
million were inaccurate 
i have no idea what its worth sutton said we havent 
sold any on the open market 
sutton said the jacksons invested with him in 1970 when he was 
struggling to start icbc and have let their investment ride he 
declined to disclose their initial investment or how many shares of 
stock they now own 
dempsey travis a chicago real estate broker said he sold 
jackson his chicago home in a middleclass neighborhood for 49500 
in 1970 he estimated that today the home would be worth about 
175000 
watkins said jackson paid 100000 for his home in washington 
but he didnt know how much he paid for the greenville sc home 
that his mother lives in

hundreds of pickets who massed behind 
police lines as two strikebreaking ferries sailed into dover on 
saturday are on the front line in a battle against prime minister 
margaret thatchers labor policies 
like other unions that mounted major strikes in recent years 
steelworkers coal miners and newspaper printers the seamen 
milling on the dockside of this english channel port say they are 
fighting for survival 
you can take our money but you cant take our minds you 
cant take our hearts said sam mccluskie leader of the 
24400strong national union of seamen whose threemonth strike 
has crippled p and o european ferries crosschannel fleet we 
will stand together 
the rhetoric has the ring of yesteryears battles to save jobs 
and retain restrictive work practices that critics say slowed 
britains economic recovery 
even as the pickets cheered mccluskies call for unity p and 
os strikebreaking ferries pride of bruges and pride of kent were 
steaming toward dover from the dutch port of rotterdam 
their crews were drawn from the 1100 p and o ferry workers who 
have returned to work on company terms the pickets are among 720 
refusing to go along with p and os plans to trim its staff and 
impose longer working hours p and o has fired the strikers 
the companys main rival sealink british ferries is trying to 
keep its fleet in operation by invoking unioncurbing legislation 
passed since mrs thatcher came to power in 1979 
sealink has asked a court to seize the national union of 
seamens 53 million in assets under a 1984 law barring sympathy 
strikes but the company has moved hesitantly because it does not 
want to trigger a nationwide strike 
sealinks nervousness and a series of delays by p and o before 
the strikebreaking ferries slipped their moorings showed that the 
union still has clout 
moreover ships officers are wary of sailing with nonunion 
crews and picket lines discourage potential ferry passengers 
the conservative governments law that makes unions liable for 
damages over sympathy strikes is the one that helped crack 
prolonged and often violent stoppages by newspaper production 
unions and coal miners 
p and o chairman sir jeffrey sterling says the company must slim 
down and relax work practices or be killed by competition from the 
channel tunnel between england and france scheduled to open in 
1993 
mccluskie and his strikers also see the battle in apocalyptic 
terms 
when i joined the queen mary as a cabin boy i thought i had a 
job for life said a 38yearold seaman who identified himself 
only as arthur for fear of losing his job 
if we lose this he said thats the end of jobs for 
british seamen 
for the seamens union the strike is the bitter fruit of 
industrial decline britains oncemighty shipbuilding industry has 
collapsed and many british shipowners have switched to flags of 
convenience and hired foreign crews to cut labor costs as have 
shipowners in other industrialized countries 
its membership having fallen from 150000 in the 1950s to below 
25000 today the national union of seamen sees the crosschannel 
ferries as its lifeblood

south korea will consider any us 
request to contribute to the cost of protecting shipping lanes in 
the persian gulf a top foreign ministry official said saturday 
the official said the united sates is expected to make the 
request when us deputy secretary of defense william h taft 
visits seoul on may 1011 
if the united states makes a formal request we will study 
it the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
korean newspapers reported from washington that the united 
states will ask south korea to help defense efforts in the persian 
gulf by providing 20 million worth of free maintenance to american 
warships the us navy is guarding the shipping lanes which have 
become dangerous most notably because of iranian attacks on neutral 
shipping 
iran attacks neutral shipping in retaliation for iraqi strikes 
on iranian oil industry targets the two countries have been 
fighting for 7 years 
the united states believes south korea which imports more than 
half of its crude oil requirements through the persian gulf is 
obliged to contribute to the defense cost the reports said 
the ministry official denied that south korea has received any 
us request the donga ilbo a leading south korean newspaper 
said washington made an informal request through us military 
channels a month ago 
donga quoting unnamed korean government sources said the 
united states is also asking south korea to aid the philippines as 
part of efforts to step up security in the pacific region 
south korea has not made any decision on the matter it said 
donga said even if south korea decides to accomodate the us 
request for contributing to the defense efforts in the persian 
gulf it would be in the form of technical assistance rather 
than cash or sending troops or warships 
the official said south korea would have to be careful about the 
us request because contributing to the defense efforts in the 
persian gulf would consequently mean our involvement in the war 
between iran and iraq 
since we are in a delicate position between iran and iraq we 
cannot accept any us request in its entirety the official said 
the official said however that seoul would favorably consider 
another us request to provide more money for the support of 
43000 us troops stationed in south korea 
south korea currently contributes more than 100 million 
annually in direct upkeep cost in addition to 1 billion 
indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the public lands 
used by the us military here 
the united states is reportedly asking south korea to increase 
the direct upkeep cost by 120 million a year 
news reports quoted us officials as saying that south korea 
which enjoyed a record 978 billion trade surplus with the united 
states last year can afford to contribute more

steel workers at one plant ended a oneday 
strike today but organizers said 16000 others remained on strike 
in a larger mill in polands severest labor unrest in six years 
solidarity leader lech walesa told the government not to use 
force to break up striking workers 
the labor crisis now in its sixth day is the most serious to 
confront communist authorities since they declared martial law in 
december 1981 and banned the independent solidarity labor 
federation the new strike wave began monday when bus and trolley 
drivers won a 60 percent wage increase with an 11hour stoppage in 
the northwestern city of bydgoszcz 
walesa the 1983 nobel peace prize laureate told regional 
solidarity chiefs to organize protests and work stoppages if the 
government sends security forces against strikers 
i am warning against the return to the policy of terror which 
is apparently supposed to defend reforms while in reality it 
defends the way of governing which has led poland to ruin he 
said in a statement read friday by an aide over the telephone from 
walesas apartment in the northern port of gdansk 
opposition sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
workers from the giant lenin shipyards in gdansk textile plants in 
lodz and workers in szczecin and at least two other cities warned 
they would stop work if force was used at the two steel mills 
the staterun pap news agency said about 7000 strikers stopped 
striking today and left the stalowa wola plant 100 miles east of 
krakow in southern poland 
it said there had been no negotiations between the management 
and strikers 
but grzegorz surdy a solidarity activist in krakow said 
they the management gave in to all their financial demands 
they had demanded a 50 monthly pay raise reinstatement of coal 
allowances and release and reinstatement of three solidarity 
activists detained after solidaritys call for the strike 
the agency said the strikers would lose pay for the time they 
stopped work but mentioned no other action against them the 
plants management on friday threatened to fire all strikers 
the government has been moving to stem unrest on sunday which 
is may day the international labor day is traditionally celebrated 
by the government and used by polish workers to air their 
grievances publicly 
on friday police in warsaw detained jacek kuron a leading 
opposition intellectual and six other solidarity leaders union 
spokesman zbigniew romaszewski said today in the capital that 
brought to at least 33 the number of opposition activists taken 
into custody across poland since thursday 
also today four labor leaders were released from government 
custody 
joanna onyszkiewicz wife of solidarity spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz said her husband and warsaw solidarity leader 
zbigniew bujak were driven to warsaw by police from lublin and 
released 
the two were detained thursday in lublin northeast of stalowa 
wola 
in warsaw two former underground solidarity leaders were 
released from prison today and taken to an airport for a flight to 
rome but relatives said they refused to leave the country 
kornel morawiecki and andrzej kolodziej were then driven back to 
warsaws rakowiecka prison they had been released in a secret deal 
between roman catholic and communist authorities the relatives 
said 
in the southern city of krakow transport workers failed to heed 
a solidarity call for a strike today to support stoppages for more 
pay and union rights by workers who had occupied the two steel 
mills one in the krakow suburb of nowa huta the smaller one in 
stalowa wola 100 miles to the east 
romaszewski said transport workers had postponed plans for a 
strike today in plock an important petrochemical center in central 
poland 
solidarity spokesman grzegorz surdyk in krakow said one shift of 
the 5000worker steel mill in bochnia just east of krakow staged 
a brief strike friday but later suspended their action he said 
they would resume the stoppage monday if the nowa huta strike is 
not settled 
prices have risen 42 percent so far this year because the 
government reduced subsidies on many consumer items as part of a 
program to make the sagging economy more marketoriented 
labor minister ireneneusz sekula said friday the government 
would soon announce tax law changes and other measures that would 
allow enterprises to meet growing worker pressure for higher pay 
he gave no details 
three times in postwar poland in 1956 1970 and 1980 
widespread labor unrest has caused government shakeups 
strikers in nowa huta are demanding an immediate 50 percent 
increase in their average monthly pay of 105 and a doubling of the 
15 paid monthly in compensation for recent price increases to all 
industrial workers teachers health care workers and retirees 
plant deputy director janusz razowski told staterun radio today 
that the strikers demands for more pay were impossible to meet 
we cannot allow the steelworks to become insolvent

a consumer action group has 
called for a boycott of mcdonalds restaurants in west germany to 
protest what it considers the negative effect of fast food on 
society and the environment 
the boycott is being mounted by the volksmund information 
bureau which promotes a variety of local grassroots initiatives 
in west germany 
oliver weilandt a volksmund spokesman said saturday the group 
called the boycott because it is concerned about the effects of the 
fastfood chains vigorous marketing efforts directed at 
children 
weilandt said the group also wants to boycott mcdonalds to 
call attention to a worldwide industrialization of the food 
industry that is having catastrophic results on the environment and 
on agriculture 
officials of the giant us food concern say they plan no action 
against the group but many franchise owners are upset because the 
group receives money from the protestant church in west germany 
we are not looking for a fight with the church at all 
mcdonalds marketing supervisor rolf kreiner was quoted by the 
protestant press service as saying 
earlier this month several mcdonalds franchise owners 
threatened to stop paying church taxes because of the protestant 
churchs support for volksmund 
kreiner said mcdonalds understood the anger of some of its 
franchise owners but would not undertake any action against the 
church according to the protestant press service report which 
appeared in the frankfurt rundschau daily on friday 
the volksmund group says fast food is unhealthy and that it 
worsens local litter problems the group also charges that 
mcdonalds forces employees to work parttime to avoid paying them 
benefits 
we are targeting mcdonalds because it has perfected these 
worldwide strategies weilandt said 
officials at the duesseldorfbased headquarters for mcdonalds 
in west germany could not be reached for comment saturday 
there are about 262 mcdonalds restaurants in west germany

bishop eugene a marino about to become the 
first black archbishop of the roman catholic church in america 
returns this week to a south he believes has come of age since 
he left his native mississippi 36 years ago bearing childhood 
wounds of racial prejudice 
the 53yearold marino an auxiliary bishop in the washington 
dc archdiocese since 1974 will be installed thursday as 
archbishop of atlanta taking charge of a 69county region of 
northern georgia 
marino recalls a childhood in biloxi miss in which for 
example he and his sister were kicked out of a coinoperated 
laundry because they were black but he said in a recent interview 
feels personally very comfortable about returning to the south 
i think that the south has changed and come of age and 
grown he said in many ways the race question has been more 
effectively addressed in much of the south than it has been in the 
north 
i think i will be able as a black person to function better in 
a southern situation as a southerner than i might be able to 
function in some northern situation he said 
marinos appointment by pope john paul ii in march came more 
than two years after he and other black bishops wrote a pastoral 
letter calling on the church to increase the number of blacks in 
official positions 
one of only 12 black bishops in the united states marino became 
the first to hold an office in the national conference of catholic 
bishops when he was elected secretary of the organization in 1985 
but despite his role as a trailblazer for blacks in the us 
catholic church and despite atlantas long tradition in the civil 
rights movement marino said he does not necessarily see himself 
becoming a leader in that struggle 
i certainly am open to any position that presents itself to 
me he said but i dont think leaders go out and become 
leaders i think the situation and the need on one hand and 
opportunities and character and ability on the other come together 
and thats what produces a leader 
still marino said hes delighted and honored and thrilled 
to be moving to a city with a magnificant legacy and such a 
beautiful tradition of leadership in this movement 
marino will succeed archbishop thomas a donnellan who died 
oct 15 he said he plans to spend his first year traveling around 
the 21445 square miles of the atlanta archdiocese which has a 
catholic population of 156000 out of a total population of 37 
million 
marino said catholics in the atlanta archdiocese should not 
expect anything tremendously new or different under his 
leadership he said his most immediate goal will be to identify the 
poor in the area and call the people of the church to a greater 
awareness of the presence of the poor 
as the sixth of eight children growing up in a traditional 
catholic family marino attended elementary and high school at our 
mother of sorrows parish in biloxi and decided at an early age to 
become a priest 
in 1952 at age 18 he entered the josephites an order founded 
in 1893 to minister to blacks after four years at st josephs 
minor seminary in newburgh ny he completed his studies for the 
priesthood at st josephs seminary in washington dc and was 
ordained a priest in 1962 
he taught science and religion at the minor seminary in 
newburgh then received his master of arts degree in religious 
education from fordham university in 1967 he was named spiritual 
director of st josephs seminary in washington in 1968 and three 
years later was elected vicar general of the josephites 
during his 14 years as an auxiliary biship in washington marino 
was known as an advocate for the poor the imprisoned and the 
homeless frequently serving as their spokesmen before congress and 
the washington city council 
i think that one of the principal demands that jesus places on 
the church and upon those who are the ministers of the churches is 
to reach out to the poor and the homeless to those who are without 
shelter he said 
marino said he also intends to bring the message that we must 
be a welcoming church we must be an evangelizing church 
particularly to blacks who make up less than 3 percent of the 
american catholic church 
we are not looking to draw people away from their own 
churches he said but we certainly want to invite people who 
have no religious affiliation to come and see what it is that we 
have

mayor richard caliguiri who is suffering from 
a rare and usually fatal disease will be evaluated to determine 
whether he is a candidate for a heart transplant his doctor said 
dr james otoole the mayors cardiologist said a transplant 
is not imminent but he wants surgeons to see whether the operation 
is viable as an ace in the hole if the mayors condition 
worsens 
caliguiri 56 said that if a transplant is eventually 
warranted id be crazy not to take it 
otoole stressed that a transplant would not eliminate the 
problem with amyloidosis but it may extend the mayors life by as 
much as five to 10 years the incurable disease which causes 
deposits of a protein substance to form in tissues and organs 
would most likely attack the new heart over time he said 
caliguiri was elected in 1977 and is serving his third fouryear 
term he has said he will announce by the end of the year whether 
he will seek reelection in 1989

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
irresistible costcutting force of the airline industry has 
smacked into a seemingly immovable object at eastern airlines 
veteran machinists leader charles e bryan 
bryan a philosophermechanic who admits to being kind of a 
cornball sometimes bases his strategies on his selfeducation in 
yoga zen the bible and history 
its kind of a gandhi approach or martin luther king if you 
continue to be right its pretty hard for your adversary to 
overcome bryan said in a recent interview 
but although bryan quotes khalil gibran and gets mistyeyed over 
the selfless nobility of king arthur and sir lancelot in 
camelot his favorite movie passive resistance is not his only 
tactic 
president of machinists district 100 since 1979 bryan 
represents 12000 or more than onethird of easterns employees 
he has been blamed by former eastern chairman frank borman for 
forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to houstonbased 
texas air 
on april 13 borman vice chairman of texas air appeared with 
lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes at a news conference aimed 
at countering a growing image that texas air management is 
harassing employees and running unsafe airlines 
the intransigence and unresponsiveness of the iam are the most 
serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of easterns internal 
restructuring borman told reporters citing his own experience 
of trying to work with the machinists leadership 
bryan responded i would be delighted to sit down with frank 
lorenzo and have an open discussion with the whole world watching 
he can bring borman along i dont think hell ever have the 
courage to do that he couldnt deal with reality and the facts 
lorenzos takeover of eastern which teetered near bankruptcy 
chilled many employees lorenzo has become a bogeyman for airline 
unions a reputation solidified in 1983 when he took his 
continental airlines into bankruptcy reorganization he voided 
contracts slashed salaries laid off a third of the work force and 
got the carrier flying again despite a pilots strike 
bryan 55 sent lorenzo a congratulatory telegram after he took 
over eastern and asked for a meeting he never got a response he 
said 
instead bryan and flight attendants union head robert v 
callahan lost their seats on the board of directors he later 
received a letter threatening to fire him for meeting with union 
members on company property 
bryan had frequent meetings with borman during the former 
astronauts 15 years at eastern but he says hes never heard a 
word from lorenzo and has gotten no more than a coldfish 
handshake from bakes 
his letters to top executives he says are invariably answered 
by staffers 
theyve tried to diminish me to the lowest common 
denominator bryan said but if theres anything thats driven 
our union together its the way theyve tried to discredit me 
personally 
bryan believes management after failing to extract cuts of up 
to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other 
nonmechanics in his union wanted to force a strike keep the 
carrier flying with replacement workers and crush the union 
he claims rising numbers of firings and grievances have been 
designed to provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire everybody 
but everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy 
our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh 
treatment said bryan reelected last year with 82 percent of 
the vote 
the machinists have been working since dec 31 1987 under 
their old contract while they meet with eastern under the 
supervision of a federal mediator pay and work rules are the two 
main issues in the bargaining 
theres been more to the machinists effort than passive 
resistance 
the union has attorneys in miami palm beach new york and 
washington keeping up with myriad lawsuits including a recent 
machinists suit that charged management with trying to dismantle 
eastern and violating security and federal labor laws and asked a 
judge to reverse lorenzos takeover 
last year the machinists won a federal ruling preventing 
eastern from having an outside company take over some ground 
service work and in march another ruling blocked the announced 
spinoff of easterns profitable northeast shuttle into a texas air 
subsidiary 
and persistent charges by easterns pilots and machinists were 
blamed by management for the current federal aviation 
administration safety inspections of eastern and continental and 
for the transportation departments unusual study of texas airs 
ability to run airlines 
frank lorenzo has run into a smart cookie said callahan 
who left eastern after losing a reelection bid in the flight 
attendants union charlie bryan is not a wild man hes a very 
deliberate intelligent motivated man who has been carefully 
portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist 
appeal 
bryan a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10 
years ago is dedicating his 70hour weeks at 63879 a year 
these days to heading off lorenzo every place he can 
bryan says he wants only whats best for his members and the 
airline and believes employees should have important influence in 
their companies 
a lot of people identify me with don quixote bryan said 
but i never believe any of these dreams is impossible

a private relief agency says it is negotiating 
with vietnam to send the first permanent american aid mission to 
the country since the 1975 defeat of usbacked forces in 
indochina 
world vision a californiabased agency with projects in 80 
nations asked leaders in hanoi for permission to open an operation 
that eventually could funnel up to 400000 worth of assistance to 
danang province world vision president robert seiple said in an 
interview over the weekend 
seiple said he was encouraged by some officials responses 
during talks in hanoi two weeks ago but he cautioned that further 
discussions were needed with the vietnamese whom he called tough 
negotiators 
since the fall of south vietnam 13 years ago vietnam has 
received an estimated 10 million in assistance from private 
american groups but because americans are prohibited from trading 
with vietnam humanitarian shipments must be specially licensed by 
the commerce department 
so far the shipments have been small supplies of food and 
medical equipment arranged by delegations that visit the country 
for a few days 
world vision for example expects to ship 40000 worth of 
resins leather and other raw materials for prosthetic devices for 
the estimated 60000 amputees in the country seiple said his 
agency could do much more if it had a presence in vietnam 
theyre reluctant to have anybody us relief workers in the 
country permanently seiple said the stance is you give us 
the money and well do the work 
unless that attitude changes however the relief shipments will 
remain small though vietnam needs massive assistance because of 
its moribund economy seiple said 
vietnam won the war but is losing the peace he said 
world vision would like to provide up to 400000 in aid to the 
16 million people in danang a particularly deprived province in 
central vietnam and the site of major us military operations 
during the war seiple himself was based there as a marine pilot 
flying combat missions during the war 
it may not sound like a lot of money in washington but the 
us dollar goes very very far in vietnams economy seiple said 
the mission staffed by at least one world vision worker would 
assist the vietnamese to improve health care farming literacy and 
water quality the region is also hard hit by polio which thrives 
in vietnam because vaccination programs are limited 
the mennonite central committee and a consortium of european 
private agencies also want to establish a regular presence in 
vietnam according to the indochina project a washington group 
that follows vietnamese affairs 
besides vietnamese approval for permanent missions american 
groups would need the usual us government licenses us 
officials also have noted that a permanent office in hanoi might 
require special waivers of laws against usvietnamese monetary 
exchange transactions 
humanitarian assistance received a limited us government 
endorsement in late 1986 when vietnam agreed to make its best 
effort to account for the estimated 1770 americans still listed as 
missing in vietnam since the war in return the united states said 
it would encourage private humanitarian efforts 
since the agreement vietnam has turned over more than two dozen 
remains of missing servicemen and private relief groups have sent 
raw materials for the production of artificial limbs 
still the reagan administration has said it will be cool to 
further enhancement of the relationship as long as the vietnamese 
continue their occupation of neighboring cambodia administration 
officials have also said publicly they believe the vietnamese are 
withholding information about missing american servicemen 
the administration has been especially critical of a proposal by 
several senators that the two countries open diplomatic missions in 
each others capitals along the lines of the interest sections 
the united states and cuba have 
seiple and other humanitarian aid workers support the proposal 
it would be a positive step seiple said you cant fight 
a match outside the ring not only would it help in the 
humanitarian efforts it would probably help resolve the issue of 
the missing 
the war is over for both sides now is the time for peace for 
reconciliation for healing seiple said

president reagan said today he would issue a 
fast veto of the trade bill and urged congress to pass one that 
will assist not impede our dynamic economy 
in a weekly radio address delivered from the oval office reagan 
said his objections to the bill range from rules on plant closing 
notifications to restrictions on exports 
you can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto but 
fast the president said adding that he would then propose an 
alternative measure 
the president said the trade bill originally proposed in 
congress contained many provisions to which the administration 
objected 
working with members of congress we managed to remove almost 
all of these bad provisions he said unfortunately however 
when it comes to safeguarding property almost can never be good 
enough 
the current legislation despite all the hard work still has 
provisions that threaten economic growth the president said 
these provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unnecessary 
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry 
he said all congress has to do is drop the ruffles frills and 
flourishes put there for the special interests and we can have a 
trade bill and have it soon 
i urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action 
on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained the president 
said it is time to set aside the special interests and advance 
americas interests by passing trade legislation that will assist 
not impede our dynamic economy

the 1000page bill fashioned over three years of congressional 
debate won 6336 approval thursday in the senate three votes 
short of the margin needed to overturn a presidential veto because 
of the measures length clerical work and printing are expected to 
delay its delivery to the president until midweek at the earliest 
the bill would overhaul the nations system for imposing import 
curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid 
american industries threatened by steppedup foreign competition 
an section added to the bill requires all but the smallest 
employers to provide 60day notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs there are exceptions for companies that find 
themselves in serious financial trouble 
the administration opposes the provision saying it does not 
belong in the trade bill and would cramp us economic growth and 
encourage companies to locate elsewhere by adding new federal 
regulation supporters argue that the idea is humane and decent 
at the white house a senior administration official said friday 
that reagans veto message is expected to cover at least plant 
closings and the bills curbs on alaska oil exports 
it wont be a laundry list of items but we want to give 
capitol hill a clear idea of what the president will accept in a 
second bill the official said he said cabinet officers were 
being consulted about their objections

the deaths of two us helicopter pilots 
raises to 46 the number of americans killed during the past year in 
the persian gulf region 
the figure includes 37 who died in an iraqi missile strike on 
the us frigate stark on may 17 1987 iraq said the attack was a 
mistake 
the navy has 17 ships in the gulf including six mine sweepers 
and 10 others in nearby waters the effort prompted by attacks on 
merchant vessels during the 7year war between iraq and iran 
costs 1 million a day 
the pentagon announced in washington on friday that the two 
crewmen aboard a us marine corps ah1 cobra helicopter gunship 
had been officially declared killed in action they had been listed 
as missing since april 18 
the marine corps announcement said the crew reported an enemy 
radar locked on their helicopter before it disappeared however 
the statement did not say the craft was shot down by iranian 
forces as iran claimed 
its crew was identified as capt stephen c leslie 30 of new 
bern nc and capt kenneth w hill 33 of thomasville nc 
their helicopter disappeared when the united states attacked and 
destroyed two iranian oil platforms in retaliation for iranian 
mining of gulf waters and firing at american helicopters when iran 
countered later that day us forces sunk or disabled six iranian 
vessels 
tehrans official islamic news agency said 44 iranian sailors 
were killed it also claimed 15 us marines were wounded which 
us military spokesmen denied 
the helicopter which took part in the attack on one of the 
iranian oil platforms earlier in the day vanished during a 
nighttime mission off the guided missile cruiser wainwright a few 
hours after the fighting ended 
iran claimed it had shot down the helicopter and recovered the 
wreckage however none was publicly displayed 
seven other us deaths in the region came as a result of flying 
accidents four soldiers were killed when a navy sh3g courier 
helicopter crashed into the middle east force flagship la salle 
while attempting a landing on july 30 
a marine pilot was killed oct 5 when his uh1 helicopter 
crashed in the central gulf

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address as delivered saturday from the white house 
this week in washington trade was the talk of the town and 
important talk it was ive often mentioned trade issues in these 
broadcasts and with your help during these last few years weve 
been able to resist attempts to block free and fair trade 
it hasnt been easy because not a few politicians still think 
the way to reelection is to portray themselves as the great friend 
of the american worker by pushing protectionism its been up to us 
to point out that over the long run this approach halts growth and 
costs jobs but as i say with your help this message has gotten 
through 
believe me this ability to resist protectionism along with our 
commitment to lower taxes less spending and fewer regulations has 
made a huge difference in all of our lives i dont think any of us 
can easily forget that sense of desperation americans felt a few 
years ago as they saw inflation driving the weekly grocery bill up 
and up the value of their savings shrinking jobs growing 
increasingly scarce and economic growth going down to virtually 
nothing 
well all thats been changed around just this week beryl 
sprinkel the head of my council of economic advisers went down to 
the white house briefing room to deliver his quarterly report on 
the state of the economy some experts who had noted were in the 
65th month of our economic expansion were saying a slowdown was 
inevitable and others nothing last octobers stock market plunge 
made dire predictions about what the economy was going to do in the 
first quarter of this year 
but the results were exactly what we had hoped for and in 
fact what we had predicted the economy is moving along at a 
moderate rate of growth and inflation is well under control my 
fellow americans i remember only too well working in 1981 on my 
first televised speech describing the worst economic mess since 
the great depression and wondering even then how long it would 
take us to repair the damage 
well thanks to the dynamics of less government and more free 
markets the damage has been repaired and repaired much faster than 
anyone could have originally hoped thats why im certain you 
dont want me or congress taking any risks with this progress and 
thats also why ive made it clear that im going to be very severe 
with any trade legislation coming out of congress that threatens 
americas prosperity 
for the last year weve all been working on a trade bill here 
one that initially contained many objectionable provisions working 
with members of congress we managed to remove almost all of these 
bad provisions unfortunately however when it comes to 
safeguarding prosperity almost well almost can never be 
good enough the current legislation despite all the hard work 
still has provisions that threaten economic growth 
these provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unecessary 
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry provisions 
range from rules on plant closing notifications to restrictions on 
exports unfortunately these provisions serve the special 
interests and not the nations interest 
they would reduce the flexibility of our economy and render us 
less able to respond to the realities of the international 
marketplace in short they would make us less competitive not 
more this bill did pass the congress this week but the good news 
is the vote showed we have the strength to sustain a presidential 
veto and you can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto 
but fast and then all congress has to do is drop the ruffles 
frills and flourishes put there for the special interests and we 
can have a trade bill and have it soon 
as ive stated repeatedly i want a trade bill and well work 
vigorously to secure one i urge the congressional leadership to 
schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after my veto is 
sustained it is time to set aside the special interests and 
advance americas interest by passing trade legislation that will 
assist not impede our dynamic economy 
in the meantime im delighted to tell you that there was some 
good news on trade this week prime minister mulroney of canada was 
in town and we discussed our two nations pending agreement on a 
historic free trade zone between the united states and canada this 
is the kind of trade legislation we need legislation that promotes 
growth and prosperity and keeps america away from the protectionism 
that once cost the world and our country so much 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

the federal aviation administration today 
issued an emergency order barring older boeing 737s like the 
jetliner that ripped open over hawaii from flying higher than 
23000 feet if they have had more than 55000 landings 
the order is in effect until the affected airlines conduct 
complete visual inspections of the jets first class cabin 
structure which is the area that opened at 24000 feet in the 
aloha airlines jet 
faa spokesman fred ferrar said the order would affect 66 planes 
in the 737100 and 737200 series the jets are in the fleets of 
aloha piedmont and american airlines he said 
he said that at altitudes of 23000 feet the pressure between 
the outside and inside of the aircraft is such that a structural 
weakness would not cause a failure or damage to the plane 
the order issued as an airworthiness directive by faa 
administrator t allan mcartor is effective immediately ferrar 
said airlines must complete inspections of the aircraft over the 
next 500 landings 
last october 5 the faa ordered close inspection of the upper 
skin of the early model boeing 737s because routine inspections had 
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap 
officials said friday the agency warned the problem could cause 
rapid cabin decompression they said 
the inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming 
loose on some earlymodel boeing 737s because the lamination was no 
longer holding 
boeing spokesman jim boynton said in seattle the company has 
issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections for 
possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion of 
the skin of the older boeing 737s 
boynton said the companys most recent bulletin had been issued 
two weeks before thursdays incident in which a huge upper section 
of an aloha airlines 737 jet tore away leaving passengers exposed 
to the open skies at 24000 feet and forcing the pilot to make an 
emergency landing within 15 minutes 
a flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 
61 passengers were injured in the incident 
the aloha airlines jet involved in the incident was among the 
early 737 models subject to the faa directive as well as to the 
series of service bulletins by boeing outlining the inspection 
programs officials said friday 
the faa directive required operators of older boeing 737s to 
inspect the extreme upper sections of the planes outer skin from 
just behind the front entry door to the tail section for cracks and 
metal strips that might be coming loose and could result in rapid 
depressurization of the airplane 
the directive covered the first 291 boeing 737s manufactured of 
which the aloha plane was no 152 according to boeing 
investigators have not determined the cause of the aloha 
incident but sources who asked not to be identified said that 
investigators are focusing on a possible structural failure that 
could have caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin 
however stephanie ackerman manager of public relations for 
aloha said we are in full compliance with the october 
directive we did receive the directive the inspections were 
carried out and we are in compliance 
she would not elaborate on what the inspections revealed but 
said nothing was found that caused alarm 
faa records show that twice in 1983 and several other times 
since then there has been extensive repair work to mend cracks and 
corroded metal in the lower half of the aloha plane this seemed 
not to be related to thursdays incident

president reagan said saturday that he plans 
to quickly veto the trade legislation passed by congress and that 
the politically touchy issue of plant closing notification will not 
be the only reason for his action 
you can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto but 
fast reagan said in his weekly radio address delivered from the 
oval office 
the president said almost all of the provisions the 
administration originally objected to had been removed from the 
bill during negotiations with congress 
unfortunately however when it comes to safeguarding 
prosperity almost can never be good enough 
the current legislation despite all the hard work still has 
provisions that threaten economic growth the president said 
these provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unnecessary 
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry 
the provisions range from rules on plant closing notifications 
to restrictions on exports 
reagans veto could come as early as midweek and he indicated 
saturday that he expects his veto to be sustained although the 
measure won approval by a wide margin in the house the senates 
6336 vote was three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a 
veto 
i urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action 
on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained reagan said 
it is time to set aside the special interests and advance 
americas interests by passing trade legislation that will assist 
not impede our dynamic economy 
the plantclosings feature requires all but the smallest 
employers to provide 60day notice of closings and largescale 
layoffs there are exceptions for companies that find themselves in 
serious financial trouble 
the administration opposes the provision saying it would cramp 
us economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by 
adding new federal regulation rep don pease of ohio delivering 
the democratic response to the presidents speech said it 
merely calls for a measure of common courtesy on the part of those 
companies that can afford it 
onethird of all workers get no notice theyre told to pick 
up their pay checks and leave pease said twothirds of all 
workers get less than two weeks notice they may have put in 20 
years of service and have two kids in college but theyre out on 
the street just like that 
the presidents comments came after one of his strongest 
supporters in the senate expressed qualms about focusing on the 
plant closing provision in a presidential veto message 
frankly some of us think there ought to be a stronger 
reason senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told 
reporters 
blaming the veto on the plantclosings provision dole told 
reporters thursday puts republicans on the side at least the 
perception out there of being against the poor working men and 
women who get only fourday notice 
he expressed doubt when pressed however that the issue would 
be much of a headache on the campaign trail this fall 
the provisions supporters are just as sure that it will 
it certainly gives the democrats a huge issue for the fall 
said sen paul simon dill there arent going to be many 
factory workers who think it is unfair for them to get 60day 
notice before they get put out to pasture 
there are polls out there says sen donald w riegle jr 
dmich the american people feel that it is entirely reasonable 
and sound 
dole was the most candid among administration supporters but 
several gop congressional staffers said there was growing concern 
over the issue 
the main provisions of the trade bill would overhaul the 
nations system for imposing import curbs to retaliate against 
international trade violations and aid american industries 
threatened by steppedup foreign competition

a set of remaining loose ends is casting a 
shadow on prospects for ratification of the ussoviet 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty in time for president 
reagans summit trip to moscow 
the four snags cited by senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva include a ussoviet disagreement about the meaning of 
provisions designed to assure the united states against soviet 
cheating 
he and the other leaders say they are optimistic all the 
difficulties will be resolved but they have firmly declared their 
opposition to rushing the ratification proceedings just so the work 
will be finished by the may 29june 2 summit 
this is not a delay said sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee this is an effort to do this 
thoroughly 
since last december when the superpowers signed the pact 
eliminating groundbased missiles with ranges between 315 and 3125 
miles reagan has hailed the verification and monitoring provisions 
as unprecedented sets of safeguards against soviet noncompliance 
having steered the pact through committee hearings the 
administration is now eager for approval by the whole senate in 
time for a formal exchange of ratification documents between reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at the summit 
byrd told a news conference on friday he would open the senate 
debate on may 11 if the four obstacles are overcome joining byrd 
and nunn in the decision were the chairmen of two other important 
senate committees claiborne pell dri of foreign relations and 
david l boren dokla of the select committee on intelligence 
who called the stumbling blocks important loose ends 
the newest of the four problems identified by byrd is a 
disagreement between the united states and the soviet union over 
the things inspectors of missile facilities will be permitted to 
see and where they may go to see them 
according to the state department soviet experts believe the 
treaty permits inspection of weapons containers big enough to 
contain entire missiles they also want to put offlimits some 
areas of three of their 133 facilities covered by the agreement 
the united states says the treaty permits inspection of smaller 
containers as well to see if they contain individual missile 
stages and does not permit the soviets to place the selected areas 
off limits 
state department spokesman charles e redman said higher level 
officials had become involved in the dispute which originally was 
raised on a technical level and he said he was optimistic the 
problems would be resolved 
nunn said i believe the problems can be reconciled but i 
believe the soviets should understand this is not a good way to 
start out by challenging some clear provisions of the treaty 
it is enormously important that we go into this treaty with 
good faith on both sides we do not need any cloud of bad faith 
hanging over us 
the second snag the senators said was the need to get 
clarification from the soviets in writing that the ban on 
intermediate rangemissiles now in the superpower arsenal will 
prevent both sides from developing futuristic versions of these 
weapons 
in settling this dispute the two countries would presumably 
need to define more precisely what is in fact a weapons 
delivery system the fear is that arms builders could devise a 
weapon they do not define as a missile but has the capabilities 
that todays missiles have 
third the senators are seeking assurances that the united 
states has the capability to verify the ban on futuristic weapons 
and finally they want a commitment from the administration that it 
is moving adequately and with enough money to upgrade satellite 
surveillance systems that help monitor the accord 
if these differences can be resolved i dont see any reason 
why we cant approve ratification byrd said

its an election year and democratic and 
republican leaders in congress are putting a high priority on 
antidrug legislation but their major problem is how to fund the 
battle 
both political parties are going to be scrambling to pose as 
mr drug buster for the next six months said rep david obey 
chairman of the house subcommittee on foreign operations 
theres a tendency to pose for holy pictures in election years 
on drugs and then forget about the blasted issue next time 
round complained obey dwis 
the senate has struck first going on record earlier this month 
930 in favor of bypassing congress spendingcut promises to allow 
26 billion in new drug programs indications are that the 
envisioned drug bill will be timed to hit the senate floor in 
september for maximum election impact 
the house voted to stay within current overall spending 
guidelines but its democratic and republican leaders have each 
ordered up their own drug bills with public release expected in 
the next few weeks 
were hoping republicans and democrats will join together and 
well have a bipartisan drug bill said house speaker jim wright 
dtexas 
rep bill mccollum of florida chairman of the republicans task 
force agreed but containing the cost will make it tough he said 
there will be for anyone a very limited amount of 
resources he said they are going to be meager compared to all 
the ideas there are to spend them 
the senate bill introduced by sens dennis deconcini dariz 
and alfonse damato rny would provide big budget increases for 
federal law enforcement agencies and grants to local police 
about a fourth of the money would go toward efforts to reduce 
demand in this country through treatment centers and drug education 
the house bills will carry those options and more 
wright has asked committee chairmen to come up with a 
comprehensive package it will almost surely be more expensive than 
whatever the house republicans propose especially in aid to local 
governments and police 
liberals on friday were looking at cutting military spending to 
pay for it 
an amendment was being considered for the pentagon bill now 
before the house that would cut funding for the star wars missile 
defense system and transfer it to the antidrugimport efforts 
rep tony coelho dcalif the thirdranking democrat 
acknowledged the reagan administration might consider that funding 
strategy as backing away from pentagon spending agreements made 
last fall but he said the public has their priorities the same 
as we do 
rep charles rangel dny the chairman of the house select 
narcotics committee would like to also include money to fight aids 
among drug users and would support expanded use of the us 
military to help other nations control their drug production 
according to spokesman bob weiner 
one thing we dont want is the death penalty he said or 
penalties on users that would overload prisons weiner said 
rangels proposal would be about the same cost as the senate plan 
republicans are looking at stiffer penalties for drug offenders 
including capital punishment for dealers involved in deaths and 
proposals to cut demand with emphasis on what they call user 
accountability what form that will take is still unclear as 
jail terms must be weighed against problems of prison overcrowding 
the gop lawmakers who two years ago opposed creation of a drug 
czar to coordinate federal efforts may now favor one they 
were also examining drug testing and related proposals to force 
antidrug action by local governments and businesses that get 
federal money 
both the house and senate are expressing impatience with the 
cooperation of other countries 
the senate has voted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions against 
mexico for not doing its share to help the united states fight the 
flow of drugs across the border 
the house foreign affairs committee meanwhile has recommended 
similar action against peru bolivia and paraguay 
neither of those pieces of legislation is expected to reach the 
presidents desk but with the white house at stake this year some 
sort of drug legislation including international enforcement is 
expected to emerge before congress quits in october for the 
campaign trail 
ann b wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters told obeys subcommittee the administration was 
expecting congress to take action on drugs before the election 
drugs is a cyclical issue she told a house 
appropriations subcommittee when the drug bill is on the floor 
were going to have an orgy of amendments of people outnarcing 
each other 
rep jerry lewis of california who is helping to draft the gop 
proposal agreed its very clear that in the months ahead 
congress will be right in the middle of this business he said 
rep james traficant dohio told the house last week that 
congress needed to take drastic action including the death penalty 
for dealers and use of the military 
too many politicians make hay with drugs around here and the 
drug dealers just keep making money he said

the reagan administration saturday relaxed its 
order prohibiting americans from paying debts in panama opening 
the way for many us workers to clear up bills for water power 
and other essential services 
on april 8 president reagan barred any direct or indirect 
payments by americans to the regime headed by gen manuel noriega 
the order which included us corporations also blocked all 
panamanian assets in the united states 
subsequently electrical power and other services were cut off 
at the homes of some americans including embassy workers 
who were prohibited from paying their bills 
the treasury departments announcement saturday specified that 
americans may now make payments for electricity water and similar 
municipal services and for communications including telephones and 
telegrams 
also allowed will be travelrelated payments including 
departure fees and ticket taxes landing fees and fuel taxes 
individuals who have paid into panamas social security system 
which includes health care may continue to do so but payments of 
the countrys income tax remain on the prohibited list the payment 
of sales and excise taxes will now be allowed 
the new rules continue to require that payments for other 
obligations be made into a specially designated account at the 
federal reserve bank of new york to be held for the benefit of 
the panamanian people those payments include corporate and 
individual income taxes port fees import duties and corporate 
social security assessments

a fistsized bundle of fluff named molloko the 
first california condor chick conceived in captivity gobbled meals 
of minced mice today 
everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick 
said martha baker spokeswoman for the san diego wild animal park 
but the first 10 days are critical for anybody human or 
animal 
the chick ate its first meal about 6 am and took subsequent 
meals from the fingertips of a keeper ms baker said 
the food was minced baby mice and chicken egg yoke she said 
the meals fed to the chick which is about the size of a mans 
fist amounted to about two tablespoons of food 
keepers using tweezers and gloved fingertips helped the baby 
bird break free of its shell at 538 pm pdt friday ending a 
61hour hatching process that began when the first crack appeared 
in the chicks shell wednesday 
molloko is an indian word for condor chosen by an intertribal 
council of california tribes ms baker said 
the squawking chick was swaddled in a towel and placed in the 
same type of isolette used for premature infants the dull 
yellowcolored chick with its bald peaked head was reportedly 
resting comfortably 
early this morning there were 27 california condors left in 
the world bill toone the parks curator of birds said at the 
news conference friday this afternoon theres 28 of them and we 
couldnt be more excited about that 
when the numbers are so low one bird is seen as a very big 
step away from extinction he added 
the chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair 
of the nearly extinct california condor north americas largest 
land bird 
efforts to save the california condor which has a wingspan of 
up to 10 feet at maturity rest with the captive breeding program 
the last known california condor in the wild was captured a year 
ago 
the chick whose sex wont be determined for about a month will 
grow up not knowing its mother or father it will be raised in 
captivity with the help of hand puppets that resemble condors the 
puppets are used to feed the chick 
officials decided to intervene in the hatching process friday 
and give the chick a delicate boost after it became mired inside 
its shell 
the bird had become stuck in a kind of glue composed of 
dried membrane and albumen and couldnt rotate in the shell to peck 
its way out hanscom said 
biologist cyndi kuehler checked the egg every two hours friday 
before determining the chick was ready to be assisted from the 
shell 
kuehler couldnt intervene prematurely because of the danger of 
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes possibly 
triggering fatal bleeding at the point of the rupture hanscom said 
when it was certain that the chicks external circulation 
ceased kuehler could begin to pull away bits of the bluegreen 
eggshell using her gloved fingers tweezers were used to peel back 
the shell membrane the gradual complicated process took seven 
hours until there was room to lift the bird out 
the avocadosized egg about 5 inches long had been under a 
24hour watch since 4 am wednesday when keepers noticed cracks 
in one end the pip cracks signaled the start of a hatching 
process that took nearly three days 
after the egg was laid march 3 it was taken away from the 
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female 
bird would produce a second egg but so far this has not happened

here is the text of the democratic response 
given saturday by rep don j pease dohio to president reagans 
radio address 
president reagan ought to sign the trade bill he will make a 
foolish mistake if he vetoes the bill it will be a foolish mistake 
because the united states is on the threshold of a new economic 
era to preserve our standard of living in the 1990s we must do 
better much better in the game of global trade 
the american people understand this thats why the trade bill 
passed the congress by a large bipartisan majority 
the bill recognizes that we need to do two things above all we 
must launch an export campaign unprecedented in our history and we 
must improve our productivity 
the bill plots a strategy for increasing exports first it 
liberates firms from the red tape of unduly tight export controls 
second it boosts export promotion efforts to benefit american 
companies third it blows the whistle on unequal and unfair trade 
many countries have gotten rich off of free access to the us 
market while protecting their home markets these countries can now 
afford to eliminate their trade barriers the bill requires them to 
live up to their international obligations pure and simple we 
seek a level playing field 
but it takes more than a level playing field to compete youve 
got to have skilled employees and a sure way to boost labor 
productivity is to strengthen education and training 
the trade bill would entitle all workers who lose their jobs to 
imports to training or remedial education it provides nearly a 
billion dollars for the readjustment of other workers and it 
renews the nations commitment to math science foreign language 
and vocational education 
in addition the bill requires large financially sound 
companies to give their employees and communities 60 days notice of 
plant closings or mass layoffs it merely calls for a measure of 
common courtesy on the part of those companies that can afford it 
members of congress get 60 days notice when they lose their job 
so does the president of the united states why shouldnt ordinary 
citizens even president reagans own task force and the us 
chamber of commerce say that advance notice is good business 
practice 
the president objects because he believes this is a matter for 
the private sector not the government to decide well mr 
president the private sector has had every opportunity to take 
care of this problem on its own terms it has failed 
onethird of all workers get no notice theyre told to pick up 
their paychecks and leave twothirds of all workers get less than 
two weeks notice they may have put in 20 years of service and 
have two kids in college but theyre out of the street just like 
that 
years ago the american people decided that it makes sense to 
ease the social and economic costs of unrestrained free enterprise 
we enacted child labor minimum wage and antitrust laws the plant 
closing provision is squarely in this tradition 
critics say the provision has nothing to do with competitveness 
theyre wrong if a worker had advance notice of a layoff he has 
time to make arrangements for retraining before the clock starts 
ticking on his unemployment insurance reducing the period of 
unemployment facilitating retraining that is what improving labor 
productivity is all about 
today america needs a workforce that is flexible and adaptable 
able to shift rapidly to changing economic conditions germany and 
japan have already figured this out they have advancenotice 
requirements to oppose this provision is to resist an effort to 
move this country into the 1990s 
it is tragic that the president is threatening to kill the 
entire bipartisan trade bill on account of this one provision in 
truth his opposition is really based on symbolism he fears a 
symbolic victory for labor 
is mere symbolism worth the price of needlessly unemployed 
people and depressed communities is it worth the price of another 
several years without a coherent foreign economic policy is it 
worth killing a bipartisan bill which congress spent three years 
on common sense says no 
mr president the country is ready for the 1990s for the sake 
of the american people sign the trade bill

saturday to protest a new antihomosexuality law that they say will 
allow censorship of the arts 
the demonstrators gathered from all over the country and 
streamed through central london to a rally against the government 
bill which becomes law on june 1 
actress maria aitken said she supported the protest because she 
is worried that the law will result in censorship of works by 
homosexuals 
the government measure is a blanket stipulation stating that 
local authorities must not intentionally promote homosexuality 
the government has accused some leftwing local authorities of 
using state funds to promote homosexuality as an acceptable 
lifestyle 
opponents say wording of the measure is so broad that it can be 
used to censor artistic works particularly books and plays by or 
about homosexuals 
several members of the royal shakespeare company joined 
saturdays march a british legislator and two italian lawmakers 
also took part in the protest 
one demonstrator actor michael cashman is widely known for his 
role as colin a gay man in the british broadcasting corps soap 
opera eastenders broadcast in the united states 
the importance of this protest is to show that we are 
determined to stand up and fight for our rights as human beings 
he said 
in new york city about a hundred sympathizers demonstrated in 
midtown manhattan carrying placards in support of the british 
homosexual cause

the decision to widen the us military 
role in the persian gulf could make the united states the policeman 
of the waterway despite its aversion to the task gulf shipping 
officials said saturday 
the shipping community generally welcomed president reagans 
decision to expand its protection of foreign vessels from attacks 
by iran but some shippers also complained that the new policy does 
not go far enough 
the best attitude to adopt now is a waitandsee one said a 
shipping executive who has complained that his vessels mainly 
flying asian flags were left at the mercy of iran as the big 
powers protected their own shipping 
from what has been annnounced protection has not been 
guaranteed for all ships he said it sounds like an elastic 
policy that will be used by the united states at the right moment 
when they choose to take on the iranians 
under the policy announced friday us forces will go to the 
aid of noncommunist neutral ships that ask for help after being 
fired upon 
previously us warships protected only those ships reflagged 
with us flags or registered as usflagged vessels including 11 
kuwaiti oil tankers 
the navy escorts through the gulf however frequently have 
picked up hitchhiker vessels that are not us flagged 
in effect the new policy could turn out to be a substitute 
for the proposal to have a un naval task force protect shipping 
in the gulf until the iraqiran war ends said another gulf 
shipping executive 
and despite statements by us officials the united states is 
going to find itself becoming the policeman in the waterway 
he was referring to us defense secretary frank carluccis 
comment that despite the policy change the united states was not 
the policemen of the gulf nor do we wish to be 
said another executive i think the americans are taking on a 
tremendous load doing the job the united nations is supposed to 
do 
irans staterun radio said saturday that washingtons decision 
proved the united states was backing iraq in the 7yearold war 
the radio said that by protecting neutral vessels the united 
states will be seeking to limit the islamic republic of irans 
retaliatory powers 
iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for iraqi strikes on 
iranian oil installations and tankers 
in the past year 46 americans have been killed in or near the 
gulf including two us marine pilots who disappeared with their 
aircraft april 18 after reporting hostile radar locked on their 
helicopter iran claimed the aircraft was shot down 
the biggest loss of american life occurred may 17 in an 
accidental iraqi missile strike on the frigate stark thirtyseven 
us sailors died 
the soviet union has sought a multinational naval escort force 
in the gulf under the un flag less than 10 percent of the ships 
sailing gulf waters fly communistbloc flags 
the gulf supplies nearly 20 percent of the noncommunist worlds 
petroleum and is the major trading route for the coastal states 
that depend on imports for most of their food and commodity 
supplies 
the spread of hostilities into the gulf from the iraqiran war 
has harmed port trade and tended to reduce ship traffic in the 
waterway 
still an average of 20 tankers and freighters a day make their 
way in and out of the strait of hormuz the entry to the gulf 
on saturday the 27th convoy this year of reflagged kuwaiti 
ships headed out of the gulf escorted by us navy warships a us 
military spokesman said 
us british french italian and soviet warships escorting 
their commercial vessels became routine last year when the iranians 
stepped up their attacks on commercial shipping with gunboat 
attacks and the laying of mines 
none of the shipping executives who commented on the us policy 
change would be quoted by name many of the officials do business 
with both iraq and iran 
some shipping executives said they believed iran would find ways 
to continue menacing ships despite the expanded us navy role 
whos to prevent the iranians sowing hundreds of mines in the 
waterway they manufacture them said one whos to prevent 
them firing silkworm antiship missiles at a convoy moving through 
the hormuz 
they will be ready to take in stride the us navy taking on 
all their missile batteries there in the end its the united 
states that will be the loser finding itself in a state of war

because there is no alternative to changes and perestroika he

members of the countrys main 
guerrilla movement the african national congress are reeling from 
a string of setbacks including revelations of a spy in their midst 
and a crackdown on antiapartheid groups 
three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows one leader 
was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed 
secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government 
congress leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged 
that south africas nearly 2yearold state of emergency has 
hobbled anc efforts to undermine whiteminority rule 
during a recent trip to anc headquarters in zambia guerrilla 
leaders engaged in an orgy of selfcriticism according to a 
story last week in the weekly mail an antiapartheid newspaper 
but it said there remained lingering optimism 
the emergency and the general repression are counterproductive 
for the regime anc official steve tshwete was quoted as saying 
in terms of heightening resentment and mobilizing mass opinion 
the situation is favorable for our activities 
but the bad news for the congress includes 
the march 29 assassination of guerrilla leader dulcie 
september in paris 
the april 7 maiming of albie sachs a lawyer and anc member 
who was seriously injured by a car bomb in mozambique 
the april 15 death of a guerrilla killed when a mine he was 
carrying blew up in pretoria prompting progovernment newspapers 
to claim the group has stooped to using poorly trained kamikaze 
bombers 
in february the government prohibited political activities by 
major antiapartheid groups in addition three anc members 
convicted of murder terror and treason face possible death 
sentences 
in messina near the northern border with zimbabwe mzondileli 
nondula 25 and mthetheleli mncube 28 are expected to be 
sentenced within the next few days 
nondula was convicted of killing two white women and four 
children who died in a blast when the truck they were riding in 
struck a mine mncube was convicted of planting a mine that killed 
a black man in november 1985 and of killing two white policemen 
during a subsequent escape attempt 
in the southeastern city of pietermaritzburg gordon webster 
24 was convicted of carrying out several bombings including one 
that killed a police colonel 
at another trial of three alleged anc members charged with 
terrorism and treason evidence submitted included secret internal 
documents purportedly photographed by a spy that cited problems 
faced by the guerrilla movement because of informers and shortages 
of weapons and funds 
defense witnesses described webster as a gentle young man who 
joined the congress in a state of despair over racial 
discrimination in south africa where the system of apartheid 
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services 
taking the stand to plead for his life webster professed 
loyalty to the congress but voiced some disenchantment 
asked what he would do if he could start over again he replied 
i would like to be a teacher 
formed as a nonviolent civil rights group in 1912 the anc was 
banned in 1960 and a year later began a bombing and sabotage 
campaign 
its tactics are repudiated by some moderate blacks but it is 
believed capable of winning a national election if restrictions on 
black voting rights and political activity were lifted

panamas international banking center 
was once a magnet for money from throughout the world a safe haven 
for cash that earned the country a reputation as the switzerland of 
latin america 
now bankers worry that the system may never recover from a 
nearly twomonth shutdown caused by political unrest surrounding 
the leadership of gen manuel antonio noriega 
frightened investors have pulled billions of dollars out of 
panama bankers are anxiously studying their options 
i assume bankers would be thinking about leaving the 
country because they cant do much business right now said 
edgardo lasso president of the banking association of panama 
which represents 93 of the 117 mostly foreign banks operating here 
eiichi motoshige general manager of the local branch of japans 
giant sumitomo bank said each bank is very very seriously 
considering what we can do for the immediate future 
the biggest problem he said is that nobody likes to 
place any funds here because of the risk 
not long ago the tiny country attracted money from investors 
worldwide many of them drawn by secrecy provisions limiting 
disclosure of information to foreign courts governments and other 
third parties 
they also were attracted by the nations use of the us dollar 
as its currency its prominent freetrade zone and its location on 
an isthmus linking central and south america 
and up until june it offered investors political stability 
but a wave of protest against noriegas rule has shaken confidence 
in the system 
noriega chief of the countrys defense forces and the power 
behind the civilian government was indicted on drug charges in the 
united states in february he forced the ouster of president eric 
arturo delvalle on feb 26 one day after delvalle tried to fire 
him 
on march 3 the government shut down 67 banks holding licenses 
to conduct local and international banking business after 50 
million in panamanian government money was frozen in us banks 
the subsequent cash shortage prevented the national bank of 
panama from providing the dozen locally owned banks with enough 
money to cover a run on deposits that began feb 26 
the reagan administration seekng to force noriegas ouster has 
imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the country 
the administration announced saturday that it was relaxing some 
restrictions and would allow americans to pay utility bills and 
sales and excise taxes to the government payments on corporate and 
personal income taxes import duties port fees and corporate 
social security payments still are prohibited 
government figures show that assets held by the banking center 
tumbled from 403 billion at the end of 1986 to 314 billion at 
the end of 1987 
there was a massive reduction in assets beginning in june 
said luis luis latin american director of the institute of 
international finance in washington 
there must have been further shrinkage of assets in the first 
quarter of this year he said 
motoshige said so many banks including ourselves have had 
to move our assets outside 
about threequarters of the centers assets or roughly 25 
billion were in offshore activities at the end of last year 
money in offshore activities those that take place outside of 
panama can be easily moved to competing banking centers in miami 
the bahamas grand cayman island in the british west indies and 
elsewhere 
analysts have no figures on how much money has left the banking 
system so far this year estimates vary widely from a few billion 
dollars to more than 10 billion one financial analyst who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said they will be lucky if they come 
out of this with 5 billion in offshore banking 
requests for interviews with officials of the national banking 
commission a regulatory agency were ignored 
bankers say that only after the nations political troubles are 
settled can the center begin healing 
there would have to be several changes in the government 
said lasso people would have to start getting confidence back in 
their people handling the government and that could take 
months 
the banking commission has been trying to ease the situation 
on april 18 it allowed the banks to begin accepting deposits 
from customers but it restricted the amount of money that could be 
drawn on the balance in checking accounts 
as a result analysts say about threequarters of the newly 
deposited checks were returned for insufficient funds 
in march the commission allowed banks to resume a dozen 
additional services including handling letters of credit 
collecting outstanding loans transferring funds within the country 
and making foreign exchange transactions 
clients still cannot withdraw cash from their accounts and 
bankers fear a premature reopening of their institutions would 
trigger another run 
people are afraid and they are just waiting for the banks to 
open so they can get their money out said lasso

the worlds largest commercial jetliner an 
enlarged 747 with fuelefficient engines and electronic cockpit 
displays made its aerial debut beautifully says the test 
pilot of the latest boeing jumbo jet 
the first boeing 747400 was taken on a 2hour flight friday 
from paine field at everett where the jumbo jets are made to 
boeing field in seattle where the boeing co has its headquarters 
just a few minutes after the newest plane touched down the 
original 747 the city of everett which first flew in 1969 
also landed at boeing field that plane was never flown 
commercially but has been used by boeing for various test programs 
and now is used for crew training 
the airplane worked beautifully test pilot james c loesch 
told reporters 
the new jumbo jet measures 231 feet 10 inches in length same 
as the original with a 211foot wingspan up from 195 feet on the 
original model 747100 
the new jumbo jet has a stretched upper deck and can carry as 
many as 660 passengers but normally would carry about 450 in three 
classes first business and coach the model 100 seated 385 
passengers 
its most noticeable feature are sixfoot winglets tilted 
upward at the tip of each wing which improve aerodynamic 
efficiency it has a range of 8400 miles compared to the 
747100s 5200 miles 
the other major change is on the flight deck where more than 
600 dials and switches have been replaced by six color video 
screens allowing a crew of just two to operate the aircraft 
instead of the usual three 
boeing boasts the plane will be able to fly nonstop between 
such cities as london and tokyo new york and seoul and los 
angeles and sydney australia 
the plane can be equipped with three different makes of engines 
pratt amp whitney general electric and rollsroyce which cut 
fuel consumption by up to 25 percent over the engines used on the 
original 747 boeing says 
the jet that flew friday dubbed 747401 will be delivered to 
northwest airlines in december two others in the test flight 
program will be delivered to lufthansa and cathay pacific 
the three planes will make about 1100 hours of test flights 
under about 10 boeing test pilots and three from the federal 
aviation administration said jerry zanatta manager of flight test 
engineering about 430 hours of test flying is needed for faa 
certification he said 
to date 18 airlines have ordered 124 of the 747400s which 
cost 108 million to 126 million each because of its fuel economy 
and other savings several carriers have changed orders during 
recent years from earlier 747 versions to the model 400 
the new air force one will be a 747400 as will the military 
e4a and e4b flying command and control stations for national 
emergencies such as nuclear war

the first american test of an experimental 
aids vaccine produced an immune response in six volunteers and is 
an important step toward developing a vaccine against the deadly 
disease officials said saturday 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
announced that the men showed the immune reaction to injections of 
a purified protein called gp160 derived from a portion of the 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv is the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
an immune response is determined when the test subjects blood 
develops antibodies against the vaccine that was injected 
many steps remain however before the work could result in an 
aids vaccine 
dr tony fauci director of the institute said the vaccine 
tests were conducted to determine if the gp160derived vaccine was 
safe and if it evoked an immune response he said the results are 
now positive to both questions 
it is clear that it is safe and the study indicates that 
several volunteers did develop an immune response he said 
the test also is designed to help determine the proper dosage of 
the vaccine for maximum beneficial effect 
a report on the study was presented at the annual meeting of the 
american foundation for clinical research 
the next step is to remove antibodies from the test subjects and 
determine if these antibodies will react in test tubes to the aids 
virus this would establish if the test subjects have developed 
what is called cell mediated immune response it is this reaction 
that provides protection against a targeted disease 
the test of gp160 started with 59 volunteers divided into four 
groups each group received injections of a different strength of 
the gp160 
two subjects in a group that received the injections but no 
booster shots developed immune response four of a group that 
received both the initial shot and a booster also developed immune 
response

the accidental release of at least 
175000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has 
turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile 
bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry 
this is a sin a crime against gods creation and makes a 
city boy want to cry said joseph hallachi 43 of santa cruz 
who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from 
a city park shoreline 
the april 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small 
animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects 
the spill of san joaquin crude from shell oil cos major 
northern california refinery occurred after a broken storm drain 
pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be 
siphoned out the companys practice of keeping valves open during 
storms was a violation of federal environmental regulations 
it has been a frustrating week for dozens of volunteers trying 
to care for dying wildlife and for cleanup workers struggling to 
remove the tarry muck 
they have been busy along a 15mile stretch of waterway from the 
carquinez strait to the mouth of the sacramentosan joaquin delta 
with their major sport fishing industry and at peyton slough marsh 
and ryer island critical wildlife habitat for the endangered 
clapper rail and dozens of other bird species including various 
ducks blue heron black rail and california brown pelican 
this is the worst possible thing that can happy to a pretty 
place like this said sheri banks 21 a member of the california 
conservation corps a state job skills training program who helped 
gather up oil 
itll never be the same i dont think a mans hands can clean 
all this up added fellow corps member steven reed 19 rubbing 
his gloves on yellow protective coveralls nearly black below the 
chest 
shell oil people should be the ones forced to come down here 
and clean these rocks themselves he said 
those sentiments are echoed by city residents by state 
officials who blasted shell for violating federal regulations and 
environmentalists who fear for the future of californias dwindling 
wetlands where many shore and water creatures breed and reproduce 
theres a lot of dismay by almost everybody who lives here 
said jack garner city manager of martinez population 30000 
except for shells administration building loading dock and wharf 
the 1000acre refinery is outside city limits and thus beyond 
city regulation 
at a state hearing at martinez city hall on the spill friday 
garner predicted therell be an awful lot of anger an awful lot 
of frustration and an awful lot of anxiety about our future in the 
companys shadow 
up to this point theres never been such a graphic physical 
illustration of what the worstcase scenario with that plant could 
be 
local boat owners many of whom make a living by taking sports 
fishermen into the delta fear the oil will harm the estuarys 
delicate food chain and possibly deplete fish stocks already 
reduced by decades of water quality problems in the delta 
most of the 400 boats at the citys marina still had oil on 
their hulls this weekend under federal regulations they cant 
leave docks until they are cleaned shell promised to pick up the 
tab 
the san francisco bay areas largest yacht race of the year was 
canceled saturday because oil was still in vallejos harbor 
patrick lane vice commodore of the sponsoring vallejo yacht club 
said shell officials asked for the cancellation preferring to 
reimburse the clubs losses of up to 60000 rather than possibly 
being liable for cleaning boats about 700 boat owners had paid 
entry fees 
harbormaster barry wysling closed the marina until all oil 
sheens are removed from the strait and delta that prevented dozens 
of ocean fishermen from participating in sundays opening of the 
salmon season 
environmentalists are concerned over the effects of oil in the 
marshes 
the marshes are devastated and there are toxins in that 
oil that is seeping into the environment every day said neal 
welsh a biologist and vice president of mount diablo audubon 
society 
its going to take a herculean effort to return it to its 
natural state he added if they leave it alone it will take 
decades to return of its own accord 
shell spokesman bill sharkey said the company will pay 
whatever it costs to restore the damaged marshes 
these wetlands and estuaries are the cradle of the oceans 
where they get energy and nutrients said welsh were not 
insisting on saving them just for aesthetics and recreation were 
talking about saving life itself

a hungry bundle of fluff named molloko the 
only california condor chick conceived in captivity gobbled minced 
mice saturday and keepers of the endangered species were 
encouraged by its appetite 
the newly hatched chick which raised the condor population to 
28 ate its first meal from the fingertips of a handler at 6 am 
and ate again at hourly intervals said martha baker spokeswoman 
for the san diego wild animal park 
the chick was hungry and ate everything it was offered ms 
baker said everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the 
chick but the first 10 days are critical for anybody human or 
animal 
the chicks diet was a combination of minced baby mice and 
chicken egg yolk she said the meals fed to the chick which is 
slightly larger than a persons fist amounted to about two 
tablespoons of food each time 
us interior secretary donald hodel congratulated the wild 
animal park staff for the successful hatching 
the hatching of the worlds first captivebred condor is a 
milestone that weve been awaiting for years hodel said in a 
statement released in washington the interior departments us 
fish and wildlife service is responsible for the california condor 
recovery program 
this small chick represents a big step back from the brink of 
extinction and a big step forward for recovery of the california 
condor he said 
keepers delicately wielding tweezers helped the chick break free 
of its avocadosize egg at 538 pm friday ending a 61hour 
hatching process that began when the chick first pecked cracks in 
the shell wednesday 
the laborious process of helping the bird get free led by 
biologist cyndi keuhler took nearly eight hours 
molloko is an indian word for the giant condor species the name 
originates from the sacramento valley maidu tribe and was chosen by 
a council of california tribes last week ms baker said 
after hatching the chick was swaddled in a towel and put in the 
same type of incubator used for premature infants the chick 
weighed about 6 ounces 
its sex wont be determined for about a month because it must be 
strong enough for a blood sample to be drawn 
the chick will be reared by keepers using a hand puppet that 
resembles an adult condor the puppet is used to feed the chick and 
help it identify with its species 
the chick hatched from an egg laid march 3 by the only pair of 
california condors known to be actively breeding the egg was taken 
from the parent birds and placed in the incubator in hope that the 
parents would produce a second egg that has not happened so far 
all 28 california condors known to exist are in captivity 15 at 
the wild animal park and 13 at the los angeles zoo fourteen birds 
are female 
the captive flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in 
the wild over the past five years molloko was the first addition 
since april 1986 when a chick named nojoqui was hatched at the 
park from an egg laid in the wild 
efforts to save the california condor which has a wingspan of 
up to 10 feet at maturity rest with the captive breeding program 
the last known wild california condor was captured a year ago 
the goal of the program is to rebuild the population until 
condors can be sent back into the wild the earliest anticipated 
release would be 1992 authorities have said the oldest bird 
hatched in captivity is 5 years old condors reach sexual maturity 
at about age 7

earnest young voices from the innercity sing 
liltingly while aspiring musicians experiment with a spectrum of 
styles each saturday in a renovated train station just south of 
downtown 
theyre members of the merit music program designed to develop 
the talents of children from poor neighborhoods who have no other 
access to music 
given the chance theyre as receptive as youths whose parents 
can afford private music lessons said lisa richter who runs an 
opera workshop for the private nonprofit program 
the goal of this program is to provide the opportunity for 
these underprivileged students to flourish she said in a 
telephone interview saturday 
teachers with extensive music backgrounds many of them 
professional musicians provide as sophisticated music 
instruction as youll find anywhere in the country she said 
there is no other music school in the country like merit in 
terms of making our services available to those who cannot pay 
ms richter added 
but the students are required to have one year of prior music 
instruction and must audition to get into the program she said 
the centerpiece of the program is its tuitionfree saturday 
classes for elementary and high school students in the redbrick 
dearborn station 
inside the old train station about 200 students get individual 
and group instruction in classes ranging from beginning piano to 
advanced musical theory 
merit which employs about 33 parttime teachers also sponsors 
weekly and biweekly music classes in 10 chicago public schools 
most of them in poor neighborhoods reaching 500 to 600 children 
ms richter said 
those classes act as feeder programs preparing students who 
want to participate in the saturday classes she said 
once a year for the past three years youths in the advanced 
music theory class have staged an opera composed and performed by 
students 
this years work a 45minute oneact opera called the 
ledge is about a disillusioned young violinist who contemplates 
suicide while facing his best friends popularity as a rock star 
the opera to be performed sunday in merits recital hall 
features an eclectic combination of music ranging from classical 
opera to jazz complete with synthesizer drums and electric bass 
guitar 
ive never really been exposed to opera said thomas white 
17 who plays bass guitar in the operas orchestra 
what surprised me the most is this was totally put together by 
us it was done totally by the students i think its good 
said white a senior at de la salle high school a nearly allblack 
school in an impoverished neighborhood 
white who wants to teach music and perform professionally has 
attended merits saturday classes for 2 years 
they expose you to a lot of different sounds classical jazz 
a lot of different talents they help you to nurture someone from 
my school they wouldnt normally be exposed to that kind of 
stuff he said 
merit students have earned scholarships to prestigious music 
programs like the eastman school of music in rochester ny and 
the interlochen music camp in michigan 
the merit program was started in 1979 by a professional pianist 
and an amateur musician ms richter said it is entirely funded by 
grants mostly from corporations and foundations 
teachers who could be making 100 an hour elsewhere earn about 
20 to 30 an hour and all have outside jobs said ms richter 
31 a former roosevelt university musictheory instructor who works 
full time at a south side bank 
i do it simply because it is rewarding ms richter said 
it gives me the opportunity to participate in these young 
peoples discovery of their own ability its extremely rewarding

illinois is taking its juicedup 
tourism campaign overseas to dispel a gangsterridden image and 
lure foreign visitors 
international people still think of us as al capone lives 
next door and this is one of the things we have to dispel in 
their minds said mary burns international marketing specialist 
for the illinois office of tourism 
to do that the state and trans world airlines have produced an 
upbeat commercial for british television that describes chicago as 
a worldclass city with a rich culture and nightlife 
tour brochures circulated by british airways in west germany 
describe chicago as the heart and soul of the americas they 
feature inviting views of the citys lakefront and historic sites 
in other parts of illinois 
chicago and illinois are described in detail to get rid of 
this al capone image that still prevails said lothar kegelmann 
market development manager in west germany for british airways 
the international effort is the latest twist in a fouryear 
campaign that officials credit for significant growth in the 
states tourist industry 
since 1984 the state office of tourism has spent 10 million a 
year on ads promoting tourism up from about 800000 in earlier 
years 
from 1984 to 1986 the number of employees in the states 
tourism industry increased 14 percent compared with a rise of 9 
percent in the nation overall tourist spending in illinois in the 
fiscal year ending june 30 is expected to reach 108 billion up 
30 percent from 83 billion three years ago state officials say 
officials hope to boost those figures further and say foreign 
tourists are a rich untapped market especially in light of the 
dollars low value compared with many foreign currencies they have 
pursued a variety of strategies to lure foreigners some costly and 
some virtually free 
to pay for the british commercials illinois and twa each 
contributed 200000 and the us travel and tourism administration 
kicked in 40000 
those commercials attracted the interest of british television 
executives who plan to produce a documentary on chicago comparing 
the windy city to paris and rio de janeiro 
in the past year state tourism officials also have helped 
organize visits by 18 groups of foreign travel agents and tour 
operators and six groups of travel journalists ms burns said the 
trips were paid for by airline companies hotels and others in the 
industry 
state officials dont expect immediate dividends from the 
overseas campaign their advisers say it typically takes five years 
to produce a significant response 
dont expect miracles and dont ask for passenger numbers 
within the next couple months kegelmann said it takes time 
and a little bit of patience but we are confident we are going to 
make it 
one expert believes illinois might get a little help from the 
capone legacy 
i can understand why illinoisans are sensitive about al 
capone and the socalled violent image of chicago but i think it 
has changed over the years to become a colorful image said john 
cooper director of marketing for twas international division

arizona attorney general bob corbin says 
he is investigating whether to prosecute gov rose mofford for 
omitting land loan and partnership transactions from sworn 
financialdisclosure statements 
corbin is prosecuting mrs moffords predecessor evan mecham 
over omission of a 350000 campaign loan from similar 
financialdisclosure statements and mechams lawyers are sure to 
object if mrs mofford is treated any differently 
but corbin also is next in line to become governor should 
anything happen to mrs mofford much as mrs mofford succeeded 
mecham upon his ouster by the senate court of impeachment in april 
hes in somewhat of a delicate position senate minority 
leader alan stephens a democrat said friday after mrs mofford 
filed amended financial disclosure statements 
mrs mofford a democrat called her ommissions an honest 
mistake and said she did not intend to hide the transactions 
reported a week before by the associated press 
mecham a republican used the same language last year when his 
ommission was reported by the arizona republic 
aides said mrs moffords share of the unreported transactions 
would total 67000 at most 
knowing failure to file a complete disclosure statement is a 
misdemeanor under arizona law intentional false swearing is a 
felony 
its kind of the same thing that mecham had and well wait 
until the ag tells us what he thinks said house speaker joe 
lane a republican who set impeachment hearings in motion against 
mecham were going to treat her just like we did gov mecham 
theres really no difference 
but stephens said aspects of the mecham case that show intent to 
conceal are not present in the mofford case he cited the size of 
the developers loan to mecham a letter in which mecham promised 
to keep it confidential and a paper trail that house and senate 
prosecutors described as a laundering scheme 
on the other hand aides acknowledge mrs mofford spent 10 
years as secretary of state in command of the office where the 
forms are filed and in charge of preparing the instructions on how 
to fill out the forms in the first place 
asked for his reaction to mrs moffords action corbin said 
friday i have no comment because the matter is under 
investigation 
as late as monday mrs mofford had described reports about the 
undisclosed transactions as nitpicking on friday however she 
filed new forms and turned over records to corbins office 
i now believe that these items should have been disclosed 
earlier she said at a news conference cut short by her aides 
i made an honest mistake 
im very sorry she added i want to emphasize that it was 
never my intent to hide anything from anybody 
asked how her position differed from that mecham mrs mofford 
replied mine are very small amounts of money and added that the 
transactions did not even offset what she had advanced her former 
husband tr mofford for hospital bills before he died in 1982 
mrs mofford said she did not list the land loans and 
partnerships because she did not make much money on them or because 
her interest in some of them was tied to mofford whom she divorced 
in 1967 
i have never made any profit she said i was paying my 
husbands bills 
mrs mofford and her aides acknowledged however that she had 
not listed her former husbands gifts under a reporting section 
that requires disclosure of gifts above 500 or alternatively 
listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a 
section covering amounts of more than 1000 owed to or by the 
officeholder 
the holdings also were not reported under the section for 
disclosing real estate 
records released friday show her being paid well over 30000 
for two properties alone but aides said she had incurred some 
costs as well the records were incomplete and no exact accounting 
was available 
mecham did not return messages left at his home and office 
friday

open to visitors to holy places than it is now kollek declared 
in a telegram to the paper earlier this week said spokeswoman

older boeing 737s like the jet that ripped 
open over hawaii last week were restricted saturday from flying at 
altitudes above 23000 feet until they can be inspected for 
structural defects 
the federal aviation administration issued an emergency order 
for jets in the 737100 and 737200 series that have had more than 
55000 flights the order affects 66 planes half of them in the 
fleets of aloha piedmont and american airlines faa spokesman fred 
farrar said the rest belong to international carriers 
federal investigators are focusing on possible structural 
failure in the aloha airlines jet that blew open thursday at 24000 
feet a flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death 
and 61 passengers were injured 
under the airworthiness directive issued by faa administrator t 
allan mcartor the airlines must complete visual inspections of the 
affected area within the next 500 flights 
they must inspect the area for cracking corrosion or 
delamination and if any is found it must be repaired and the 
suspect pieces replaced farrar said 
the area to be inspected is the top of the fuselage in the 
aloha jet a huge upper section of the 737200 tore away leaving 
passengers exposed to the open skies and forcing the pilot to make 
an emergency landing 
farrar said that at altitudes of 23000 feet or below the 
pressure between the outside and inside of the aircraft is such 
that a structural weakness would not cause a failure or damage to 
the plane 
farrar originally said that all 66 affected jets belonged to 
us carriers however he later said that about half of the jets 
belonged to international airlines he said the faa did not know 
which ones 
tom cole a boeing spokesman in seattle said boeing also did 
not know which international carriers flew the affected 737s he 
said the company would try to find that out monday 
a piedmont airlines spokesman bill kress said from 
winstonsalem nc that the airline had already begun inspecting 
the 17 affected 737200s in its fleet he said such inspections 
were part of the airlines regular maintenance program for the jets 
and the order would have virtually no effect on our operation 
the aircraft is such that we use it on short hauls anyhow and 
we dont need to attain that altitude of 23000 feet he said 
in hawaii aloha spokesman milton goto said he hadnt heard of 
the faa order and had no immediate comment aloha has three jets 
affected by the faa order in addition to the one involved in the 
accident according to boeing 
american airlines said 16 of its 737s were affected by the faa 
order and those are used on shorthaul west coast routes that do 
not require flying above 23000 feet spokesman steve mcgregor said 
from dallas that the airline would inspect those planes within 48 
hours 
mcgregor called the faa action prudent and said were 
going to comply with it more quickly than required were simply 
going to do it as quickly as we can 
last october 5 the faa ordered close inspection of the upper 
skin of the early model boeing 737s because routine inspections had 
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap the 
agency warned the problem could cause rapid cabin decompression 
the inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming 
loose on some earlymodel boeing 737s because the lamination was no 
longer holding 
the earlier faa directive covered the first 291 boeing 737s 
manufactured of which the aloha plane was no 152 it had been in 
service since 1969 
aloha airlines has said it conducted the inspections in october 
as ordered but found nothing that caused alarm 
boeing spokesman jim boynton said friday in seattle the company 
has issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections 
for possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion 
of the skin of the older boeing 737s 
boynton said the companys most recent bulletin had been issued 
two weeks before thursdays incident 
farrar said saturdays directive was broader than the one issued 
in october because the new directive orders visual inspections of 
the entire top of the fuselage he said the order will probably 
mean an increase in fuel costs for the airlines because the higher 
a jet flies te more fuelefficient it is 
national transportation safety board member joseph t nall said 
friday that investigators believed the cause of the aloha accident 
was a structural problem with the aloha jet 
he also said the jet had been through 85000 to 90000 
takeoffandlanding cycles and called that a high cycle number 
because of the stress caused by repeated expansions and 
contractions of the fuselage 
earlier boeing asked for inspection of all boeing 737200 jets 
that have completed more than 55000 takeoff and landing cycles 
meanwhile aloha grounded three jets similar in age to the one 
involved in thursdays accident

prosecutors at the trial of alleged 
drug lord carlos lehder rivas produced more than 100 witnesses over 
22 weeks to show that he operated a multimilliondollar smuggling 
business centered on the bahamas 
while the prosecution tried to draw a noose around lehder it 
also presented evidence of the key role of the bahamas island 
chain and a federal grand jury reportedly is looking into the 
activities of bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
lehder 38 is accused of conspiring to smuggle 33 tons of 
cocaine into the united states through his private island in the 
bahamas normans cay from 1978 to 1980 
the colombian is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine 
with intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operation of 
a continuing criminal enterprise his codefendant jack carlton 
reed 57 of san pedro calif is charged only with conspiracy 
the prosecution rested its case against the two thursday the 
defense is expected to begin monday and to last at least two weeks 
the issue in this case is not whether mr lehder was a drug 
smuggler but whether mr lehder as an individual committed the 11 
crimes charged ed shohat one of lehders attorneys said last 
week 
when the jury selection started in october attorneys said they 
expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months but 
counting jury selection and a twoweek christmas recess the trial 
has ended its 30th week 
carlos lehder pursued a singular dream a singular vision to 
be the king of cocaine transportation us attorney robert 
merkle said in his opening statement in midnovember he was to 
cocaine transportation what henry ford was to cars 
while in federal prison during the 1970s lehder began hatching 
his plans to form a cocainesmuggling empire prosecutors said 
the colombian first began smuggling small amounts of the drug 
inside the lining of suitcases using young women as couriers 
according to testimony the smuggling witnesses testified became 
bolder as time progressed 
key prosecution witness ed ward an admitted smuggler described 
normans cay about 45 miles southeast of nassau as the perfect 
transshipment point the island was sparsely populated had a 
3000foot airstrip and no police or customs officials 
ward testified that he flew 10 loads of colombian cocaine into 
the united states for lehder whom he met in 1979 
the trial also has touched on alleged payoffs to bahamian 
officials including allegations from numerous witnesses that 
pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as 
lehder 
ward testified that he gave former bahamian agriculture minister 
george smith 100000 that was supposed to go directly to the 
prime minister prime minister pindling 
law enforcement sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that merkle has been presenting evidence about pindling to a 
federal grand jury in tampa including reams of material first 
presented at the lehder trial 
other news reports have said that the grand jury investigation 
was located in miami or jacksonville rather than tampa 
merkle when asked last week about whether a grand jury was 
investigating pindling said i cant comment on that 
pindlings name has frequently been mentioned in relation to 
drug investigations but in 1984 a royal commission of inquiry in 
the bahamas found that pindling had more money than known income 
but none of that appeared to be drugrelated 
pindling won reelection a year ago by invoking the fear common 
to small nations in this hemisphere that the united states is 
meddling in their affairs 
bill kalis pindlings spokesman in nassau said friday he had 
heard reports of grand jury investigations in miami or 
jacksonville but that pindling didnt expect to be indicted 
most of the testimony at the lehder trial is recycled from the 
commission of inquiry kalis said he added that the grand jury 
might be hearing some of the same pleabargaining witnesses that 
are appearing at the lehder trial much of the testimony in the 
trial has come from convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from 
prosecution or awaiting sentencing 
at one point in lehders trial defense attorneys reminded 
prosecutors and jurors that pindling was not on trial 
but in his opening statement merkle had told jurors you also 
will hear evidence that carlos lehder was making payoffs directly 
the prime minister of the bahamas still the prime minister now 
lynden pindling 
lehder is also charged in separate indictments in los angeles 
and miami 
the miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of 
the socalled medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into united states a drug 
operation worth 8 billion each year

the government on saturday ordered an nbc 
television correspondent to leave the country after he reported 
that jordan has a tightly controlled and at times even repressive 
society 
correspondent rick davis one of only a small number of american 
television correspondents based in arab countries was given a week 
to leave jordan 
information minister hani hassawneh said davis feature about 
jordan on nbcs sunday today was clearly against the 
country 
he also accused the correspondent of breaking the ethics of 
reporting by complaining about security and information ministry 
officials 
davis said nbc would protest the government action but he said 
he could not comment further until consulting with the network 
headquarters in new york davis who has worked for nbc for 13 
years has reported on the middle east since 1979 and has been 
based in jordan since march 1985 
in new york lawrence k grossman president of nbc news issued 
a statement addressed to king hussein it said 
your majesty we protest in the strongest possible terms the 
expulsion of nbc news correspondent rick davis from the kingdom of 
jordan mr davis the only american television network 
correspondent stationed in an arab country is a veteran reporter 
who has been ably covering jordan and the middle east continually 
for the past three years his journalistic efforts have been widely 
recognized as being fair insightful authoritative and 
intelligent it is indeed shameful that jordan has now joined 
israel in denying press credentials to a distinguished and expert 
nbc news corresponsdent stationed within its borders 
mary lou ocallahan director of news information for nbc said 
jordanian information ministry officials indicated the network 
could replace davis but no decision has been made by nbc 
the action against davis came four days after neighboring 
israel technically at war with jordan suspended the press 
credentials of nbc correspondent martin fletcher and washington 
post reporter glenn frankel 
israel said they violated censorship rules by failing to submit 
for clearance stories alleging that israel was behind the 
assassination in tunisia of plo military chief khalil wazir 
in his profile of jordan davis referred to jordan as tightly 
controlled and at times even repressive society he noted that 
the headquarters of the notsosecret police is sometimes 
termed the palestinian hotel because of the palestinian 
activists often imprisoned there 
the program also included a clip of radical palestinian leader 
george habash accusing king hussein of a barbarous massacre of 
palestinian civilians during the black september fighting between 
the palestine liberation organization and the jordanian army in 
1970 thousands of people died 
hassawneh said the program insulted king abdullah jordans 
first ruler and grandfather of king hussein by saying the british 
appointed abdullah emir when jordan was created as a british 
protectorate after world war i 
it was very clear to us he was a very biased man hassawneh 
said 
american networks once kept correspondents in beirut lebanon 
to cover the arab world but pulled them out after journalists 
became targets of kidnappers in 1985 and 1986 
they now rely largely on termcontract journalists and 
freelancers based in egypt lebanon and other arab countries and 
they send in europebased staff correspondents for major stories 
 
journalists rarely have been expelled from jordan in recent 
years although the information ministry in 1986 blacklisted two 
israelbased western reporters for stories about jordanian 
suppression of demonstrations 
king hussein quickly lifted those bans

whittier narrows temblor and the other near the mexican border 
authorities said 
the aftershock measuring 32 on the richter scale hit at 1140 
am said robert finn spokesman for the california institute of 
technology in pasadena 
its epicenter was placed four miles southeast of pasadena on the 
fault that produced the october quake which caused millions of 
dollars in damage 
a quake measuring 30 on the richter scale hit just before 9 
am about 12 miles southeast of downtown san diego finn said 
no injuries or damage were reported in either quake sheriffs 
deputies said 
quakes with a richter reading of less than 35 can cause slight 
damage in a local area 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
stepped up criticism of michael dukakis saturday saying the 
massachusetts governor fails to offer a clear alternative to 
republican policies 
jackson avoided saying directly that dukakis would be like a 
republican but he told a labor forum in cleveland democrats 
must be the alternative we do not need two republican parties in 
america 
jackson was asked by reporters if he meant to say that dukakis 
would pull democrats toward republican policies 
i would not put him in that category he said there are 
some in the democratic party who would pull our party toward 
conservatism 
he then gave a litany of issues on which he thinks dukakis has 
not presented a strong commitment or budgetary priority for change 
childcare southern africa education drugs 
it was clear as jackson campaigned in search of votes for 
tuesdays primary in ohio that he wants to cast dukakis as a weaker 
voice against reagan policies than his own 
jackson also spoke repeatedly of the importance of having 
leaders who can inspire an apparent effort to showcase himself as 
an inspirational candidate in contrast to dukakis lowkey demeanor 
that many find dull 
jackson drew repeated applause in the hall full of unionists as 
he focused on labor issues and called himself a working peoples 
person 
at a speech at the university of dayton gymnasium jackson 
continued to suggest that dukakis was a managerial candidate while 
he is a leader he said attainment of peace in the world and 
changing president reagans economic policy requires leadership 
not management 
to end reaganomics we need a leader we need to change the 
course jackson told the cheering racially mixed crowd to 
find peace in the middle east we must have leadership we cannot 
manage apartheid we must end apartheid 
in the cleveland appearance and later at a columbus rally 
jackson tried to put a damper on dukakis massachusetts miracle 
of economic recovery during his tenure as governor 
even in massachusetts massachusetts lost 11 percent of its 
manufacturing jobs since 1984 jackson said 
he said however that its not the fault of governor dukakis 
its the fault of reaganomics 
the best of governors are not a substitute for a president who 
leads he said 
he then added in a twosided comment dont blame mr dukakis 
because union membership has plummetted 
the dukakis campaign cites an increase of 400000 jobs in 
massachusetts during nine years under dukakis 
but jackson contended sure there are more jobs more jobs 
less wages 
he told reporters that if other states had received the 
contracts for research and development that massachusetts had 
received they too would be economically prospering and that a 
combination of circumstances contributed to massachusetts 
success 
he continued to say dukakis has shown no commitment to reverse 
president reagans economic policies but would only manage 
reaganomics 
he ridiculed dukakis for offering only 250 million in new 
education spending saying you cannot educate every child in 
america to go to college on only 250 million 
we need a massive commitment to invest in people reinvest in 
america and end reaganomics jackson told the columbus rally of 
about 1500 people organized by churches and labor groups 
he also accused both dukakis and vice president george bush the 
likely gop nominee of failing to show their priorities by setting 
out a budget 
on one of jacksons primary campaign themes increasing taxes 
on corporations including those that escape taxation through 
loopholes he referred to dukakis proposal to raise revenue by 
stepping up enforcement on uncollected taxes 
its not about uncollected taxes its exempted taxes and 
unregulated behavior of corporate baracudas he said

a federal judge says hell ignore federal 
sentencing guidelines on the ground they violate the us 
constitutions separation of powers 
us district judge marvin shoob ruling friday in the case of 
two people convicted of a december bank robbery said he intended 
to sentence them as though their crimes had occurred before 
november when the sentencing guidelines went into effect 
the guidelines intended to remedy disparities between the 
sentences handed down by federal judges across the country require 
them to follow a schedule of mandatory sentences 
the guidelines shoob ruled are not simply guideposts to aid 
the exercise of judicial discretion they reduce the role of 
sentencing judges to filling in the blanks and applying a rigid 
mechanical formula 
shoob said the us sentencing commission which produced the 
guidelines was acting in place of the judge 
he also held unconstitutional the commission itself required by 
law to include three federal judges and four nonjudiciary members 
all appointed by the president 
mandatory service of judges on the commission violates the 
doctrine of separation of powers shoob said 
constitutional separation of powers shoob said is so 
fundamental to our governmental system that every schoolchild 
learns about our system of checks and balances 
shoobs ruling was almost certain to be appealed because of the 
constitutional question it raises 
shoob also has challenged federal officials over treatment of 
cuban refugees jailed in the atlanta federal penitentiary saying 
they were being held unfairly

two former underground solidarity leaders 
were released from prison saturday and flew to rome after initially 
refusing to leave the country 
kornel morawiecki 46 and andrzej kolodziej 28 were put on a 
plane to vienna austria and arrived in rome saturday night 
the communist government released the two men from warsaws 
rakowiecka prison saturday in a deal with roman catholic church 
officials 
morawiecki and kolodziej had been driven to warsaws airport to 
board a flight for rome but the two refused to leave after meeting 
with family members at the airport 
the two were then taken back to the prison but agreed to leave 
the country after more talks at the prison involving church 
officials 
one of morawieckis daughters marta said the two men were told 
they could either leave together or remain imprisoned she said 
medical reasons played a role in the decision to leave 
the two were given multiple exitandentry passports and were 
expected to undergo medical treatment in rome both apparently are 
suffering from ulcers and other medical problems 
morawiecki who was arrested nov 9 1987 was chairman of the 
militant splinter group fighting solidarity 
he went underground after martial law was declared in december 
1981 and the solidarity union federation was suspended and 
subsequently outlawed in 1982 he formed fighting solidarity 
which differs from solidarity because it advocates anticommunist 
political goals solidarity emphasizes social and union issues 
kolodziej headed fighting solidarity from the time of 
morawieckis arrest until his own capture in january he had been 
in hiding since 1985 
a third less prominent fighting solidarity activist krzystof 
szymanski also was released saturday 
morawieckis elder daughter anna said morawiecki and kolodziej 
had agreed to leave the country in a deal worked out by church 
officials but after family members at the airport told them about 
new strikes in the country they decided to stay 
asked to explain what finally prompted the two men to leave 
marta morawiecki said we cannot give you a full explanation 
there were very important arguments and they both finally agreed to 
go 
there were some personal reasons which had to be taken into 
account also a serious danger to kolodziejs health she said 
ewa maria stoja kolodziejs girlfriend said official documents 
indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of 
a commission of prison doctors due to the required urgent medical 
examination which may also take place abroad 
she said kolodziej suffered from ulcers and teeth problems 
while morawiecki had ulcer symptoms poor eyesight and heart and 
kidney problems 
morawiecki speaking with reporters in rome said he and 
kolodziej at first did not want to leave poland because they were 
not told why they were being sent to the west he said the issue 
was settled after they spoke with a secretary of the polish 
episcopal conference aloizj orszulik 
we decided to leave for three reasons he said first the 
medical diagnosis that koldziej might have a tumor secondly 
the possibility that it might be more difficult in the future for 
the polish church to perform these humanitarian acts if we refused 
and lastly the assurance that we would be allowed to return 
whenever we choose 
morawiecki said that while in prison he was never told anything 
about what was happening in the country 
i only learned something today he said there is an 
agitation going on that reminds me of august of 1980 i believe 
this pressure will increase and i hope it might lead to a change in 
government 
in august 1980 nationwide strikes led to the creation of 
solidarity it was chartered by the government and became the first 
independent union federation in the soviet bloc but was banned 
after the december 1981 crackdown 
authorities alleged that morawiecki and kolodziej were part of a 
ring that attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use 
from sweden they were never formally charged 
in a statement in november kolodziej denied the allegations 
in september 1986 the communist government issued a broad 
amnesty for political prisoners since then all political

strikers occupying a machinery plant in 
southeast poland ended their sitin saturday after apparently 
winning promises of higher pay but a walkout by thousands of steel 
workers persisted with no end in sight 
the developments came as the polish government prepared for its 
big may day celebrations solidarity the banned trade union 
federation called for nationwide protests to mark the nations 
biggest official holiday 
in the history of the communist government there has never been 
a largescale strike in progress on may day 
strike leaders said dozens of police vans and vehicles including 
water cannons moved into positions near the lenin steel mill in 
nowa huta late saturday there were also large numbers of police in 
other parts of krakow and in warsaw in an apparent show of strength 
before may day 
more than 40 opposition activists were rounded up by police to 
prevent them from taking part in the holiday protests said 
zbigniew romaszewski a warsaw solidarity spokesman 
one of polands senior antigovernment activists kornel 
morawiecki founder of the splinter dissident group fighting 
solidarity was freed from prison nearly six months after his 
arrest through apparent negotiations by the countrys powerful 
roman catholic church 
morawiecki was freed with andrzej kolodziej another member of 
fighting solidarity 
the two men were flown to rome after initially refusing to leave 
a strike by what organizers said was about 15000 workers at the 
lenin steel mill in nowa huta outside krakow entered its fifth day 
with no sign of a breakthrough 
the 7000 striking workers occupying a heavy machinery plant at 
stalowa wola about 150 miles southeast of warsaw left the factory 
saturday at about 2 pm after management agreed to their pay 
demands said grzegorz surdy a spokesman for the strikers 
the rev jan niemiec a roman catholic priest in stalowa wola 
said the strikers received nothing in writing but that their 
demands were expected to be met 
the staterun news agency pap also reported the oneday strike 
ended but denied there were any negotiations with the strikers 
in view of the illegal character of the protest action no 
negotiations had been held with the striking group the report 
said 
the labor crisis began monday and is the most serious to 
confront poland since the december 1981 declaration of martial law 
and the banning of solidarity 
in a positive development for the government krakows tram 
drivers ignored a solidarity call for a strike saturday 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was to address the nation 
during the may day celebration in the capital of warsaw which was 
festooned with banners red party flags and redandwhite national 
colors in the countrys biggest official holiday 
the holiday is dedicated to working people and in recent years 
has been an occasion for sometimes violent protests for solidarity 
surdy a student and twicejailed solidarity activist said 
saturday he was surprised that authorities had not attempted to 
stop the nowa huta strike before the holiday 
in a communique issued through the polish news agency 
interpress the plant management said that as of saturday it would 
begin docking strikers pay and would close down restaurants and 
snack bars on the plant grounds 
in an apparent hardening of the positions of strikers three 
fired solidarity activists including mieczyslaw gil the former 
head of the solidarity at the plant were named to the strike 
committee 
one of the committees demands is that the three be rehired 
unlike polands last wave of labor unrest in 198081 which gave 
rise to solidarity the workers did not cover the plant with 
banners or mix political and economic demands 
photographs taken in work areas inside the plant showed workers 
reading newsapers sleeping or talking on the telephone 
after four days of the strike there is weariness and already a 
little boredom surdy said but he emphasized that workers 
intended to stay off the jobs until our demands are met 
besides the reinstatement of the fired workers the steel 
workers are demanding an immediate 50 percent raise on the average 
salary of 105 a month 
at stalowa wola where the occupation strike began friday the 
demands included a 50 monthly raise reinstatement of coal 
allowances and release and rehiring of three other dismissed 
solidarity activists 
church sources said earlier saturday that one of the solidarity 
activists had been freed from detention 
solidarity last month urged that may 1 be a day of protest 
against the nationwide price increases that have raised prices 42 
percent in the first three months of 1988 
union activists applied for permission to march sunday in warsaw 
but were turned down 
however opposiiton sources said the march was planned anyway

the faultriddled rock layers under 
the nevada desert blur and diminish shock waves from underground 
explosions but weekend tests showed cheating under a nuclear test 
ban still could be detected scientists said 
experiments using buried charges of conventional explosive and a 
network of sensitive instruments proved that even the smallest 
explosions can be monitored said research geophysicist holly 
eissler 
ms eissler of the university of california san diego was part 
of a team from the natural resources defense council that set up 
modified earthquakemonitoring equipment to record shock waves from 
three detonations of tnt in remote areas of nevada friday and 
saturday 
the third and largest test saturday showed clearly on seismic 
equipment here producing cheers from scientists the first test 
friday was less obvious and a second one later friday showed up on 
only the most sophisticated instruments ms eissler said 
the experiment is successful charles archambeau a 
university of coloradoboulder geophysics professor said after 
seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of tnt on 
friday 
it means that we can more accurately gauge the numbers and 
distribution of stations that will be required to verify a 
lowthreshold treaty it also will help us to set the threshold of 
whats verifiable he said 
archambeau heads the seismic monitoring advisory committee of 
the natural resources defense council a private group conducting 
the experiments in this country and the soviet union in cooperation 
with the soviet academy of sciences 
following the explosion of 10 tons of tnt buried beneath the 
desert 100 miles north of reno and another 10ton shot 50 miles 
south of the nevada test site on friday a 15ton detonation was 
set off saturday about 100 miles east of carson city and 210 miles 
northeast of deep springs 
the blasts were monitored by soviet and american equipment here 
in the sierra nevada about midway between reno and las vegas and at 
two permanent defense council installations closer to the nevada 
test site 110 miles north of las vegas where all us underground 
nuclear detonations are conducted an additional 140 temporary 
monitoring stations were set up across nevada 
experiments similar to this weekends were conducted by the 
soviet and american scientists last september near the soviet test 
site in kazakhstan 
because of the geology of the soviet union the readings there 
were much more pronounced than those so far in the fractured 
foundations of nevada 
it was a very small signal but it was a discernible signal 
ms eissler said of fridays first test she noted that a limited 
nuclear test ban treaty passed thursday by the house forbids 
detonations larger than one kiloton 100 times the strength of the 
10ton tnt blast 
she said fridays first test was recorded here at about three 
times normal background noise and the second explosion was barely 
detectable 
saturdays larger explosion registered about 10 times background 
noise ms eissler said 
the scientists initially thought fridays first detonation 
failed to register on any of the seismic monitors but a more 
detailed study indicated the test was recorded successfully 100 
seconds after the blast 
this is about the size wed expect in this terrain 
archambeau said he called nevadas complex geology a worstcase 
situation that will help us design networks that can do 
verification in these rather difficult areas 
the experiments are expected to show that any chances for 
cheating are about excluded under a test ban said evgeni 
velikhov vice president of the soviet academy and an adviser to 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
we think the comprehensive test ban is very important he 
added it is extremely important to stop the arms race 
the testing equipment was designed to feel the difference 
between nuclear and industrial explosions and very small 
earthquakes according to thomas cochran senior staff scientist 
for the defense council

democrat michael dukakis responded to 
criticism from republican george bush on saturday saying i think 
maybe its time for him to stop criticizing others and defended 
his leadership ability against rival jesse jacksons sharpened 
charges 
dukakis the democratic presidential frontrunner answered the 
increasing criticism from his competitors only when questioned by 
reporters he had avoided any mention of his rivals during a day of 
campaigning in two states 
the massachusetts governor pointed to his states economic 
record in trying to deflect jacksons suggestion that dukakis was 
offering only a managerial approach to governing and lacked the 
leadership abilities that he provides 
when it comes to leadership im very proud of the fact that 
im governor of a state which is generally viewed to be a state 
thats way out front dukakis said my kind of leadership is as 
a doer and not a talker 
dukakis has also come under fire from bush who a day earlier 
charged dukakis with waffling all over the field in his 
reaction to the administrations decision to attack iranian 
positions in the persian gulf he was asked about bushs comments 
that he has cannon fodder to use against dukakis in the fall 
suggesting it was some unknown evidence from the governors 
administration in massachusetts 
i really dont think the american people are interested in 
what george bush thinks of me and i think of him and whether hes 
got cannon fodder or whatever it is that hes got dukakis said 
i think maybe its time for him to stop criticizing others and 
to begin to address some fundamental issues that face this 
country dukakis said 
running with a big delegate lead and confident of his standing 
in the remaining primaries dukakis has campaigned cautiously and 
strived to avoid the suggestion of acrimony 
his campaign schedule has been carried out in a manner that has 
limited his availability to take questions while he has delivered 
speeches repeating familiar themes and exhorting supporters not to 
become overconfident 
earlier in ohio dukakis told supporters they must take this 
primary seriously 
the massachusetts governor took an early morning stroll through 
an outdoor fruit market in downtown cincinnati and later spoke to 
union members at a halfempty labor hall in cleveland less than an 
hour after jackson received an enthusiastic response for his speech 
before the same group 
dukakis also spoke to a largely black group in cleveland he 
criticized the reagan administrations antidrug efforts and told 
them his aim was to open up that door of opportunity to all 
citizens no matter who they are or where they come from or what 
the color of their skin 
thats really what this campaign is all about he said 
he traveled to indianapolis where he attended the state 
democratic partys annual jeffersonjackson dinner and planned to 
visit a high school prom where aides said he would deliver a 
message on the dangers of drinking and driving 
with a large and growing lead in delegates over jackson and a 
primary calender strongly in his favor dukakis has been urging 
supporters at every stop to ignore the polls and work to produce a 
large turnout 
standing amid new sofas and tables on the loading dock of a 
cincinnati furniture store dukakis spoke optimistically of winning 
the nomination but also urged them not to become complacent 
i want to ask you once again to do everything you can on 
those phone banks in your neighborhoods with your friends and 
coworkers to make sure the people are taking this primary 
seriously that they know it is important he said 
if we work together were going to win in ohio were 
going to win in indiana and were going to win this 
nomination he said 
in urging his voters to turn out on tuesday dukakis repeatedly 
referred to his own 1978 reelection defeat in massachusetts 
despite a onetime lead in the polls 
it was the most painful experience of my life he told union 
members in cleveland 
he compared the experience to being a worker laid off from his 
job although he added that in his case it was his own fault i 
know what its like he said

times are good for cable television it has 
become a 12 billion industry whose programming is watched in more 
than half of all american households and subscribership is 
continuing to grow 
but the industry is also wary of how long this prosperity will 
last 
cable tv is no longer a highly regulated industry weighted down 
with debt from stringing cable to build community systems most of 
the systems are built and cable operators have more control than 
ever over what viewers see and how much they pay 
its a very healthy industry its never been healthier 
said edward hatch a media analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets in new york life is good in the cable industry right 
now 
but some in congress think it may be too good lawmakers 
prompted by complaints from constituents about rate increases and 
poor service and the competitive concerns of others in the 
entertainment industry have raised the specter of reregulating the 
cable industry 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio fired a warning shot at the 
industry at a congressional hearing in march saying some of us 
feel we were had by a law that freed most cable companies of 
municipal rate control in january 1987 he and other lawmakers 
wonder aloud whether cable has become an unregulated monopoly 
the threat from capitol hill is a concern you cant ignore 
hatch said and this and other regulatory issues are on the minds 
of cable operators attending their industrys annual convention 
here this week 
more than 13000 people were expected to attend the national 
cable television association convention which runs from sunday 
through tuesday 
cable tv systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987 
putting the households receiving cable at 51 percent about 45 
million 
now that many of cable operators have finished building their 
systems wiring more than 80 percent of american households 
cable companies are beginning to pay off their debt and have cash 
to spend on programming 
cable is looking to programming to attract new subscribers and 
the industry is encouraged by the success of efforts like 
showtimes critically acclaimed its garry shandlings show a 
series that now also airs on the fox broadcasting network 
home box offices dear america letters home from vietnam 
also received high marks from tv critics and the entertainment and 
sports programming network espn has landed some big sports 
contracts including national football league games 
things are going extraordinarily well for cable said robert 
alter president of the cabletelevision advertising bureau 
people are discovering the choice in programming that cable 
offers 
cable systems are adding subscribers at the rate of 1 percent to 
2 percent a year and those with the wire are spending nearly as 
much time watching programming produced by cable as they do viewing 
programs of the three major broadcast networks he said 
increased viewership boosted cable advertising sales above the 
1 billion mark last year and ad revenues are expected to hit 15 
billion this year he said each new subscriber is worth about 
2000 to the asset value of many cable systems he said 
there is a tremendous incentive on cable to sharpen its 
marketing skills to build its subscriber base he said 
rates have also risen since deregulation 16 months ago and that 
has concerned congress metzenbaum says prices in some systems have 
risen by up to 400 percent 
the ncta however says the average cable subscribers monthly 
bill rose 67 percent in the first six months after deregulation 
while basic service prices rose about 106 percent rates for 
premium or pay channels like hbo dropped 25 percent according to 
the study

fawn hall the former secretary to oliver 
north has been named by a federal grand jury as an unindicted 
coconspirator in the irancontra affair a newspaper reported 
saturday 
miss hall was named along with robert earle a former assistant 
to north on the national security council staff and joe fernandez 
a former cia agent the los angeles times reported 
the action which has been kept under court seal allows 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to use the testimony of the 
unindicted coconspirators against the prosecutors primary 
targets north former national security adviser john poindexter 
retired gen richard secord and iranianborn arms dealer albert 
hakim 
citing unidentified sources close to the investigation the 
times said the move is significant because it distinguishes miss 
hall earle and fernandez from conventional witnesses whose 
testimony would apply only to one defendant at a time 
james wieghart a spokesman for walsh declined to comment on 
the report saturday in washington 
miss halls attorney plato cacheris said i dont regard her 
as a coconspirator and this is grossly unfair and incorrect 
north poindexter secord and hakim were indicted on charges of 
conspiring to divert iran arms sale profits to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
hearsay testimony from an alleged member of a conspiracy even 
if unindicted can be used against all members of the conspiracy 
because the witness was close to events the times said 
walsh has reportedly granted full immunity to miss hall and 
earle fernandez has not been granted immunity however and could 
still face charges sources told the times 
in testimony before a congressional committee last year miss 
hall admitted removing classified materials from the nsc offices 
while she was norths personal secretary she and earle have 
admitted shredding documents later sought in the investigation 
fernandez former cia chief of station in costa rica has 
acknowledged involvement in secret us airdrops to the contras at 
a time when congress had banned military aid to the rebels 
earles lawyer dennis dean kirk declined to comment john 
stein the attorney representing fernandez could not be reached 
for comment 
the process of naming unindicted coconspirators has come under 
criticism on the ground that because they are not defendants they 
do not have the opportunity to clear themselves in court

the director of the district of columbias 
department of human services and two aides have resigned after 
reports surfaced that the three used city funds to pay their rent 
and food bills officials said saturday 
mayor marion barry jr demanded the resignations friday night 
after meeting with the city administrator and legal counsel 
according to john white a spokesman for the mayor 
director m jerome woods and chief deputy theodore carthen had 
been living in an 875amonth twobedroom apartment using city 
housing allowance funds and receiving some reimbursements for food 
since august steve ybarra and a fourth assistant deputy director 
robert little were also found to be living off city funds 
littles resignation was not immediately accepted pending 
determination of whether he is responsible for the housing 
allowances he received 
none has been charged with criminal wrongdoing white said 
city personnel regulations allow the reimbursement of housing 
and food costs to outoftown employees hired as experts if the 
employees are not on a regular work schedule 
the impropriety however stems from the fact that all four men 
receive pay for normal 40hour work weeks although they maintain 
residences in other states according to white 
neither woods who assumed the position in july nor carthen 
could be reached for comment saturday 
a total of 11 people including two deputy mayors have been 
convicted of criminal wrongdoing while serving in the nineyearold

government and rebel leaders on 
saturday ended their second round of discussions with both sides 
far apart on an agreement for a lasting ceasefire 
the sandinistas and rebels known as contras gave conflicting 
accounts of progress 
defense minister humberto ortega head of the sandinista 
delegation said after the meeting ended at 7 pm edt that some 
progress had been made he said the two sides agreed on 16 of 32 
proposals made by the government 
ortega gave no details the sandinistas said the negotiators had 
tentatively agreed to meet again may 1214 but the place has not 
been determined 
contra spokesman aristides sanchez told a news conference there 
had been no agreement on when the next session will be held and he 
said the rebels did not want the talks to resume in managua 
because the climate is not good here 
he said the rebels refused to sign a joint communique the 
sandinistas had prepared on what was achieved during the last 
session 
meanwhile police arrested three more people outside a union 
hall were 38 workers were in the sixth day of a hunger strike 
demanding higher wages 
the government and rebel leaders met behind closed doors at a 
managua hotel in the third and final day of talks to work out 
details of the march 23 ceasefire pact 
the rebel delegation got rid of one of the major stumbling 
blocks when it agreed to withdraw its demand that combatants be 
allowed to replace damaged weapons and spent ammunition while they 
are in special zones 
a sandinista proposal calls for the rebels to move into seven 
zones once they are concentrated in the areas the government is 
to release about 700 political prisoners and allow rebel delegates 
to take part in national talks with political parties 
the contras on friday rejected a sandinista proposal that the 
international red cross seen here as sympathizing with the 
government immediately resupply the rebels the ceasefire pact 
called for delivery of food clothes and medicine to the contra 
combatants only after they entered the zones 
contras say they want to select the organization that will send 
the goods the rebels agreed in the pact to accept only nonlethal 
supplies from a neutral organization 
sandinista police meanwhile cordoned off the entrance to the 
general workers federation an umbrella group of antigovernment 
unions and the scene of demonstrations on friday 
about 1500 construction workers and car mechanics walked off 
their jobs feb 25 to demand higher salaries and protest economic 
measures enacted a week earlier 
union officials and witnesses said the interior ministrys 
special forces known as black berets used rubber truncheons 
to break up demonstrations outside the union headquarters inside 
38 workers were staging the hunger strike 
witnesses said two men and a woman were taken into police 
custody saturday morning for gathering outside the building 
police scuffled with the two men and then roughly tossed them 
into a pickup truck the witnesses said 
barricada the newspaper of the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front reported saturday that police detained 25 people 
during the demonstrations eleven others were taken into custody 
earlier in the week 
the newspaper also reported an altercation between interior 
minister tomas borge and jose castillo osejo director of 
antisandinista radio corporation 
castillo told the associated press he was summoned to borges 
office friday for allegedly reporting erroneous information about 
the strike the minister punched him in the mouth castillo said 
barricada reported that castillo insulted borge when the two met 
in private 
as a result of the incident castillo suffered minor

opec oil ministers failed early sunday to 
agree on a production cut that analysts said could boost prices 
officials said 
the oil ministers said they would resume their debate sunday 
night 
eight of opecs 13 member nations backed a proposed twomonth 
cut of 300000 barrels a day in the cartels production that 
analysts said could raise gasoline prices by 25 cents a gallon 
but gholamreza aghazadeh the iranian oil minister said saudi 
arabia and three other persian gulf arab states rejected the plan 
the saudis proposed that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries cut only about 200000 barrels a day he said 
the saudi idea was rejected by the eightcountry majority and 
the talks adjourned in the early hours sunday the ministers have 
been meeting since thursday 
were still studying the issue said hisham nazer the saudi 
oil minister as he left the 3hour meeting he declined to say 
more 
the other three holdouts are kuwait qatar and the united arab 
emirates whose oil ministers also have said they needed more time 
to consult with their governments the 13th member not voting on 
the proposal is iraq which normally does not follow opecs 
production quotas 
the venezuelan oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti said the 
cartel leaders were still stuck on the same questions 
we are giving time to the four gulf arab countries to think 
again about the proposal hernandez said 
several officials including irans aghazadeh said the saudis 
insisted any cuts in production be shared equally rather than 
following the usual practice of assigning cuts in accordance with 
each members share of current opec production 
in other words the saudis insisted that gabon which pumps only 
150000 barrels a day cut as much as saudi arabia which produces 
43 million barrels daily 
analysts and opec officials said the proposal to cut opec 
production by 300000 barrels or 2 percent could boost oil prices 
by as much as 1 a barrel meaning an increase of 25 cents per 
gallon at the gasoline pump 
opec oil currently is selling for 14 to 16 per 42gallon 
barrel well below its target of 18 a barrel 
the saudis proposal to cut output by 200000 barrels a day 
would match the reduction that a group of six nonopec producers 
has offered to make in tandem with the cartel according to 
delegation sources 
they reported the saudis said they would be willing to accept 
the 300000 figure if the nonopec group raised its cutback offer 
to that level 
the six nonopec nations include mexico egypt china oman 
angola and malaysia 
taken together the cuts would represent a loss of only about 1 
percent of oil supplies in the noncommunist world 
normally a cutback that small would have little or no effect on 
prices but analysts said the psychology of the market is such that 
any agreement on production restraint between opec and the nonopec 
group would give at least a modest boost to prices 
paul mcdonald a londonbased oil consultant said prices could 
rise as much as 1 a barrel in the very short term 
its sheer genius as far as getting them over the next two 
months when oil markets were expected to be weak mcdonald said 
in a telephone interview 
by june oil demand in the industrialized countries is expected 
to pick up a little putting less pressure on opec to restrain its 
production he said 
if the vienna talks ended without agreement however prices 
would be expected to fall sharply analysts said 
the proposed mutual cuts in oil output were easy for most opec 
members to accept partly because they are so small and of such 
short duration that it would be virtually impossible to verify 
whether any of the cuts were actually made 
the whole thing is a nonsense in terms of actually changing 
the balance of supply and demand mcdonald said 
opec leaders insisted however that the proposed cuts would be 
important 
if one cuts by a combined 500000 barrels a day the market 
would stabilize etienne tchioba the oil minister of gabon said 
in an interview 
other cartel officials acknowledged that the proposed cuts were 
more imagined than real 
its only psychological said one senior opec official 
speaking on condition he not be further identified 
the main aim of the proposal was to establish a precedent for 
mutual production cuts with the nonopec nations 
if this could be repeated later or widened to include more 
independent producers opec could have an easier time stabilizing 
oil prices around its target of 18 a barrel

the reagan administration has toughened its drug 
enforcement by allowing the coast guard to seize any boat or ship 
on which even a small amount of contraband is found transportation 
secretary jim burnley said saturday 
since the policy was enacted april 11 the coast guard has 
confiscated nine vessels including a 300000 yacht off the coast 
of florida that would not previously have been seized officials 
said 
a confiscated boat must be returned to its owners only only if 
allegations of illegal drugs on board are proved to be false 
otherwise the boat is turned over to us customs which can sell 
it at an auction 
this new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who 
is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our 
waterways whether its in a commercial vessel a row boat or a 
milliondollar yacht burnley said at a news conference 
they will not only be prosecuted to the fullest extent of 
applicable state and federal laws but will be risking the loss of 
their property as well 
burnley said the administration now has zero tolerance 
toward illegal drug use the new policy is an extension of the 
previous strategy of focusing on larger quantities of drugs where 
there was an intent to deal burnley said 
the tougher policy is an attempt to reduce demand for illegal 
drugs burnley said he said it is based on the notion that when 
we permit even the smallest drug infraction what some still call 
recreational drug use we open the door a bit wider for drug 
smugglers around the world and for drug users in this country 
in florida ship owners found in possession of small amounts of 
drugs often havent been prosecuted because the us attorneys 
office was flooded with bigger drug cases said lt cmdr jim 
simpson spokesman for the coast guard district based in miami 
now we will at least be able to take the boats away simpson 
said it should be a deterrent 
on another front in the governments drug crackdown customs 
agents at oroville wash on the canadian border reported seizing 
an 18wheel truck loaded with aluminum friday after a roach 
clip and cigarette papers were found in the trucks cab 
the truck worth about 60000 and owned by a north dakota 
company was the second tractortrailer confiscated by customs 
agents in washington state this month

gen manuel antonio noriega waving a 
machete that he called a symbol of the valor of the panamanian 
people vowed saturday to keep fighting us efforts to oust him as 
panamas strongman 
this machete says not one step back noriega told a 
solidarity meeting of about 300 latin american labor leaders 
noriega brandished the machete several times and people in the 
crowd cheered and waved machetes they had been given by the 
government as they entered the conference hall for the closing 
ceremony the meeting was organized by progovernment groups 
this is the machete of panamanian dignity of panamanian 
valor noriega shouted and the audience chanted not one step 
back 
there can be no national or international dialogue unless the 
popular forces negotate their own security this commander is 
willing to accept a dialogue for the benefit of the popular 
forces noriega said 
he claimed the united states is using panama as an 
experimental field to develop methods to subjugate other latin 
american governments 
the steel machetes engraved with the panamanian seal are sold 
as souvenirs and are very popular 
before entering the hall the general told reporters he has no 
commitments with the united states to quit as chief of the 
defense forces 
washington officials said friday that noriega had agreed during 
recent negotiations with us envoy michael kozak to step down as 
the military commander but rejected american insistence that he 
leave the country immediately after resigning 
yes i had talks with kozak but i have no committments of any 
kind no commitments with the united states noriega told the 
reporters if they the united states want to be irresponsible 
i will not he did not elaborate 
noriegas opponents said they were dismayed by the reports that 
the united states had agreed to a plan that would allow noreiga to 
stay in panama if he resigned as head of the 15000member defense 
forces the key to his political power 
it would be a serious mistake if noriega is allowed to stay in 
panama said ricardo arias calderon president of the christian 
democrat party he will continue to be a focus of controversy 
panamanian officials had earlier acknowledged that noriega met 
with kozak an aide to assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
but denied that any deal was made 
the united states has been trying since february to oust the 
general who is under indictment in florida on drugtrafficking 
charges but he has clung to power despite us economic sanctions 
that have paralyzed the panamanian economy 
the reagan administration announced saturday that it was 
relaxing some restrictions and would allow americans to pay utility 
bills and sales and excise taxes to the government payments on 
corporate and personal income taxes import duties port fees and 
corporate social security payments still are prohibited 
noriega will go out on his terms when he is ready said a 
christian democrat party leader who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the americans are negotiating now from a position of weakness 
but they cannot back down after publicly demanding that noriega 
step down and leave the country 
the christian democrat and authentic panamanian parties are the 
largest opposition political parties in panama 
the authentic panamanian party called for a massive rally next 
friday the anniversary of the 1984 elections it feels were stolen 
from party leader arnulfo arias madrid with the approval of the 
united states which then backed noriegas candidate nicolas 
ardito barletta 
ardito barletta later was deposed by noriega vice president 
eric arturo delvalle replaced him then was ousted by noriega on 
feb 26 after delvalle tried to fire the general 
the us government recognizes delvalle as the legitimate 
president but some of the opposiion forces do not 
there will be no peace or progress in panama until the 
government the people elected in 1984 is reestablished and 
the police clique that oppresses the country leaves the barracks 
and yields to the young officers who understand that civil power 
belongs only to the people the authentic panamanian party 
communique said

formed outside legalization centers throughout the country and 
immigration officials braced for an even bigger onslaught as next 
weeks amnesty deadline neared 
monday tuesday its going to be outrageous said richard 
s rios director of the immigration and naturalization service 
center in houston an estimated 3000 people submitted applications 
at the center saturday and another 3500 were expected sunday he 
said 
the crowd will grow as the deadline approaches rios said 
the 1986 immigration reform and control act gives aliens who can 
prove continuous residency in the united states since jan 1 1982 
until midnight wednesday to apply for legal status 
from california to new york ins offices were staying open 
saturday and sunday and many planned extended hours next week 
officials also were waiving interviews with applicants until 
after the deadline to cope with the rush 
in the new york borough of queens immigration officials staged 
a party to entice applicants saturday balloons and american flags 
decorated a big room a calypso singer entertained the crowds and 
a disc jockey and a steel band were waiting in the wings officials 
also served refreshments 
one trinidad native who said he has lived in new york for 18 
years said he waited until the last minute to apply because he had 
trouble raising the 185 application fee the fee for children is 
50 and there is a family ceiling of 420 
yvette la gonterie chief ins legalization officer for brooklyn 
and queens said she expected 1000 people at the office saturday 
and again sunday over 100000 of the estimated 250000 illegal 
immigrants in the new york city area are expected to apply by the 
deadline she added 
the refusal by congress last week to extend the application 
deadline to nov 30 was spurring the flow of applicants some 
officials said 
theyve had a year and theyve just procrastinated said jim 
pomeroy ins district manager for new jersey 
the paterson nj office had more than 100 applicants by 10 
am saturday pomeroy said about 22000 people statewide mostly 
from latin america have applied for citizenship he added 
moiseca castillo 37 of peru stood at the paterson office

gonzales an ins security officer who translated for the three 
mexican immigrants they wont worry about people telling 
them we will call immigration 
the small office in wenatchee wash 150 miles east of seattle 
stopped accepting new applications friday after being inundated 
with agricultural workers apparently confused about wednesdays

under a special program agricultural workers have until nov 30 
to apply for citizenship if they can prove they worked for at least 
90 days from may 1985 to may 1986 he said some farm employers

a federal judge has ordered the immigration 
and naturalization service not to use coercion to keep salvadoran 
refugees from applying for political asylum 
in a ruling released late friday us district judge david v 
kenyon granted a petition for a permanent injunction ordering the 
ins to routinely inform all salvadorans detained that they have a 
right to ask for political asylum legal counsel and even access to 
pay telephones 
the ruling reaffirmed a preliminary injunction kenyon issued in 
1982 in which he ruled that the ins routinely threatened 
salvadorans to talk them out of their rights ins attorneys had 
denied many of the allegations of abuses 
civil rights attorneys hailed the ruling 
the decision really affirms the fact that salvadorans with 
valid claims were simply being denied justice said linton 
joaquin executive director of the central american refugee center 
who helped argue the classaction lawsuit 
the governments lead attorney in the case allen hausman 
criticized the decision saying it offered sweeping protections to 
salvadorans that are not enjoyed by other immigrants 
how can you say a person from haiti or south africa or iran is 
less deserving its hard to distinguish said hausman assistant 
director of the justice departments office of immigration 
litigation in washington 
the attorney said he didnt know if the ins would appeal 
kenyons decision came after a twoyear nonjury trial that 
featured testimony from 180 witnesses including many immigrants 
who said they had been tortured in their native country 
the total number of salvadorans who have applied for asylum was 
not available but the ins said late last year it was considering 
about 25000 applications from salvadorans in los angeles more 
than half of the estimated 750000 salvadorans living in the united 
states are in the los angeles area 
during the 1985 fiscal year 74 salvadorans were granted 
political asylum in the united states and 2229 had their 
application rejected during the same period 2779 iranians and 
408 nicaraguans were granted asylum 
the reagan administration maintains that many of the salvadorans 
do not qualify because they are economic immigrants fleeing poverty 
rather than political refugees fleeing persecution

a sinkhole that became one of floridas 
largest seems to have stablized with one house at the bottom slowly 
being covered by water and another home teetered on the edge a 
geologist said saturday 
i call this a double freak sinkhole because its so far south 
and its so big said william wilson a geologist with the 
florida sinkhole research institute at the university of central 
florida 
at least one whole acre has been swallowed up in one big 
gulp he said 
it appears to be stable wilson said following the typical 
pattern of sinkholes which usually stabilize within a day or two 
after taking anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to collapse 
the sinkhole which collapsed in a subdivision near here friday 
evening is more than 200 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet deep he 
said the average sinkhole in southern central florida is about 20 
feet across wilson said 
this sinkhole is larger than 99 percent of all other sinkholes 
in florida wilson said 
its real gentle said sebring police lt jerry fennell 
its not a real abrupt hole its more like a saucer 
the sinkhole is becoming a pond since the water table is about 5 
or 6 feet below the ground level in that area 
the house at the edge of the sinkhole is completely ruined 
wilson said 
it looks like a drunken sailor he said but it 
doesnt look like its going to get sucked underground like the 
first house 
beyond those houses neighborhood residents are moving back into 
their homes fennell said 
its highly unlikely highlands county is going to have a rash 
of sinkholes wilson said 
sinkholes are generally caused by changes in the level of water 
flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil a 
sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought 
for instance can weaken walls and roofs of the underground 
limestone caverns leading to their breakdown 
too much water drainage into the ground also creates pressure 
that can dissolve claylike materials and rock formations 
underground

the onceinfouryears general conference of 
the united methodist church ended the first lap saturday of a 
concentrated exercise in ecclesiastical democracy 
like most us protestant bodies the churchs organizational 
system is modeled on the nations representative system and the 
process here provided an intensified example of it 
so far it has been preoccupied with preliminary hearings of 
legislative committees on a range of proposals including the 
status of homosexuals in the united methodist church and a new 
hymnbook decisions will come next week in the second stage of the 
11day conference which runs through friday 
the group is the top lawmaking body for the approximately 10 
million united methodists in the country who make up the nations 
secondlargest protestant denomination after the southern baptists 
they elect from their regional units the 996 national 
delegates half laity and half clergy in a sense they resemble 
legislators sent by states to congress 
somewhat like the congressional record a daily similarlooking 
publication the daily christian advocate provides a verbatim 
account of general proceedings and a summary of committee 
deliberations 
there is lobbying here too including advocates in the 
cervantes convention center hallways who passed out buttons and 
brochures promoting church establishment of a university in africa 
that project costing an estimated 20 million and to be located 
in zimbabwe was approved by the conference saturday 
as in the secular political realm the conferences task 
involves carving out budgets and a 14 percent increase is being 
proposed to 100 million annually for national operations that 
doesnt include the approximately 25 billion given annually for 
local and regional activities 
alongside the general conference or legislative branch the 
churchs approximately 100 area bishops serve as the executive 
branch appointing clergy to pastoral or other duties 
the church also has 13 national boards or agencies somewhat 
like cabinetlevel departments 
bishops have no vote at the legislative conference but are 
required to be present address it and in rotation preside over 
it 
in addition to the legislative and executive branches a 
ninemember judicial council elected by the conference serves as 
the churchs supreme court to settle disputes over church law 
or constitution the council has a rigorous schedule during the 
general conference 
the cost of the gathering about 25 million including the 
convention hall rental fee the delegates air travel and 55 each 
per day for living expenses

vice president george bush criticized hollywood 
films that glamorize drugs and challenged the democrats saturday to 
join his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins 
bush denying that investigations of attorney general edwin 
meese iii are hurting his campaign also warned that if the 
democrats want to go down the low road well meet them 
in another development the washington post reported in its 
sunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuit 
portray top aides to bush as being more actively involved in 
central american counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 than 
previously disclosed 
the information however does not contradict assertions by 
senior advisers donald p gregg and col samuel j watson iii that 
they were unaware until august 1986 of the plan to resupply the 
nicaraguan rebels during a ban on us aid the newspaper said 
according to the information bush was advised on june 3 1986 
of the salvadoran air forces need for spare parts for its 
helicopters the memo stressed the need to quickly solve the 
problem to help salvordan president jose napolean duarte win the 
war bush wrote good on the memo 
gregg and watson provided the memos and testimony last week 
during pretrial questioning of witnesses in a 24 million civil 
suit filed by two journalists against 29 people many of whom 
figure in the irancontra investigation 
bush at a rally in the sunny atrium of a cleveland state 
university building called for all americans to stand up against 
drug use even casual use and express our outrage when we see 
some in the entertainment industry condoning almost advocating 
cocaine as some kind of a modern hip lifestyle 
in an interview with cleveland reporters bush said he was 
shocked at the approving way cocaine was presented in a video he 
and his wife barbara rented he did not name the film 
he told the crowd of 300 theres much more to do in this 
fight 
weve appointed tougher judges we are getting more conviction 
and longer sentences but where are the democrats on mandatory 
sentencing on tougher penalties for those who poison our kids with 
drugs i favor the death penalty for drug kingpins those involved 
in drugrelated killings he said 
if michael dukakis and jesse jackson are serious about this 
lets see where they stand on throwing the book at those who are 
poisoning the lives of the young people 
both dukakis and jackson oppose capital punishment for any crime 
bush said what about those who get minors to do their 
dirty work their drugdealing for them throw the book at them 
put em where the sun dont shine 
dr otis bowen the secretary of health and human services 
voiced pessimism this week about the war on drugs and told reagan 
at a white house meeting that the democrats are poised to steal 
from our party what has been a traditionally republican issue law 
enforcement 
aboard air force two robert teeter bushs polling expert and 
strategist said drugs have become an increasingly important issue 
in voters minds in the past six months 
voters want answers they want results they dont want to 
blame somebody they want a solution said teeter 
bush also visited a nursing home in columbus st raphaels home 
for the aged on what was once the estate of his industrialist 
grandfather the late samuel bush 
there bush told the carmelite nuns and elderly residents i 
pledge to you that in a bush administration there will be 
longterm care legislation put on the books 
bush also took in a spring football scrimmage at ohio state 
before returning to washington the vice president rode a river 
boat across the ohio river from west virginia to marietta ohio to 
mark the bicentennial of that onetime frontier town 
some unemployed steel workers from waterford ohio carried 
protest signs and groaned when bush spoke about the 64month 
economic recovery but most of the crowd of 5000 at the waters 
edge cheered the republican candidate 
look some people in your state are hurting and so are they 
in mine bush said but we have created 15 million new jobs 
since 1982 that is progress and we must keep it going until 
everybody benefits 
the vice president told cleveland reporters he has evidence to 
throw the sleaze allegations back in the democrats faces but 
declined to be specific 
he said he is keeping my powder dry i want to see the 
whites of their eyes 
ive heard dukakis and jackson talk about sleaze what are 
they talking about who are they talking about said bush are 
they convicting someone before the system works 
bush has already clinched the gop nomination but ohio which 
holds its primary tuesday along with indiana and the district of 
columbia will be a key battleground in the fall

a new drug for psoriasis is closely related to 
the acne drug accutane and is probably even more likely to produce 
birth defects when taken by pregnant women according to a 
published report 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that at least 
seven babies have been born with defects to women who had taken the 
drug tegison though no cases have been been recorded in the united 
states 
the drug was licensed in the united states in december 1986 and 
is used to treat severe cases of psoriasis whose symptoms include 
scaly reddish patches of skin 
the newspaper said experts have called for restrictions on the 
distribution of tegison like those suggested for accutane last week 
by the food and drug administration 
tegison whose generic name is etretinate can remain dormant in 
bodily tissues at least two years after it is taken and can cause 
birth defects long after a woman stops taking it dr franz rosa of 
the food and drug administration told the times 
tegison is produced in the united states by roche laboratories 
of nutley nj a subsidiary of f hoffmanla rouche ltd of 
switzerland roche also makes accutane 
i think etretinate will be a much bigger problem than 
accutane said dr devendra kochhar of the jefferson medical 
college in philadelphia the number of women exposed will be 
less but etretinate is manyfold more toxic than accutane 
tegison carries a pregnancy warning saying that it has not yet 
been determined how long a woman must avoid pregnancy after taking 
the drug 
a spokeswoman for hoffmanla roche carolyn glynn told the 
times that the company was investigating 10 new related compounds 
for skin treatments so far pregnancy risk does seem to come 
with this class of drugs she said 
she said the company was considering whether to make the 
pregnancy warning more prominent on the package 
everything we do for accutane is certainly applicable to 
tegison she said last week the fda endorsed suggestions by the 
company that it strengthen its warning on accutane and make it 
harder for women to obtain 
tegison and accutane can cause facial deformities mental 
retardation and often lethal heart defects in babies born to users 
of the drug the newspaper said

a man convicted of contracting his wifes 
murder through an advertisement in soldier of fortune magazine was 
found hanging in his prison cell saturday an apparent suicide 
authorities said 
robert spearman who was serving a sentence of life plus 20 
years in the 1985 slaying of his wife was found dead three days 
after authorities announced they had thwarted a planned helicopter 
escape 
the body of spearman 60 was found hanging by a bedsheet from 
the top bars of his cell wall in polk county correctional center in 
this town about 35 miles northeast of tampa said state corrections 
spokesman bob macmaster spearman was found saturday morning just 
15 minutes after the last check of his cell macmaster said 
macmaster said spearman was not considered a suicide risk 
spearman had been transferred to the polk prison monday from 
zephyrhills correctional institution 25 miles to the east 
on wednesday the florida department of law enforcement 
disclosed that agents had thwarted an attempt by spearman a 
millionaire boatyard owner from palm beach gardens to arrange a 
helicopter escape from zephryrhills 
two undercover fdle agents posing as pilots received 4700 as a 
down payment on a 54700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly 
spearman out of the prison said ed williams agent in charge of 
the fdles tampa office 
spearman asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns 
and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter authorities said he 
intended to use the grenades to kill his prosecutor palm beach 
county assistant state attorney moria lasch said john joyce an 
fdle spokesman in tallahassee 
spearman was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses 
stepson fred douglas laurent jr of fort lauderdale a suspected 
accomplice was charged with the same offenses but remains at 
large authorities said 
longtime friend gene fenno said spearman was struggling to cope 
with prison life when he visited him last summer 
he was always talking about getting out that he couldnt 
stand it fenno said after the escape plan was disclosed 
attorney david roth who represented spearman in his murder 
trial said he was not shocked by the escape plan because under the 
sentence imposed in april 1987 he would not be eligible for parole 
before he reached his mid80s 
someone in his position would not have a great deal to lose 
roth said 
spearman was convicted of hiring two men who had advertised in 
soldier of fortune to kill his wife anita for 20000 she was 
bludgeoned to death in november 1985 
prosecutors said spearman wanted to get rid of his 
cancerstricken wife a former west palm beach assistant city 
manager because he had fallen in love with his secretary and 
didnt want a costly divorce

the wildlife casualty toll from a 
175000gallon oil spill 40 miles northeast of san francisco 
appeared to have peaked friday and gusty winds and high tides 
helped the cleanup officials said 
they arent picking up many more birds at all now and we 
dont expect to get too many more at all said coast guard lt 
bob brach 
rescuers have recovered about 470 oilsoaked birds and animals 
since a shell oil co refinery spilled crude oil into the peyton 
slough on april 23 said chuck monroe regional patrol chief for 
the state fish and game department of those about 200 have died 
or were found dead he said 
only about a dozen oily birds were brought to the international 
bird rescue center in berkeley on friday said spokeswoman beth 
podvin 
for the second consecutive day wind and high tides pushed about 
1500 gallons of oil from remote inlets where it had been trapped 
into open water and marshland 
although the spread could threaten other coastal wildlife 
sanctuaries it helped the cleanup authorities said 
more and more oil is getting flushed from the marshy areas 
into the carquinez strait but thats actually working for the 
most part to our advantage because its making it easier to pick 
up said todd nelson of the coast guard 
eight skimmer boats removed several oilsheen patches over a 
12mile section of the strait brach said more winds and high 
tides were expected to continue pushing oil into the strait over 
the weekend he added 
the crude also has begun to thicken turning into tar and making 
cleanup along shorelines easier coast guard officials said about 
126000 gallons of the thick crude has been recovered so far they 
said 
the spill occurred after a pipe used to draw off rainwater broke 
inside a shell oil tank allowing crude to be siphoned out shell 
said 
the company acknowledged the practice of keeping outtake valves 
open during storms violated federal regulations 
larry kolb principal engineer fo the state regional water 
quality control board has estimated the spill could cost shell 4 
million including 3 million in penalties

two ferries sailed for england friday to 
try to break a seamens strike that threatened delays of up to 18 
hours for travelers heading to continental europe over a long 
weekend 
about 500 pickets gathered in drizzling rain around midnight 7 
pm edt at the dockside at dover preparing what union leaders 
promised would be a hostile reception for the two p and o shipping 
company ferries and their strikebreaking crews 
police reinforcements formed lines in dover as pickets shouted 
at truck drivers crossing picket lines to board ferries of the 
rival sealink company 
p and o refused to give the two ferries destination or when 
they would arrive 
the confrontation looming between pickets and nonstriking 
crewmen at dover in southeast england the worlds busiest ferry 
port put prime minister margaret thatchers unioncurbing 
legislation to its toughest test since her reelection last june 
the p and o companys pride of kent and pride of bruges left 
rotterdam holland on a 10hour voyage to england crewed by about 
280 of the 1100 employees who accepted new working conditions and 
opted out of a 3monthold strike called by the national union of 
seamen 
p and o has fired 720 other seamen who rejected the new 
contract and many of them manned picket lines at dover 
crew members of sealink have refused for four days to cross the 
picket lines forcing sealink to cut the number of daily roundtrip 
voyages to calais france from 16 to eight and use only 
frenchcrewed vessels 
with monday a public holiday the problems come on one of the 
travel industrys busiest weekends of the year 
sealink warned motorists of delays of up to six hours while bus 
passengers were told they might wait 18 hours 
truckers faced even longer delays and police cordoned off lanes 
of the highway into dover to accommodate stranded vehicles 
mrs thatchers legislation which forbids sympathy strikes has 
enabled sealink to seek court seizure of the unions funds 
the measure has proved critical in taming militant labor sectors 
like the coal miners railwaymen and newspaper printworkers in 
recent years 
but the sequestration of funds could push the seamen into voting 
for an allout national strike and sealink has appeared at pains 
to prevent that stressing that it is not in dispute with its 
workers and does not want to harm their union 
after talks with government mediators friday sealink and union 
negotiators announced a skeleton agreement to save sealink from 
further disruption and asked to adjourn the hearing until tuesday 
the negotiators said that under the agreement the seamen would 
confine their pickets to dover and neighboring folkestone and call 
off the scattered strikes that have broken out at other english and 
welsh ports 
but later the deal collapsed over the failure to bring p and o 
into the peace talks 
the deal with sealink is off so far as i am concerned all 
sealink ferries should stay in port said sam mccluskie leader 
of the 24400member national union of seamen 
some pickets set fire to a p and o flag and cheered as mccluskie 
warned the crews in rotterdam if they stay there as scabs they 
will be marked as scabs forever 
the ferries sailed from rotterdam despite lastminute efforts by 
the union to persuade their crews to join the strike 
dutch tugboats ignored the unions pleas to refuse to handle the 
vessels 
crews of the tugs said their action was saving the company from 
being sold to foreign owners that the strike decision was 
undemocratic and that had they been allowed to vote in a secret 
postal ballot they would have abided by the outcome

the federal employees health insurance

to its 10 million beneficiaries according to a report presented to 
the government friday 
the washington post said in saturdays editions that the report

health plans 
the consultants found that those plans compete to attract the 
healthy and avoid the sick rather than competing to offer the best 
benefits at the cheapest rates 
the need to attract the healthiest workers means no plan can

while americans debate the pros 
and cons of a 55mph speed limit most west europeans legally drive 
much faster than that and theyve been doing so with a lower 
fatality rate than the united states 
west germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system 
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules 
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes 
elsewhere in western europe speed limits range from 140 
kilometers an hour 866 mph in italy to 88 kmph 55 mph in 
ireland which does not have an extensive superhighway system 
the latest statistics of the 12nation european economic 
community for 1986 when a uniform 55mph limit was still in 
effect in the united states indicate a highway fatality rate of 
144 per 100000 population in contrast to 199 in the united 
states that year 
the 1986 highway death toll for eec nations with a total 
population of 320 million was 46046 in the united states with a 
popultion of 242 million the motor vehicle fatalities numbered 
47900 
but the united states has more motor vehicles and highways than 
west europeans americans are driving an estimated 176 million 
cars buses and trucks on about 42500 miles of interstate 
highways the 12 eec countries have an estimated 122 million such 
vehicles and about 17800 miles of highways similar to us 
interstates 
this past march however the us department of transportation 
said traffic fatalities in the united states for 1987 were the 
lowest in history as measured by 100 million miles of travel it 
put the rate by that measurement at 24 deaths compared to 25 in 
1986 33 in 1980 and 2408 in 1921 the first year the calculation 
was made 
the department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use 
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving 
seat belts are required in most west european countries as they 
are in 32 us states and the district of columbia italy plans to 
require seat belts by september 1989 
many european countries also have stiff penalties for drunken 
driving 
although their highway death tolls have been lower than the 
united states some west european countries are trying to get their 
own drivers to slow down 
in 1986 the eec proposed a uniform speed limit of 120 
kilometers an hour 744 mph for member nations but the idea has 
fallen on deaf ears or has met with outright opposition 
the federal republic west germany would be the last country 
to accept any uniform limit said wolfruediger nickel a traffic 
expert for the state of lower saxony 
last year 693 people died in accidents on west germanys 
5239mile autobahn system where multicar pileups are routine 
twentythree vehicles piled up on sunday morning april 10 on an 
icecovered stretch near schweinfurt in northern bavaria 
the fatality toll on all roads in west germany a nation of 61 
million was 7973 in 1987 or 1307 per 100000 population 
while the autobahn system has no overall speed limit many areas 
near bridges construction sites and major cities are posted often 
with police enforcement 
west german officials also are looking into ways to slow 
autobahn traffic in areas where accidents are frequent 
traffic engineers in cologne and frankfurt are setting up 
elaborate systems that will bounce beams of light off passing 
traffic to measure speed and the number of vehicles on two key 
stretches of the autobahn 
the information will be fed to a computer that will 
automatically adjust speed limits to conditions and post them in 
bright lights on electronically equipped traffic signs 
officials in other nations are becoming speed conscious 
in britain transport secretary paul channon has announced a 
package of measures including more road signs and speed 
restrictions to eliminate our own bad driving on motorways 
lower speeds at major road construction sites will be mandatory 
and traffic will be monitored by video equipment among other 
measures 
the british also plan an experiment on their biggest highway 
one linking london and northern england to see if 70 mph 
speedlimit signs will help keep drivers from going any faster 
about 250 of britains 564 million people are killed a year on 
british motorways as the major highways are called and more than 
8000 are injured 
in spain a record 192 people died in traffic fatalities during 
the 11day easter vacation period this year only 17 percent 
however were attributed to speeding 
the newspaper el pais commenting on the deaths said spain 
needed a better developed highway network 
the spanish government however recently sharply raised the 
amounts of fines for speeding 
on french superhighways the speed limit is 130 kmph 806 mph 
but it is not systematically enforced in 1987 479 people died on 
major highways in france which has a population of 552 million 
while speed and the difficulty of enforcement remain issues of 
major concern western european countries also provide an array of 
stiff fines jail terms and temporary license suspension for 
drunken drivers 
drunken drivers in switzerland for instance have their 
licenses seized by police on the spot courts decide later when 
they get them back 
firsttime drunken drivers face fines of as much as 1000 
guilders 535 in the netherlands 
swedish police frequently stopped postmidnight traffic on 
weekends and administer blood tests on the spot to measure alcohol 
in a drivers system 
the french national assembly in july passed a law doubling jail 
terms for drunken driving to a range of two months to two years 
some west germany cities offer shuttle bus service to keep young 
people from driving after a night at discotheques 
the west german magazine stern recently published a cover story 
on the highway accident toll involving young people who had been 
partying all night 
almost every second car was driving too fast and alcohol 
played a role in every third case stern said the 
recommendation of the accident researchers let the girls do the 
driving at this age 18 to 24 girls are the better drivers

wells who comes from park ridge ill left marquette 
university in milwaukee wis in 1951 with a bachelors degree in 
electrical engineering he worked as a design engineer managed a 
computer chips manufacturing company and helped various companies 
automate their operations before establishing his own company 
wells automation products in chicago in 1983 
he closed the business in january 1986 when the economy turned 
sour 
wells a widower said the children had gone their seperate 
ways so he decided to strike out on his own 
he joined the peace corps an organization usually staffed by 
people a third his age 
wells was sent to kenya in july 1986 and eventually wound up 
in mutomo a market town of fewer than 1000 people 140 miles 
southeast of the capital nairobi there the danish international 
development agency had asked other donor governments to help find 
someone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows 
i wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to big 
plants would do here recalled wells a stocky balding man 
he spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of naivasha for 
orientation before coming to mutomo about 18 months ago he found 
workers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand 
i was astounded he said the men sat on dirt floors 
hacking away at wood with pangas machetes and producing beautiful 
frames for harnesses 
he intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to the 
process so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a faster 
rate 
days are hot and nights chilly in mutomo which sits in the 
middle of scrubland rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrential 
rains that come twice a year 
peasants of the kamba tribe mainly women and children because 
men seek fortunes elsewhere try to grow corn sorghum and millet 
they also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys 
but they lack affordable tools particularly plows 
wells pushed the idea for a training center writing proposals 
and seeking money 
josephat muliungi development coordinator for the kitui roman 
catholic diocese said the center will be the largest economic 
enterprise in mutomo 
the area is one of kenyas poorest average income for a peasant 
farm family is less than 100 a year 
once the students are gainfully employed we expect a sizeable 
increase in income for at least 1000 families within a year 
muliungi said 
wells said the center will continue making harnesses and plows 
but in larger quantities and better quality he hopes to reduce the 
price of a plow from the current 450 shillings 2650 
only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after the 
yearlong training the others will be organized into groups given 
a little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnesses 
in the villages around mutomo 
the center will continue to offer advise on how to run simple 
businesses 
wells already is looking to expand production to include hand 
tools bicycles carts and solarpowered radios 
people say it cannot be done he said but i think it can 
be done it is possible 
wells whose peace corps stint has been extended by a year said 
the center can be duplicated in other parts of kenya and wants to 
stay after his peace corps time is up 
it is a beautiful thing what im doing here he said and 
its good for people like me 
im young again im thinking again

friday is the best and worst day 
of the week for socorro chavez a maquiladora mother 
she is one of the thousands of mexican women now able to earn 
their own livelihoods working in the foreignowned assembly plants 
in northern mexico known as maquiladoras 
maquiladoras have made life better for most of them but for 
others it is still difficult to shake off all of the hard times the 
left behind 
it is that way for socorro chavez just as friday is her best 
day and her worst day 
when the whir of the plants sewing machines stops at 530 pm 
on fridays ms chavez catches a bus for downtown then another 
that takes her to a childrens home 
its a twohour journey across town for a weekly reunion with 
her two children marco antonio 14 and guadalupe 10 who stay at 
the home while she works 
that is the best part of friday taking the children to her own 
small apartment for the weekend 
the worst part is seeing how the children are outgrowing their 
clothes and dodging the landlady who is asking her to vacate the 
apartment 
then theres shopping for wholesome food 
the week i have to pay the rent we dont buy food the 
34yearold mother says 
ms chavezs husband went to work temporarily as an illegal 
alien in the united states 10 years ago 
he wrote and sent money home the first year the frequency of 
the letters dropped off and finally stopped 
he never returned 
ms chavez who has just a fifth grade education moved her 
family from the small chihuahua state town of namiquipa to the 
state capital the city of chihuahua and worked five years there 
as a seamstress 
but she said i just couldnt make it on what i earned 
sometimes i would put the children to bed without dinner 
we didnt have heat so i would borrow the neighbors iron and 
iron the bed to get it warm she said 
in that way life has improved for ms chavez and her children 
since they stepped off the bus two years ago in ciudad juarez a 
city of 11 million people just across the border from el paso 
texas 
ms chavez got a job the day after she arrived as a seamstress 
in a maquiladora which makes goods for export mostly across the 
border to the united states 
for maquiladora owners the advantage is mexicos low wages for 
mexico it is jobs for its people and increased export income for 
its coffers 
ms chavez makes about 80000 pesos a week nearly 35 at an 
average exchange rate of 2300 pesos to the dollar 
her job is stitching sections of leather work gloves at wellmax 
a subsidiary of the chicagobased glove manufacturer wells lamont 
her pay is double the mimimum wage in juarez and more than 
triple what she had earned for similar work in chihuahua 
instead of the oneroom apartment she and her children had in 
chihuahua they now have two rooms two beds and some used 
furniture she bought with money she saved from her earnings 
by staying at the home the children dont have to spend their 
afterschool hours in an employee cafeteria waiting for her to 
finish work as they did before 
my boss worked hard to help me find a place so the children 
could be together during the week she said 
but she added sometimes i get so lonely for them that i go 
there and sleep 
wellmex is one of about 200 foreignowned maquiladoras in 
juarez more than 330000 people the majority of them women work 
in the maquiladora industry that now vies with tourism as the 
countrys no 2 source of foreign exchange for mexico after 
petroleum 
another maquiladora mother at wellmax is ana maria lemus 
secondborn in a family of 17 children 
things now are much better for her and much less difficult than 
they are for ms chavez 
in ms lemus past life is her father working 30 years as a cook 
in a juarez restaurant while her mother stayed home to care for the 
children in a tworoom adobe hut 
my mother would cry because we didnt have money for food 
said ms lemus now 33 
at age 15 she dropped out of junior high school in el paso to 
work at cleaning a curios shop she earned 5 a week 
i had to stop studying to help my parents pay for the other 
kids she said 
when wellmex opened she applied for a job 
she has worked her way up from seamstress to production manager 
with the education i have if it werent for the maquiladoras 
id be working as a maid in el paso she said 
ms lemus met her husband at wellmex and he is now a plant 
maintenance supervisor the couple is rearing two children on a 
combined net income of nearly 300000 pesos a week about 130 
they own a car and a threebedroom middleclass home they got 
through the governments lowcost housing program infonavit 
things are a lot easier now ms lemus said i dont have 
to worry whether the kids have hot food 
and theyre getting an education thats the most important 
thing

heading north out of town past farms and 
pine stands one might never notice the overcomer campground 
until recently when television news vans began clustering at the 
headquarters of evangelist rg stairs ministry 
the attention follows reports by families in the philadelphia 
area that their children have abandoned their lives for a christian 
cult and their allegations that cult members cant leave because 
stair controls their money 
the allegations are denied by stair a 51yearold pennsylvania 
native who like other members of the faith cathedral fellowship 
lives in a renovated mobile home set among the tall oaks and pines 
near this town about 50 miles from charleston 
we have a good lifestyle here he said we believe in the 
christian principle of having food and raiment be content 
the ministry is headquartered in a nondescript brownroofed 
motel building along us 15 beside it is a modest brown building 
which is the congregations tabernacle 
worshippers sit on folding white wood chairs each friday evening 
and saturday morning to hear stairs sermons of bible prophecy 
delivered from a podium on a redcarpeted riser behind the podium 
is a small room in which the evangelist records his radio programs 
carried on 50 stations nationwide 
a few miles farther north is the sects 74acre farm where 37 
people are busy farming and renovating house trailers 
the farm has a fiveacre plot where residents raise everything 
from turnips to squash and watermelon nearby are a kitchen and 
dining hall where residents gather for prayers and share their 
meals 
despite the allegations the group espouses survivalism theres 
no indication of any weapons or military dress among the residents 
of the ministry where a sign requests there be no smoking no 
drinking and no swearing 
a number have their own bank accounts and vehicles there is no 
fence but a freestanding gate at the motel keeps cars from 
swerving into the parking lot at night 
visitors can stay without charge but there are some 
requirements for those who want to stay permanently stair said 
we want to make sure they believe in the christian faith like 
we do he said 
they must also be debtfree because its not right for me to 
take other peoples money and pay your debts he added 
the ministry takes in about 30000 a month stair said adding 
he pays about 20000 monthly for radio air time since the 
challenges to his ministry were raised several stations have taken 
the fiery overcomer broadcast off the air 
stair has predicted that president reagan wont complete his 
term in office therell be an economic shakeup beginning next 
month and therell be a limited nuclear war before the year is out 
i believe god speaks to me he said in a broadcast prepared 
for this weekend thats one of the issues they have taken up 
with me but how many of you christians out there in radio land 
believe god speaks to you 
stair said the religious community is not a survivalist enclave 
noting weve got a navy base over there in charleston with 
submarines if theyre going to blow us up theyre going to blow 
us up there is no human protection from a nuclear war 
the sect does have a food storehouse stocked with several 
thousand pounds of food its for the congregations use and is 
also given away to the needy 
stair who is called brother stair by the congregation was 
ordained a methodist minister now he said i wont identify 
with any organized religion i just call myself a christian 
he said the lord told him to move south 30 years ago because 
the safest place for christians in the end time is going to be the 
south he has lived in walterboro for 10 years 
much of the recent controversy has centered on the move of gerry 
and linda mccourt of drexel hill pa to the community 
gloria ahern mrs mccourts mother said stairs prophecy of a 
nuclear war inspired them to quickly sell their home and belongings 
and head to south carolina 
she and others in the philadelphia area have called for 
investigations by the irs and the fbi 
but mrs mccourt said we just wanted to move to a quieter 
place 
she said the couple had planned to sell their house and when a 
buyer offered them 60000 cash they decided to take it real 
estate agents had earlier offered to list the house for 74000 and 
65000 she said 
mrs mccourt who is expecting her second child in june said 
she leads a different life from her mother she said she and her 
husband dont watch television or go to movies and on vacations 
were likely to go to christian retreats 
she said when she arrived in south carolina she called home to 
let her mother know where the family was 
all she kept saying was youre sick she said there 
was no having a conversation 
but mrs mccourt said her mother is welcome to visit i wish 
she would come down here we have no malice 
stair said that if his critics in pennsylvania were to visit 
there would be no question of whether im making their people 
stay here or not whether they would still approve of the lifestyle 
is a different story 
gerry mccourt said the family felt it was time for a change long 
before they had heard of stair 
we wanted something more out in the country a slower way of 
life he added 
in pennsylvania their church group ate together and had church 
five times a week so our lifestyle hasnt changed that much 
except we lived in the suburbs and we might have had a little bit 
more he said 
dave moratto another member of the walterboro congregation 
worked for a livestock dealer in florida for 25 years before coming 
to south carolina last summer 
i feel this is where the lord would have me to be he said 
as he cleaned turnips in a sink outside the group kitchen people 
do it every day in florida sell what they have and move about 
shirley roe who originally came from austin texas said she 
and her husband and son were living in a volkswagen bus in north 
dakota last winter when they decided to come to walterboro 
wed been seeking the lords will he was telling us his will 
by telling us to come here she said as she helped prepare dinner 
chief deputy rf stevens of the colleton county sheriffs 
department said that in recent weeks the department had received a 
number of calls from relatives of members of the community 
we try to contact them and tell them to call home he said 
we have no indication of wrongdoing he said adding its 
just a situation that bears watching

nestle sa knows that if its 39 billion bid for 
rowntree plc is successful it will have immediate access to the 
masses of consumers who chomp down 30 million kit kat bars every 
week 
rather than going to its own kitchen and tinkering with new 
recipes to tempt the average sweet tooth swissbased nestle will 
rely on rowntrees triedandtrue formulae for kit kat the worlds 
second best selling chocolate product and other candy favorites 
like after eight mints and rollos 
as the takeover epidemic spreads to consumer product companies 
these firms find buying a successful product rather than trying to 
invent one is cheaper and the fastest way to the customer 
but some experts wonder whether product research and innovation 
will fall by the wayside as this latest strategy for gaining market 
share takes hold 
recently on the takeover scene the same rationale of buying 
into success was the driving force for west pointpepperell inc 
which will acquire stateoftheart sheet and towel plants as well 
as hot designer brand names through its 122 billion acquisition 
of rival textile maker jp stevens amp co 
and cartier sa the french luxury products concern unveiled 
plans to acquire a controlling interest in two swiss watchmakers a 
move that ensures it will control 40 percent of the international 
market for expensive watches 
even general electric co recently decided to buy into the gas 
stove market by acquiring roper corp rather than go out and set 
up its own gas range operation 
ge has all the resources to compete and develop new products 
and break into new markets but its cheaper to do it through the 
stock market noted donald margotta an assistant professor at 
northeastern university in boston 
the cost of introducing a new product that will appeal to a 
broad public palate is extremely high definitely in todays 
market entry is very expensive said israel shaked a professor 
of finance at boston universitys school of management 
a product like computer software for example has a narrowly 
defined target market making it possible to start at the fringes 
of the market and gradually build up interest 
but with consumer products it doesnt work that way shaked 
said you have to implement a fullfledged ad campaign for any 
product you want to place on the shelf spreading the word is much 
costlier when youre talking about every household rather than the 
5 percent of households that use computer spreadsheets 
a consumer product is only as good as when it reaches the 
consumer said edward de boisgelin an international food and 
beverage analyst at the securities firm smith barney harris upham 
amp co 
and its only good if it has high volume the hit is a 
combination of a few things a good product good marketing 
and good distribution he said 
in the case of nestle whose bid for britains rowntree this 
past week challenged a competing offer from jacobs suchard ag of 
switzerland success would be guaranteed 
the main positive for nestle is to go from low market share in 
the united kingdom to a 2025 percent share overnight de 
boisgelin said to achieve that otherwise would require money and 
years of product development and positioning 
some estimates have put the consumer product failure rate as 
high as 95 percent but marketing experts continue to refine the 
figure based on when a product is labeled a bust whether that 
occurs while an idea is still on the drawing board after a 
prototype product gets to a shelf or somewhere in between 
a majority of products that get to the commercial launch stage 
actually do manage to survive experts say but developing a 
trusted brand name takes years of nurturing 
some experts fear what the takeover trend might mean for product 
development efforts and quality control companies may find it 
worthwhile to delay the introduction of technology and milk 
profits if they have a stranglehold on the market margotta said 
in addition employees who are involved for 20 30 years in 
creating highquality products can be the very people thrown out in 
a takeover he said 
but de boisgelin disagrees he contends mergers could increase 
product innovation because the bigger you are the more money you 
can spend on rampd 
experts say consumers will be little affected by the recent 
acquisitions of companies selling everyday products calvin klein 
sheets will still be available at the local department store 
regardless of whether pepperell or stevens is making them

while the companies initiating takeovers are sure to reap some 
savings by consolidating operations like administration accounting 
and even distribution those savings arent likely to be passed on 
to the consumer 
instead experts say companies with a commanding share of the 
market might even be in a position to boost prices 
i dont think the consumer will be directly affected 
immediately shaked said the benefit will be for shareholders 
not consumers

the governments chief forecasting gauge of future economic

in their search for some likely event to break 
the recent stalemate in the stock market many analysts are looking 
to next fridays report on employment 
wall streeters expect the labor department data to set the tone 
for the numerous other statistics on the economy for april that 
will be issued over the next several weeks 
they also believe the federal reserve will take a close look at 
the numbers as it considers what monetary policies it should pursue 
public notice focuses most directly on the unemployment rate 
which dropped to 56 percent in march hitting its lowest level 
since july 1979 
participants in the securities markets however pay more 
attention to other elements of the report for instance the net 
change in what the government calls nonfarm payrolls 
this number is closely watched as a gauge of the economys 
overall strength and of the prospective outlook for interest 
rates and inflation 
thus while strong growth in employment is a positive for 
consumer spending and nearterm corporate profits it is also 
viewed as a potential negative for stock prices 
payroll employment grew by a largerthanexpected 262000 
workers in march 
recent trends in initial claims for unemployment insurance 
suggest that the april nonfarm payroll gain will be at least 
200000 said mitchell held an analyst at smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
in helds appraisal the federal reserve would like to see 
strength in the economy concentrated in the manufacturing sector 
manufacturing jobs registered a slight decline in march 
by now many followers of the securities markets are used to the 
good news is bad news reasoning that wall street often applies 
to statistics such as the employment figures 
nevertheless even hardened veterans of the game acknowledge 
there is something dramatic right now in the difference between the 
apparently robust state of the economy and the rampant pessimism in 
the markets 
catatonic paralyzed numb could all be used to describe 
the average investor in recent months said james stack in his 
advisory letter investech 
those who are out of the market are too terrified of another 
crash to step in investors who were heavily invested in the crash 
are just as afraid of not recouping their losses if they jump out 
now 
in the past week which produced some of the quietest trading 
days of the year to date the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
managed a 1724 gain to 203233 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 130 to 14833 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
increased 520 to 37924 and the american stock exchange market 
value index gained 511 to 30314 
volume on the big board averaged 14147 million shares a day 
down from 15502 million the week before 
from the mid1960s through the mid80s may and june acquired a 
wellearned reputation as a perilous period for stock prices with 
numerous and sometimes sharp declines 
yale hirsch publisher of the stock traders almanac dubbed it 
the mayjune disaster area 
but whether this pattern was a product of mere coincidence or 
the result of some force undiscernable to the ordinary mortal it 
seems to have been broken in the last three years 
from the end of april to the end of june the dow jones 
industrials rose 62 percent in 1985 61 percent in 1986 and 58 
percent in 1987 according to hirschs reckoning

congress turned its spotlight of scrutiny on 
junk bonds this past week and the head of the investment firm 
that pioneered the controversial issues defended them staunchly 
in 6 hours of testimony thursday before a house investigative 
subcommittee frederick h joseph the chief executive of drexel 
burnham lambert inc also defended the firm against allegations of 
manipulation of the 160 billion junk bond market 
drexel a leading wall street investment firm is the granddaddy 
of the highyield highrisk bonds and underwrites around 40 
percent of all junk bonds issued 
the securities are designed to allow companies without a track 
record of earnings to get financing based on whether they have 
sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts they pay higher 
interest rates than those of established companies and are viewed 
as riskier investments 
michael milken chief of drexels junk bond trading unit in 
beverly hills calif who pioneered the bonds was a lot less 
talkative than joseph at a hearing wednesday before the 
investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee 
milken who has been under investigation for the past year and a 
half by a federal grand jury that is reported to be probing insider 
trading refused to testify and cited his fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination 
behind the spotlight the junk bond market seems to have quietly 
risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the october stock market 
collapse as worries about a recession have subsided 
the resurgence of corporate takeover fever earlier this year 
also gave junk bonds a shot in the arm since many of the issues 
are used to finance acquisitions 
some of the companies that have used junk bond financing such 
as businesses in the steel and chemical industries have performed 
well recently helped by a weaker dollar that made their exports 
more attractive after the crash there had been concern that 
failures of vulnerable companies could cast a shadow on the junk 
bond market 
theres an ongoing need for highyield securities said 
robert waill a managing director of investment firm lf 
rothschild amp co and the head of its junk bond research department 
waill believes more funds will be attracted to junk bonds in the 
coming months as investors switch big sums of money now parked in 
moneymarket funds into highyield mutual funds featuring junk 
bonds the moneymarket funds based on prevailing interest rates 
on treasury bonds have been yielding relatively low returns 
recently 
junk bonds are purchased mainly by big financial institutions 
and most individual investors buy them through highyield mutual 
funds 
the bad publicity now surrounding the bonds with congressional 
investigators portraying drexel as a greedy firm that elbowed its 
own clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues 
wont hurt the market traders insist 
this has been going on for 18 months its a little 
anticlimactic by now waill said referring to investigations of 
junk bond trading and the congressional hearings 
drexels joseph told the house panel he expects the junk bond 
market to expand substantially over the next 10 years since less 
than 10 percent of the companies that could get financing by 
issuing the highyield bonds have done so 
in the last 10 years the market has grown explosively from 
less than 25 billion in junk bonds in 1977 to around 160 billion 
last year or 25 percent of the 650 billion corporate debt market 
joseph pointed to cable television as an example of an industry 
ripe for the bonds saying cable companies tend to have low 
earnings because of their high investment costs initially but also 
have great profit potential 
the average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old 
has around 1 billion in assets and employs more than 4000 people 
drexel says

a double dose of good economic news failed to inspire the 
nations financial markets which worried more about inflation and 
ended the week by heading down 
the commerce department said friday that its index of leading 
indicators rose 08 percent in march the second straight big 
monthly gain some economists said the figure eliminated chances of 
a recession in 1988 and thereby boosted the republican chances for 
winning the presidential election 
new home sales also rose in march for the second straight month 
the commerce department said the 4 percent gain strengthened 
arguments that the housing industry has revived following a slump 
in the aftermath of the october stock market crash 
nevertheless some analysts said the sales level could fade 
later this year because of rising mortgage rates a consequence of 
a slow upward move in interest rates over the past several weeks 
others said economic strength also means a probable rise in 
inflation which could compel the federal reserve to tighten credit 
conditions 
it is the rise in inflation that worries investors in the stock 
and bond markets which largely ignored the news on the economy 
friday and instead retreated 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
dropped 895 points to 203233 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of inflation and 
interest rate trends the key 30year treasury bond lost about 
125 in face amount and its yield edged up slightly to 909 
percent 
the economic news helped the value of the dollar which rose 
slightly against most key currencies but some traders said the 
dollars behavior also was a reaction to the evidence of rising 
interest rates which makes dollardenominated assets more valuable
