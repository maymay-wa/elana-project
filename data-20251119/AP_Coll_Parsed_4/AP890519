as prodemocracy demonstrations rocked china 
three us warships arrived friday in shanghai for only the second 
us navy port call since the communist government was founded in 
1949 
the goodwill visit came one day after soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev visited shanghai 
the warships originally were scheduled to arrive thursday but 
were delayed for one day although no official explanation was 
given for the delay the soviets apparently saw the coincidence of 
the port call with gorbachevs visit as a diplomatic affront 
the three us vessels sailed up the huangpu river common 
waters for foreign warships at the turn of the century when foreign 
powers dominated shanghai with gunboat diplomacy decorative flags 
dotted the masts and sailors lined the rails for a look at chinas 
largest city 
more than 200000 students and workers marched and rallied 
through the city of 12 million friday for the second straight day 
in support of larger related protests in beijing about 100000 
were gathered a short distance down the huangpu river from where 
the american vessels docked 
barry matney a press officer for the seventh fleet said the 
command and control ship uss blueridge the cruiser uss sterett and 
the guided missile frigate uss rodney m davis will be in shanghai 
until monday 
he said the 2500 naval personnel aboard the ships had been 
advised to avoid the demonstrations but were to be granted liberty 
to visit the city as scheduled he said they were to be in uniform 
when touring the city 
he said not many people watched the arrival because most people 
were more interested in the demonstrations 
the first us navy port call to communist china was in november 
1986 when three warships visited the yellow sea port of qingdao 
last month a chinese navy training vessel visited honolulu in 
communist chinas first port call in the united states

american television coverage of events in 
beijing was disrupted friday night when chinese authorities 
pulled the plug on live transmissions from tiananmen square 
goodbye from beijing cnn anchorman bernard shaw said as 
cable news network signed off its broadcasts from the chinese 
capital it was shortly after 11 am saturday in beijing or 10 
pm friday edt 
cbs also had its transmissions cut off from the square nbc was 
cut off by virtue of its sharing satellite transmission equipment 
with cnn and abc said the government had shut down all satellite 
feeds from china 
later reports via telephone by cnn anchor bernard shaw said 
chinese officials had issued a news blackout that prohibited crews 
from videotaping any events in the country related to the 
continuing student protests 
beijing mayor chen xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden 
to incite or instigate chinese to to march and could not 
conduct interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at 
government offices schools factories and mines 
any violators will be stopped according to the law the 
order said 
cnn spokesman steve haworth said in a telephone interview that 
the network was continuing to cover the story of students resuming 
a weekold hunger strike in tiananmen square in beijing by live 
telephone interviews 
we dont know yet what this order means he said our 
crews cannot move around or even shoot tape but its too early to 
tell what the impact is 
shaw and haworth said the crews have not been ordered out of the 
country 
haworth said that the journalists have 30day visas and that 
crews arrived may 1214 so theyre there for a while 
earlier in a live transmission from the great wall sheraton 
hotel in beijing cnn showed a government official writing the 
official order on a note pad provided by cnn editors to shut 
down the broadcasts 
the order came about an hour after martial law was declared in 
parts of beijing including tiananmen square where hundreds of 
thousands of chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms 
cnn requested the order in writing because it had legal 
agreements with the chinese government to broadcast from beijing 
editors said in the live transmission 
the government official said the agreement had been designed for 
coverage of the visit to china of soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev which ended friday 
cbs news broke into the networks season finale broadcast of 
dallas to show anchorman dan rather at the networks control 
center in beijings hotel shangrila as chinese officials ordered 
the network to end its broadcasts 
rather reported that chinese officials pulled the plug on 
live transmissions from tiananmen square just after several 
helicopters flew over the square tape showed rather preparing to 
broadcast from the square then a screen full of interference 
he said that when he returned to the control center he was met 
by representatives of the government television system saying 
theyd been told by the foreign ministry to end cbss broadcasts 
the written order to cnn said it must shut down the moveable 
earth station transmitting its signal to a satellite transmission 
ceased about four minutes later after network executives in cnns 
atlanta headquarters told the staff to obey the letter 
in my 20 years of news reporting ive never seen anything like 
this shaw said before signing off 
donna dees a spokeswoman for cbs news said representatives of 
the governmentrun television company were preparing an official 
order similar to cnns to put the network off the air 
after being cut off from tiananmen square cbs was able to 
continue with reports from its headquarters at a nearby hotel but 
even that appeared threatened by the impending order she said 
abc had ordered two feeds from china on friday night using 
chinese television equipment said spokesman scott richardson but 
were apparently caught by the official blackout 
bill baxter manager of the network desk for nbc news said the 
network shared a satellite with cnn and was unable to get a signal 
out of china he said efforts to book other satellite time were 
also stymied by the official blackout 
efforts by the chinese to end live transmissions began at about 
8 pm edt haworth said cnns live china coverage went briefly 
off the air at 921 pm edt but resumed live coverage several 
minutes later 
officials then issued a statement that we would be live until 
they physically unplugged us or issued a written declaration of why 
we were to leave which they did shortly thereafter according to 
haworth 
haworth said the shutdown apparently was not due to any specific 
coverage by cnn but because the chinese are anxious about 
resolving problems in tiananmen but not on live television

against a backdrop of political turmoil 
irans leaders are grappling with the thorny question of who will 
rule the islamic republic after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the signs are that because no one has the aging revolutionary 
patriarchs charisma or religious authority no one man will take 
his place and that iran will be led by a council of three to five 
members 
the leadership question was thrown open in april after khomeini 
forced his designated heir ayatollah hussein ali montazeri to 
resign following his criticism of iranian policies 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who is the frontrunner 
in presidential elections later this year is likely to be a 
candidate for the collective leadership which would embrace irans 
various factions 
other possible candidates include ayatollah ali meshkini 
radical chairman of the 83member assembly of experts ayatollah 
ahmad jannati a leading member of the 13man council of guardians 
chief justice ayatollah musavi ardebili a centrist and khomeinis 
son ahmad who is showing increasing signs of political ambitions 
after years in his fathers shadow 
khomeini 88 and ailing has named a 20man committee of irans 
leading political clerical and legal figures to settle the 
leadership question and to draft amendments to the december 1979 
revolutionary constitution a move that could have farreaching 
political consequences 
he said the constitution contained imperfections and flaws 
he did not specify them but warned that any delay in the 
amendments will result in plagues and bitter consequences for the 
country and the revolution 
the committee is expected to present its recommendations in 
advance of the presidential elections to be held between july 22 
and aug 22 before incumbent ali khameneis second fouryear term 
runs out in september he cannot run for a third term 
the result of that poll will affect the future course of 
khomeinis decadeold islamic revolution and the power of the 
countrys theocracy which radicals fear is in danger from the 
liberalization sought by more moderate leaders 
this has fueled a radical resurgence in the wake of the aug 20 
ceasefire in the war with iraq that has triggered purges of 
socalled liberals and the executions of hundreds of political 
dissidents 
the current swing toward the antiwestern radicals dates from 
feb 14 when khomeini issued his death sentence on the british 
author salman rushdie on grounds that he blasphemed islam in his 
novel the satanic verses 
but khomeini in the past has thrown his weight behind one 
faction or another every few months in a delicate balancing act 
that prevents any group from becoming too powerful 
some analysts suspect khomeini may already be swinging back 
toward rafsanjanis socalled pragmatists 
one of the constitutional committees tasks is to decide whether 
to scrap or downgrade the post of prime minister and broaden the 
executive powers of the presidency 
rafsanjani the only declared candidate for the presidential 
election so far is supported by the hardpressed middle class the 
powerful bazaaris or merchant community and some of the 
conservative religious establishment 
the populist speaker polled 13 million votes in last years 
parliamentary elections the highest single tally in the ballot 
another possible entry in the presidential race is 
prosecutorgeneral musavi khoeiniha a middleranking cleric who 
led the militants who stormed the us embassy in tehran in 
november 1979 
the incumbent khamenei who backs rafsanjani noted that the 
leaders who drew up the constitution after shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi was ousted sought to ensure that power would be dispersed 
and not concentrated in view of their bitter experience of the 
concentration of power under the former regime 
the radicals oppose centralizing power but ayatollah abolqassem 
khazari an influential figure noted recently some powers 
should be concentrated if the legislative branch is vigilant 
there can be no move toward a dictatorship 
the radical revival torpedoed rafsanjanis efforts to build 
bridges with the west to end irans isolation and left him 
politically exposed 
but the speaker who has survived earlier reverses has in 
recent weeks publicly taken a much more radical position 
protecting his flanks from hardline rivals led by interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi 
how long he will identify with the radicals is open to question 
he has changed positions many times trimming his sails to the 
prevailing political winds until he is able to reassert himself

casualties from the artillery battle between christians and 
moslems im so worn out i sometimes lock myself in my room and

really sick and tired of all this pierre said 
by the end of his tour 20 of the new arrivals had been 
pronounced dead and 36 had undergone emergency surgery eighteen 
had wounds light enough to be treated and released 
sirens wailed in the distance and pierre winced hiw eyes red 
from lack of sleep lets hope its not more casualties he 
said weve had enough 
more than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
in the often indiscriminate artillery and rocket barrages that 
began march 8 most of the casualties have been civilians 
the hospital compound has been hit many times once by a 155mm 
shell that penetrated the fourth floor but did not explode seven 
of beiruts 24 hospitals have been damaged 
dr najat daou who treats wounded children told of a 
13yearold who staggered into the emergency ward holding her 
7yearold brother under her right arm and said dont worry 
about me just please save my brother hes the only one left 
her left hand was broken when a shell hit their home it killed 
her father mother and four sisters she carried her brother more 
than a mile to the hospital but he was dead

the pentagon costs most congressional 
districts more in taxes than they get back through military 
spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because 
of changing budget priorities says an economist who studies the 
effects of federal spending 
these numbers should look quite different five or six years 
from now james r anderson said thursday in releasing a study 
that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on 
the deal 
the patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time but 
i think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go 
into the 90s in part because of base closings but also in part 
as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military 
budget said anderson a professor of economics at michigan state 
uniersity 
anderson a senior fellow of employment research associates of 
lansing mich an independent nonprofit economic consulting firm 
that conducted the study said the findings run counter to 
arguments often heard on capitol hill 
for years members of congress would say that even if they 
wanted to they couldnt vote against military spending because it 
meant money coming into their districts anderson said but we 
found that the pentagon budget isnt a boon to most congressional 
districts its a drain 
the study was based on fiscal year 1987 during which us 
military outlays came to 282 billion an additional 71 billion 
was spent on military categories of foreign aid 
for the study that 2891 billion was apportioned among the 
states and then divided among congressional districts by a formula 
designed to take into account income levels as well as population 
the north central region of the country was the biggest loser 
with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category in the 
northeast there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers the 
south had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained the west was 
the closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts heavily 
concentrated in southern california gaining 
the district with the biggest net gain from military spending 
more than 3 billion was the 10th district of virginia home of 
the pentagon the biggest net loss 12 billion was in the 7th 
district of texas in houston 
anderson said he included prime contracts military salaries and 
wages and retirement pay but not veterans payments in calculating 
defense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about 40 
percent of federal taxes go for federal expenditures he said this 
is higher than some other estimates which run between 26 and 28 
percent because he did not include trust funds dedicated to a 
specific project in his total 
the study said 104 districts registered a net loss of 500 
million or more 
of these 19 districts were in new york 13 in illinois 11 in 
texas eight each in ohio and michigan seven each in florida and 
new jersey five in california four in pennsylvania three each in 
missouri north carolina and wisconsin two in massachusetts and 
one each in colorado connecticut georgia indiana kansas 
minnesota nebraska oklahoma oregon tennessee and virginia 
states registering an overall net gain were alabama 62

mississippi 5529 million missouri 2 billion new mexico 
147 billion south carolina 1 billion utah 6643 million 
virginia 94 billion and washington 1 billion 
the most dramatic change was in texas which went from a net 
gain in a previous study in 1981 to a loss of 526 billion 
other losing states were arkansas 6128 million delaware 
4599 million florida 3 billion idaho 2207 million 
illinois 1162 billion indiana 282 billion iowa 219

the toxic avenger cavorts on the beach 
while in a theater nearby critics weigh the latest entry in the 
international film festival 
it is part of the incongruous reality that is cannes where 
movies like video demons do psychotown or the toxic avenger 
part ii are promoted alongside those competing for the coveted 
golden palm award 
the worlds most prestigious showplace for film also is the 
industrys biggest marketplace and movies in the official 
selection may die an artsy death while those shown in backstreet 
theaters go on to blockbuster success 
its the first encounter of the first degree the life and 
death of a motion picture is decided here said menahem golan a 
leading independent hollywood producerdirector in town for the 
42nd annual festival 
thousands of producers film makers and distributers from around 
the world set up shop for two weeks each year in cannes they hawk 
their wares in the basement of the palais des festivals in hotel 
suites or for those able to pay for an aloof but powerful 
presence on yachts anchored in the mediterranean 
giant movie banners are strung across the white facade of the 
swank carlton hotel which reigns over the croisette the 
waterfront boulevard inside the lobby is overrun with stands and 
the upstairs suites are transformed into office space 
having a suite at the carlton for doing business is like 
having box seats to a mets game said rob aft acting 
international sales director for troma inc a small new 
yorkbased company that is becoming a major force in the 
exploitation film genre 
we are never going to have an official selection at the 
palais he said but were known here 
troma is the creator of the toxic avenger a former 98pound 
nerd named melvin from tromaville nj who was transformed by 
chemical waste into a deformed and hulking hero 
in the first five days of the 13day festival troma which 
buys sells and distributes movies did about 500000 in business 
troma president lloyd kaufman said he expected to close about 2 
million in deals by the festivals end may 23 
cannes is known for being a fairly conservative artistic 
festival said aft all the better for troma he added 
they make films we make movies 
golan said that in less than a week he closed more than 20 
million in deals presales on 20film packages to countries like 
spain australia greece belgium the netherlands portugal and 
peru he inaugurated his company 21st century with the first 
announced deal in the marketplace worth multimillions 
the market first sprang up around the festival 29 years ago and 
organizers say it has grown into the worlds largest there are no 
official figures on transactions 
film critic roger ebert says in his book about cannes two 
weeks in the midday sun that he once came across a man who sold 
movies by the pound 
golan whose brassy style rainbow suspenders over a tshirt 
shines like the glitz of cannes cannot go unnoticed here 
he mounted the festivals most aggressive publicity blitz with 
fliers strewn along the croisette dozens of daily fullpage ads in 
the various festival trade journals and a large office on the 
ground floor of the carlton 
golan cofounded cannon films with his cousin yorum globus and 
produced an eclectic combination of high profile movies and schlock 
now he talks up 21st century products like phantom of the 
opera and mack the knife an adaptation of the musical the 
threepenny opera 
golan vows he he is getting out of exploitation movies 
saying i want to associate myself with what is considered the 
better product 
but 21st centurys repertoire includes caged fury and 
deceit the latter billed as a scifi space comedy about a 
nucleararmed alien sex fiend looking for earthly love

sen edward m kennedy is leading a 
congressional drive to push the bush administration into 
negotiations with the soviet union on a mutual halt to production 
of plutonium a key ingredient in all nuclear weapons 
kennedy dmass on thursday unveiled a legislative proposal 
introduced in both the house and senate that would shut down parts 
of the us nuclear weapons complex unless president bush pursued 
such negotiations within six months 
more than 90 congressmen cosponsored the house bill and the 
senate version had seven sponsors more than 20 environmental arms 
control and religious organizations announced their support for the 
measure 
the united states currently is unable to produce any plutonium 
because of breakdowns in its weapons production complex but bush 
has proposed spending several billion dollars to modernize and 
expand plutonium production in the 1990s 
the size of the us plutonium stockpile is classified but 
private experts say there is enough to last for hundreds of years 
without further production 
kennedy said the unplanned suspension of us plutonium 
production gives the administration an opening to counter soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs recent flurry of arms control 
initiatives 
we cant let him trot around the globe making it look like 
hes the only one interested in arms control said rep ron 
wyden dore a cosponsor of the house bill 
the white house said no one was available to comment on the 
legislation 
the bills say that six months after enactment bush would be 
prohibited from operating any of the facilities dedicated to 
production of plutonium for military purposes unless he certified 
one of the following conditions 
the soviets refuse to negotiate a ban on plutonium and highly 
enriched uranium 
the united states is unable to determine whether the soviets 
have halted production or 
the soviets continue to get plutonium by operating civilian 
plants 
gorbachev announced in london last month that he would shut down 
by the end of the year three reactors that are producing enriched 
uranium and plutonium for the soviet nuclear arsenal he called the 
move a major step toward the complete cessation of production of 
fissionable materials for use in weapons 
the soviets will still have 11 reactors producing nuclear 
weapons materials according to congressional testimony wednesday 
by energy secretary james d watkins

sharp criticism from sen alan cranston will 
not block action on the nomination of san francisco attorney vaughn 
walker for a federal judgeship the chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee says 
i have no desire to hold up walker judiciary chairman 
joseph biden ddel told reporters thursday following a committee 
meeting 
cranston has opposed walkers nomination to the us district 
court in san francisco citing the attorneys vigorous defense at a 
1988 hearing of a private club that allegedly discriminates against 
women he also says walker waited too long before he resigned from 
the club 
biden said cranstons opposition will affect walker 
negatively but will not kill the nomination outright as would 
have been the case under customs that once prevailed in the senate 
under the senates old traditions a judicial candidates 
homestate senator could torpedo the nomination outright merely by 
sending the committee what lawmakers call a blue slip with a 
negative recommendation 
in that case all work on the nomination would stop immediately 
and the candidates hopes for becoming a judge would be effectively 
dead 
biden said the tradition changed in 1978 when sen edward m 
kennedy dmass became chairman of the committee he said kennedy 
believed that no individual senator should have the power to veto a 
nominee 
biden said he would modify that formula he said a homestate 
senator now can veto a judicial candidate with a blue slip but only 
if the administration neglects to consult with lawmakers before 
making the nomination still he said other senators should give 
due weight to a negative recommendation from a homestate senator 
he said he has discussed the need for consultations with the 
administration officials and received assurances that they will 
take place 
cranston has submitted a negative blue slip in walkers case 
citing his defense of san franciscos olympic club and criticizing 
walker for waiting until february to resign the club does not 
allow women to become fullfledged members it attracted attention 
previously when supreme court justice anthony kennedy resigned from 
it a month before his confirmation hearings 
walkers confirmation is being urged by sen pete wilson 
rcalif 
walker resigned from the olympic club in february saying he 
enjoyed being a member but that unfortunately the clubs present 
membership practices are wrongly based on a policy of exclusion 
he said the club has certainly recently demonstrated that 
race ethnicity religion and other arbitrary factors do not play 
as role in club membership 
nonetheless walker added i as a member of the club 
have been disappointed that the club has not taken longer strides 
toward making full membership status available to women 
biden said he has not set a hearing date for walker 
meanwhile the judiciary committee sent to the full senate with 
favorable recommendations the four other judicial candidates whose 
names currently are on capitol hill 
they are pamela ann rhymer of los angeles and ferdinand f 
fernandez as judges of the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
robert c bonner of pasadena calif as judge of the us district 
court for the central district of california and melinda f harmon 
of houston as district court judge for the southern district of 
texas

gen manuel antonio noriega who has 
been out of public view since the may 7 elections and resulting 
violence led to international calls for his ouster appeared before 
about 1000 chanting supporters thursday 
but the beaming defense forces chief wearing a white 
guayabera tropical shirt and gray pants did not respond to 
calls by the united states and the organization of american states 
for him to give up his control of panamas government 
he did not address the gathering when reporters asked how many 
years he could continue in power he laughed and said thats a 
good question 
noriega appeared at a rally called in support of the national 
liberation project at the governments atlapa convention center 
the people united shall never be defeated and noriega 
for sure hit the yankees hard chanted the generals admirers as

official media said thursday the organization of american states

us officials in washington said the bush administration is 
prepared to urge steppedup pressure on noriega if he ignores an 
oas call to give up power 
the catholic church in panama applauded the oas call 
this is a great step forward said panamanian archbishop 
marcos mcgrath im gratified that the organization has taken 
this seriously and that it is bringing to bear its influence

civilians and opposition leaders whose peaceful protests were met 
with savage and bestial use of force 
anderson was the second panamanian member to resign this year 
the directorate comprises five us citizens and four panamanians 
at a special meeting wednesday night in washington the oas 
foreign ministers said power should be transferred through

trinidad and tobago 
senior us officials met with latin american diplomats thursday 
to discuss strategy for dealing with noriega if he refuses to 
cooperate with oas mediators 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter promised on wednesday 
that his government will cooperate fully with the mediators but 
there was little expectation in washington that negotiations will 
go smoothly 
opposition leaders interpreted the oas resolution as a demand 
for the departure of noriega who has commanded the 15000member 
defense forces since 1983 and is de facto ruler of panama 
it is important to note that the resolution speaks of a 
transfer of power and that it insists that noriega must retire 
said ricardo arias calderon opposition candidate for first vice 
president in the may 7 election which the government annulled 
on the governments radio nacional commentator rigoberto 
paredes countered that the ministers must not come with the 
proposal that noriega leave because that is an internal panamanian 
affair 
he rejected installation of a puppet government of the united 
states a reference to the opposition coalition which claims its 
candidate guillermo endara won the presidential election 31 
paredes is an influential member of the national assembly and 
former secretarygeneral of the government democratic revolutionary 
party 
if the foreign ministers visit panama he said their purpose 
should be to discuss the war of aggression the united states is 
waging against us and the freeing of panamanian funds frozen in 
us banks since last year 
arias calderon noted that the threemember commission has until 
june 6 to file a report if noriega does not accept the report he 
said the stage will be set for more sanctions against panama by 
the united states and other oas members 
those who oppose noriega in panama have been unable to keep 
sustained pressure on him and us sanctions have not driven him 
out washington began trying get rid of noriega after he was 
indicted last year on us drug charges he denies 
the oas resolution calls for full respect for the sovereign 
will of the panamanian people over objections by panama and 
nicaragua language was added blaming noriega by name for grave 
events and abuses 
the government newspaper la critica implied the resolution only 
passed because the united states promised to pay the 51 million it 
owes the oas before the end of 1989 
panamanian opposition leaders had hoped the oas would impose 
sanctions amounting to a diplomatic and political quarantine unless 
the government recognized the opposition candidates as winners of 
the election 
the government claimed its candidate carlos duque had a 21 
lead over endara when it stopped the vote count may 10 and 
nullified the election

persons who have aids will be allowed to enter 
the united states to attend conferences conduct business or 
receive medical treatment under new rules being drafted by 
immigration authorities 
foreigners infected with aids or the hiv virus can apply for 
30day visas provided they do not seek to travel to this country as 
tourists the justice department said thursday 
the new regulations to be issued shortly by the immigration and 
naturalization service will allow foreigners infected with aids to 
visit relatives conduct business seek medical treatment or attend 
conferences said justice department spokesman david runkel 
the regulations were drafted after last months dispute over a 
dutch aids patient who was detained by federal authorities in 
minneapolis while en route to an aids conference in san francisco 
runkel said 
an immigration judge overruled the ins refusal to grant hans 
paul verhoef 31 of rotterdam a waiver to an exclusion order 
verhoef admitted he had aids after us customs service agents 
at the minneapolis airport found the drug azt in his baggage 
the immmigration judge whose decision was not appealed by the 
justice department held that verhoef was entitled to an exclusion 
waiver because he presented only a minimal risk of infecting others 
during the hearing verhoef pledged to follow safesex 
procedures to avoid infecting others during his visit 
ins asks foreigners seeking to enter the country to state 
whether they have a contagious disease congress added aids to the 
list two years ago 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv the virus 
previously termed htlv3 or lav is spread through contact with 
blood or with semen from infected persons 
the disease is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
the new regulation is expected to be in place before the june 4 
start of the 5th international conference on aids in montreal 
attorney general dick thornburgh had been asked by organizers of 
the 1990 conference scheduled for san francisco to relax 
restrictions so aids patiends could attend the meeting next year 
there was also concern expressed about people traveling through 
this country to the montreal conference this spring said urvashi 
vaid a spokeswoman for the national gay and lesbian task force 
the new rules were called a ludicrous policy by pat 
christen policy director for the san francisco aids foundation 
which has sought to delete aids and the hiv virus that causes the 
disease from the list of contagions for which aliens can be 
excluded 
there is no reason to believe that a tourist poses any more 
public health threat than a business person she said people 
with hiv infection are not casually contagious and are not going to 
go around transmitting the diseease she said 
its a disease of consenting adults we dont need to worry 
about foreign invaders with this infection

a top official from a space consulting firm is 
bucking a trend and moving to the national aeronautics and space 
administration to take charge of its troubled space station program 
dr william b lenoir a former astronaut is taking the post of 
associate administrator for space station which was recently left 
vacant by the third resignation in a year 
asked about his moving back to a nasa job when others are 
fleeing from nasa to industry lenoir joked that i get the 
buylow sellhigh part wrong all the time 
lenoir flew in 1982 on the fifth flight of the space shuttle and 
left nasa in 1984 for the firm of boozallen amp hamilton inc 
which has a role in the space station program he is a vice 
president and a member of the board of the company and manages its 
space systems division 
richard truly who awaits confirmation as administrator of the 
agency said he appointed lenoir to the space station post because 
its a program im committed to its a program i will continue 
to fight for and i want to send the best signal that i can that we 
are sending in a team of people that can do that 
truly also announced the appointment of richard kohrs as 
director of the space station which will be called freedom kohrs 
currently deputy director of the shuttle program will be 
responsible for design development and future operations of the 
station 
ray tanner becomes deputy director of the station program 
the space station now in the design stage faces rough sledding 
from a budgetminded congress this year including efforts to kill 
the 32 billion program altogether 
lenoir told a news conference announcing his appointment the 
program must turn the corner this year with sufficient funding 
i do think that we should do something that presents this 
country with a working space station on the time scale that we have 
set or admit that we cant set it down and pick it up sometime 
later lenoir said 
lenoirs new post was most recently held by thomas l moser who 
served as acting associate administrator for space station for less 
than a month before announcing his retirement moser had succeeded 
james b odom who held the job for only a year before resigning 
in recent months nasa has lost its administrator james c 
fletcher his deputy dale c myers and the thirdranking 
official noel c hinners hinners said he resigned partly because 
of new federal ethics rules that would place strict restrictions on 
postgovernment employment he has taken a job with martin 
marietta a major space contractor 
since hinners announcement there have been a spate of 
resignations in various government agencies in addition to nasa on 
tuesday president bush signed legislation to postpone the measure 
for 60 days until july 16 
the new rules would have banned federal contractors from hiring 
government officials who have supervised their competitors 
projects

securities and exchange commission chairman 
david s ruder who was expected to be replaced by president bush 
is resigning after leading the agency through two of its roughest 
years 
the 60yearold attorney said thursday he will return to his 
teaching post at northwestern university school of law in chicago 
by the end of august the precise timing of his departure will 
depend on when bush appoints a successor 
ruders term expires in june 1991 and he gave no reason for 
leaving but bush had been widely expected to replace him even 
though senior democrats in congress were urging ruder to stay on 
had he remained ruder faced the possibility of presiding over a 
commission that could have been increasingly out of step with his 
views 
ronald reagan a month before leaving the presidency replaced 
aulana peters a ruder ally with mary schapiro a former futures 
industry lobbyist the term of charles c cox another frequent 
ruder ally has expired and his nomination by reagan was never 
acted on 
the list of possible successors includes attorney thomas a 
russo a former division director at the commodities futures 
trading commission and edward h fleischman who already holds a 
seat on the fivemember sec also mentioned are kraft inc chairman 
john m richman of chicago and harvey l pitt former sec general 
counsel 
white house spokesman bj cooper said the administration was 
reviewing the appointment and declined further comment 
ruder known for his professorial manner took over the sec in 
august 1987 and two months later found himself embroiled in the 
aftermath of october 1987 stock market crash the sharpest oneday 
drop in stock prices since world war i 
also during his tenure the seeds of the agencys historic 
investigation of insider trading on wall street planted by his 
predecessor john sr shad bore fruit in the largestever 
securities fraud case settled for 650 million by drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
democrats in congress were at first skeptical of ruder whose 
scholarly experience in securities regulation included little 
background in prosecution 
however one opponent former sen william proxmire of 
wisconsin who was chairman of the senate banking committee now 
says i was wrong i think he worked out well 
ruder won friends among democrats on capitol hill during the 
postcrash debate over market reform for hewing to a somewhat 
independent line from the freemarket reagan administration 
the white house and treasury department resisted any attempt to 
combine the regulation of stock and futures markets which are 
regulated with a lighter hand by the commodity futures trading 
commission 
ruder alone among top administration officials argued that 
stock and futures markets are closely linked and said his agency 
should coordinate regulation of both 
also in the wake of an outcry from small investors who lost 
money in the crash he pushed the securities industry to improve 
its system of arbitrating disputes with customers and to take other 
steps to restore public confidence 
ruder believes strongly in regulation proxmire said he 
believes that securities issuers should be vigorously required to 
provide information to investors and if they dont they should be 
penalized fined or jailed 
i think the reagan administration felt that regulation of our 
markets was not desirable and that we should have less regulation 
rather than more he said 
ruder exhibited real political courage in proposing 
muchneeded reform said rep edward j markey dmass chairman 
of the house energy and commerce finance subcommittee 
unfortunately for the nation the reforms were not supported by 
the freemarket theorists within the administration 
however roderick m hills chairman of the sec during the 
administration of gerald ford praised ruder for resisting pressure 
from the most ardent regulation advocates 
i thought he brought an unusually scholarly and calm 
perspective to one of the more turbulent times in the markets 
history he probably will be respected more for what he didnt do 
rather than for what he did do namely he didnt overreact 
hills said

the airline industry and boeing co are 
welcoming government orders that will alter the way airlines keep 
aging passenger jets safe 
in a series of airworthiness directives announced thursday 
the federal aviation administration said it plans to order 161 
modifications on older boeing 727s 737s and 747s and will give 
airlines up to four years to comply 
we think this is an important step in the right direction and 
will further increase the already high levels of safety in the 
industry said stephen hayes vice president of the air transport 
association which represents airlines 
the directives are expected to become law by late summer after 
a period for comment and modification they would replace a method 
of dealing with aging airliners which requires periodic inspections 
and replacements only when parts show excessive wear 
the faa said its action marks a fundamental change in faas 
philosophy for maintaining the airworthiness of older aircraft 
the faa estimated the cost of modifying the 115 oldest jets at 
142 million other airliners would be affected as they age an 
industry group estimates the orders which have been anticipated 
for several months eventually will cost us and foreign airlines 
more than 800 million and affect 1300 planes 
a boeing statement said other countries aviation agencies are 
expected to adopt the orders 
high standards must be maintained to assure the safety of 
aging airplanes until economics dictate their retirement said 
ben cosgrove a boeing senior vice president 
only a handful of airliners have been retired in the last decade 
as traffic throughout the world continues to increase and orders 
for new jets are backlogged the average age of the worldwide fleet 
of passenger jets exceeds 13 years and aviation experts expect it 
to steadily increase 
the new directives will require replacement or strengthening of 
part of the fuselage wings doors tail assembly landing gear and 
engine struts of airliners as they age 
due to the magnitude of the modification program faa 
anticipates that the work will be staggered over a period of time 
and generally coordinated with other scheduled maintenance the 
agency said in explaining its decision to give airlines four years 
to comply 
the action was prompted partly by the april 1988 accident over 
hawaii in which a boeing 737 which had made almost 90000 flights 
lost an 18foot section of its fuselage a flight attendant was 
killed but the aircraft landed without any other fatalities 
the new requirements will force airlines to replace aging parts 
earlier in a planes life 60000 flights for 727s 75000 for 737s 
and 20000 for 747 jumbo jets the larger aircraft make fewer but 
longer flights airliners that reach 20 years old would also be 
affected even if they have logged fewer flights 
one requirement for 747s calls for a major modification of the 
fuselage shell structure from the nose to the forward main 
passenger entry door the faa estimates the work on that and 28 
other modifications will require 35000 man hours per airplane 
for 737s 58 changes are mandated requiring more than 14000 
man hours for 727s the 74 required modifications will take more 
than 17000 man hours to complete 
the faa said the orders would initially affect 67 boeing 727s 
28 boeing 737s and 20 boeing 747s owned by us airlines 
the faa action follows guidelines proposed feb 28 by a 
150member task force of aviation industry and government experts 
set up by the ata and the aerospace industries association 
at that time task force member clyde kizer told an interviewer 
that the aircraft that are out there right now are perfectly 
safe this supplies an extra protection margin 
other task forces are examining airliners manufactured by 
mcdonnell douglas and other aircraft builders and the faa said it 
plans to issue similar directives affecting other planes

an environmental group wants transportation 
secretary samuel skinner to look into a fourmonthold accident and 
fuel spill involving an argentine navy supply ship in antarctica 
the environmental defense fund says that while the government 
pushes cleanup of the alaskan oil spill little attention is being 
paid to damage and danger from the bahia paraiso which lies 
overturned a mile from the us scientific outpost at palmer 
station antarctica 
fund lawyer bruce manheim in a letter thursday to skinner said 
the bahia paraiso ran aground jan 28 spilling 170000 gallons of 
diesel fuel but 70000 gallons remain posing a hazard because the 
wreck could be crushed by severe ice conditions which are expected 
with the onset of the antarctic winter this month he said 
manheim urged skinner to determine the likely fate of fuel still 
aboard the vessel contact argentine authorities to determine if 
they plan further action and implement measures to eliminate 
further pollution from the ship if a grave or imminent threat of 
pollution exists 
manheim said that while the exxon valdez spill of 11 million 
gallons of crude oil on march 24 into alaskas prince william sound 
has produced a massive cleanup effort argentina has essentially 
walked away from the bahia paraiso shipwreck 
he asked skinner to consider acting under international 
agreements that manheim said would allow the united states to 
protect marine life and us scientific interests on the icy 
continent 
transportation department spokesman bob marx said skinners 
office had received the letter but would have no comment until it 
could be reviewed 
well see what action we could take said marx 
manheim said the spill has killed seals penguins and other 
antarctic marine life and has destroyed important us studies on 
the effects of ozone depletion 
antarcticas worst environmental disaster has become a 
forgotten oil spill he said the situation is bound to get 
worse 
the environmental defense fund describes itself as a nonprofit 
organization of scientists economists lawyers and others 
interested in finding economically viable solutions to 
environmental problems

a pentagon official who left his post a week 
ago says the stealth bomber program should be scrapped because of 
cost overruns and sloppy quality control by the company building 
the longrange bomber according to a published interview 
robert b costello former undersecretary of acquisitions told 
the washington post in its friday editions that northrop corps 
quality controls on development and production of the planes is 
terrible 
he said each of the planes will cost at least 600 million each 
but he said development is in such early stages that the air force 
might not be able to calculate the true costs 
northrops chief executive officer thomas v jones defended 
the radarevading aircraft in a speech wednesday to shareholders 
saying the airplane has achieved unprecedented technological 
success 
former defense secretary frank c carlucci fought efforts by 
costello to kill the program the newspaper said but the new 
pentagon chief richard b cheney has recommended slowing 
production by at least a year while costs and technical problems 
are reviewed 
the air force has spent 15 billion on the stealth and has six 
aircraft in various stages of construction the program calls for 
132 aircraft

lowpower tests at the 6 billion seabrook 
nh reactor could begin next week now that the nuclear regulatory 
commission has removed the final regulatory obstacle a decade after 
the plant was scheduled to go on line 
an emergency court order is the lone remaining hope for 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis and other seabrook foes in 
their struggle to block a 5 percent power testing license 
the nrc gave its final approval thursday by refusing to issue a 
regulatory stay of the license the last in a series of agency 
hurdles that has delayed lowpower operations for three years 
the commission as part of its unanimous ruling said it would 
not issue the license for seven days to give a federal appeals 
court time to rule on a request by seabrook critics to prohibit 
lowpower testing pending further legal reviews there was no 
indication when the court would rule on the request filed last 
week at the us circuit court of appeals here 
nrc chairman lando w zech jr said the agencys staff could 
issue the license anytime after 4 pm next thursday if the court 
does not grant an emergency stay a license could come sooner if 
the court rules against the opponents petition no further 
commission consideration is necessary to grant the license 
we have reviewed the concerns zech said after the brief 
vote we have determined at this stage lowpower license is 
appropriate 
zech said a fullpower commercial license could be issued as 
early as late september 
opponents argue it is impossible to safely evacuate the coastal 
towns near seabrook especially in the summer when beachgoers clog 
narrow access roads the 1150megawatt reactor is two miles from 
the massachusetts border 40 miles north of boston 
how anyone thinks you can evacuate people from that site in a 
nuclear accident is beyond me dukakis said at the massachusetts 
statehouse in boston 
critics also say financial problems the lead owner has filed 
for bankruptcy protection and the requisite approval of emergency 
evacuation plans will block seabrook from ever getting a fullpower 
license therefore they say lowpower tests would only make the 
plant more expensive to dismantle greatly diminish any chance of 
converting it to another form of energy production and pose a 
danger to neighboring towns 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon vowed that state 
officials are in this fight for the long haul we have months if 
not years of litigation ahead of us the commonwealth remains 
resolute in its opposition 
seabrook officials say the plant is safe and is badly needed to 
meet new englands energy needs into the 21st century they say 
utilitydrafted evacuation plans written after dukakis refused to 
submit plans for the six massachusetts municipalities near the 
plant are sufficient seabrooks evacuation plans include alerting 
massachusetts neighbors by truck and helicoptermounted sirens 
at seabrook new hampshire yankee president ed brown praised the 
ruling which represents the biggest victory for a plant that is 
already a decade behind schedule and billions over budget 
weve reached a milestone that many people said would never 
come he said 
brown expressed confidence seabrook officials would win in court 
and be able to start lowpower testing early next month 
he rejected criticism that the nrc is biased toward the 
industry by any stretch of the imagination any process that 
takes 16 years cant be biased in any respect brown said 
the battle over seabrook has raged since the idea of a new 
hampshire atomic plant was first proposed more than 20 years ago 
seabrook came to symbolize the antinuclear power movement of the 
1970s 
long past its anticipated operation date of 1979 and with its 
sister plant abandoned seabrook i was finally completed in 1986 
billions of dollars over budget and still needing regulatory 
approval

at last buffalo is getting its day in the 
sun 
a new report compiled from three decades of weather data is 
literally putting this much maligned city in a new light 
buffalo recorded the highest percentage of sunshine 67 percent 
of any major northeast city from june through august buffalo 
also had the least rain during the period 869 inches and was 
the coolest with an average july afternoon temperature of 80 
degrees 
people just cant believe it robert carr a spokesman for 
the greater buffalo chamber of commerce said thursday theyve 
got this misconception that all we have is snow 
sure we get our snow but we get our sun too carr added 
residents have long complained that on the basis of one storm 
the blizzard of 1977 the city has the reputation of a frozen 
tundra 
buffalo did have the most snow of any large city during the 
1970s according to the weather service but other smaller new 
york cities such as syracuse and watertown and caribou maine 
received more snow 
the last three winters in buffalo have been unusually mild with 
less than 67 inches of snow the average yearly total is 966 
inches 
carr and other buffalo residents are hoping that the new report 
which was compiled by meteorologist stephen mclaughlin using 
weather service data will help change the citys image 
you cant argue with the statistics carr said 
buffalos 67 percent sunshine the equivalent of two sunny days 
out of every three edges out boston at 65 percent new york city 
64 percent baltimore and washington each 63 percent 
philadelphia 62 percent albany 61 percent and pittsburgh 58 
percent 
lake erie the source of much of buffalos snow in winter is 
responsible for its pleasant conditions in summer according to 
meteorologist jerry pace of the national weather service in buffalo 
while cold air moving across warm lake waters generates 
lakeeffect snows in fall and early winter warm winds across cold 
waters dampen the formation of clouds in spring and early summer 
pace said 
in addition cool breezes off the lake keep summer temperatures 
down so that there are few uncomfortably hot days in buffalo he 
said

william bennett visiting his first school as the 
nations drug czar on thursday urged students to report to an 
adult you trust any friend with a drug problem 
it isnt snitching or betrayal to tell an adult that a friend 
of yours is using drugs and needs some help he said its an 
act of true loyalty true friendship 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
spoke to an assembly at wr thomas junior high in dade county 
a true friend doesnt stand aside and watch someone he cares 
about use drugs maybe your friend will be mad at you for a while 
but in the end your friend will thank you and you may save a 
life 
the school recognized as one of 47 drugfree schools nationally 
for its program to keep students from trying drugs and to 
discipline them if they do is in the heart of a suburban dade 
county zone dubbed cocaine alley 
we heard this was a success and this was a success in an area 
where there are a lot of drugs bennett said at a school 
assembly complimenting students on their achievement if we can 
do it here we ought to be able to do it just about anywhere in 
america 
bennett who late wednesday went on an undercover crack sting 
run by miami police said later at a news conference that there 
are at least 50 fronts in this war and cutting both drug supply 
and demand are essential 
weve got a flood out there and these guys police are out 
there with their buckets and their pails bailing us out but weve 
got to turn off the spigot too he said the threat of law 
enforcement in america in many places is not credible 
bennett said drug dealers should expect to go to prison and he 
boosted a bush administration proposal to immediately seize the 
cars of dealers to deliver a clear message 
bennett who plays the lead role in the bush administrations 
antidrug effort but has little more than advisory power said he 
supports a proposed 16 percent drug budget increase but cautions 
that the nation cant rely on the federal government for solutions 
you cant buy your way out of this one he said but added 
its not an argument for not spending more money

house speaker jim wright his support eroding 
among fellow democrats is hoping a longshot legal move in his 
fight against ethics charges will rescue his political career 
but even as wright expressed confidence he could defeat some of 
the charges against him in televised proceedings scheduled tuesday 
those who elected him speaker were growing more pessimistic about 
his chances of holding onto the post 
its time for a leadership change said rep philip sharp 
dind one of the few democrats willing to say publicly what many 
were saying in private wright he said has become too distracted 
by his ethics struggle to run the houses business 
another midlevel democrat speaking on condition of anonymity 
said many have written off wrights political fortunes and are now 
focusing on the need for a legal defense to protect him from 
possible justice department action 
others questioned wrights strategy of leaning so heavily on a 
motion to dismiss the two most serious charges against him that 
he used bulk sales of his book to evade outside income limits and 
that he improperly accepted 145000 in gifts from a business 
partner with a direct interest in legislation 
even an ardent supporter said wright needed some good news 
its got to quit raining on the speaker said rep charles 
stenholm dtexas the constant addition of problems has not been 
helpful some things have got to break extremely favorably 
in asking the ethics committee to dismiss the charges wright 
was essentially demanding that the panel abandon a legal 
interpretation of house rules that it accepted when it voted to 
charge him with 69 rules violations 
the speakers defense is that the panel stretched the rules when 
it charged him by deeming fort worth real estate developer george 
mallick to have a direct interest in legislation and by 
characterizing his book royalty earnings as disguised speaking fees 
but one of wrights eight lawyers william c oldaker 
acknowledged that motions to dismiss charges are routinely denied 
and put chances of winning next week at probably less than 5050 
and ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif called the 
committees interpretation of the rules very well founded 
but wright appearing briefly before television cameras on 
thursday expressed optimism that he would prevail we welcome 
the opportunity for our case and we believe it is very very 
strong to be heard before the full public view he said 
wright himself will not appear at the hearing his lawyers will 
be allowed to argue their case for dismissing the charges and 
ethics committee outside counsel richard phelan will defend the 
committees action the hearing will be televised on cspan the 
cable tv public affairs network 
the full ethics committee made up of six democrats and six 
republicans will then decide whether to grant the motion probably 
sometime later in the week dixon said 
whatever the outcome any remaining charges would then become 
the subject of a triallike disciplinary hearing before the 
committee members would be asked to decide whether there is clear 
and convincing evidence of the alleged violations 
also on thursday the ethics committee denied wright access to 
advisory opinions on ethical questions which the panel has given 
other house members saying that to release them would violate 
confidentiality the members receiving the opinions expect

if not for the university of wisconsin phil 
hellmuth jr might be a businessman today instead of the worlds 
best poker player 
thanks to the universitys rejection of his application to 
business school however hellmuth is 755000 richer after 
capturing the world series of poker 
i was a little disappointed when they didnt take me said 
the 24yearold hellmuth but now im driving a cadillac and 
doing pretty well 
hellmuth became the youngest champion in the tournaments 
20year history thursday when he used a pair of kings and nines to 
beat twotime defending champion johnny chan to capture the 10000 
buyin tournament 
this is the pinaccle of poker here the world championship 
said hellmuth of madison wis its just an incredible feeling 
hellmuth outlasted a record field of 177 other players over the 
fourday event taking only 47 minutes to wipe out chans last 
630000 in chips as the two played headtohead in the final 
showdown of the texas hold em tournament at binions horseshoe 
club 
the end came when hellmuth holding a pair of nines in the hole 
put in all his chips after chan had raised the bet 100000 chan 
of houston had an ace and seven of spades when he called with his 
last 330000 in chips 
i had to gamble sometime and i thought that was a good time to 
gamble said chan who won 302000 for finishing second if i 
threw my hand away i only had 330000 left 
both players stood as the dealer turned the flop of three 
common cards which gave each a pair of kings a queen and a six on 
the final two cards helped neither player and hellmuth escaped with 
the win 
hellmuth finished 33rd last year in his first tournament while 
chan picked up his second straight win 
the win capped a short professional playing career for hellmuth 
who turned to poker after dropping out of the university of 
wisconsin when he was refused admittance to the business school he 
came to las vegas two years ago to try his luck against seasoned 
professionals 
my first 10 trips out here i didnt win a thing he said 
after that i started to win pretty consistently

the house foreign affairs committee is trying 
to work out a compromise between the bush administration and the 
senate over the fsx fighter deal with japan congressional aides 
say 
the effort comes after secretary of state james a baker iii 
told the house panel that restrictions contained in the senate 
legislation approving the deal could scuttle the 6 billion plan 
for joint development and production of the new warplane 
in a letter to committee chairman dante b fascell dfla 
baker said the senate measure establishes an unacceptable 
precedent infringing on the presidents constitutional authority 
with respect to the conduct of negotiations with foreign powers 
the conditions stated in the resolution would put the entire 
fsx program and our agreement with japan at risk it would require 
us to reopen negotiations on unnecessary issues baker told 
fascell 
the senate voted 5247 on tuesday to defeat a resolution that 
would have scrapped the fsx agreement but it then voted 7227 a 
margin that would override a presidential veto to adopt the 
restriction proposed by sen robert byrd dwva 
the deals calls for general dynamics to join with japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries to develop and produce the fighter an 
advanced version of the us f16 for deployment by japan in the 
late 1990s general dynamics has headquarters in st louis but 
most of the fsx work would be done at its f16 plant in fort worth 
texas 
richard bush a staff member of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said the panel is trying 
to modify the byrd resolution in such a way that the 
administration would be willing to accept it and the president 
would be prepared to sign it 
he said the most serious sticking point appears to be a 
section that would mandate the us position when negotiations are 
undertaken with the japanese several years from now on a memorandum 
of understanding or mou to set terms for coproduction of the fsx 
the senatepassed resolution stipulates that the coproduction 
mou shall prohibit transfer to japan of critical jet engine 
technology and bar japan from exporting the fsx or any of its 
major subcomponents to other countries 
linda krueger an aide to rep mel levine dcalif an 
outspoken opponent of the fsx said levine is working with the 
foreign affairs committee staff to develop modified language that 
wouldnt require renegotiation of the agreement 
the compromise is expected to be presented to the house 
committee when it meets to consider the issue next tuesday 
bakers opposition to the byrd measure was underscored by 
administration officials who testified thursday before the asian 
and pacific affairs subcommittee 
william clark jr acting assistant secretary of state for east 
asian and pacific affairs told the panel that if the senatepassed 
restrictions became law it would have a tremendous impact around 
the world in future us negotiations with other countries 
if i were on the other side of the table negotiating i would 
be very reluctant to put a lot on the line he said 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the subcommittee 
said that regardless of what congress does now this is going to 
be an issue in the future in case there are any major 
violations by japan of the terms of the fsx deal 
but he added that i dont want a renegotiation of the 
agreement

former philippine president ferdinand marcos was 
in very critical condition thursday suffering from kidney 
cardiac and pulmonary failure hospital officials said 
marcos 71 suffered acute renal failure and was taken to st 
francis medical centers operating room late thursday morning for 
vascular access surgery according to gene tiwanak the hospitals 
assistant administrator 
in the 2hour surgical procedure his veins were prepared for 
hemodialysis or the removal of body wastes from his blood by 
machine tiwanak said 
marcos also experienced cardiac and pulmonary failure thursday 
tiwanak said 
the prognosis is very poor and his condition is very 
critical tiwanak said 
marcos who was undergoing kidney dialysis suffered severe 
infection including pneumonia according to dr azucena ignacio 
his personal physician and an internist at st francis 
ignacio said marcos was being treated with antibiotics and a 
heart medication which she refused to name 
some medications are working some are not ignacio said 
marcos family was informed of his worsening condition and that 
he was conscious before surgery and had been conscious on and off 
since she said 
the problem is that his kidneys failed and we had to get him 
on dialysis quick tiwanak said 
the deposed president who is also suffering from pneumonia was 
placed on dialysis in the hospitals intensive care unit tiwanak 
said 
the procedure was not lifethreatening but the hours following 
the surgery would be crucial considering marcos frail health the 
hospital administrator said 
earlier marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad had said marcos had 
only a 2 percent chance of surviving the operation but tiwanak 
refused to comment on marcos prospects 
marcos wife imelda was praying in the hospital chapel with 
son ferdinand jr nicknamed bong bong trinidad said 
asked if the marcos family had given up hope trinidad said 
no we have always thought he would live the thought of him 
dying has never entered our minds 
mrs marcos left the hospital later in the evening without 
discussing the situation with the news media 
i believe the hospital has issued a medical bulletin and 
thats all im going to say mrs marcos said before getting into 
a van 
shes on her way to the house to make one call one last 
appeal to philippine president corazon aquino to let marcos 
return home said marcos aide arturo aruiza who accompanied mrs 
marcos 
mrs aquino has repeatedly cited national security in rejecting 
previous marcos requests to return to his homeland 
marcos has been hospitalized for heart kidney and respiratory 
ailments since jan 15 he was moved to the hospitals intensive 
care unit on monday and lapsed into critical condition the 
following day before that he had spent a month in the telemetry 
ward which monitors heart patients 
the former president and his wife are under us indictment on 
charges of diverting more than 100 million from the philippines 
during their 20year reign marcos has been separated from the case 
because of health problems but the case against his wife continues 
the marcoses have lived in exile in hawaii since they were 
toppled in a popular uprising in february 1986 
marcos has been hospitalized here three times since early 
december for pneumonia bronchial asthma and congestive heart 
failure he last entered the hospital jan 15 and underwent a 
tracheostomy feb 1 after which he lapsed into critical condition 
he eventually was upgraded to guarded condition and transferred 
out of the intensive care unit but doctors said he was 
chronically ill and unlikely to recover

filipinos broadcast frequent reports on marcos condition 
throughout the day 
in honolulu gene tiwanak assistant administrator of st

executive secretary catalino macaraig said there was no change in 
that position 
on friday the philippine daily globe reported from honolulu 
that doctors had told us and filipino officials that 
progressive and massive organ failure is beginning to take 
place 
the newspaper citing unidentified sources said doctors 
believed marcos could fight back if his will to live was strong 
if he does fight back and lasts several more days it wont be 
because our diagnosis is wrong the paper quoted doctors as 
saying 
the report appeared before word from hawaii that marcos had

its been two years since garrison 
keillor came to denmark to lead the life of a tall silent 
person leaving behind buster the showdog sheila the christian 
jungle girl and other inhabitants of lake wobegon 
during that time he returned to the united states and managed 
to put another book on the market now hes looking ahead to his 
autumnal return to us radio 
he announced thursday that his new twohour american radio 
company of the air will be produced by minnesota public radio and 
distributed by american public radio it will feature keillor 
sketches monologues and a mixture of american music 
keillor still calls minnesota home even though he has a place 
in manhattan and makes frequent trips to his wife ulla skaerveds 
native denmark where they also have an apartment 
his new book we are still married is a potpourri of 
letters poems and stories written during the reagan years his 
first book was about his fictional hometown lakewobegon days 
his next was leaving home 
more than 4 million people tuned into american public radios 
a prairie home companion keillors hit radio show that 
celebrated the norwegian bachelor farmers and others of the quiet 
imaginary little town of lake wobegon the town that time forgot 
the show started in 1974 and keillor gave the last broadcast in 
june 1987 
to the end a prairie home companion was keillors show 
reflecting his diverse and sometimes cornball musical tastes and 
his affection for smalltown life after leaving the show keillor 
felt unsettled and at loose ends 
the worst possible thing is when all your dreams come true 
and mine did including some i didnt realize i had but i felt 
better about facing up to those things in minnesota he said in 
an interview 
his old show was broadcast from st paul but the 46yearold 
keillor staged it in lake wobegon minn which became so familiar 
that some listeners thought it was a real town 
the monologues grew from a regional hit show into a national 
phenomenon running more than a decade keillors bestselling 
lake wobegon days was the book version of his radio humor 
the radio show made keillor a nationally known figure wider 
recognition came after the success of the book and it generated a 
resentment that he said took him by surprise 
if somebody id gone to school with whom i didnt think was 
that smart to begin with had written a book that sold a whole lot 
of copies i would envy him i know that i would he said 
keillor said he felt forced to give up his home when the local 
press took too much interest in his private life it bewildered 
me i had no idea what they were aiming at said keillor he felt 
hatred directed against him which was entirely strange to him 
what bothered him most was that he couldnt see anything funny 
about it usually i can think of something humorous about 
something but ive never been able to write about that it just 
seems so utterly grim 
today keillor thinks less about that time which he calls 
awkward confusing and embarrassing 
he confessed to escaping the midwest first to europe then to 
new york i fled first to copenhagen sort of under the illusion 
that i could live over here he said 
keillors move to denmark was accompanied by much fanfare 
particularly since his humor played on themes of smalltown america 
and values inherited from the scandinavian immigrants who settled 
his lake wobegon but he had problems working here and found he 
could write more easily in the united states 
i was embarrassed and had to go back to america i suppose 
that was kind of embarrassing too to have failed so publicly to 
have planted your flag so publicly and having to pull it out he 
said 
denmark provided some anonymity but the humorist feels like a 
tourist here and he cannot foresee adjusting to the danish scene 
while in copenhagen he mixes socially with danes and with other 
americans shoots baskets near his home and does occasional 
speaking engagements 
after only a short spell on his first visit to the country he 
was so taken with denmark that he thought it could be material for 
a book but that feeling of newness has worn off and he now feels 
hed have trouble writing a few good paragraphs 
nonetheless he has spent a good deal of time over the past 
three years in denmark and plans to continue doing so 
i think it is such an amazing thing to come to another country 
and marry someone from another country its miraculous he said 
and then to do it in middle age to have a passionate romance 
when youre 43 i cant wish things were different

school lunch programs could face milk and 
cheese shortages as early as this fall because excesses of dairy 
products have been reduced says the chairman of the house 
agriculture committee 
because congress passed legislation four years ago to reduce 
excess dairyfarm output surpluses available for government 
purchase have been sharply reduced rep kika de la garza dtexas 
said thursday 
we had to change the legislation and reduce the expenses of 
the government and once the surplus stock is reduced then we 
dont have enough for the school lunch and commodity distribution 
programs for the poor de la garza said 
food banks food for the elderly head start every place that 
gets butter cheese nonfat dry milk is being reduced or will have 
to be reduced because we dont have the ample surplus he said 
jack parnell deputy secretary of agriculture has confirmed 
that due to reduced surplus production of dairy goods there will 
far less milk and other dairy products to distribute to school 
districts for use in lunch programs across the nation de la 
garza said 
a spokeswoman for the food and nutrition service the 
agriculture department agency that administers the school lunch 
program agreed there will be less dairy products available next 
fall 
kelly shipp spokeswoman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said the milk and cheese in question are bonus 
commodities given to schools in addition to what they ordinarily 
receive 
the problem is we dont have it she said the stocks of 
nonfat dry milk and cheese are so low we have a very limited 
amount 
de la garza said the commodity credit corp purchased 123 
billion pounds of surplus dairy goods in fiscal 1986 for 
distribution to various agencies the following year purchases 
dropped to 54 billion pounds 
according to figures from the department of agriculture the ccc 
purchased 97 billion pounds in fiscal 1988 and current projections 
indicate this years totals will reach at least 82 billion 
but a usda official said most of the 74 billion pounds of food 
purchased to date has been butter the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said cheese represents only a fraction of 
this years purchases and not one pound of nonfat dry milk has 
been bought since last june 
the official said usda can only buy what the dairy industry 
offers to sell this year because of a strong commercial demand 
for nonfat dry milk and cheese most of the products offered to 
the government under the price support program have been butter 
de la garza said some commodities may have to be bought on the 
open market but the cost would be about onethird more expensive 
than purchasing surplus milk and cheese

dissident exxon corp shareholders 
dragged their chairman through a 4hour 20minute annual meeting 
on thursday challenging him to explain the companys actions in 
the nations worst oil spill 
outside about 250 demonstrators gathered peacefully listening 
to speeches by ecologist barry commoner and others three dozen 
police officers kept them from the entrance of the suburban hotel 
35 miles west of new york city where the meeting was held 
exxon chairman lawrence g rawl rejected one suggestion that he 
resign from the biggest american oil company and another suggestion 
that he put his exxon shares into a special fund for ensuring oil 
tanker safety 
but he assured stockholders that he and other exxon management 
would be part of major policy changes at the company including 
random drug testing 
i want you to know theres going to be equity rawl told 
about 1700 exxon shareholders attending the first annual meeting 
since the march 24 spill by the tanker exxon valdez we will have 
random testing of our people and of senior management including me 
exxon president lee raymond said the number of customers who had 
returned their exxon credit cards apparently in response to the 
oil spill was up to 18000 out of a total of 7 million 
as weve said before the board and all of our employees are 
profoundly sorry about the impact this major accident has had on 
the natural environment and the people who live and work in the 
region rawl told about 2000 shareholders and others 
the accident itself cannot be undone he said 
in time when the job is done im confident that it will be 
evident to every fairminded person that our employees met this 
major challenge with a high level of determination and 
professionalism 
were determined to show through deeds that we really care 
about the environment and wildlife rawl said 
rawl showed a 15minute film prepared by exxon on the march 24 
spill by the exxon valdez in alaskas prince william sound 
during a prolonged questionandanswer session afterward rawl 
rejected a suggestion that he resign made by ed rothschild of the 
activist group citizen action 
the answer is no i wont rawl said to a mixture of 
applause and boos he said his resignation would distract the 
company at a critical time 
management has to take responsibility said shareholder 
dorothy braude edinburg some heads have to fall 
some shareholders came for the excitement of potential 
confrontation between environmentalists and company management in 
fact the questioning was tough but orderly 
we expected fireworks and didnt see it said shareholder 
herbert forrest 
outside the meeting commoner a former presidential candidate 
told the crowd that the spill points out what he called us 
overreliance on fossil fuels 
we are here to pass judgment on a crime against nature and the 
american people commoner said that is the only adequate 
description for what exxon has done in alaska 
one demonstrator isabel byrd of trenton nj was dressed in 
an overstuffed tuxedo wore a pigs nose and walked on stilts she 
identified herself as a pig from exxon and said her outfit 
represented the companys corporate mentality 
we just came to say we dont have to care because were 
exxon said ms byrd were greedy and were pigs 
a federal investigation began this week into the causes of the 
spill which has fouled hundreds of miles of alaskan waters and 
coastline and killed numerous fowl and wildlife 
several pension funds with large holdings of exxon stock 
publicized their dissatisfaction earlier this month with the 
companys handling of the spill and cleanup the groups also 
demanded changes in what they called exxons inadequate state of 
preparedness for dealing with future problems and said thy would 
vote their shares against exxon management if it failed to 
adequately address those concerns 
alaska pension fund officials said they would withhold their 
650600 shares from voting to underscore the states concern about 
the spill 
the largest shareholders included pension funds from new york 
city new york state and the california public employee retirement 
system the largest individual us public pension fund 
together the funds own more than 20 million shares of exxon 
stock valued at more than 800 million amounting to less than 2 
percent of the companys total 133 billion outstanding common 
shares 
in the final tally at the meeting 9766 million shares or 778 
percent were voted in favor of electing the current slate of 
directors 
among the demands by the institutional shareholders were the 
appointment to the board of an environmental expert and the 
formation of a committee to review exxon policies on the 
environment and worker safety and health

no longer woebegone are those longing for a 
fresh dip in lake wobegon 
garrison keillor the folksy humorist and bestselling author 
whose radio program a prairie home companion warmed audiences 
for 13 years announced thursday he will be back on the radio come 
fall after a twoyear absence 
the fictional minnesota town of lake wobegon will be back in his 
new show keillor said at a news conference following his address 
to a public radio conference but the town that time forgot has 
undergone changes 
a lot of things have happened to lake wobegon its hard to 
make them into humor he said times have been hard back there 
as they have been all across the midwest 
his new twohour american radio company of the air will be 
produced by minnesota public radio and distributed by american 
public radio it will feature keillor sketches monologues and a 
mixture of american music 
keillor 46 said the music will include fats waller aaron 
copland leonard bernstein old hymns and all the great things 
that every american ought to hear at least twice 
his new program will be performed before theater audiences in 
new york st paul minn and other cities in 12show series in 
the fall of 1989 and spring 1990 it will be broadcast live 
saturday nights starting sept 30 
despite estimates that his show had a following of more than 4 
million keillor said he has about 13000 true fans while others 
talk about buttermilk biscuits and the home on the prairie 
show 
minnesota public radio spokeswoman susan jensen in st paul 
declined to comment about the differences or similarities between 
prairie home and the new show minnesota public radio produced 
his old show which was broadcast from st paul 
asked what his new show will be like keillor replied i cant 
wait to find out 
keillor joked that he and minnesota public radio officials 
talked about doing a new show as a joke and it was one of those 
jokes that got out of hand 
but he said that when he envisions himself back on stage its 
nothing but wonderful 
two years ago he announced he was leaving his fictional hometown 
of lake wobegon in order to resume the life of a shy person 
he abandoned sheila the christian jungle girl norwegian 
bachelor farmers and other lake wobegon inhabitants in an attempt 
to leave an increasing frustration with notoriety and resentment 
that accompanied his fame and fortune 
keillor also criticized the media for intruding on his privacy 
by interviewing his neighbors photographing his house and printing 
his address 
ive always been pleased if people come up and i expect them 
to and i get upset if they dont he said thursday adding 
theres a fine line that a person has to defend otherwise your 
life becomes weird 
after his last broadcast in june 1987 keillor took up residence 
in wife ulla skaerveds native denmark but he found it hard to 
work there 
i suppose that was kind of embarrassing too to have failed 
so publicly to have planted your flag so publicly and having to 
pull it out he said 
now he calls minnesota home again but has a place in manhattan 
and plans to retain his copenhagen apartment 
home is a spiritual place he said thursday and in some 
ways i feel closer to minnesota and lake wobegon living in new 
york and copenhagen 
thats how you get to know your family he quipped by 
moving away to a desirable place

more than 60 western relief workers are 
defying kidnappers and constant shellings to aid palestinian 
refugees and tens of thousands of lebanese displaced by the 
countrys 14year civil war 
but a recent spate of abductions has raised questions whether 
the risks are worth it 
some nongovernmental aid agencies have withdrawn their 
officials in recent weeks after their relief workers once 
considered immune from lebanons kidnap gangs were abducted by 
moslem militants 
on thursday the plo told four west german relief workers to 
leave a palestinian refugee camp after they refused to say who 
kidnapped some of their colleagues 
fourteen aid officials four swiss red cross officials four 
west germans an irishman a swede a norwegian a briton a 
belgian and a syrian have been abducted since 1985 
most were released after periods ranging from hours to a month 
three including a west german kidnapped twice remain missing 
along with 15 other western hostages longest held of the hostages 
is american terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press who was abducted march 16 1985 
but 20 organizations are still functioning providing badly 
needed help to a growing number of homeless people and refugees 
theres no question of us leaving said francoise derron 
spokeswoman for the international committee of the red cross 
icrc which has 13 swiss officials in moslem west beirut the 
largest foreign relief team in lebanon 
like most aid officials interviewed she declined to discuss 
security arrangements but she stressed were going to continue 
our work especially a big program of aid distribution to the 
displaced people 
more than 750000 people have fled beiruts christian and moslem 
sectors since fierce artillery and rocket battles broke out march 8 
between army commander gen michel aouns mainly christian forces 
and an alliance of syrian troops and moslem allies 
ms derron said icrc teams have distributed blankets kitchen 
sets and food parcels to 61000 people whose homes were destroyed 
by the shelling or who were forced to flee 
the red cross pulled out its 30strong team dec 21 following 
death threats from unidentified extremists but the genevabased 
organization sent a smaller team back feb 7 
the swiss terre des hommes group has not replaced three swiss 
workers it withdrew in december after the red cross pullout 
the belgianbased medicins sans frontieres withdrew its four 
belgian doctors and nurses from west beirut in december it 
replaced them with two spanish doctors last month 
belgian physician jan cools 32 who worked with the norwegian 
aid group norwac was kidnapped nearly a year ago may 21 in 
south lebanon 
a previously unknown group the soldiers of justice claimed 
it abducted him because he was a spy he remains missing 
despite cools disappearance weve never stopped working and 
well try to continue said norwac coordinator gretha jensen 
a west german team working with the asmehumanitas group in 
sidon provincial capital of south lebanon have become the most 
recent targets for extremists 
two of them administrator heinrich struebig and nurse petra 
schnitzler have been kidnapped twice in the space of two weeks 
they and colleague markus quint were first abducted may 4 near 
sidon by unidentified gunmen 
struebig and ms schnitzler were freed after a few hours 
apparently to relay a message to bonn that quint would be freed if 
a frankfurt court handed down a light sentence on lebanese shiite 
moslem mohammed ali hamadi 
hamadi on trial for taking part in the 1985 hijacking of a twa 
jetliner and the slaying of a us navy diver was convicted this 
week of air piracy and murder and sentenced to life in prison 
quint was freed after 11 days in captivity apparently after 
intervention by shiite leader nabih berri 
struebig defiantly told reporters last week we wont leave 
but he and ms schnitzler were kidnapped again may 16 with 
another colleague 28yearold male nurse thomas kemptner 
ms schnitzler was freed when moslem militiamen inadvertently 
intercepted her abductors car but the two men remain missing 
while mystery still shrouds these abductions the palestine 
liberation organization accused the germans of deliberately 
concealing their kidnappers identities and blatantly ignoring 
security precautions 
the plo which controls the refugee camps where they work asked 
them get out of south lebanon and the group said they would leave 
unlike most aid officials the 11 westerners working for the 
un relief and works agency which cares for palestinian refugees 
use bulletproof cars and move around protected by heavily armed 
lebanese bodyguards 
unrwa spokesman iman kasrawi a palestinian said the agency 
which employs 2700 palestinians and lebanese has no plans to 
evacuate its foreign staff 
two have been kidnapped and freed but british writer alec 
collett on assignment with unrwa was abducted in 1985 and his 
kidnappers claimed they killed him

mikhail gorbachev ended his landmark visit to 
china after restoring sanity to sinosoviet relations and gaining 
new marching mates on the tortuous road to socialist reform 
the first goal was accomplished tuesday when the soviet leader 
met a smiling deng xiaoping chinas supreme leader to normalize 
state and party relations after 30 years of hostility 
a long period of mutual alienation is now behind us 
gorbachev said later in a speech 
but the breathtaking scene of 1 million chinese in the streets 
clamoring for democratic reforms added an unexpected dimension to 
the first meeting of chinese and soviet leaders in three decades 
more than disrupt the summit schedule the protests appeared to 
elicit an empathy among leaders determined to carry out reform but 
beset by critical social problems 
gorbachev while refusing to take sides in chinas internal 
problems consoled the chinese by noting the turmoil he faces from 
unrest among various ethnic groups 
the soviet leader reasoned that disturbances did not represent a 
crisis for socialism but were a natural consequence of the reforms 
undertaken by both china and the soviet unionn 
glasnost and the pluralism of views have laid bare problems 
which were piling up for decades without solution popular 
aspirations often run ahead of the reforms he said 
without democratizing the economy gorbachev said 
perestroika economic reforms will never succeed 
the chinese seemed of similar opinion premier li peng in words 
partially meant for domestic consumption said china will improve 
its record on freedom democracy and human rights 
senior leader deng xiaoping the father of chinas decadeold 
marketoriented economic reforms agreed with gorbachev that the 
theories of karl marx belong to the 19th century and are not always 
applicable today 
the two sides also made it clear that democratic reforms do not 
mean multiparty rule if the party is properly supervised 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang said i believe 
that the chinese citizens can enjoy genuine democracy and freedom 
under oneparty rule 
to take into account and harmonize the various interests of 
the people under one party gorbachev added at a news conference 
we need democracy and glasnost 
gorbachev and the chinese were in somewhat less accord about the 
meaning of normalization gorbachev spoke in glowing terms 
about the potentials for trade cultural and technical exchanges 
and close consultations on international affairs 
he envisioned an ideal world in which the 4300mile sinosoviet 
boundary heavily militarized since the outbreak of fighting in 
1969 becomes a border of peace and goodneighborliness with 
all troops removed 
gorbachev also said the soviet union having opened the door to 
china hopes to become an integral member of the asian community 
he again promoted the concept of a collective security arrangement 
among asians and stressed that this is the region where the fate 
of our civilization will be played out 
the chinese were generally less positive emphasizing they will 
never return to the relationship of the 1950s when beijing was 
subservient to moscow and repeating that normal ties will not 
affect relations with other countries namely the united states 
disagreement continued over cambodia where moscowbacked 
vietnamese troops backing the government are to end their 10year 
occupation by the end of september and where beijingsupported 
khmer rouge rebels are fighting for control 
the issue took up the most space in the summits joint 
communique china reiterated its call for a coalition government 
headed by prince norodom sihanouk a moderate backed by washington 
while the soviets said only that the civil war should be settled by 
cambodians

one week after a freight train 
careened out of control killing four people and devastating a 
neighborhood survivor ramon esqueda leaned on his crutches and 
said goodbye to his ruined home 
i was 20 feet from death he said speaking in spanish 
esqueda was standing just below the railroad tracks in his back 
yard filling in a hole dug by his dogs when the southern pacific 
freight train came roaring down steep cajon pass and slammed into 
11 homes along the tracks two crewmen and two boys in a house died 
in the may 12 accident 
esqueda escaped by leaping the 6foot fence he and his family 
members had painstakingly erected after moving in just a month 
earlier in making it to safety he wrenched his back and an ankle 
federal investigators have found the braking systems on three of 
the trains six locomotives were faulty the train also apparently 
was heavier by about 3000 tons than the weight given to the crew 
the federal railroad administration said thursday that drug and 
alcohol tests were negative for the three surviving crewmen and the 
two dead trainmen 
bulldozers have torn down seven of the most severely damaged 
homes on thursday they waited to level esquedas house and the 
one next door where dossie reed 71 and her daughter tommie 
fowler 46 watched the movers hired by southern pacific to 
relocate the family 
neither family knew where it would go both are being housed in 
hotels at the expense of southern pacific which also is buying the 
houses moving residents and storing their goods until they find 
new homes 
i liked it here mrs reed said the kids were secure 
here the neighbors was all nice catch the kids doing anything 
theyd make them stop 
george greenwoods home was not badly damaged and wont be 
purchased by the railroad 
they say the worst is over the worst has just begun he 
said 
greenwoods family including a new grandchild has refused to 
return to the house and he fears he wont be able to sell now that 
the neighborhood has been marked by the accident 
i cant do anything but exactly what they want me to do 
just stay here and die he said they tore my family up 
esquedas home was knocked off its foundation by train cars and 
the roof was cracked potted rose bushes lay smashed on the ground 
the family recently had finished fixing up the house since moving 
from los angeles 50 miles to the west 
without irony esqueda explained why he chose the neighborhood 
its nice and calm 
after this were going to live in the middle of the airport 
said his nephew eric gonzalez 13 and after that in the desert 
where theyre testing the bombs 
eric whose mother and two sisters also lived in the house said 
the family was just beginning to enjoy the gray and white stucco 
home 
now like mrs reed 71 they want to stay as far away from 
trains as possible 
im still afraid she said it seems like i always hear 
train whistles or hear brakes i think this track should be 
closed 
as the families spoke the bulldozers roared mounds of potash 
spilled from the train cars was scooped into trucks pieces of 
rail protruded from the mounds of sandy mineral 
a lawyer videotaped the work his chemist assistant took a 
sample of the potash across the track sightseers took pictures of 
the twisted train cars and mangled locomotives 
the area where the homes were demolished will be planted with 
grass and left vacant to guard against future tragedies 
by nightfall investigator william pugh with the national 
transportation safety board reported the area was cleared and 
leveled 
it looks like its almost ready for grass he said

more than 5 million new cases of aids could 
develop during the next decade the world health organization said 
in its longestterm forecast to date 
the number of people infected by the virus but not necessarily 
having the disease could quadruple by the end of the century from 
the currently estimated 5 to 10 million people the un agency 
said thursday 
the projections are much worse than what we have experienced 
during the 1980s jonathan mann chief of whos aids program 
told the 166nation organizations annual meeting 
about 151000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have 
been reported to who to date but the agency estimates the actual 
worldwide total at about 375000 
aids is a disease in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers 
mann said up to 1 million new aids cases and 5 million 
infections with the virus could be prevented in the 1990s by 
pressing the global campaign for safe practices by highrisk groups 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth

the united states has succeeded in 
turning latin american governments against one of their own 
panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
the move has given hope to his opponents with one opposition 
leader saying pressure by the organization of american states could 
help topple noriega by sparking an explosion from within the 
military 
the oas action wednesday to condemn noriega was an important 
victory for the new bush administration which inherited former 
president reagans yearlong confrontation with the tough panamanian 
despot who the us government accuses of drug trafficking and 
political repression 
it is no longer a fight between the northern giant and noriega 
but between noriega and his peers who now consider him a problem 
after he threw out the results of the may 7 presidential elections 
widely believed won by the opposition 
in a quick maneuver wednesday the united states squeezed a 
resolution out of the oas condemning noriega for causing the 
current political crisis and practically telling him he must 
recognize the oppositions electoral victory 
foreign ministers from three latin american countries are to 
visit panama next week to promote conciliation and a national 
accord to bring about a transfer of power in the shortest 
possible time 
in diplomatic terms they are making the general an offer they 
know he cannot accept and forcing him to face the alternative 
diplomatic and political sanctions 
the sanctions would mean almost total isolation from other latin 
countries and most likely additional economic sanctions by the 
united states they could also mean credit restrictions and other 
financial curtailments from european and asian countries already 
upset by the heavyhanded way the government annulled an election 
noriega says he has become a target of us wrath because he 
opposes alleged us designs to maintain control of the panama 
canal and to keep its military installations in panama beyond the 
year 2000 
internally noriega has little to worry about from an opposition 
that although powerful in votes does not have the resources or 
will to rebel against a general who retains the loyalty of the 
panamanian defense forces a welltrained and disciplined 
organization of 15000 
opposition vice presidential candidate ricardo arias admitted 
domestic opposition could not oust noriega but he expressed hope 
that actions such as the oas resolution would help increase the 
pressure and create the atmosphere that would result in an 
explosion from within 
he was referring to the oppositions hopes for a coup detat by 
disaffected members of the military 
the united states has done its share to create the 
atmosphere by sending 1900 soldiers to beef up panama canal 
security and protect us lives interests and property it 
also evacuated us dependents from panama thus removing millions 
of dollars from the local economy 
the roman catholic church which also opposes noriega and 
criticized the annullment of the elections expressed hopes the oas 
action would help solve the problem 
the expression of the oas will not solve our problems but it 
may lead to the circumstances in which it is easier to solve 
them said panama archibishop marcos mcgrath 
but the general still has at least two options 
he can call for the formation of a constituent assembly to 
govern panama after sept 1 when the current governments term 
ends or he can negotiate with the opposition and perhaps try to 
divide it 
some noreiga supporters already are asking for talks with the 
opposition 
some latin american sources admitted privately they were not 
happy with the oas resolution which they said could be considered 
interventionist one of the organizations principles prohibits 
meddling in members affairs 
but for now the us can stop being the big bully and let its 
oas partners carry on the fight against the panamanian strongman

aids is being seen more and more often among drug 
abusers the national centers for disease control reported 
homosexual and bisexual men still account for most aids cases in 
the united states the cdc reported thursday that they made up 63 
percent of the aids cases reported last year that was down from 70 
percent in 1987 and 72 percent in 1985 the cdc said in an 
analysis of aids in the united states 
meanwhile the proportion of adult or adolescent men with 
intravenous drug abuse as their lone aids risk factor jumped from 
14 percent in 1987 to 20 percent in 1988 
the percentage of cases listing both homosexual activity and 
drug abuse was 8 percent in 1987 7 percent in 1988 
in the agencys latest monthly aids statistics 56783 of the 
nations 94280 reported aids cases were homosexual or bisexual 
men 18819 were drug abusers and 6620 were both 
although 91 percent of the adult aids cases reported since 1982 
have been males drug use is a strong factor among the number of 
female aids cases as well 
the percentage of drug use among female adult and adolescent 
aids patients decreased from 60 percent in 1984 to 49 percent in 
1987 but rose again to 53 percent last year 
by the end of 1988 3589 heterosexually acquired aids cases had 
been reported to the cdc the majority 65 percent or 2340 
were in people who reported sex with highrisk partners 
the agency also noted that blacks and hispanics still have 
suffered a disproportionately large share of the burden of aids in 
the united states us blacks have an aids rate of 84 cases per 
100000 people and hispanics have a rate of 73 cases per 100000 
compared to 26 for whites and 14 percent for asians and pacific 
islanders 
the racial distribution of cases has remained stable over 
time with few exceptions the cdc said

after a week of testing failed to 
uncover any pcbs in us fuels being trucked into this southcentral 
canadian province environmental officials have scaled down border 
checks for the toxic chemical 
environment canada department officials said thursday they are 
reducing the number of roadside inspections at hightraffic border 
towns immediately 
the analyses that weve got for saskatchewan show no pcbs 
said don waite acting manager of environmental protection for the 
saskatchewan branch of the department 
bryan armstrong of environment canadas office in edmonton said 
tests on eight alberta samples and three manitoba samples also 
showed no presence of pcbs there was no immediate word on whether 
testing there will be cut back 
in saskatchewan four staffers were sent last week to north 
portal a border crossing 140 miles southeast of this provincial 
capital the action followed reports that millions of gallons of 
hazardous chemicals had been mixed with fuel in the united states 
and shipped illegally to canada since 1987 
the investigators stopped all fuel trucks entering the province 
and took roadside samples for testing 
since may 11 the department has tested 42 samples of gasoline 
diesel fuel and heating oil for the presence of pcbs 
polychlorinated biphenyls but so far no traces have been detected 
pcbs primarily used as an insulator in electrical equipment 
have been linked with cancer and were banned in canada in 1977 as 
well as in the united states by illegally mixing pcbladen wastes 
into fuels expensive disposal fees can be avoided 
the department said it will continue to perform random spot 
checks at north portal and will consider further tests at gas 
stations around the province 
armstrong said the problem of illegal shipments appears to be 
restricted to central canada 
but last week andrew porterfield a researcher for the 
washington dcbased center for investigative reporting told a 
vancouver radio station that fuel laced with hazardous wastes has 
been brought up through idaho and illegally dumped in british 
columbia and alberta

a man convicted in the murder of a 
smalltown police chief was executed in georgias electric chair 
despite frantic appeals by lawyers who claimed he was denied a fair 
trial because of racism 
henry willis iii 36 was strapped into the electric chair at 
the georgia diagnostic and classification center shortly after 11 
pm thursday he was pronounced dead 20 minutes later 
he was sentenced to death for his part in the feb 11 1976 
slaying of ray city police chief ed giddens the 29yearold chief 
was abducted and shot the day before he was to leave the force to 
manage orange groves in florida 
the chiefs son bill giddens said he felt relieved after the 
execution 
its a burden thats removed its something ive waited on 
for years its something i never thought would come true 
giddens said 
willis was the 14th person executed in georgia and the 109th in 
the nation since the us supreme court allowed the death penalty 
to be reinstated in 1976 
in their appeals willis attorneys claimed he did not receive a 
fair trial because blacks were excluded from the jury that 
convicted him 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals delayed the execution for 
four hours but the appeals court and the us supreme court agreed 
with a lower court judge who said willis lawyers had failed to 
prove their claims 
millard farmer willis attorney met with the condemned man 
shortly after the supreme court ruling he said willis appeared 
resigned to his fate and deeply regretted the slaying 
willis was led into the death chamber by six guards and sat 
rigidly in the heavy wooden chair while they strapped him in he 
glanced briefly at farmer but showed no emotion before a mask was 
placed over his face 
willis was one of three men convicted in giddens death the 
death sentence of another defendant has been stayed by a federal 
court the third defendant was sentenced to life in prison 
giddens was abducted after he stopped a car matching one used in 
a robbbery he was taken to a swamp where he begged for mercy he 
was shot once while running away and again in the face before being 
thrown into the swamp according to testimony

the ruble is fast becoming a secondrate currency 
in the soviet union with more people insisting on foreign money 
for their services or bartering for products in short supply 
salaries have been rising but state stores remain so poorly 
supplied that a scrap of 1950sstyle linoleum is sold by lottery 
only with plenty of rubles around but the nations hardpressed 
industry producing little the ruble has less and less purchasing 
power 
the soviet union has long been a place where foreign currency is 
highly valued and barter is a common practice a pack of foreign 
cigarettes works better than soviet cash to convince a taxi driver 
to accept a customer and a bottle of vodka has legendary 
persuasive powers 
but a 60percent crash since last autumn in the black market 
value of the ruble is testimony that the rubles worth is declining 
faster than ever 
the street rate casually offered to tourists has fallen from 25 
cents eight months ago to 10 cents a ruble now compared to the 
official rate of 156 the exchange rate among soviets themselves 
is as little as 6 cents for a ruble 
the soviet space agency glavkosmos recently infuriated soviet 
journalists by selling a seat on a forthcoming space mission to a 
japanese reporter for the hardcurrency equivalent of 113 million 
alas we get our pay in ordinary soviet rubles and cant pay 
for the flight in convertible currency which glavkosmos needs so 
badly a columnist in pravda complained 
many of the new cooperative private businesses permitted in the 
soviet union are obtaining permission to collect valuta as 
hard currency is called in russian 
even the hijackers who recently threatened to blow up a busload 
of schoolchildren in ordzhonikidze if they werent given a plane to 
israel demanded their ransom in foreign cash 
in moscow foreign companies like christian dior are setting up 
joint ventures that serve customers only for hard currency this 
has left citizens fuming especially when plans were announced for 
a new pharmacy that would sell lifesaving drugs right in their 
midst but only for valuta 
it is still technically illegal for most soviets even to possess 
foreign money but clerks even in government hardcurrency stores 
are increasingly ignoring the origin of customers hard currency 
for many soviets hardcurrency and barter transactions are the 
only way to get things they want and need 
we work but what do we get for it complained one 
muscovite if i want to use my money to buy a tv set there 
arent any i have to wait six months 
only 23 of 211 basic food items are readily available in 
markets without using personal connections ration cards or paying 
a bribe according to a survey reported by economist vasili 
selyunin in the newspaper socialisticheskaya industria 
that was in april before sugar rationing started in moscow and 
before salt and matches joined laundry detergent and ordinary soap 
on the list of hardtofind items coffee has long disappeared from 
the shelves of official stories in leningrad even that staple of 
russian winters tea is missing 
in the krasnoyarsk region 1850 miles east of moscow farmers 
have been resorting to oldfashioned barter meat for boots 
in moscow audio cassettes and videotapes that cost a few 
dollars in the west are virtual alternative currencies worth 
multiples of their dollar price 
elsewhere on the black market a leather jacket brings more then 
2000 rubles on the blackmarketinfested streets around 
leningrads touristclogged palaces or more than 8 months pay for 
the average soviet 
demand for dollars is also skyrocketing according to a 
leningrad blackmarketeer because thousands of soviets are taking 
advantage of newly relaxed border controls to travel abroad 
some soviets are seeking inflation hedges in a nation that has 
almost none newspapers report shoppers lining up in front of 
jewelry stores to buy gold that is grossly overpriced by world 
standards simple gold chains cost 749 
the few soviets lucky enough to own their homes on land leased 
from the state are sitting on gold mines one lithuanian family 
figures the unusally fine 6room stone house they bought 10 years 
ago is now worth more than three times their purchase price 
there have been calls in the upstart baltic republics for the 
right to create their own currency partly as a sign of 
independence from moscow but also because they believe their more 
efficient economies will be able to support an internationally 
convertible currency

a state lawmaker says he is relieved two men 
have been arrested in connection with 13 bombs planted around town 
last summer but he may never rest easy again 
the largest bomb 52 sticks of dynamite was found under a 
stairwell behind state rep frank newkirk jrs law office 
although no bombs were found at his home newkirk said he always 
feared for his wife and their four children 
every night i still walk around the house with a flashlight to 
make sure theres nothing out there he said thursday thats 
probably a habit ill never end 
john m hubbard iii a 31yearold factory worker and gerald 
conrad a 42yearold coworker were arrested wednesday accused 
of planting explosives targeted at newkirk 32 who also is the 
mayors son 
they were indicted thursday on federal charges of possession of 
stolen dynamite conspiracy making bombs and attempting to destroy 
roads and buildings in this southern indiana community of 6000 
hubbard and conrad are being held in indianapolis 
the bombs were planted around salem under bridges and behind 
buildings three of the bombs fizzled none of the 13 exploded 
authorities have declined to speculate on a motive but a 
criminal complaint filed in federal court described hubbard as a 
lifelong rival of newkirks 
newkirk and hubbard were in the same cub scout pack and competed 
for leading roles in high school plays 
if there was a rivalry it was in johns mind newkirk said 
i understand maybe he wanted to achieve some of the things i 
had 
newkirk a democrat said the two men disagreed on politics and 
sometimes debated issues when they happened to pass on the 
sidewalk john believed government was too involved in peoples 
lives newkirk said 
the relationship between newkirk and hubbard dates back to their 
scout pack which was led by newkirks father 
my father really liked john the younger newkirk said 
john was overweight and i was overweight too my father realized 
how cruel children can be about things like that and i think my 
father kind of went out of his way to look after john 
newkirk said hubbard once complained about losing out to newkirk 
in leading roles in high school plays 
newkirk a former deputy prosecutor who was first elected to the 
legislature in 1984 said he became suspicious of hubbard about two 
weeks after the bombs were found 
he and his wife denise were working in a booth at a county 
fair when they ran into hubbard 
after a while he began to talk about the bombings newkirk 
said he had a lot of information he told me where the bombs 
were located what the dynamite would do if it were exposed to fire 
and what would have happened if the bombs had gone off 
newkirk took that information to state police 
hubbards mother opal kramer said thursday she was not 
surprised her son was able to talk specifically about the bombs 
everybody in town was talking about the bombings said mrs 
kramer who has taught kindergarten in salem for 23 years the 
pictures were very vivid on tv and in the papers 
she described her son as a vocal opinionated intelligent man 
who liked guns but would not harm anyone unless hes under the 
influence and i dont know that he would harm anyone then 
she said hubbard had been hospitalized for about a month for 
alcohol abuse treatment earlier this year

a federal judge has lifted the ban on 
logging large tracts of virgin forest but chastised the agency that 
administers them for failing to plan for the protection of a rare 
owl 
in a major defeat for environmentalists us district judge 
helen frye ruled thursday against challenges to the bureau of land 
managements timber sales plans for the forests of western oregon 
pending any further appeals by the environmentalists the blm 
said the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feet 
of timber that has been tied up in legal challenges since last 
summer 
frye said the agencys decision not to update the timber plans 
was arbitrary and capricious in light of the new significant 
and probably accurate information that the planned logging of 
spotted owl habitat raises uncertainty about the ability of the 
spotted owl to survive as a species 
nevertheless her hands were tied by an amendment to a budget 
resolution in congress that prohibits challenges to the agencys 
plans frye said 
the amendment was pushed through congress by sen mark hatfield 
rore 
at this point it appears that sen hatfields legal 
shenanigans that placed the blm above the law have worked said 
andy kerr conservation director for the oregon natural resources 
council a coplaintiff in the case 
fryes ruling lifted an injunction that had prohibited the 
logging of oldgrowth forests within 21 miles of spotted owl nests 
the injunction grew out of a lawsuit brought by the resources 
council the portland audubon society and other environmental 
groups 
kerr said the groups would appeal the ruling while pushing for 
the listing of the spotted owl under the engangered species act by 
the us fish and wildlife service which estimates there are 2000 
to 3000 pairs of the species left in the northwest 
ed ciliberti spokesman for the blm said his agency would be 
unable to proceed with the timber sales until fry signs a summary 
judgment and said the threatened species recommendation could 
force the blm to reconsider its plans 
i think frankly were pleased that shes ruled the way she 
has he said but i think a substantial statement will have to 
wait until our lawyers review the opinion 
a timber industry representative said it was too soon for his 
side to celebrate 
we need to figure out what the ruling means before we can 
start dancing said jim geisinger president of the northwest 
forestry 
the continuing budget resolution passed by congress prohibits 
a judicial challenge to existing timber management plans but 
allows a judicial challenge to particular blm activities on a 
casebycase sitespecific basis frye wrote in her 73page 
opinion 
she noted that the audubon societys challenge does not seek 
judicial review of an activity of the blm based on sitespecific 
new information such as the discovery of a bald eagle nest or an 
archaeological find or a blow down of timber on a particular sale 
location 
they cant challenge our management plans they have to 
challenge individual sales ciliberti said 
frye had dismissed the lawsuit in april 1988 but last june the 
9th circuit court of appeals issued an injunction and as a result 
the blm had to cut its planned timber offerings for the year by one 
third 
the appeals court returned the case to frye who issued a 
preliminary injunction feb 9 that reaffirmed the logging ban

legislators in lithuania and estonia have passed 
laws in defiance of the kremlin in which the two baltic republics 
will gain more control over their natural resources and 
nonmilitary economies 
the laws approved thursday in those restive republics take 
effect in 1990 similar measures similar are being considered in 
latvia the third baltic republic 
lithuanias law includes provisions for printing its own money 
and estonias allows limited ownership of private property 
in lithuania the supreme soviet also declared the tiny republic 
sovereign an official in lithuanias foreign ministry said 
the laws fly in the face of recommendations from a moscow 
commission on how much freedom the soviet unions 15 republics 
should have 
the commissions proposed law would leave control over energy 
and at least half of heavy industry as well as all defense 
production in the hands of moscow bureaucrats it also would 
prohibit republics from printing their own money 
geidrius cekuolis first secretary of the lithuanian foreign 
ministry said in a telephone interview from the capital vilnius 
that the republics law was passed without amendments after several 
hours of debate he did not know the final vote 
he said the law granting lithuania general sovereignty passed by 
a large margin 
the law specifies that national soviet laws are valid in 
lithuania only if they are approved by the lithuanian parliament 
effectively claiming the republic can veto kremlin decisions 
the estonian supreme soviet passed a similar law in november 
moscow authorities pronounced the law invalid but the estonian 
parliament stood by its decision and considers the sovereignty law 
in force 
the new estonian law contradicts the soviet constitution on 
several points including its provision allowing limited private 
ownership of property estonias prime minister indrek toome said 
in a recent television interview that estonian authorities will 
have to ask moscow to invalidate some articles of the constitution 
the estonian law declares that within limits set by the law 
smallscale private property is allowed in a similar vein the 
lithuanian law provides for the economically necessary 
introduction of plots of land for perpetual use with the right of 
inheritance 
president mikhail s gorbachev has proposed leasing for up to 50 
years or more but the communist party leadership has explicitly 
rejected private ownership which is antithetical to communist 
ideology 
the laws specify that foreigners may own property in estonia and 
lithuania and they encourage foreign investment and trade 
in its law estonia claims full control over its land water 
air space forests and other natural resources all industry 
except defenserelated factories are to be put under control of 
local authorities according to the law 
the lithuanian provision says the republic can introduce its 
own money system with independent banks and that it can if 
necessary print its own state obligations stocks and other 
valuable papers

scattered fighting was reported 
today between loyal and mutinous troops in northern ethiopia in a 
rebellion the countrys marxist leader said had been crushed 
president mengistu haile mariam told the nation on radio and 
television late thursday that the situation in the northernmost 
province of eritrea was under full control 
but diplomatic sources in the capital said loyal and dissident 
units of ethiopias 2nd army clashed today in and around the 
provincial capital of asmara three days after the mutiny began 
it is not under control said one western diplomat 
obviously the whole situation is very fluid 
the revolt is the most serious challenge to mengistus 15year 
rule in ethiopia which is the soviet unions closest ally in 
africa 
the diplomat who like his colleagues spoke only on condition 
that he not be identified said at least six rebellious generals 
were killed in the factional fighting including the 2nd armys 
commander 
i think mengistu may be getting it in hand he said but i 
dont think hes quite as firmly back in the saddle as his 
statement last night would indicate 
the 150000strong 2nd army nearly half the countrys entire 
armed forces had been considered in full opposition to mengistu 
thursdays fighting between rival factions within the unit 
represented what the diplomat called a dramatic turn 
its pretty obvious now that while the insurgents held asmara 
they did not fully control units outside the provincial 
capital the diplomat said 
he said the counterrevolt was led by the 102 paratroop brigade 
the 3rd mechanized brigade and the 2nd tank brigade all units 
based in other eritrean cities 
an african diplomat in addis ababa said other army units based 
outside the capital had been outwardly neutral in the revolt but 
now appeared to be swinging toward the government 
in his first public comment since returning wednesday from an 
abbreviated trip to east germany mengistu blamed the uprising on 
a few generals who placed their greed and hunger for power 
above the national interest 
he said thursday that his revolutionary forces will 
liquidate the mutineers 
a few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd army 
the eritrean peoples liberation front eplf declared it was 
temporarily suspending its 28year war of secession to support the 
rebellious soldiers 
the western diplomat said the factional fighting appeared to 
have been caused by a backlash against the rapprochement with the 
eplf 
the rebels control threefourths of the countryside in eritrea 
and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities 
including asmara 
mengistu inherited the northern civil war when he and a clique 
of army officers deposed emperor haile selassie on sept 12 1974 
eritrea is a former italian colony that was federated with 
ethiopia in 1957 under a ussponsored un resolution haile 
selassie annexed the territory in 1962

with no end to the walkout that has hobbled 
education in the nations secondlargest school system this week 
substitute teacher chris farmer keeps smiling at striking teachers 
but they dont smile back 
and the juniors and seniors who showed up thursday at his john 
marshall high school classroom were a pretty listless bunch 
one girl thumbed through bridal guide magazine a youth read 
coma a paperback thriller three students sat with headphones 
in their ears several students answered questions from a stack of 
trivial pursuit game cards 
its pretty painful really farmer said theyre a good 
group of kids they just want something to do 
the scene was typical of the 600 schools in the los angeles 
unified school district where 2237 substitutes who crossed the 
picket lines for a special daily wage of 167 are coping with the 
workload of 22000 striking teachers 
student attendance has declined steadily since the strike began 
monday of the 551759 students enrolled this quarter 283620 were 
counted thursday down from 329371 on monday 
the first formal contract talks in months between the striking 
teachers union and the school district took place thursday both 
sides agreed not to comment to reporters 
farmer tall and gangly with wirerimmed glasses is an 
erstwhile substitute teacher who doubles as a contract worker at 
the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena with no current contract 
at the lab he has worked every day since the strike by the united 
teacherslos angeles union began 
farmer was one of 22 substitute teachers supplementing 17 
marshall faculty members who worked thursday despite the strike 
the staff normally includes 139 teachers 
marshall is an ornate stone building that has been used as a 
backdrop for countless movies commercials and television shows 
including wildcats grease and room 222 
in 1987 a team from the school won the national academic 
decathlon a point of pride for principal donald hahn 
one of the things the substitutes like about marshall is that 
its a good school said bill pitkin a biology teacher who began 
picketing at 530 am thursday 
his pride in the school was mixed with bitterness about 
substitutes whom he views as strikebreakers 
theres one substitute in there whos an exceptional teacher 
hes taught some of my biology classes but we wont ever call 
for him as a substitute again pitkin said 
teachers who currently earn salaries of 23440 to 43319 are 
seeking a 26 percent pay increase over three years the district is 
offering them a 215 percent increase over three years 
a little more than half of marshalls enrollment of 2780 
students was counted in attendance thursday farmer at first 
counted 26 students in his class although another dozen or so 
trickled in over the next two hours and one bored student walked 
out 
there are no science teachers and few math teachers the 
principal said and many classes are lumped together 
administrators have scheduled three twohour classes a day instead 
of the usual six onehour periods 
the beginning of the strike was chaos hahn said but the 
longer it goes the better its going to be for us because were 
getting more and more teachers each day 
still the shortage of teachers has all but brought education to 
a halt 
students enrolled in math analysis trigonometry and algebra 
find themselves in one room listening to a lesson that many find 
incomprehensible and others see as too elementary 
its kindergarten work said senior alexandra cervantes 18 
the substitute teachers she said are just sitting there 
looking pretty and getting paid a hundredandsixtywhatever 
dollars a day 
specialized programs also are suffering said wanda fuhrmann a 
striking special education teacher 
the blind students are coming to school and some are doing 
ok and some are bouncing off the walls she said 
farmer tried to keep the students in his class busy by asking 
them to write a haiku a threeline poem of 17 syllables 
one student responded 
turmoil in the air 
one against the other one

the us dollar held steady in calm european 
trading this morning following a day of erratic trading marked by 
central bank intervention 
gold prices fell 
dealers said the dollar remained wellsupported from a 
fundamental point of view with large institutional investors 
attracted by relatively high us interest rates that show no signs 
of being lowered 
this dollarbuying would be balanced by profittaking they 
said but most agreed that the dollar would be unlikely to drop 
sharply in future 
some predicted the central banks would intervene if the dollar 
hit the 19700 german mark level 
on thursday the us unit was boosted by news that the west 
german bundesbanks central bank council had decided to leave its 
key interest rates unchanged and by a rise in us consumer prices 
but a wave of concerted intervention started the dollar on its 
downward move to its late levels 
in london today the dollar rose against the british pound it 
cost 16179 to buy one pound cheaper than 16180 late thursday

uss duluth capsized today during naval exercises off northeastern 
australia drowning a us marine and injuring two others the us 
embassy said 
fiftytwo people including an australian were thrown into the 
water when the small craft overturned off shoalwater bay 745 miles 
north of sydney according to an embassy statement australian 
defense sources said nine inflatable zodiac boats carrying five 
people each were involved 
embassy spokesman arthur lefkowitz said marines from the uss 
duluth an amphibious transport dock ship were being put ashore 
when the accident occurred 
they were making a landing and apparently the surf was heavier 
than they anticipated or the winds were wrong lefkowitz said 
several of the boats overturned in the surf dumping all the 
marines aboard into the water 
the embassy said the military exercises were suspended 
temporarily after the accident the exercises codenamed valiant 
usher started monday and involve seven us and australian ships 
and 5000 marines and sailors 
the embassy said helicopters from the duluth and the uss bellau 
wood buzzed the accident site but rough seas and overcast weather 
hampered the rescue effort 
the identity of the dead marine was witheld pending notification 
of relatives but lefkowitz said the marines were based at camp 
pendleton in southern california 
australian defense sources said the marine drowned when the 
inflatable craft overturned in rough conditions 
the americans are dealing with the injured themselves they 
have not told us very much about it said an official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
lefkowitz said the marines were wearing life jackets at the 
time he described the injuries as minor and said the injured 
marines were being treated on board the duluth the other us 
ships taking part in the exercise are the belleau wood germantown

teachers entered their fifth day of a walkout 
today demanding a chunk of the states newly announced tax surplus 
in their negotiations with the nations secondlargest school 
district 
neither the district nor the teachers would discuss with 
reporters what progress had been made in talks held thursday night 
there are going to be some meetings on our side in the morning 
and some meetings on their side in the morning and well be back 
tomorrow united teacherslos angeles president wayne johnson 
said after the talks at a downtown hotel broke up around midnight 
more than 22000 teachers are on strike with about 11000 
remaining teachers and substitutes crossing picket lines at the 
citys 600 schools 
only 283620 of the los angeles unified school districts 
551759 students attended classes thursday school officials said 
a state factfinders report this week concluded that no 
additional money was available for teachers salaries beyond the 
districts offer of a 215 percent raise over three years 
but confusion over the salary issue arose after gov george 
deukmejian announced wednesday that the state expects to receive an 
extra 25 billion windfall in unanticipated tax revenues over the 
next two years 
according to the terms of the states proposition 98 virtually 
all revenue above an expenditure limit is to be given to schools 
the los angeles district reportedly could receive 120 million 
to 228 million of that money but board of education president 
roberta weintraub said the district could not improve its wage 
offer because it had no assurances it would get the additional 
funds 
johnson encouraged by the windfall report immediately raised 
the unions wage demand from 21 percent over two years to 26 
percent over three years including a 10 percent retroactive boost 
for the first year the teachers have been working without a 
contract since september 
it is not acceptable weintraub said we will not even 
consider a 10 percent firstyear raise 
if they stand firm the unions strike is going to continue 
johnson said he dismissed the factfinder report saying its 
author did not know about the extra state money 
ms weintraub said the district might offer a 24 percent raise 
over three years with 8 percent for each year if we get the 
money from the windfall 
the strike is the districts first since a 23day walkout in 
1970 
teachers annual salaries range from 23440 to 43319 with the 
high end of the scale for those with doctorates 98 extra course 
units and 19 years experience

marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers 
can cause disruptions of normal functions 
ileto a retired vice chief of staff and former defense 
minister said the 160000member armed forces was capable of 
quelling any unrest by marcos supporters

students at a taiwanese university pledged 
their support today for chinese students whose hunger strike for 
democracy in beijing has won widespread backing in mainland china 
you are our brothers said a statement signed by all 12000 
students at the national chengkung university although you do 
not know us personally please remember that we are with you all 
the time 
the students at chengkung an engineering university said they 
regretted thousands of chinese students have had to treat 
themselves in such a harsh way to gain a brighter future for 
china 
student leaders from chengkung and 19 other taiwanese 
universities were scheduled to meet later today to discuss ways to 
support the chinese students who began their hunger strike in 
beijings tiananmen square on may 13 
the hunger strike is the largest show of defiance in 40 years of 
communist rule on the china mainland the chinese government today 
issued an order effective at midnight forbidding demonstrations 
on wednesday the ruling nationalist party said it would provide 
support through various channels to the prodemocracy student 
demonstrators it did not elaborate 
a major taiwanese newspaper the united daily news said in a 
dispatch from beijing that the chinese students have declined any 
medical or other assistance from taiwan to avoid a crackdown on 
their movement by chinese authorities 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan in 1949 when they lost a 
civil war on the mainland are still technically at war with the 
chinese communists 
they continue to reject any official contacts with the 
communists although they have adopted a more flexible policy the 
past two years that allows taiwanese and chinese to exchange visits 
and trade through third countries

the government is considering 
lifting the nearly threeyearold national state of emergency when 
it expires next month because antigovernment protest has subsided 
information minister stoffel van der merwe said 
the government is considering thoroughly all aspects of the 
security system in the country in order to decide whether the 
emergency should be reimposed or not he said thursday on state 
televisions evening newscast 
the fact that things are fairly normal there are not so many 
people dying in these days is not necessarily a full conclusion 
that we dont need security arrangements 
although van der merwe made no promises it appeared significant 
that the issue of lifting the emergency was the first item 
mentioned on the evening news 
van der merwe has said in the past that when the government 
wants to make a significant policy change it prepares the public 
for it by opening discussion on the issue 
president pw botha declared the national emergency on june 12 
1986 saying regular laws were insufficient to deal with widespread 
violence in black townships protest rallies and unrest against the 
governments apartheid laws 
under apartheid the black majority of 28 million has no say in 
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and 
have separate housing districts and schools 
bothas decrees under the emergency allow police nearly 
unrestricted power to detain people indefinitely without charge 
close newspapers ban meetings rallies and church services and 
outlaw organizations 
individuals also may be prohibited from speaking in public and 
criticism against the government police and the army can be banned 
monitoring groups say at least 30000 people were detained 
without charge under the emergency hundreds were freed following a 
hunger strike among detainees earlier this year and an estimated 
50 people still are being held 
van der mewe said the government could soften some criticism by 
lifting the state of emergency which has been condemned by 
governments and human rights organizations around the world 
but he said you cannot afford to let society lapse into 
disorder again in order just to avoid criticism

about 30 fossilized dinosaur teeth 
found near tucumcari are estimated to be 220 million years old 
meaning the creature was one of the first of its kind to inhabit 
the earth 
this is of worldwide importance because it is so rare said 
adrian hunt a doctoral candidate at the university of new mexico 
hunt who made the discoveries during four years of explorations 
for the new mexico museum of natural history said thursday the 
shape of the animals teeth indicate it was one of the first 
dinosaurs on earth 
he named the animal revueltosaurus callenderi after the new 
mexico museums director jon callender the first part of the name 
referred to a spanish word for revolution revuelta 
the discoveries are discussed in a book published this week 
titled dawn of the age of dinosaurs in the american southwest 
edited by hunt and museum paleontologist spencer lucas 
lucas said it was the first new genus of dinosaur discovered in 
new mexico since 1923 and the first new dinosaur species found in 
the state in nearly 30 years were breaking a lot of new ground 
after a long dry spell he said 
found with the teeth were fossils of many early ancestors to 
mammals turtles crocodiles flying reptiles and birds several of 
which have yet to be identified hunt said 
tucumcari is in eastern new mexico about 30 miles from the texas 
border 
the area is an incredible graveyard of ancient animals 
lucas said 
the authors conclusions have yet to be reviewed by scientific 
peers 
their theory is that revueltosaurus was the ancestor of all the 
planteating dinosaurs including stegosaurus it resembles a 
10footlong lizard with 3foot hind legs that permitted it to walk 
nearly upright it had much smaller forelegs 
the oldest previous north america fossil also dating back some 
220 million years was unearthed several years ago in west texas 
dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found in africa 
and the mediterranean

gen manuel antonio noriega made his 
first public appearance since the nullified may 7 elections before 
a cheering crowd but he had nothing to say about his countrys 
crisis or his future plans 
noriega was greeted with roars and chants by the more than 1200 
military government and party workers who gathered thursday night 
but he gave no speech and made few comments to reporters 
im fine panamas de facto ruler said repeatedly when asked 
how he had held up in the tensionfilled weeks since may 7 
when asked how much longer he could go on he laughed and said 
thats a good question 
the elections were nullified by a government tribunal even as 
international observers said opposition candidate guillermo endara 
was leading noriegas handpicked candidate 31 
noriega commander of the panamanian defense forces has been 
accused of ordering the beatings of opposition candidates may 10 
at the rally noriega supporters watched a series of traditional 
music and dance mixed with antiamerican skits poetry and a 
recitation of us interventions in panama 
with noriega to the year 2000 signs declared members of 
the crowd said they were members of the government party or 
government workers or both 
we came voluntarily we werent forced said one woman who 
refused to give her name but said she worked in a hospital laundry 
in colon 50 miles north of panama city she said she was bused in 
after work 
she and her friends joined in a chant of noriega for sure 
hit the yankees hard which rhymes in spanish 
noriega was pursued by a pack of journalists as he left the 
convention center but did little more than smile in reply to 
repeated requests for a message to bush or to the organization of 
american states 
bush and the oas have condemned election fraud and repression 
and the oas is sending a committee of foreign ministers to report 
on the situation in panama 
news media run by the noriega regime denounced wednesday nights 
oas resolution condemning noriega 
in an interview with wbai radio early thursday in new york 
noriega declared that the united states was persecuting panama 
because we are black 
in other interview comments noriega repeated his frequent 
assertions that the us embassy in panama is misinforming the 
white house and that the united states was engaged in aggression 
noriega was indicted on drug smuggling and money laundering 
charges in florida in february 1988 washington and the local 
opposition since then have mounted a concerted campaign against him 
to no avail 
noriega denies the drug accusations he and his supporters 
contend the united states has slandered him as part of a scheme to 
renege on its commitments under the 1977 panama canal treaties 
the pacts oblige washington to hand over complete control of the 
waterway to panama on dec 31 1999

the legal ordeal is over for a father who 
disconnected his comatose son from a respirator and held him until 
he died but the act of desperation reveals a gap in laws dealing 
with euthanasia experts said 
a grand jury refused thursday to indict rudy linares on a 
firstdegree murder charge for the april 26 death of his 
15monthold son samuel 
linares 23 pulled a 357caliber magnum handgun on hospital 
staff and kept them at bay while taking his son off a respirator 
and cradling the boy in his arms until the severely braindamaged 
toddler died 
he said he did it because i loved my son the child had been 
in a coma since august when he accidentally swallowed a balloon 
cutting off oxygen to his brain 
linares pleaded guilty thursday to a misdemeanor charge of 
unlawful use of a weapon and was sentenced by circuit judge robert 
bastone to one year conditional discharge meaning he will serve no 
time in jail 
bastone told him to get a psychological evaluation and consider 
counseling 
as far as punishment is concerned i think you have suffered 
enough the judge said at a brief hearing 
im glad its more or less behind me now linares said i 
want to thank everybody that sent me cards letters their prayers 
moral support 
linares a house painter from cicero had been charged with 
murder but after the grand jury action the states attorneys 
office said it would not prosecute the charge 
authorities say linares also had unhooked his sons lifesupport 
system during a december visit but that staff members immediately 
reattached the boys ventilator and did not notify police 
groups that back legislation to support parents and other 
relatives in such cases applauded the grand jurys decision 
everybody is really relieved for mr linares said fenella 
rouse legal director for the new yorkbased society for the right 
to die its the right decision im very glad hell be able to 
get back to some relative privacy 
ms rouse said laws and court precedents at the federal and 
state levels protect parents and doctors in disconnecting life 
support when children are in irreversible comas 
this wasnt a gray area she said 
prosecutors the hospital and linares lawyers disagreed 
public defender kevin smith said congress and state legislatures 
must draft laws to govern such cases 
the criminal courts are not where this should be dealt with 
he said there should be an orderly way that a family dealing 
with a tragedy can end the suffering of a child or another loved 
one without being driven to an act of despair like rudy linares was 
driven 
states attorney cecil partee repeated his pledge to form a 
panel of medical legal and religious representatives to analyze 
the issues raised by the case and seek appropriate laws 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center had refused the 
familys requests to withdraw life support and welcomed prosecution 
for child abuse or murder because the youngster wasnt braindead 
serious questions remain for doctors and nurses as to how best 
to protect the rights of both our patients and their family 
members the hospital said after the hearing 
state rep thomas mccracken jr who has been involved in 
euthanasia issues in the illinois general assembly said no laws to 
clarify legal options posed by the linares case are on the horizon 
and drafting them would be very difficult 
something needs to be hammered out said mccracken an 
attorney the courts are a bad place to make public policy 
northestern university law school professor daniel polsby 
predicted prosecutors would seek charges again if faced with a 
similar case 
the one thing that the states attorney cannot allow to happen 
is an open invitation for people to start euthanizing their 
relatives polsby said

state officials and lawmakers said 
they hoped californias decision to restrict militarystyle assault 
rifles would lead other states and congress to follow suit 
the state legislature spurred by the january slayings of five 
children in a stockton schoolyard sent the governor a bill 
thursday that would make california the first state to virtually 
ban sales of rifles such as the one used in that attack 
republican gov george deukmejian has agreed to sign the measure 
into law 
we are sending ripple effects across the country attorney 
general john van de kamp said what is needed in my view is a 
national ban california on so many issues is on the cutting 
edge 
we have struck a major blow for public safety said senate 
president pro tem david roberti 
the legislature approved the bill by votes of 2711 in the 
senate and 4135 in the assembly 
this represents the culmination of a rather lengthy and 
grueling process of how we can do something to change the culture 
of violence assemblyman mike roos said 
national rifle association spokesman richard gardiner threatened 
to file a lawsuit against the measure after it takes effect next 
year 
the movement to ban the guns gained public support on jan 17 
when deranged drifter patrick purdy used a semiautomatic ak47 
rifle to kill five students and wound 29 children and a teacher on 
a stockton playground 
the legislation is the second half of a twopart package that 
would restrict sale and possession of more than 50 models of 
assault weapons including the ak47 
both bills would virtually ban the sale of the affected weapons 
after jan 1 1990 but would allow people who legally obtained the 
weapons before june 1 of this year to keep the firearms if they 
register them with the state 
it would take a special permit like those required for machine 
guns to keep an assault weapon obtained after the cutoff date 
the bills also would increase penalties for crimes committed 
using assault weapons

the us supreme court refused to 
reinstate floridas abortion consent law clearing the way for a 
15yearold girl and other minors to get abortions without 
permission of parents or a judge 
the high courts action thursday shifts the issue back to the 
florida supreme court which has said it would review the 
constitutionality of the abortion consent law in september 
she can legally have an abortion right now and until the 
florida supreme court rules again that is the law said jerri 
blair attorney for the lake county teenager who is 12 weeks 
pregnant and has been identified only as tw 
following the us supreme court action the state promptly 
moved thursday to speed up the state supreme courts review of the 
abortion consent law or allow its enforcement until that review in 
september 
under the 1988 law unmarried women younger than 18 must get 
permission from parents or a judge before getting abortions 
if the florida supreme court denies the stay it looks like 
the law will be unenforceable said assistant attorney general 
jerry curington 
in papers filed with the state justices curington argued there 
is confusion over whether the us supreme courts refusal to 
reinstate the law means it cannot be enforced statewide 
although it was struck down by only one of floridas five 
district appeals courts a 1976 precedent apparently means it also 
cannot be enforced in the other four districts he wrote 
therefore he argued the justices should expedite their review 
or else keep the law in effect until they rule on the 
constitutional issues 
ms blair noting that the state supreme court already ruled 
tuesday that abortions could proceed without consent said it 
appears fairly ludicrous to bring this up again 
the consent requirement was found unconstitutional earlier this 
year by the 5th district court of appeal in daytona beach 
a lawyer appointed by the judge in tws case to represent the 
fetus obtained an order tuesday from us supreme court justice 
anthony m kennedy blocking an abortion 
on thursday the full federal court lifted kennedys order 
without comment or recorded dissent the high courts decision was 
strictly procedural and did not rule on the merits or 
constitutionality of the law 
but kennedys order sparked widespread speculation about his 
views on abortion 
he is considered to hold a pivotal vote in a missouri case 
asking the justices to reverse or curtail the courts 1973 decision 
in roe vs wade legalizing abortion a decision in that case is 
expected by late june 
but lawyers on both sides warned thursday against reading too 
much significance into kennedys earlier order 
i dont believe his action lends any real insight into his 
views on roe vs wade said james bopp of the national right to 
life committee it shows he takes the supreme court cases on 
parental involvement seriously but beyond that i dont think you 
can say much more 
charlene carres an american civil liberties union lawyer in 
tallahassee said the courts action vindicates the aclus 
initial impression that this was not any kind of sign that 
justice kennedy would necessarily be an antichoice vote in the 
missouri case

a government scientist says his detailed new 
analysis disproves the theory that volcanoes are more likely to 
erupt at certain times of the year 
historically volcanoes have erupted slightly more often in some 
months than others leading to disputes over whether the variation 
was enough to constitute a periodic pattern 
richard b stothers concluded that it isnt in a report in the 
may issue of geophysical research letters published by the 
american geophysical union 
stothers of the national aeronautics and space administrations 
goddard space flight center in greenbelt md compared the dates 
of recorded strong volcanic eruptions between 1500 and 1980 
during that time 265 eruptions were recorded in the first half 
of each calendar year and 236 in the last six months a difference 
stothers said is not statistically significant 
breaking down the eruptions by month and area stothers did find 
some clustering but this was explainable he concluded 
for example nearly all eruptions south of 50 degrees south 
latitude occurred between november and april 
this is almost certainly because that is summer in that part of 
the world the time of year the nearly uninhabited region is most 
often visited by outsiders who would record eruptions stothers 
said 
no similar pattern was seen in the far north where residents 
are always present to notice eruptions 
stothers monthly analysis found a peak average of 52 eruptions 
in february between the years 1500 and 1980 and a minimum of 36 
eruptions in the months of april and december during that period 
the average number of eruptions in other months fell in between 
those two a variation within the range that statisticians would 
expect to occur in a random sample 
stothers analysis rebuts several studies done in the late 1800s 
and early in this century that indicated a seasonality to volcanic 
eruptions 
at least one 1917 report speculated that eruptions would cluster 
around the equinoxes in the spring and fall as a result of changes 
in the angle of the sun 
periodic springtime eruptions of some volcanoes have been 
associated with melting snow seeping into the ground and reacting 
with molton lava below the ground scientists have suggested 
but seasonality occurring at individual volcanoes disappears 
when they are averaged in with many others around the world 
according to stothers analysis

the first black woman to sit on the 
pennsylvania supreme court has been stripped of her office and 
91000 salary by her colleagues because of her age 
the high court split 42 on thursday with chief justice robert 
nc nix registering what he called a most vociferous dissent 
justice juanita kidd stout was forced off the bench retroactive 
to her 70th birthday on march 6 she had not participated in any 
new cases since then the state constitution requires judges to 
retire at 70 but stouts attorney argued she was exempt because 
she was appointed not elected 
justice nicholas papadakos writing for the majority said 
appointed judges should not be exempt 
we do not believe that the equal protection clause of the 
federal constitution confers any greater rights upon appointed 
judges than upon elected or retained judges papadakos said in 
agreeing with state attorney general ernest preate jr who brought 
the lawsuit 
there is no question that justice stout is widely recognized 
as an outstanding judge and justice preate said the position 
that i argued is simply that the constitution must apply to 
everyone including supreme court justices 
gov robert p casey appointed stout in february 1988 to fill a 
vacancy expected to last only a year her term was extended when 
the court canceled judicial elections in 1988 on a technicality 
the court then ordered casey to extend her appointment to jan 
2 1990 but did not address the age question 
nix who shared his office with stout said the majoritys 
opinion would hurt the judicial system 
many highly qualified former judges who have surpassed the age 
of 70 are by the majoritys decision prevented from filling 
vacancies in our court system on an interim basis he said 
if there is a sadness to todays decision it is that this 
court which traces its existence back to 1681 has only had two 
female justices both of whom assumed office by appointments to 
fill a vacancy 
nix held out the hope that stout could become the first person 
appointed as a senior justice a retired judge who continues to 
work to ease court backlogs to the supreme court

broke demoralized and ignored the 
organization of american states needed a spiritnourishing issue 
manuel antonio noriega may have provided it 
the oas has been unable to accomplish much of anything this 
decade one of the organizations principal aims is to keep the 
peace but it has been on the periphery of the continuing bloodshed 
in central america and was irrelevant at the time of the 
britishargentine war in 1982 over the falkland islands and the 
usled invasion of grenada a year later 
at one point several years ago an oas official said the 
organization was so feckless that it was unable to agree on a 
resolution commemorating the upcoming 500th anniversary of the 
discovery of america 
but for the oas noriega has been heavensent the organization 
which seemed paralyzed by factionalism was able to close ranks 
against the panamanian leader wednesday night 
with only panama and nicaragua dissenting oas foreign ministers 
agreed to blame noriega for the grave events and abuses that 
have occurred since the may 7 national elections in panama 
international organizations normally are loathe to single out 
leaders of member states for criticism but the scenes of opposition 
candidates and ordinary citizens being bludgeoned by government 
agents turned stomachs from one end of the hemisphere to the other 
it was time for the oas to drop its genteel guard 
the foreign ministers approved a resolution which not only held 
noriega personally responsible for the bloodshed but also 
appointed a mediating team to take steps aimed at ensuring a 
transfer of power in panama 
that is quite a departure for an organization which normally has 
as its highest principle the right of member states to be spared 
outside intervention 
noriega of course will put his own spin on the resolution he 
is expected to tell the mediators that he is a soldier for 
democracy who wanted nothing more than to see a transfer of 
power resulting from the may 7 elections on that basis 
noriegas foreign minister was able to go along with the resolution 
wednesday night 
secretary of state james a baker iii has shown interest in 
reviving the oas he is planning to appoint one of the state 
departments most accomplished latin american hands luigi einaudi 
as us ambassador to the oas 
but baker didnt take office soon enough to head off the layoffs 
earlier this year of 300 oas employees about 30 percent of the 
total that step was largely brought on by us arrearages 
amounting to more than 50 million more layoffs are expected next 
month 
the oas heyday was the 1960s it was the cold war era and us 
administrations were able to forge an anticommunist consensus with 
rightist dictators and hawkish democratic governments which 
dominated the hemisphere at the time 
cuban president fidel castro was everybodys villain the oas 
expelled him from its ranks a few years after his revolution and 
25 summers ago the organization slapped a mandatory economic and 
diplomatic embargo against cuba 
in 1965 the united states invaded the dominican republic a 
seeming violation of the oas charter but oas nations albeit 
reluctantly gave their blessing to the us action rather than 
siding with the target of the invasion 
with the demise of rightist dictatorships in latin america and 
their replacement by elected governments the anticommunist 
consensus in the hemisphere has unraveled 
never has latin america been more democratic or less willing to 
go along with washingtons policies support for president reagans 
central america policies in the hemisphere was virtually invisible 
the special session on noriega recalled the time 10 years when 
the oas decided to move against nicaraguan president anastasio 
somoza a month after the oas foreign ministers called for somozas 
resignation he fled to paraguay 
now the question is whether the oas stand against noriega will 
contribute to a similar result 
one of the oas mediators who will sit down with noriega next 
week is ecuadoran foreign minister diego cordovez the principal 
architect of the agreement that led to the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan starting a year ago 
if cordovez was able to get more than 100000 russian troops 
out surely he can do the same with one panamanian or can he

an israeli soldier and three 
palestinians were killed today in the first gun battle between 
troops and arab villagers since the start of the 17month uprising 
against israels occupation 
the soldiers opened fire on the palestinians who had allegedly 
killed a suspected israeli collaborator in the past authorities 
said 
seven soldiers were wounded including a highranking israeli 
officer in critical condition after he was wounded in the head 
said an army spokeswoman who was not identified under military 
regulations the soldier was killed by a grenade thrown by the 
palestinians officials said 
the clash brought to 487 the number of palestinians killed in 
the uprising it also raised to 22 the number of israelis who have 
died in the violence including eight soldiers 
also today troops arrested about 100 palestinian activists in 
the gaza strip including sheih ahmed yassin 52 the spiritual 
leader of the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas arab reports 
said hamas arabic for zeal is a principal group coordinating the 
uprising 
in the west bank village of surif the army blew up two homes of 
palestinians allegedly involved in attacks on soldiers the army 
said western nations have condemned house demolitions because they 
are usually carried out before a suspect has been charged or tried 
the incident occurred in beit aula a village of 1500 residents 
about 15 miles southwest of jerusalem troops blocked access to 
beit aula stopping journalists at the nearby village of halhoul 
maj gen amram mitzna the army commander of the west bank 
denied the gun battle marked a new phase in the uprising 
i dont think this is a turning point he said 
mitzna said the palestinians were affiliated with the fatah 
faction headed by yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation 
organization 
mitzna said the incident began when an alleged palestinian 
collaborator from the west bank village of nuba near beit aula 
called the army for help saying he was being attacked by fellow 
villagers 
troops responding to the call passed through beit aula and 
unexpectedly met a suspect car mitzna told reporters 
there was a chase and they soldiers opened fire the result 
was three of the group palestinians were killed and one of our 
soldiers was killed and another one was wounded very seriously 
mitzna said 
the israeli soldier driving the lead jeep was killed by a hand 
grenade an army spokesman said the battalion commander a 
lieutenant colonel was critically wounded in the grenade blast 
i was in a vehicle behind the lead jeep i opened fire and 
shot the terrorist in the front seat a soldier involved in the 
firefight identified only as capt rafi told israel radio i 
then saw another terrorist in the back seat holding an m16 rifle 
who was also firing i reloaded and continued firing 
mitzna said the three palestinian victims were wanted by 
authorities they acted mainly against villagers who helped 
israeli authorities and those who opposed the rule of the 
intefadeh arabic for uprising he said 
an army spokesman said the palestinians had killed one suspected 
collaborator 
an army spokeswoman said the three palestinians had an 
americanmade m16 assault rifle an israeli uzi submachine gun and 
a pistol 
todays israeli victim was the fourth soldier shot to death 
during the uprising but he was the first to die in a fullscale 
gun battle the other four soldiers deaths came from stonings and 
stabbings 
underground leaders of the uprising have urged palestinians not 
to use guns saying such an escalation would only bring strong 
retribution by israel 
beit aula has a long history of disputes between residents and 
alleged collaborators

iran has filed suit against the 
united states in the world court over the loss of 290 lives in the 
downing of an iranian jetliner last year a court official said 
today 
tehran has asked the court to rule that the united states is 
responsible to pay compensation to the islamic republic to the 
amount to be determined by the court for the injuries suffered 
by the islamic republic and the bereaved families the official 
quoted irans submission to the court 
iran filed its application at the court on wednesday said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with court 
practice 
it was not clear whether the bush administration was planning to 
take part in the proceedings the us embassy in the hague 
declined comment 
the case involves the downing of an iranian airbus jet by the 
uss vincennes on july 3 1988 all 290 passengers and crew of the 
plane died in the incident which occurred after the airbus was 
erroneously identified as an iranian fighter plane by the 
vincennes crew 
president reagan said at the time that the families of the 
victims would be compensated as an expression of grief but that 
no other reparations would be made the former administration said 
the unspecified compensation would go to families and not the 
government of iran 
but recently bush administration officials said they cannot 
compensate the families until their receive more information from 
iran about the victims 
the world court officially known as the international court of 
justice is the judicial branch of the united nations it has no 
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
rulings 
in documents filed at the courts registry iran also asked the 
court to quash a march 17 decision by the international civil 
aviation organization which deplored the incident but did not 
blame the us government the court official told the associated 
press 
the court is considering when to begin proceedings in the case 
which pits the united states against iran in the world court for 
the second time since 1979 
in that year the carter administration filed suit against iran 
over the fate of 55 american diplomats held hostage at the us 
embassy in tehran the court ruled in favor of the us government 
ordering iran to immediately release the hostages 
the iranian government ignored the court ruling but later freed 
the hostages in january 1980 after an elaborate deal was reached 
with washington 
the united states withdrew from proceedings in the other major 
world court case in which it was involved earlier in the decade in 
1984 nicaragua sought a halt to us support for the contra rebels 
and the court sided with the leftist sandinista government two 
years later 
only days before that complaint was filed the reagan 
administration canceled its acceptance of world court jurisdiction 
in central american affairs 
of the more than 150 un member nations only 49 have accepted 
the courts authority as compulsory in settling conflicts between 
states the united states is one of them with the exception of 
central american disputes

dissident leaders said today they will 
ask amnesty international to intervene if the government refuses to 
perform a new autopsy on a radical student they claim was killed by 
police 
dissidents charge the government is trying to cover up police 
involvement in the death of 24yearold lee cholkyu whose body 
was found in a reservoir near the southern city of kwangju on may 
10 
lees death has inflamed radicals and heightened tension in 
kwangju a stronghold of antigovernment sentiment where thousands 
of dissidents and radical students have staged antigovernment 
protests for the past eight days the protests there and around 
korea are to mark the annniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in 
kwangju that left at least 192 people dead 
antigovernment rallies to mark the uprising were expected to 
continue through the weekend and police units were on top alert 
oust the roh taewoo regime which tortured lee to death 
yelled 400 students at the national polytechnic university in seoul 
who marched through the streets today about 400 riot police 
followed but did not intervene 
the united national democratic movement the nations leading 
dissident group said that if the government does not conduct a 
second autopsy it will ask doctors from amnesty international to do 
so 
the government has said a second autopsy is unnecessary but 
dissidents want an independent investigation to check their charges 
of torture and police involvement 
the government says troopers chased lee when he was stopped at a 
roadblock but deny police were responsible for the death officials 
say an autopsy performed earlier this week indicates lee drowned 
and they speculate he slipped and fell into the reservoir while 
running away from police 
how could it be drowning as the government claims lees 
mother hwang jungja said today during an emotional meeting with 
the provincial police director in kwangju according to yonhap the 
south korean news agency 
yonhap said lees mother accompanied by 30 women who are 
mothers of political prisoners visited director paik hyungjo at 
his office to protest the governments ruling that lee drowned and 
demand a police investigation 
in seoul relatives of victims of the nineday kwangju uprising 
called today for an end to political exploitation and demanded the 
government provide compensation to families of those killed 
we have suffered enough mentally and physically said park 
chanbong spokesman for the family association of victims of 
kwangjus prodemocracy movement we must not be exploited 
anymore for political purposes 
roh was a senior army general when townspeople and students 
seized a government armory in kwangju may 18 1980 and took control 
of the city troops were sent in to suppress the uprising nine days 
later after talks failed 
government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds 
injured in the uprising opposition groups claims the government 
covered up many more deaths 
dissidents and radical students have been calling for the 
overthrow of the roh government but they lack public support 
because of their violent tactics and extremist views

data from experiments on prisoners in nazi 
concentration camps should be available for use in research if 
lives could be saved a hypothermia researcher says 
researchers currently have to dig through archives for the 
material 
the value of human life is great and if we have the means to 
save life even if the data is suspect we should use it dr 
robert pozos said thursday at an international conference on the 
meaning of the holocaust for bioethics 
the public must be educated about what went on in the camps as 
the data were being gathered so they can understand and make 
their own decisions pozos said 
the suggestion that the data be used drew angry reaction from 
three holocaust survivors who participated in a panel reaction to 
pozos address 
this is an issue fraught with much emotion said pozos vice 
president for minority affairs at the university of washington and 
former director of the hypothermia research laboratory at the 
university of minnesotaduluth 
it is very difficult even for me to disassociate what 
happened to the people at dachau buchenwald and other 
concentration camps with the data that was gathered he said 
pozos said his research could benefit from experiments done by 
the nazis so far he has refrained from using the data and did not 
make clear whether he would use it 
he said 80 to 90 prisoners died in coldwater immersion 
experiments conducted at dachau where nonconsenting prisoners 
were placed in brutally cold water to see what would happen to 
luftwaffe pilots if they were shot down 
information from the experiments still useful to todays 
scientists includes data showing that rapid rewarming with warm 
water is effective only for severely hypothermic patients and that 
bodytobody rewarming is ineffective 
data showing the head and neck are especially vulnerable to cold 
have been used in designing hypothermia suits pozos said and 
other experiments provided the basis for using lowered body 
temperature during cardiac surgery 
the situation is one which i think good might come from 
evil pozos said 
the experiments the tortures were talking about are the very 
tortures that killed my sister the tortures that were done to 
me said susan seiler vigorito a teacher of judaic studies from 
cleveland ohio and a survivor of the experiments conducted on 
twins by dr josef mengele at auschwitz 
the real issue is the method the method is as much a part of 
the data as the data itself the data doesnt tell us anything 
about the evil of the holocaust she argued

every fire that starts in 
yellowstone national park this year will be fought a park 
spokeswoman said today 
the announcment extends a moratorium of the let it burn 
policy that had been due to expire by midsummer the moratorium is 
now in effect through the summer and fall fire season said 
yellowstone spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
the let it burn policy adopted in 1972 allowed all 
naturally caused fires that did not threaten life or property to 
burn without intervention fires caused by humans were fought 
the policy came under widespread criticism last year after both 
mancaused and lightningstrike fires burned sections of nearly 
half of the 22 millionacre national park the fires were 
exacerbated by drought and high wind 
anzelmo said heavy snow this winter and wet spring conditions do 
not compare to last years low snowpack and dry spring we should 
be moving into the early summer with a lot of moisture on the 
ground she said 
although lightning fires started as early as june last year 
anzelmo said this summer will be too wet for early fires she said 
park officials expected a normal fire season this year 
in a normal season it usually is the late summer or early 
fall before conditions are dry enough for lighting strike fires 
she said 
but when they do start they will be fought she added

president bush summoned his top 
defense advisers to his seaside home today to discuss natos 
nuclear arsenal as his spokesman indicated arms issues dividing the 
alliance remain subject to discussion 
bush met with defense secretary dick cheney joint chiefs of 
staff chief adm william crowe and other military advisers in 
advance of a weekend meeting with french president francois 
mitterrand said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the snf shortrange nuclear forces issue of course is one 
thats under cosndiration right now and is driving the meeting 
fitzwater told reporters 
the bush administration wants to upgrade natos nuclear weapons 
while west germany has called for early ussoviet talks on 
reducing the nuclear arsenal in europe talks the united states 
has rejected the flap threatens to disrupt the nato summit in 
brussels later this month 
fitzwater said he did not know if a compromise could be struck 
before the nato meeting 
at the same time fitzwater denied that comments by mitterrand 
the day before in paris urging a goslow approach on modernizing 
natos nuclear forces were in conflict with the us stance 
president mitterrands comments yesterday indicate that his 
position is very similar to ours he shares our general concern 
about the strength of the nato alliance fitzwater said 
im sure all of that is subject to disscussion he said 
fitzwater dismissed news accounts suggesting mitterrands party 
was unhappy with accomodations in kennebunkport 
as far as i know the accomodations are satisfactory to the 
french delegation the discussions of accommodations have gone 
quite well we dont have any problems he said 
the new york daily news in todays editions quoted 
unidentified souces as saying mitterrand was unhappy with the size 
of the bed and the height of the toilet in the house in 
kennebunkport where he and his wife will be staying the house 
owned by bushs mother is next to the presidents home the 
article also said that barbara bush was upset about the 
mitterrands visit claiming it to be disruptive 
bush on thursday told a rochester audience were having the 
president of the french republic come to our hourse so first she 
mrs bush bawled me out about that because the house has been 
closed all winter 
fitzwater said today that the bushes had decided to restrict 
press coverage of the mitterrand visit within the oceanside 
compound 
the family feels their home is their private residence and 
should not be used for publicity purposes they want to keep it 
pesonal and i think thats reasonable he said 
bush arrived here thursday and immediately took his powerboat 
for a spin his motor got hung up on lobster pot lines and he had 
to hang overboard to untangle 
at one point the president was almost upside down with secret 
service agents holding onto his thighs as he worked to unsnarl his 
propeller 
had to lift up the prop to free the line bush later told 
reporters 
bush was out for several hours at the wheel of his 28foot 
cigarette speedboat crashing through the waves of the open 
atlantic it was the first time bush has been out on the boat as 
president and he was accompanied by several coast guard vessels 
that stood guard 
bush and mitterrand are to meet on saturday for a session that 
aides said would focus on the nato summit in brussels later this 
month 
bush has invited mitterrand to visit with him for the weekend 
and was to take the french leader with him to boston on sunday 
where bush was to give the commencement address at boston 
university 
high on the agenda of a planned saturday work session between 
the two presidents will likely be the issue of shortrange missiles 
in western europe 
the french leader has voiced general support for bushs 
opposition to a west german call for early negotiations with the 
soviets for eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
however while reiterating that it was still too early for such 
talks to begin mitterrand said in paris on thursday that the nato 
allies should allow time for reflection and give conventional 
disarmament talks a chance before deciding to modernize us 
shortrange missiles in europe 
the decision to update lance missiles stationed in west germany 
which the united states has proposed will not become urgent 
until about 1992 mitterrand told a news conference 
he said he hoped the issue of shortrange missiles which has 
split nato could be dealt with calmly at the brussels meetings of 
the alliance 
if we have to modernize then lets do it he said but 
how do we know its necessary 
still the french president said he thought the time has not 
come far from it for a zero option eliminating all 
shortrange missiles from europe 
france which is a member of nato but not part of its integrated 
military command has already decided to modernize and extend the 
range of its own shortrange nuclear missiles

foreign minister moshe arens said today israel 
has asked the united states to lead an international campaign to 
raise 2 billion for rehabilitating palestinian refugee camps in 
the israelioccupied territories 
arens said the israeli request was included in a letter from 
prime minister yitzhak shamir to president bush the foreign 
minister outlined the proposal as well as an israeli plan for 
elections among the 17 million palestinians to vice president dan 
quayle today 
quayle endorsed the plan in principle but said he wanted to 
hear more details said vice presidential spokesman david 
beckwith 
disclosure of the israeli request appeared designed to shift 
some of the emphasis away from the controversial election proposal 
that is part of a fourpoint plan adopted earlier this week by 
israels cabinet and parliament 
the plan formulated under international pressure for israel to 
resolve the 17month uprising in which nearly 500 palestinians have 
been killed also calls for an egyptianisraeliamerican summit 
meeting to lend impetus to the initiative and for some 20 arab 
states at war with israel to talk peace 
arens told reporters at a breakfast meeting that israel already 
had raised the refugee rehabilitation proposal with japan and he 
will ask the european economic community for its help when he meets 
with the group in brussels next week money from oilrich arab 
states would also be welcome he said 
israel is hoping that by building new housing and providing 
employment opportunities for the 300000 palestinians it estimates 
live in camps it will alleviate some of the bitterness that 
spawned the palestinian uprising against the 21year israeli 
occupation he said 
arens said that in meetings thursday with secretary of state 
james a baker iii and national security adviser brent scowcroft he 
had emphasized that the whole israeli package must have unqualified 
us support that would then generate its acceptance in the arab 
world 
we feel its now the turn of the united states at bat to 
declare wholehearted and unreserved support for this initiative 
arens said 
arens told us officials that now was not the time to discuss 
details of the election proposal such as which palestinians would 
be allowed to participate and whether israel would agree to 
international supervision 
i hope i was successful in convincing my interlocuters here 
of that view he said 
details could be worked out later but israel accepts the 
principle there must be free and democratic elections he said 
israel is not panama and shamir is not panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega he said 
arens said baker promised to go to bat and do what he can to 
further this initiative 
but a us official speaking thursday on condition of 
anonymity said that while the israeli plan is a good start it 
raises many questions the official said the united states has been 
looking at what opportunities it affords and what questions 
remain to be answered 
baker told arens the next step will be for israel to start talks 
with palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip to discuss 
details for the elections and the conditions that would be 
acceptable to each side said the us official 
israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity say the 
united states is pressing israel to give answers to several 
questions raised by baker in a letter to israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir last week regarding the election blueprint 
arens said he had urged the bush administration to grant 
wholehearted and unreserved american support for this peace 
initiative such support he said has a good chance of 
enlisting support among other countries throughout the world and 
eliciting a positive reaction from the arab world and that is a 
necessary precondition for this thing to really take off 
the plan envisions balloting to elect palestinians who would 
negotiate with israel for limited selfrule in the west bank and 
gaza following several years of selfrule israel would then 
engage in talks on the future of the lands which it captured from 
egypt and jordan in the 1967 war 
the plan excludes any participation by representatives of the 
plo and egyptian leader hosni mubarak and jordans king hussein 
have said they would not accept it unless the palestine liberation 
organization approves

dissident groups are blaming the 
united states for the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising using 
the deep political wounds it left to demand the fall of the south 
korean government and inflame antiamericanism 
dissidents routinely attack the united states for meddling in 
korean affairs charging that washington has controlled a 
succession of authoritarian governments in seoul one of the most 
frequent accusations is of alleged us involvement in the kwangju 
uprising in which hundreds were killed and wounded 
radical students in kwangju claim tanks and troops from us 
forces based in south korea took part in putting down the may 1980 
uprising by students and townspeople 
i have seen videotapes of the american tanks and soldiers in 
kwangju said lim chongsoo who was 11 during the nineday 
uprising posters put up in kwangju to mark the anniversary alleged 
that us troops helped south korean units that shot students and 
townspeople 
us troops were not involved in kwangju but the belief is 
spreading among some students despite a lack of evidence and 
denials by us and korean officials 
drive out the yankees chanted crowds of up to 100000 
protesters who marched in kwangju on thursday to mark the 
anniversary the crowds applauded wildly as dissident leaders 
blamed the united states for what happened 
the uprising continues to haunt south korean politics with many 
in the opposition contending the nation cannot have political peace 
until the men responsible are punished and all the facts of the 
incident exposed 
some us and south korean officials and other observers worry 
the battle over kwangju may add to antiamericanism that is strong 
among some koreans especially students and farmers 
antiamericanism is inspired by growing national pride trade 
friction and a sense that washington treats south korea as a lackey 
despite its growing strength and importance 
dissident leaders who do not claim us troops were involved 
contend the united states helped direct the suppression of the 
uprising they contend the united states encouraged former 
president chun doohwan roh taewoo and other senior generals to 
suppress the uprising and take control of the government 
the united states controlled the kwangju massacre the 
dissident alliance the united national democratic movement said 
in an open letter to president bush when he came to seoul in 
february 
the dissidents who have staged violent antigovernment rallies 
and labor strikes in recent months are demanding the overthrow of 
roh who is now president and the expulsion of the 43000 us 
troops based in south korea roh won elections in late 1987 and 
replaced chun at the end of his sevenyear term 
theamerican troops must leave korea we cannot have peace 
until they go lim said as other students nodded in agreement 
south korean troops put down the uprising that began after 
townspeople and students seized a government armory and said they 
were opposing the efforts of generals to take control of the 
government the government says 192 people were killed and about 
800 wounded dissidents say the death toll was about 2000 
many older people in kwangju who lived through the uprising say 
us troops were not involved they worry about how the idea of 
us complicity is growing among some young people and the growing 
radicalism of some students 
park chanbong whose 17yearold son was killed in the 
uprising said most kwangju people do not agree with these 
allegations that the united states is responsible for the 
massacre 
taxi driver yang youngko 40 agreed that us troops and 
officials were not involved but he said there is a feeling among 
residents that the united states could have done more to prevent 
the bloodshed 
the united states as a big brother should have used its power 
to stop the military government from killing all those people he 
said 
the dissidents claim about us involvement in kwangju center 
on charges that us commanders allowed south korean generals to 
move troops to kwangju and the us government supported the 
generals seizure of power most south korean troops are under the 
command of a us general as part of the alliance between the two 
nations against communist north korea 
the us government repeatedly has denied any involvement in the 
uprising us officials say it was a south korean affair and 
korean generals and officials acted on their own without consulting 
us counterparts 
this is a korean show and americans have no role in it the 
american role was insignificant said a senior us official who 
declined to be identified further 
but the uprising is one of several factors creating 
antiamericanism and troubling the close alliance between 
washington and seoul the official said 
in terms of a target the us is like an elephant in a 
bathtub he said

the legislatures of two baltic republics appealed 
to moscow to renounce a 1939 pact with nazi germany under which 
josef stalin absorbed their onceindependent states into the soviet 
union tass said friday 
the supreme soviets of lithuania and estonia took the action 
thursday according to the official news agency the republics on 
the same day declared for themselves far more independence than 
moscow intends to allow 
the measures may force a confrontation with the kremlin 
the two republics asked the kremlin to renounce the 
molotovribbentrop pact that divided eastern europe into soviet and 
german spheres of influence 
lithuania asked the new congress of peoples deputies which 
meets for the first time may 25 to condemn the treaty and to 
pronounce it unlawful and null and void from the moment it was 
signed tass said 
estonias legislature also declared the pact violated 
international law and asked that it be nullified tass said 
the soviet union maintains the pact was necessary to forestall a 
nazi attack and give the soviets time to prepare for war with adolf 
hitler whose forces attacked the soviet union in june 1941 
nullification of the pact would strengthen claims by the baltic 
republics for greater independence toward which they have been 
striving for the past year 
besides claiming greater economic autonomy lithuania also today 
followed estonias example and declared its sovereignty from 
moscow 
the law specifies that national soviet laws are valid in 
lithuania only if they are also approved by the lithuanian 
parliament effectively claiming the republic can veto kremlin 
decisions 
the estonian supreme soviet passed a similar law in november 
the kremlin pronounced the law invalid but estonia still considers 
it to be in force 
lithuanias economic law includes provisions for printing its 
own money and estonias would allow limited private property both 
republics economic plans gave them control over virtually all 
industry on their territory and declare them the sole masters of 
their natural resources 
but a moscow commission headed by nonvoting politburo member 
yuri maslyukov wants kremlin control over energy and at least half 
of heavy industry as well as all defense production in the area 
it also prohibits republics from printing their own money

the irancontra book that majority leader 
george j mitchell wrote with a fellow senator brought him 22500 
in royalties last year but he remained one of the senates least 
wealthy members 
mitchells annual financial disclosure form among the 100 filed 
by all senators and released today showed that making speeches was 
more lucrative than helping write a book mitchell dmaine earned 
42500 in speeches above the limit but gave 8000 of that to 
charity which brought him into compliance 
his coauthor on the book men of zeal fellow maine senator 
william cohen a republican reported that he received 25763 
and that included royalties from a a spy novel he cowrote years 
ago with former sen gary hart dcolo 
the annual disclosure forms of income in 1988 showed that in 
many cases the chief providers of speaking fees and free trips were 
the groups interested in legislation before the committees on which 
the senator sits 
for instance wyche fowler of georgia a democrat on the 
agriculture committee earned 28000 for speeches and 16000 came 
from agriculture food beverage and tobacco interests bennett 
johnson of louisiana received 10000 from energy groups he sits 
on the energy committee 
but speaking fees werent the only pluses for being a senator 
trips figure largely in many senators lives among many that 
johnston listed was one to alaska paid for in part by alaskan oil 
and gas and conoco 
both oregon senators republicans bob packwood and mark 
hatfield accepted free trips to the far east with their wives 
from different sources thomas daschle dsc took four 
expensepaid trips with his wife that included puerto rico and the 
kentucky derby 
albert gore of tennessee a presidential candidate in 1988 
received a round trip for himself and his wife to acapulco mexico 
paid for by the lomas financial group of dallas gore listed 
26800 in honoraria 16000 of that came from food beverage and 
tobacco groups 
even the richest among the senators accepted speaking fees in 
the case of john heinz of pennsyvlania a republican whose pickle 
and ketchup fortune is between 113 million to 136 million and 
more all 10000 in honoraria went to food banks 
some surprising facts came to light with the disclosure forms 
slade gorton of washington a republican restored to the senate 
after a twoyear absence owned stock in the exxon corp he has 
been an outspoken critic of the oil giants handling of the alaska 
oil spill 
the mitchellcohen book subtitled a candid inside story of 
the irancontra hearings focuses on the joint housesenate 
committee hearings that played to a television audience of millions 
in the summer of 1987 
in a senate noted for its millionaire members mitchell is one 
of the paupers he lists assets of less than 16000 
the disclosure forms list assets and liabilities only in ranges 
mitchells counterpart republican leader bob dole of kansas 
earned 116090 to 132272 of which 99500 was his senate 
salary he made 36000 for speeches but he gave 31750 of that to 
charity 
the two senate leaders earn 10000 a year more in salary than 
the other senators but they too may keep honoraria equaling only 
40 percent of salary that amount is 35800 in the case of all but 
robert byrd dva who was last years majority leader and dole 
each senator must list the source of honoraria doles breakdown 
showed 6000 from groups interested in finance 10000 from 
health groups 4000 from transportation groups he reported his 
assets between 292295 and 691277 and no liabilities 
dole said he received gifts worth nearly 5000 including a set 
of lithographs portraying the heritage and history of armenian life 
and a crystal magnolia for his wife elizabeth who is now 
president bushs labor secretary 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sam nunn of 
georgia reported receiving 46950 from speechmaking and he gave 
11686 to charity to get under the limit of the honoraria 
10000 was from the defense industry with which his committee 
deals 
the disclosure form shows nunn a democrat is probably a 
millionaire he lists his assets in the range of 942015 to 
1195000 plus 
the usual list of the richest senators got a new member in 1989 
sen herbert kohl a wisconsin democrat kohl who owns the 
milwaukee bucks of the national basketball association listed 
assets in the range of 194 million to 277 million or more 
after his election last november his investments were 
transferred to a blind trust 
the other senators with big bucks include those with the 
bestknown names john d rockefeller iv dwva an heir to the 
vast oil fortune edward m kennedy dmass and heinz 
john c danforth rmo grandson of the man who founded the 
ralstonpurina company listed assets of 78 million to 13 
million or more and returned to the list as did william armstrong 
rcolo and alan j dixon dill not returning is lowell weicker 
rconn who was defeated for reelection 
the disclosure rules ask each senator to declare assets 
liabilities earned and unearned income amounts given to charity 
and money received for speeches and articles called honoraria 
contributions to charity usually represent money the senator has to 
give away because of limits 
assets include anything of value such as real estate stocks 
bonds and trust but not the senators home or property owned 
solely by the senators spouse and children

to the philippines it would show a humanitarian and a kinder and 
gentler america the marcoses cannot leave the island of oahu

tips generated from a network anticrime program 
led to the arrest of a fugitive convicted of stealing more than 16 
million in the largest theft of medicaid funds since the program 
began 22 years ago 
sheldon weinberg 64 was arrested wednesday night in 
scottsdale ariz just hours after he was featured on nbctvs 
unsolved mysteries 
an anonymous caller one of hundreds of viewers who phoned in 
tips gave the fbi weinbergs alias and address at a 
gardenapartment complex 
weinberg and his two sons who had operated a brooklyn health 
clinic were convicted nov 30 1988 of stealing more than 16 
million from medicaid between 198087 
it is fitting indeed that ordinary citizens whose millions of 
stolen tax dollars directly financed sheldon weinbergs obscenely 
lavish lifestyle should be the instrument of his ultimate 
downfall said deputy attorney general edward j kuriansky 
kuriansky said weinberg had used the money he defrauded from 
medicaid to finance an 18000amonth apartment in manhattans 
trump tower a 5 million lakefront mansion in boca raton fla 
yachts and a fleet of custom cars 
this reverse robin hood has finally gotten his just 
desserts he said 
at the trial in state supreme court prosecutors charged that 
weinberg and his sons falsely billed medicaid by submitting phony 
reimbursement claims for about 400000 phony patients 
weinberg failed to appear at his jan 10 sentencing this year 
and has been the target of a nationwide search since then 
following extradition proceedings in arizona weinberg will be 
returned to new york to begin serving a sevento21year prison 
term that was imposed in absentia

premier ciriaco de mita resigned today after 
repeated sniping by the socialists his main partner in the 
13monthold coalition government 
de mita turned in his resignation as head of italys 48th 
postwar government to president francesco cossiga 
the president asked de mita to stay on in a caretaker capacity 
the political negotiations aimed at forming a new coalition could 
take weeks 
de mita a christian democrat announced his resignation after 
an urgent cabinet meeting requested by his main political foe 
bettino craxi a former premier who leads the socialists craxi 
called the cabinet meeting to discuss what he called a political 
and government crisis 
earlier today in a closing speech at the socialist convention 
in milan craxi said a political and procedural clarification 
about the fiveparty coalition government was needed immediately 
the socialists and christian democrats have been squabbling for 
weeks over a variety of issues with craxi and fellow party members 
accusing de mita of failing to take a leadership role the 
government which took office in april 1988 also includes the 
small republican social democrat and liberal parties 
craxi and his aides have made no secret that the socialist 
leader would like o regain the premiership 
the socialists are italys third largest party but have great 
weight in forming a government that is because no party has a 
majority and the christian democrats who have dominated all 
governments since the end of world war ii refuse to bring the 
communists italys second largest party into the cabinet

william lucas is working for the justice 
department as a 284aday consultant while awaiting senate 
confirmation as assistant attorney general for civil rights the 
department said friday 
lucas whose nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups 
who question his professional qualifications is studying the 
justice departments role in training law enforcement officials to 
be sensitive about civilrights issues and report potential 
violations said david runkel chief justice department spokesman 
the 284 perday consulting agreement which took effect march 
20 is a common arrangement for bush administration officials 
awaiting senate action on their nominations runkel said 
lucas who garnered more than half his 1988 earnings as a 
consultant for the republican national committee continued to work 
for the gop until february runkel said 
the justice department consulting contract was negotiated with 
lucas after he stopped working for the republican party runkel 
said lucas generally works five days a week as a consultant but is 
not paid for the days he spends paying calls on senators who will 
vote on his nomination runkel said 
the 284 daily rate is equivalent to an annual salary of 73840 
runkel dismissed suggestions that lucas was given the contract 
simply to tide him over during the senate conformation proceedings

civil rights division runkel said 
there is a need to do it or it wouldnt be done runkel said 
of the study 
lucas will submit a report to the justice department following 
his review of training and manpower resources of federal law 
enforcement agencies on civil rights the role the department plays 
in training local law enforcement officials

police and obtaining local cooperation in investigating such 
complaints according to the contract he signed with the department 
no date has been set for lucas confirmation hearing by the 
senate judiciary committee the panels chairman sen joseph r 
biden jr ddel said thursday he wanted to determine the scope

legal case in court since he entered private legal practice in 
detroit two years ago 
before that lucas a former fbi agent and new york city police

of japanese politics 
reagan and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone called each 
other yasu and ron but nakasones office said he had no plans to 
see his friend during the visit his successor noboru takeshita 
who also was on a firstname basis with reagan has said he will 
resign because of the scandal 
takeshita and nakasone are under fire for benefiting from 
cutprice unlisted shares in a subsidiary of recruit co that 
soared in value when offered on the market executives of the 
company face trial on charges of bribing other government officials 
there have been reports of a bidding war to sponsor events

former presidents fee for the week would be about 2 million he 
did not give the source of the information 
japanese companies involved have denied the report and reagans 
office in california declined comment mark weinberg a reagan 
spokesman said the fees were a private matter 
charles z wick former director of the us information agency 
director helped arrange the visit 
i feel quite certain as do many other people in japan and the

things were going well that he supported a free economy but with 
bush things have changed dramatically he said 
the us goverments trade council has come to endorse managed 
trade and the negotiators have become much more resultoriented 
now people feel that usjapan relations may be breaking down

voters edged away from northern 
irelands militant extremes and boosted moderates today on both 
sides of the communal divide according to nearly complete returns 
from local elections 
with all but 20 of the 566 council seats counted nationwide the 
gap between moderate and radical parties widened with moderates 
ahead 2to1 in both the protestant and roman catholic camps 
on the catholic side the larger social democratic labor party 
was showing the best election performance in its 20year history 
winning 120 seats compared to 101 in the last election in 1985 it 
had gained 3 percent to hold 208 percent of the total vote 
sinn fein the political backer of the militant irish republican 
army won 11 percent of the total vote down slightly from the 117 
percent it had in the last election the party was weaker in rural 
areas and was expected to lose 15 of its 59 council seats 
but in west belfast sinn feins traditional stronghold the 
party was 31 percent stronger and rose to an 187 percent share 
though the social democrats increased their belfast vote by 18 
percent sinn fein remained the capitals largest party and the 
council stayed protestant controlled 
the shift toward moderates appeared more pronounced on the 
protestant side where rev ian paisleys hardline democratic 
unionist party slumped by 63 percent and shed about 30 seats to 
105 
the larger more moderate official unionists gained 21 percent 
and was expected to finish with about 190 seats 
local elections matter little since the british government runs 
most of the provinces affairs but they are watched closely for 
pointers to the relative strengths of moderates and hardliners and 
any gain for sinn fein would sound alarm bells in london and dublin 
it does look as though there has been some move away from the 
extremes said tom king the cabinet minister who runs northern 
ireland 
but sinn feins alex maskey reelected in belfast said the 
vote in the capital endorsed his partys campaign to rid northern 
ireland of british rule but the 51seat belfast council remained 
firmly in protestant control 
among the more spectacular results were the social democratic 
and labor partys 78percent gain in londonderry another ira 
redoubt and sinn feins 47percent slide in enniskillen scene of 
a november 1987 ira bombing that killed 11 protestants and still 
arouses abhorrent memories 
in paisleys home town of ballymena his party lost 11 percent 
and three seats 
paisley said his voters were apathetic because they believe the 
british government is interested only in the balance of power 
concerning the ira 
the protestant parties are deeply embittered by a 1985 
angloirish agreement giving the irish government a say in northern 
irelands affairs they see ireland as a hostile 
catholicdominated state intent on dissolving their union with 
britain 
strong personalities proved able to override doctrinal divides 
in larne popular catholic priest pat buckley promised to serve 
all sectors of the community and won handsomely on a largely 
protestant vote 
in magherafelt social worker mary mcsorley romped home as an 
independent she had been kicked out of the social democratic and 
labor party for affronting irish nationalists by accepting a medal 
from queen elizabeth ii 
other moldbreakers were five selfstyled conservatives who 
pledged to attract mainland british parties into the province they 
argue this would strip ulster politics of their sectarian character 
and move them onto conventional leftright lines 
overall a pattern emerged of an electorate either indifferent 
turnout was down 4 percent or wanting moderate protestants and 
catholics to work together

premier nikolai i ryzhkov was criticized thursday 
as ecologically illiterate by a soviet parliamentarian who said 
his possible replacement will be debated when the new congress 
meets next week 
the extraordinary criticism of the soviet head of government 
who also sits on the ruling communist party politburo came at a 
news conference on soviet diplomatic initiatives to promote world 
cooperation on environmental protection 
the remarks by alexei v yablokov heralded a battle between 
ryzhkov and environmental activists elected to the 2250seat 
congress of peoples deputies when it convenes its first session 
may 25 to elect the soviet premier president and other officials 
we have serious reproaches to make to comrade ryzhkov 
chairman of the council of ministers said yablokov who also is 
a corresponding member of the soviet academy of sciences hes 
ecologically illiterate and this issue will be discussed at the 
congress of peoples deputies and well discuss whether he should 
remain as chairman of the council of ministers 
other speakers including deputy foreign minister vladimir f 
petrovsky state environmental committee chairman fedor t morgun 
and state hydrometeorology committee chairman yuri a izrael all 
ryzhkov subordinates vigorously defended his ecology record 
a lot of sinful decisions were made several years ago 
morgun said but what is being done now in the council of 
ministers and by general secretary mikhail s gorbachev and 
chairman ryzhkov well i know their approach is very strict to the 
ecological problem 
but yablokov charged that ryzhkov 59 had made several bad 
decisions since he was appointed head of government in september 
1985 
he gave only one example the approval ryzhkov allegedly gave at 
a dec 3 council of ministers meeting for construction of a 
fiveplant chemical complex in western siberia before an 
environmental impact survey or technical study had been made 
yablokov said his fellow lawmakers should advance an alternative 
to the economic development program being pursued by ryzhkovs 
government which some environmentalists contend is causing 
nationwide ecological ruin 
even now proposals are made that something has to be done with 
the economy and we should probably come forward with an alternate 
program for economic development and not only the program that 
comrade ryzhkov proposes said yablokov 56 a biologist elected 
to the congress by moscowbased scientific research institutes 
speaking later to western reporters yablokov said that in more 
than 100 soviet cities the air is now 10 times more polluted than 
health regulations allow water in rivers like the volga is too 
polluted to drink and many foods are laced with chemicals that 
make them harmful 
this is of great concern to us and maybe ryzhkov does not 
have this information available but we do and we are all 
witnesses of the situation he said 
the lawmakerscientist predicted ryzkhov would be reelected by 
the congress but not before he was given a dressingdown by 
enviromentalist deputies 
the man occupying the no 2 soviet protocol position behind 
gorbachev is a surprising candidate for controversy the 
exdirector of a huge machinebuilding plant in the urals ryzhkov 
was regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a 
highprofile politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for 
victims of the december earthquake in armenia 
his popularity soared in armenia and when the partys central 
committee met in march to elect 100 deputies to the congress 
ryzhkov outscored gorbachev twelve of the 641 party officials 
voting opposed gorbachevs election while only 10 objected to 
ryzhkov 
the congress whose members were chosen in the soviet unions 
first multicandidate elections in more than 70 years is expected 
to become the battleground for diverse causes as environmentalists 
baltic nationalists and other activists demand reforms 
yablokov said the parliament should become the supreme power 
in the country and revealed that 39 of the 41 deputies elected in 
moscow met thursday to draft common resolutions to submit to the 
congress on critical issues 
andrei d sakharov 1975 nobel peace laureate and human rights 
activist wrote a resolution on soviet interethnic relations a 
group of economists wrote another one on economic reforms and 
yablokov said he was the author of the proposed resolution on 
ecology

widespread publicity made it less likely drug couriers would be 
fooled into making telltale uturns 
state transportation secretary kaye henderson said last week 
that sheriff bob vogel and volusia county would be liable for any 
accident caused by the signs 
melvin stack a legal adviser to the sheriff said wednesday 
that hendersons warning was not the reason vogel had the signs 
taken down they were removed temporarily because they werent 
serving their purpose anymore after national news reports disclosed 
they were fake stack said 
in all probability this will be put on the back burner for a 
while until the drug dealers forget about it stack said 
the department of transportation has been giving sheriff vogel 
a hard time about placement of signs on i95 he said i say 
they should get their own house in order and take care of the roads 
around here stay out of the law enforcement area thats what we 
elected the sheriff for

residents of this rural hamlet are thinking 
about putting in the modern convenience of telephones but when 
they got together to talk about it they had to meet in the oldtime 
glow of kerosene lanterns 
a passing storm wednesday knocked out electrical power itself 
an innovation that arrived in starkey just 17 years ago 
the blackout didnt stop bob hald of telephone utilities of 
eastern oregon inc from preaching the virtues of the companys 
plan to bring phone signals in by microwave to the starkey trading 
post and from there to the communitys 60 homes by buried cable 
the community last in union county without phones would have 
service as complete as that in any big city financed by government 
money hald said whatever they have in los angeles you can have 
here 
wes delve called it a darn good deal but not everyone at 
the meeting was thrilled with the idea 
murial wherley 56 said she had a phone when she lived in 
nearby la grande and doesnt miss it 
we love it without a phone she said if we wanted a

grandma may have known best after all after 
three years of research microbiology professor byron murray thinks 
she knew what she was talking about when she said garlic helps to 
fight the common cold 
garlic may not be an allpurpose cure but it kills coldcausing 
viruses at least in a laboratory dish murray a microbiology 
professor at brigham young university has found 
the active chemical in garlic also wipes out viruses that cause 
herpes and upper respiratory infections as well as some bacteria 
and fungi he said 
the garlic component that thwarts these organisms is allicin he 
said thursday at the american society for microbiologys annual 
meeting here 
murray isnt sure yet of its structure or how it works but he 
said he has seen it immobilize 90 percent of a virus in a 
laboratory dish within 30 minutes 
the professor doesnt hold with the old recommendation of 
wearing garlic in a bag around the neck he suggests people take 
garlic in pill form 
theres a long and historic tale of garlic going back to 
medieval times murray said theres a good scientific basis 
there are a number of companies that make garlic pills but were 
doing more definitive antiviral work with allicin and other garlic 
compounds

a koreanborn businessman accused of trying 
to export nerve gas bombs to iran was found guilty of conspiracy 
today but was acquitted of trying to export the gas 
juwhan yun did not react when the verdict was announced his 
wife prayed silently to herself as she had throughout the trial 
yun faces up to five years in prison for the conviction the 
other charge would have added an additional 10 years yuns 
attorney stephen dratch said that under new sentencing 
guidelines yun probably would face about 2 years 
sentencing is set for july 13 
dratch said he would ask us district judge h lee sarokin to 
set the guilty verdict aside 
us attorney samuel a alito jr praised the verdict and 
rejected the defenses argument of entrapment saying that an 
undercover operation is virtually the only way to enforce weapons 
export laws 
yun was looking for a source of arms alito said 
yun was arrested jan 12 at us customs offices near newark 
international airport at what he thought was to be a meeting with 
an undercover agent posing as an arms dealer he had called off the 
deal for the nerve gas the night before his arrest 
yun was convicted of conspiring to export arms without a 
license the verdict came on the third day of deliberations 
dratch had argued during the nearly threeweek trial that yun 
was entrapped by a slick undercover agent he maintained that the 
agent used economic coercion to entrap yun 
olinsky told jurors that yun was motivated by greed and chose on 
his own to negotiate for the nerve gas sarin 
under sarokins instructions the jury had to find that the 
government proved decisively that yun was not entrapped in order to 
convict

the government on saturday sent army troops into 
beijing to end more than a month of student demonstrations that 
have shaken the communist leadership the move amounted to 
imposition of martial law 
after the announcement students said they would resume a hunger 
strike in central tiananmen square which they had called off hours 
earlier they vowed to remain in the square to press their demands 
for democratic reforms 
premier li peng made the announcement in front of an audience of 
several thousand at the great hall of the people the national seat 
of government 
president yang shangkun attended but communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang was not seen in the national television 
broadcast of the speech sources said zhao who opposed a 
crackdown offered to resign friday 
li said students were not trying to disrupt social order but 
that a few were taking advantage of the situation to create turmoil 
the usually softspoken premier raised his voice and 
occasionally waved his fist as he demanded the students end their 
protests which have evolved into the biggest show of defiance in 
chinas 40 years of communist rule 
the party government and military leaders in the audience 
mostly elderly clapped perfunctorily many had grim expressions 
president yang speaking next said beijing has been in a 
state of anarchy i completely support li pengs report if the 
situation were to continue our capital would no longer be a 
capital 
he said troops had come from outside beijing to restore order 
however both yang and li said the action was not directed against 
the students 
beijing residents said troops were poised on a main street near 
the city center and that some were entering downtown by subway a 
student who ran to central tiananmen square from the west said he 
saw 10 to 15 army trucks immobilized in the street by residents 
no troops had arrived in the square more than an hour after lis 
announcement which was broadcast on national television 
protesters in the square drowned out the broadcast for several 
minutes by singing the internationale the song of the world 
communist movement they then began chanting li peng step 
down 
yang said the troops were sent in to protect important 
ministries and key installations 
the liberation army is here to protect beijing society its 
people and its future we were forced to send the liberation army 
into the city he said 
li described the situation in beijing as anarchic and 
chaotic 
we have been reasonable for more than one month in the world 
theres no government like that he said the communist party 
will resolutely deal with all turmoil and not allow it to interfere 
with society 
li claimed that a handful of persons seeking to overthrow 
the government are using the hunger strikers as hostages to 
coerce and force the party and the government to yield to their 
political demands in this regard they have no iota of humanism 
it has become more and more clear that the very few people who 
attempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals 
negating the leadership of the communist party of china and the 
socialist system and violating the constitution he said 
upon hearing the broadcast people swarmed toward tiananmen 
square where about 100000 people already were gathered thousands 
were clustered on nearby streets 
the students vowed to remain until the government meets their 
demands which include a dialogue on political reforms press 
freedom and an end to official corruption they called on 
classmates to remain passive if troops tried to force them out 
tonight we have to stay here for the future of china said a 
student from the central city of hangzhou 
i thought we were close to victory now i see its far away 
said another 
about 3000 students began a hunger strike in the square on 
saturday and agreed late friday to end it but they revoked that 
decision after lis announcement 
communist party chief zhao accompanied by li visited some of 
the strikers before dawn boarding buses where they had sought 
shelter from a rainstorm 
i came too late too late i should be criticized by you 
strikers quoted zhao as saying students of beijing normal 
university said zhao had tears in his eyes as he spoke to them and 
autographed their hats and shirts 
he said the problems you have raised will eventually be 
resolved but he made no concrete offer the students said 
he was very sincere he was sympathetic and understanding 
said chen hong a 22yearold math major who spoke with difficulty 
through cracked lips 
the students said li stayed a few minutes and said little 
two sources said zhao offered to resign after his four fellow 
members on the standing committee of the politburo the partys 
highest decisionmaking body rejected his proposal that they reach 
an agreement with the protesters 
the committee said the matter would have to be considered by a 
larger party body either the entire politburo or the central 
committee 
tens of thousands of people arrived by train from across china 
today to parade around tiananmen many young people and workers 
marched along with truckloads of uniformed police and army and navy 
cadets 
messages were chalked on walls throughout the city criticizing 
senior leader deng xiaoping the prestigious chinese academy of 
social sciences took up the call for deng to retire by stretching a 
banner across a driveway of the great hall of the people which 
faces tiananmen square 
deng 84 reportedly wanted to crack down on the students when 
they began their protests in midapril but was unable to because of 
their large numbers and strong public support

they are both principals of tough urban middle 
schools they both won national education awards this year they 
also happen to be married 
theres a wicked rivalry said thomas p oneill a 1989 
readers digest american hero in education that makes us better 
principals because we have twice as many ideas 
his wife and fellow principal mary grassa oneill claimed a 
top honor from the us department of education 
i think it carries over to the staff grassa oneill said 
initially we didnt think about it at all she said but 
then the timilty school headed by grassa oneill and her 
husbands solomon lewenberg middle school began vying for the same 
firstplace finishes in test scores and the same grant money and 
students 
when boston school test scores were released recently timilty 
school staff members were chagrined to place second in reading to 
lewenberg but they took comfort in the fact that their average in 
all subjects put them ahead of lewenberg grassa oneill said 
i always tell the staff that timilty is the best school 
compared to all the others oneill joked 
students seem to enjoy the principal connection 
thursday as the oneills toured a timilty classroom a student 
in the front of the class whispered is that your husband when 
grassa oneill nodded yes heads all over the classroom whipped 
in oneills direction 
both oneills command schools in highcrime areas and have to 
cope with the daily realities of innercity school life a security 
officer monitors visitors at timilty a precaution grassa oneill 
said is taken at most innercity schools 
the oneills national awards didnt involve direct headtohead 
competition 
grassa oneills school was one of 218 singled out for 
excellence by the us department of education schools were 
nominated by the state and then subjected to intensive onsite 
visits the award reflected the performance of the entire school 
right down to the custodians grassa oneill said 
oneill and his school were nominated for their efforts in 
turning lewenberg around once on the brink of closure it not only 
has the highest reading scores of all 22 boston middle schools but 
has seen its retention rate soar from the third lowest to the third 
highest 
readers digest gave oneill 5000 and the school 10000 
grassa oneill didnt get any money but she will be honored this 
fall at a ceremony in the white house rose garden 
both found out about their awards in april and were 
terrifically excited they said but grassa oneills 
excitement was tinged with sadness because she found out at the 
same time that five of her teachers were being laid off as part of 
a citywide budget crunch 
the couple met in 1969 as english teachers at a middle school 
they married in 1975 and have 4yearold twins 
two of everything oneill laughed 
in 1984 thomas was appointed principal of solomon lewenberg 
one year later grassa oneill got the top post at timilty 
the oneills said they dont have their eyes on the 
superintendents office just yet because theyre fully occupied 
with their present posts 
i think the biggest challenge is trying to keep everybody 
motivated all the time sometimes thats tough grassa oneill 
said 
that as well as the sort of awesome responsbility that running 
a school can be on some days oneill said

him with the murder of dr kathryn hinnant in her bellevue hospital 
officelaboratory late jan 7 
we now admit he committed the crime said smiths lawyer 
marvyn kornberg but we say he did not know what he was doing

commit the crime 
smith arrested jan 9 at a mens shelter originally had said 
he helped an accomplice named john strangle the 33yearold woman 
while robbing her he claimed it was john alone who raped her 
kornberg said lab tests show that semen and some of the blood at 
the scene came from smith the lawyer said this shows there was no 
john and therefore smith is delusional

a teenager who attends a sixstudent church 
school in great bend kan walked away friday with the 
championship of the first national geography bee and a 25000 
college scholarship 
jack staddon 6foot6 and 15 years old correctly named a flat 
intermountain area in the central andes to defeat michael shannon 
14 of reading mass the answer was altiplano 
shannon finishing second will receive a 15000 scholarship 
while kieu luu the thirdplace winner from landover md won a

national geographic society and open to students in grades 48 the 
55 state and territorial winners aged 10 to 15 were in washington 
this week for semifinals and the 10 top winners competed friday 
moderator alex trebek host of the longrunning tv trivia quiz 
show jeopardy used maps and slides in questioning contestants 
on everything from zanzibars most profitable 19th century trading 
commodity cloves to the two points connected by the alaskan 
pipeline valdez and prudhoe bay 
staddon said he studied geography trivia cards and read through 
a college geography book in preparation for the contest 
nevertheless with competitors allowed to miss only two 
questions before being eliminated he blew his first question in 
both the final and semifinal rounds 
on thursday shown a slide of the grand canyon staddon missed 
its location by a state or two i said utah he recalled with a 
rueful grin it is actually in arizona 
and on friday asked by trebek to identify an unusual 
modernistic building he replied after a long pause new york i 
dont know the correct answer was the sydney opera house 
i had no idea what that was staddon said laughing after 
winning the bee i remember reading about that in my book but i 
had no idea what it looked like if i had to do this again i would 
concentrate more on the pictures rather than on maps 
staddon said there are two thirdgraders two seventhgraders a 
firstgrader and an eighthgrader himself at the great bend 
seventh day adventist elementary school he attends he said he 
wants to follow in the footsteps of his father and become a church 
pastor 
the national geography bee set to become an annual event is 
part of a campaign by the national geographic society to improve

among the bottom third in geographic knowledge those aged 1824 
came in last 
the geography bee was modeled on a new jersey bee where sen 
bill bradley dnj was the host i never thought id 
appreciate a theft but i certainly appreciate this one bradley 
said before the finals began 
i hope were beginning a tradition here said trebek i 
hope ill be asked to do this again for many many years to come

zhao ziyang in his first known rebellion against 
his mentor senior leader deng xiaoping has chosen to resign as 
head of the worlds largest communist party rather than endorse a 
crackdown on students demonstrating for democracy sources said 
as of friday night zhaos resignation offer had yet to be 
decided on by his colleagues in the party the chinese sources said 
however his failure to appear with premier li peng and other 
top party and government leaders when it was announced the military 
would move in to end the student unrest appeared to make zhaos 
break with the leadership irrevocable 
his rebellion contrasts with the fate of his predecessor hu 
yaobang who was forced to step down in january 1987 after failing 
to crack down on earlier nationwide student protests it was hus 
death april 15 that triggered the new student movement 
zhao 69 tried repeatedly in recent weeks to defuse mounting 
tensions between authorities suspicious of any unofficial political 
activity and students demanding a free press an end to official 
corruption and other reforms 
he reportedly sent representatives to campus to talk to students 
after their marches drew hundreds of thousands of cheering 
residents into the streets 
zhao was the first toplevel official to endorse student calls 
for dialogue after the party mouthpiece the peoples daily 
condemned the student movement as a planned conspiracy aimed at 
overthrowing the government 
he spoke april 27 as 150000 students and supporters marched 
triumphantly through beijing streets to tiananmen square in the 
first display of the widespread public support for their movement 
deng reportedly issued orders to stop that march but the crowds 
of citizens who swarmed to screen the students from police and 
soldiers made it impossible without bloodshed 
zhao used the student movement to trot out of the closet 
proposals for political reform that had been largely shelved since 
last summer worsening economic problems including inflation 
running at an annual rate of near 30 percent had weakened his hand 
and strengthened the position of officials such as premier li who 
favored moving more slowly on both economic and political reforms 
after students began their hunger strike in the square a week 
ago only zhao impressed the fasters as sincere in his pleas for 
them to stop and his promises that authorities were trying to 
implement reforms 
however the students said he spoke only as an individual and 
not for the government 
zhao was born in october 1919 to a landowning family in central 
chinas henan province he joined the communist party in 1938 and 
headed the party committee in his native county for most of the 
193745 chinajapan war 
unlike the previous generation of party leaders he did not take 
part in the 193435 long march the 7700mile trek from 
nationalist government troops in eastern china to the northwest 
after the communist victory in 1949 zhao spent most of his 
career in regional government and party posts he was purged during 
the 196676 far leftist cultural revolution as was deng but was 
rehabilitated in the 1970s 
he gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of 
dengs home province sichuan where he implemented dengs policies 
of dismantling communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for 
extra work 
deng brought zhao to beijing as vice premier in 1980 he became 
premier six months later replacing hua guofeng he was made acting 
party secretary in january 1987 after fellow reformer hu yaobang 
was forced to resign 
zhao was confirmed in the post at an october 1987 party 
conference in which his keynote speech emphasized increasing 
production over ideological issues he also announced dengs theory 
that china was in a primary stage of socialism during which 
time private ownership of businesses was permissible 
at the same congress a new party politburo standing committee 
was constituted made up of zhao premier li peng yao yilin qiao 
shi and hu qili 
by putting li and yao relative conservatives on the standing 
committee with liberalleaning zhao and hu qili deng may have been 
trying to prevent either faction from becoming powerful enough to 
discard him qiao a pragmatist was the swing vote 
the setup made deng an essential arbiter between the two 
factions a role he apparently relished 
in the end zhaos failure to win over the conservatives in the 
standing committee and dengs adamant refusal to compromise with 
the students may have forced zhao to step down

a new generation of college students has 
discovered something old ballroom dancing and in the best 
intercollegiate tradition theyre turning it into a competition 
you get to dance in someone elses arms and you get to get 
dressed up its something we never did said lara manzione 19 
president of brown universitys ballroom dance club other 
generations grew up with it but its new for us 
the competition in newport this weekend will pit students from 
14 ivy league and other northeastern colleges against one another 
doing the fox trot chacha and tango 
manzione a sophomore and her partner will be one of 
approximately 30 student couples from schools such as brown 
princeton dartmouth massachusetts institute of technology the 
university of massachusetts and the university of connecticut 
competing at the festival there also will be an adult competition 
in all some 100 couples are slated to take part in the fest 
the collegiate dance craze began at the ivy league schools but 
has filtered through to other campuses said skip jones president 
of friends of ballroom dancing which is sponsoring the festival 
nearly 30 colleges in the united states have ballroom dance 
clubs about half in the northeast he said brown started its club 
this year and already has 60 members said manzione 
in the last three years interest in ballroom dancing has 
tripled said jones who is also the united states amateur 
ballroom dance associations new england college coordinator 
i think what is happening to ballroom dancing in general is 
that the younger generation sees rock has reached its peak and is 
starting to fade said jones in particular the yuppie crowd 
is starting to attend charity balls and discover that their music 
isnt there 
a renewed interest in formal weddings also has prompted some to 
take dance lessons he said

president corazon aquino on friday 
refused to allow ferdinand marcos to return home to die and said 
her government wont permit him to be buried here despite a last 
appeal from his wife 
the 71yearold marcos was in critical condition friday in a 
honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery hospital 
officials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal cardiac 
and pulmonary failure 
marcos wife imelda broadcast an appeal friday to mrs aquino 
to allow her husband to die in his homeland and his supporters 
threatened mass protests if the request is rejected 
but mrs aquino refused to withdraw her ban on marcos and the 
philippine supreme court rejected a petition from the former 
presidents lawyer juan david to order the return marcos has 
lived in hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular 
uprising that propelled mrs aquino to power 
i would like first of all to convey to the family of mr 
marcos that i do pray that he will still recover from this latest 
critical illness mrs aquino said i regret very much it is 
not possible for us to allow him to return 
she said she has said in the past that we will not allow his 
remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to 
avoid any untoward incidents 
mrs aquino whose government has survived six coup attempts 
has cited national security in refusing previous requests 
in a statement broadcast by a promarcos radio station mrs 
marcos said she has tried to telephone mrs aquino from hawaii but 
was told the president was busy 
maria elena cruz mrs aquinos daughter and personal secretary 
said the president received no calls from mrs marcos 
mrs marcos said she was trying to contact the president to 
make a last appeal to madame corazon aquino to open her heart and 
let ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition 
my countrymen i am appealing to each and every one of you to 
pray that hopefully mrs aquino will know that bringing home 
marcos will bring true reconciliation true peace and unity for our 
country mrs marcos said this is whats best for the 
country 
mrs aquino had said earlier i regret to inform mrs marcos 
if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration because as i have 
said in the past much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i 
still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of 
filipinos 
when told of mrs aquinos statement mrs marcos said we are 
aware but i am a believer and i am an optimist i know miracles 
can happen 
marcos supporters meanwhile announced they would hold rallies 
saturday to pray for his recovery promarcos leaders warned the 
former presidents death in exile would trigger demonstrations 
we expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action 
said promarcos lawyer oliver lozano we refer to the tactical 
alliances of the military labor sector and student sector 
but the chief of staff gen renato de villa said the armed 
forces would accept mrs aquinos decision and was prepared to 
block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble 
we will do everything in our power to see to it that law and 
order prevail de villa told reporters we will follow any 
decision by the executive branch

a koreanamerican businessman was convicted 
friday of conspiring to export deadly nerve gas bombs to iran 
the jury however acquitted juwhan yun 48 of short hills of 
attempting to send the gas 500 quarterton boms of the nerve gas 
overseas no such gas was in yuns possession but he discussed the 
deal with an undercover agent 
yun did not react when the verdict was announced early on the 
third day of deliberations his wife prayed silently and later 
sobbed outside the courtroom 
us district judge h lee sarokin set sentencing for july 13 
yun could receive up to five years in prison 
the last chapter hasnt been written said yuns attorney 
stephen dratch it appears the verdict very well may have been 
inconsistent because the governments evidence was directed at 
both charges he said 
dratch said he would ask sarokin to set the guilty verdict aside 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said he was pleased by the 
verdict and that justice military and fbi officials were 
considering further charges 
in pretrial hearings prosecutors said classified documents were 
found at the summit office of yuns importexport business and 
that yun maintained contacts at us military bases and with 
officials in the chinese yugoslav and south korean militaries 
alito declined to give further details 
dratch countered that he and his client dont know what 
theyre talking about he said he has yet to see the allegedly 
classified documents 
during the nearly threeweek trial dratch argued that yun was 
entrapped by an undercover agent from the customs service posing as 
an arms dealer he maintained that the agent used economic coercion 
to entrap yun 
alito said entrapment was the usual defense argument when people 
are caught in such stings without doing these undercover 
operations its virtually impossible to enforce the arms export 
laws he said 
sarokin had instructed jurors that in order to convict they had 
to find that the government proved decisively that yun was not 
entrapped 
the prosecution and defense agreed that yun contacted the 
undercover agent while looking for legal ammunition discussed 
buying a type of nerve gas called sarin for iran and called off the 
deal jan 11 
that was the day before he was arrested at customs offices near 
newark international airport at what he thought was to be a meeting 
with customs official richard kennan 
the prosecution however argued to jurors that yun only 
temporarily called off the deal and intended to renew it 
yun said he had no intention of shipping anything illegal and 
only discussed the illegal deals to secure the 105mm and 106mm 
ammunition

president mengistu haile mariam 
appeared to regain control in ethiopia on friday as a fourday 
revolt by mutinous soldiers faded under the guns of loyalist troops 
nearly the entire high command of this marxist government has 
been killed a western diplomat said in an attempted coup led by 
generals humiliated in a string of recent defeats against rebels in 
northern ethiopia 
if we move into a night of the long knives it the high 
command will be gutted even more the diplomat said therell 
be a certain amount of retribution 
despite reports of continued scattered fighting the government 
confidently said it has thoroughly smashed the rebellion 
briefing foreign ambassadors in the capital friday foreign 
minister berhanu bayih said the revolt was crushed at the center 
here in addis ababa within hours tuesday evening 
lingering resistance was stamped out thursday when loyal 
soldiers of the 2nd army killed their commander and his 
collaborators in asmara ethiopias secondlargest city and 
capital of the northernmost province of eritrea 
it was a very selfconfident briefing by the minister said 
a western diplomat i think mengistu has got back in the saddle 
he has shown a degree of efficiency and ruthlessness that 
might have surprised some the diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity 
but the envoy noted the military situation in the north is 
going to be substantially eroded 
mengistus troops have been fighting secessionist rebels in 
eritrea and another rebel group seeking autonomy for the 
neighboring province of tigre 
but they have consistently lost ground to the rebels despite 
massive military aid from the soviet union which counts ethiopia 
as its staunchest african ally 
the high command was virtually gutted the diplomat said of 
the reported deaths of at least eight rebellious generals and the 
countrys defense minister who was killed by the mutineers six 
dissident generals are said to have been killed in the asmara 
fighting 
mengistu in a radio and tv broadcast to the nation thursday 
night promised his revolutionary forces will liquidate his 
enemies 
plotters had committed treason by attempting to join hands 
with secessionist and rebel movements in northern ethiopia the 
president said 
the tide turned for the mutineers thursday when three loyal 
units of the 2nd army moved on asmara from neighboring towns 
recapturing the radio station and killing the armys commander 
maj gen denissie bulto according to berhanu 
the counterrevolt came only hours after the rebel eritrean 
peoples liberation front announced it was calling a twoweek 
ceasefire to boost the dissidents chances of ousting mengistu 
in a clandestine radio broadcast the rebels said their leaders 
had met with 2nd army commanders to discuss the best way to 
intensify the struggle against the common enemy 
one western diplomat speculated that the fighting within the 2nd 
army may have been a backlash against the rapprochement with the 
eplf 
the foreign minister said the coup leaders flew elite 
paratroopers to addis ababa from asmara basing half at the 
international airport and the rest at an old airport converted to a 
military compound on the outskirts of the city 
on tuesday five of the ringleaders met at the defense ministry 
berhanu said shortly after some of them had seen mengistu off on a 
state visit to east germany 
as they were meeting berhanu said the defense minister maj 
gen haile giorgis habte mariam courageously confronted the 
plotters and was killed by one of them 
two of the coup leaders both generals were killed in a 
subsequent gunfight at the defense ministry a third was captured 
thursday in addis ababa and troops still are hunting for two more 
berhanu said 
he said the rebel paratroopers at the international airport 
surrendered without resistance wednesday but those at the old 
airport put up a 45minute fight before they too gave up 
mengistu abandoned his visit to east germany and returned him 
wednesday night to crush the coup attempt 
with a clique of fellow army officers mengistu seized power 
after ousting emperor haile selassie in a sept 12 1974 
revolution he inherited the northern insurrections from selassie 
who annexed eritrea in 1962

storm damage to helicopters and buildings at 
the armys fort hood in texas will cost at least 600 million to 
repair the service said friday 
the army said it had so far pegged last weeks storm damage to 
almost 200 helicopters at 585 million damage to buildings and 
other facilities was put at 15 million 
detailed exact cost repair figures are not available said 
lt col john chapla an army spokesman who provided the 
preliminary estimate 
the storm packing heavy rain and winds of 95 miles per hour 
ravaged the area on may 13 although there were no fatalities the 
storm forced 25 military families from their quarters and damaged 
the helicopters and at least 20 percent of the forts buildings 
the damage occurred even though the army said about half the 
helicopters had been placed inside hangars as the storm approached 
and the remainder were tied down 
especially hard hit was the armys new fleet of ah64 attack 
helicopters fort hood is home to the apache training brigade and 
the damage forced the base to downgrade its state of aviation 
readiness 
about 100 of the forts 150 apaches were damaged to some extent 
and 30 or more were extensively damaged according to the army 
each apache made by mcdonnell douglas helicopter in mesa 
ariz costs about 134 million new it is designed to replace the 
vietnam warera ah1 cobra as the nations premiere tankkiller and 
battlefield helicopter it can carry laserhoming hellfire missiles 
or hydra 70 rockets and has a 30mm chain gun 
while the apache fleet was hardest hit other choppers damaged 
by the storm included uh60 blackhawk transports uh1 huey 
transports oh58 observation copters ah1 cobra attack copters 
and ch47 transports 
chapla said the army had no timetable for repairs nor did it 
know where the money would come from some discussions have been 
held on capitol hill about a supplemental appropriation but those 
talks are in a very preliminary stage chapla said 
we also dont have a whole lot of experience in stormdamage 
repair we have experience in crash repairs and repairs of war 
damage fixing all of these aircraft is not going to be a quick 
thing he said 
the spokesman said the dollar estimates could climb since just 
determining everything thats wrong is going to take time

the agriculture department attempted friday to 
answer that notsoancient question which came first chicken or 
beef theres a bone of contention 
forecasts have put us per capita beef consumption at the 
lowest level since the early 1960s poultry consumption which was 
less than half of beef in 1966 is expected to rival beef this year 
not necessarily true says usda economist judith putnam in a new 
issue of national food review quarterly magazine published by the 
departments economic research service 
for some years statistics watchers have seen poultry 
consumption overtake and then pass annual beef consumption by 
american consumers there have been many reasons including prices 
shifts in diet preferences and health concerns about red meat 
in 1987 it happened for the first time according to the 
department per capita consumption of poultry exceeded that of beef 
778 pounds to 734 unds for the year 
the gap widened even further in 1988 with total poultry 
estimated at 803 pounds per capita against 727 pounds for beef 
and the forecast for 1989 shows poultry at 844 pounds and beef at 
699 pounds 
but those estimates are on the basis of retail cuts putnam 
said and those include bones take away the bones and the figures 
change 
according to the boneless basis shown in her report beef has 
never lost the lead in the annual race for first place in the 
palates of consumers in 1987 for example boneless beef led 
boneless poultry which includes chicken and turkey by 692 
pounds to 553 pounds 
last year beef led poultry 686 pounds to 571 pounds per 
capita and the outlook for 1989 is beef leading poultry 659 to 60 
pounds 
regardless of how its sliced boned or not the figures do show 
something else per capita consumption of poultry is increasing 
while beef is declining 
total red meat consumption is something else at an expected 
1354 pounds of retail weight per capita consumption of beef 
veal lamb and pork leads total poultrys 844 pounds on a 
boneless basis red meat is expected to be ahead 1124 to 60 pounds 
per capita consumption of fish and shell fish without bones 
was put at 154 pounds in 1989 unchanged since 1986 no boneless 
figures for fish were included

no evidence of fuel contaminated by pcbs has been 
found in a week of spot checks of oil tanker trucks entering canada 
from the united states officials said but theyll expand tests to 
include other toxic waste 
canadas environment department ordered the random testing may 
12 alerted by reports in the globe and mail newspaper that 
solvents waste oil and the polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
have been mixed into fuels illegally and sold in western new york 
and canada it said the practice had been going on for four years 
jack trip chairman of the newly created federal task force on 
tainted fuels was quoted by the globe and mail on friday as saying 
about 40 federal inspectors will continue inspections for a 
considerable amount of time it will be on the basis of spot 
checks we wont be at the border 24 hours a day 
samples will be analyzed for substances other than pcbs in the 
order of weeks if not days trip said 
an environment department spokesman said its officers had 
analyzed 360 samples 
nothing has been found so far said spokesman k shikaze 
this week the department restricted oil tanker trucks to 
entering canada at 31 of 125 border crossings to control the entry 
of any tainted products 
the globe and mail report quoted unidentified law enforcement 
sources and unnamed participants in what it said was lucrative 
illicit trafficking 
pcbs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical 
transformers but have been banned in northern america because they 
have been linked with cancer 
lawbreakers could avoid expensive disposal fees for pcbs and 
other hazardous substances and boost profits by diluting fuel

the message that seems to have 
emerged from northern irelands latest election is that peace is a 
long way off and people would like to get on with their lives in 
the meantime 
as the lengthy vote count wound up friday night a small but 
consistent shrinking was evident on the extremes of both sides of 
the religious divide and a strengthening of the center 
but there were also enough quirks and surprises to show that for 
many ordinary voters there are more immediate issues than ones 
national allegiances or the church one attends 
northern ireland averages nearly one election a year and rarely 
do they make a difference the protestants vote for protestant 
parties roman catholics for catholic parties 
the latest election to choose the 26 district councils 
contained no huge surprises 
the protestants who outnumber catholics 32 got most of the 
councils the main change was a slump of 6 percent for the rev ian 
paisleys hardline democratic unionists 
at the other end sinn fein the irish republican armys 
political backer lost some ground to the larger more moderate 
social democratic and labor party which turned in its best local 
election performance ever 
sinn feins losses were in the countryside in the catholic 
ghettoes of belfast its bastion the sinn fein vote held firm 
against sdlp advances and it remains the largest catholic party in 
a capital once again under protestant government 
the party leaders gathered in tv studios to discuss the outcome 
and engaged instead in a strident dialogue of the deaf 
paisley and james molyneux the two protestant party leaders 
stuck firmly to basics the 1985 angloirish agreement had to go 
before there could be any progress 
sdlp leader john hume retorted that the agreement was here to 
stay and he would brook no attempt to put it on ice 
there was no hint of compromise 
protestants revile the agreement because it gives the irish 
government a say in the running of northern ireland and most 
protestants regard ireland as a foreign country bent on dissolving 
northern irelands union with britain 
paisley argued that the british governments refusal to listen 
to protestant views on the agreement made voters apathetic and led 
to his partys slump 
but his critics said it was his disruptive antiagreement 
tactics and the paralysis they brought to local government that 
hurt him most 
people were most concerned about the daytoday issues cuts 
in housing attempts to interfere with the health service social 
security said hume he attributed the sdlps successes to the 
fact that those are the issues we fought the election on 
the election handed out many small victories that pointed to an 
electorate yearning for normalcy 
in larne for instance the rev pat buckley a popular catholic 
priest was elected on a largely protestant vote buckley promised 
to work for the community on the breadandbutter issues and his 
religion clearly made no difference 
in magherafelt mary mcsorley was elected as an independent 
after she was expelled from the sdlp for affronting irish 
nationalist sensibilities by accepting an honor from queen 
elizabeth ii 
the voters clearly admired her social work which won her the 
award and she was not only elected but holds the balance of power 
on the council 
in londonderry an ira stronghold protestant ken kerr defeated 
a machinepicked candidate with his promise to talk to catholic 
adversaries we have to start talking to people he said all 
around the world were seen as intransigent bigots and were not 
but we have to prove it 
sinn feins worst setback was in fermanagh the only district it 
captured outright in the 1985 local election it lost half its 
seats 
fermanagh happens to be where an ira bomb killed 11 protestants 
in november 1987 and sinn feins reputation was badly tarnished 
the protestant unionists now in charge of fermanagh have long 
advocated cooperation with the sdlp 
that is already happening in neighboring dungannon where 
unionist and sdlp councilors are in alliance to shut out the 
militants on both sides 
analyst paul arthur said fermanagh voters had looked at 
dungannon and taken that on board thats the sort of thing they 
want to see 
it gives you some hope for the future said a local sdlp 
leader austin currie 
there was a time when you only had to mention dungannon and 
you thought of divisiveness bigotry and discrimination he said 
id like to think that there may be a lesson for northern ireland 
as a whole that if people are given leadership they are prepared 
to follow the path of partnership and responsibilitysharing

the government and opposition parties 
friday tentatively agreed that former president chun doohwan would 
testify on alleged corruption and human rights abuse under his rule 
ruling party officials indicated chun would testify once before 
the national assembly before that happens however they said 
unspecified conditions must be met by the opposition 
there was no immediate comment from chun who lives in exile in 
a remote temple and it was not known when he might testify 
the agreement considered a major breakthrough could help 
settle a yearlong dispute over the legacies of chuns 
authoritarian rule 
chun who left office in february in november apologized to the 
nation but the three main opposition parties have called for a 
full accounting and said that he and top lieutenants should be 
prosecuted for wrongdoing 
dissidents and radical students have staged demonstrations to 
demand chun and his associates be punished 
fortyseven people including 13 members of chuns family have 
been charged with embezzlement and abuse of power but chun himself 
has not been touchedpresident roh taewoo has asked the nation to 
pardon chun 
among other abuses many south koreans accuse chun of having 
crushed a civil uprising in the city of kwangju in 1980 that 
resulted in 192 deaths chun was a senior army general when armed 
protesters opposing a declaration of martial law seized the 
southern provincial capital 
chun took power with military backing a few months after the 
uprising 
roh one of chuns key allies has introduced broad reforms 
since he took office in february 1988 but dissidents charge roh 
has failed to fully address past wrongdoings a key factor in their 
demands for his resignation 
in kwangju friday antigovernment protests marking the 
anniversary of the nineday uprising continued with thousands of 
protesters marching to demand the overthrow of rohs government 
the protesters also accused the government of covering up 
alleged police involvement in the death of lee cholkyu a 
dissident student whose body was found in a reservoir near kwangju 
on may 10 
dissidents said friday they would appeal to amnesty 
international if the government refuses to perform a new autopsy on 
lees body dissidents have demanded an independent investigation 
into the cause of his death 
in seoul relatives of victims of the kwangju uprising called 
friday for an end to political exploitation of the incident and 
demanded the government provide compensation to families of those 
killed 
we have suffered enough mentally and physically park 
chanbong who heads the family association of victims of kwangjus 
prodemocracy movement we must not be exploited any more for 
political purposes park said he claimed his group represents 
the majority of relatives of victims killed in the 1980 uprising 
and they feel their loss of loved ones is being exploited by 
political games 
our efforts should not be used for any political groups trying 
to promote their cause park said 
dissidents and radical students lack public support in their 
calls for rohs overthrow because of their violent tactics and 
extremist views

israeli foreign minister moshe arens urged the 
united states friday to promote his governments peace initiative 
and to head an international fundraising drive for 2 billion to 
rehabilitate palestinian refugees in the west bank and gaza strip 
us officials said that although the united states will do what 
it can many questions remain about the israeli proposals and the 
next steps must be up to the israelis and palestinians themselves 
arens presented his governments newly adopted fourpoint 
initiative to vice president dan quayle after discussing it a day 
earlier with secretary of state james a baker iii 
quayle endorsed the plan in principle but said he wanted to 
hear more details said vice presidential spokesman david 
beckwith the spokesman said arens and quayle did not discuss the 
fundraising request or specifics of the israeli proposal to hold 
elections among the 17 million palestinians of the occupied west 
bank and gaza 
arens reiterated friday that he had sought to convince baker and 
other us officials that details of the plan being sought by the 
united states and arab countries should be discussed only once its 
implementation begins 
discussing details endangers acceptance of the plan he said 
the united states can assure its allies that regardless of the 
details israel accepts the principle that there must be free and 
democratic elections he said israel is not panama and shamir is 
not panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega arens said 
i hope i was successful in convincing my interlocuters here 
of that view he added 
the important thing now is for the united states to fully 
endorse the proposal in principle and push for its acceptance with 
arab and nonarab states arens told reporters 
we feel its now the turn of the united states at bat to 
declare wholehearted and unreserved support for this initiative 
arens said 
but baker told arens that while the united states would 
continue our efforts to advance peace we believe that the 
parties must bear the major responsibility to ensure movement 
forward in the process said state department spokesman richard 
boucher 
much work needs to be done but this proposal is certainly a 
good start in the right direction he added 
boucher declined to discuss elements of the plan which includes 
the rehabilitation of some 300000 palestinians living in refugee 
camps 
the united states views the elections as the centerpiece of the 
israeli plan but arens appeared to be trying to shift some of the 
emphasis away from the controversial election proposal to the 
rehabilitation idea 
arens said he had brought a letter from prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to president bush asking the united states to spearhead an 
international campaign to raise an estimated 2 billion to provide 
new housing education and jobs for the palestinian refugees 
israel has also raised the refugee rehabilitation proposal with 
japan and arens will ask the european economic community for its 
help when he meets with the group in brussels next week he said 
oilrich arab states which in the past have refused to provide 
financing for such projects could also take part if they want he 
added 
arens said he views the rehabilitation plan as a concrete 
response to the frustrations that spawned an 18month palestinian 
uprising in which almost 500 palestinians have been killed 
the proposed elections would let palestinians elect 
representatives who would negotiate with the israelis for selfrule 
but the proposal does not answer some of the question which the 
arabs view as most pressing such as whether the plo will be given 
a role in elections and whether international supervision will be 
allowed

the agriculture department attempted friday to 
answer that notsoancient question which comes first chicken or 
beef theres a bone of contention 
forecasts have put us per capita beef consumption at the 
lowest level since the early 1960s poultry consumption which was 
less than half of beef in 1966 is expected to rival beef this year 
not necessarily true says usda economist judith putnam in a new 
issue of national food review quarterly magazine published by the 
departments economic research service 
for some years statistics watchers have seen poultry 
consumption overtake and then pass annual beef consumption by 
american consumers there have been many reasons including prices 
shifts in diet preferences and health concerns about red meat 
in 1987 it happened for the first time according to the 
department per capita consumption of poultry exceeded that of beef 
778 pounds to 734 pounds for the year 
the gap widened even further in 1988 with total poultry 
estimated at 803 pounds per capita against 727 pounds for beef 
and the forecast for 1989 shows poultry at 844 pounds and beef at 
699 pounds 
but those estimates are on the basis of retail cuts putnam 
said and those include bones take away the bones and the figures 
change 
according to the boneless basis shown in her report beef has 
never lost the lead in the annual race for first place in the 
palates of consumers in 1987 for example boneless beef led 
boneless poultry which includes chicken and turkey by 692 
pounds to 553 pounds 
last year beef led poultry 686 pounds to 571 pounds per 
capita and the outlook for 1989 is beef leading poultry 659 to 60 
pounds 
regardless of how its sliced boned or not the figures do show 
something else per capita consumption of poultry is increasing 
while beef is declining 
total red meat consumption is something else at an expected 
1354 pounds of retail weight per capita consumption of beef 
veal lamb and pork leads total poultrys 844 pounds on a 
boneless basis red meat is expected to be ahead 1124 to 60 pounds 
per capita consumption of fish and shell fish without bones 
was put at 154 pounds in 1989 unchanged since 1986 no boneless 
figures for fish were included

the us and west german governments made 
progress toward bridging their differences in two days of talks 
over nato shortrange nuclear missiles west german defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg said today 
the overall discussions were very very encouraging 
stoltenberg said after concluding a second round of meetings with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and before a session with 
vice president dan quayle 
the defense minister declined to go into detail on whether the 
two sides had reached agreement until he reports back to his 
government in bonn but as he sat down to talks with quayle he 
said 
we work for a common position so we have to argue and try to 
come together and we made progress 
baker and stoltenberg were working towards a gentlemans 
agreement on the missile dilemma prior to a critical nato meeting 
in brussels but no final accord was due and the usgerman 
discussions were expected to continue next week said a diplomatic 
source close to the discussions 
after their talks baker left for president bushs retreat in 
kennebunkport maine for meetings touching on the nato problem and 
sessions with french president francois mitterrand on saturday 
the defense minister after the meeting with quayle was 
returning to bonn for talks sunday with chancellor helmut kohl the 
diplomatic source said 
the state department meeting the second in as many days between 
baker and stoltenberg took place as a senior government source in 
bonn reported the two sides had reached a compromise on the knotty 
problem 
the us government has agreed to support the concept of 
negotiations to reduce shortrange missiles based in europe in 
return for west german assurances at next weeks nato summit that 
the talks would not be aimed at total elimination of those weapons 
the source said 
the government official said west germany would go along with 
the rest of the alliance at its may 2930 summit on a statement of 
unity that would make it clear nato does not yet seek the 
elimination of shortrange nuclear weapons only reductions 
the shortrange upgrade project known as modernization has 
been shelved until at least 1991 the official said 
the diplomatic source who spoke on condition he not be named 
said stoltenbergs aim was to indicate a new flexibility on 
bonns part and sound the american side out about the timing of 
possible ussoviet negotiations involving the shortrange weapons 
the united states has steadfastly balked at the notion of 
starting such talks fearing they could lead to stripping europe of 
all shortrange nuclear weapons and leave the west vulnerable to 
the superior conventional warsaw pact forces 
stoltenberg was to suggest a possible link between a reduction 
of soviet conventional forces in europe with the start of 
negotiations on reducing the number of shortrange nuclear weapons 
the negotiations might not begin until there is significant 
progress toward reductions by the soviets and its allies said 
the diplomatic source 
one proposal would be to form a highlevel nato study group 
which would define the significant progress necessary before 
any ussoviet talks on shortrange missiles could convene the 
source said 
an administration official speaking on the condition he not be 
identified said the west german proposals would be studied closely 
well take a look at what theyre trying to sell but what do 
they mean by significant progress we have to define it the 
official said 
the west germans also oppose a usbritish effort to more than 
triple the range of existing lance missiles to just below 300 
miles the usbuilt lance now can hit targets from about 75 
miles and most of the 88 launchers and 700 singlewarhead missiles 
are based in west germany 
that opposition stems from the fact that the lance is designed 
for battlefield use and if fired from a launcher in west germany 
most probably would strike east and west german territory 
a group of west german parliament members visiting washington 
shared stoltenbergs prediction that some agreement in the missile 
dispute will be reached prior to the nato summit 
theres a new flexibility on both sides the chances we will 
reach an agreement are not 100 percent but given the political 
will theres a good chance we will reach an agreement said 
volcker ruehe the deputy majority leader in parliament in a 
meeting with reporters 
ruehe and three other parliament members said they were pleased 
with the reception they received from officials the state 
department the national security council and on capitol hill 
during their threeday visit 
as for us opposition to any negotiations on the shortrange 
weapons ruehe said hed never met anybody whos said theyd 
never negotiate on shortrange weapons the question is the 
speed of the negotiations 
in any case ruehe said the west german could not make any 
decisions about deploying a modernized version of the weapons until 
after kohls government faces national elections in the fall of 
1990

a toplevel commission friday found evidence of 
gross violations of law by two anticorruption crusaders and 
turned them over to the national prosecutors office for 
investigation 
the report by a commission that included minister of justice 
alexander sukharev and kgb chief vladimir kruchkov brought to a 
head the dispute that started a week ago when one of the 
investigators said the names of politburo member yegor k ligachev 
and other top officials had come up in their inquiry 
this kind of accusation not based on any kind of objective 
evidence is a gross violation of the honor and dignity of the 
individuals which is protected by law said the commission 
which was formed by the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
countrys highest executive body 
it said complaints and evidence from defendants as well as other 
investigators and government officials accused investigators telman 
gdlyan and nikolai ivanov of threatening defendants inducing them 
to implicate others arresting their relatives without evidence 
holding suspects for months without questioning or charges and 
carelessly handling valuables the seized 
the commission said accusations against gdlyan and ivanov have 
a serious basis 
it said it was acting on accusations made by the kgb the 
justice ministry the supreme court and other top national bodies 
gdlyan has been removed as head of an investigation of 
corruption in the republic of uzbekistan that he has headed since 
september 1983 and the accusations were turned over to the soviet 
procurator generals office for careful verification it said 
ivanov said in a preelection debate broadcast may 5 on 
leningrad tv that the names of ligachev former politburo member 
mikhail s solomentsev and other top officials had come up in his 
corruption investigation two days later he won 61 percent of the 
vote in a race with more than two dozen candidates for a 
parliamentary seat representing all of moscow 
ligachev and solomentsev released statements denying any 
wrongdoing and labelling ivanovs statement a political 
provocation they demanded an investigation of the claims be 
carried out and that the results be made public 
ligachev is considered by many a conservative counterforce to 
president mikhail s gorbachev on the politburo and a potential 
rival to the soviet leader he is particularly unpopular among 
radical reformers solomentsev retired from the politburo in 
september 
gdlyan won a parliamentary seat march 26 with about 87 percent 
of the vote in a moscow district both men have become famous 
throughout the country for their investigation of corruption in 
uzbekistan that led to convictions of top local officials and led 
to yuri churbanov the soninlaw of former president leonid i 
brezhnev 
churbanov was convicted of taking bribes in december and 
sentenced to 12 year in a labor camp 
the commissions statement was read on the evening tv news 
program vremya ensuring that millions of soviets would hear it 
the investigators have said repeatedly they are trying to widen 
their investigation to include corruption in the kremlin itself 
but are running into resistance from highly placed officials 
the commission accused them of ignoring the uzbekistan 
investigation it said gdlyan had been in uzbekistan only three 
days this year while ivanov had not been there at all 
it said that the investigators accusatory style of work and 
provocative method of obtaining evidence had damaged president 
mikhail s gorbachevs drive to strengthen the soviet unions 
system of law 
gorbachev a lawyer has said respect for the law must be 
increased to avoid the systematic disregard that characterized the 
purges of the stalin years 
a popular editor on wednesday likened the corruption crusade to 
a soviet version of the watergate scandal 
gdlyan also is under scrutiny for his handling of an 
investigation of a wellknown estonian scientist johannes hint who 
was jailed in 1983 on corruption charges and later died in jail 
the soviet supreme court this month vindicated hint and several 
other codefendants and told the procurator generals office to 
review whether gdlyan should keep his job as a top criminal 
investigator

the youngest person to walk to the north pole said 
friday he wants to inspire kids in places like harlem where he 
grew up to believe in themselves and accomplish their dreams 
darryl roberts suffered frostbite blisters and pain for most of 
the 56day journey but he said he never thought of giving up 
because i believe so much in being able to go back and tell these 
kids the story hoping that it will inspire them 
five days after he set foot or more appropriately skis on 
the pole the 23yearold instructor in outdoor education was in 
balmy london with the seven other members of the arctic team to 
meet prime minister margaret thatcher 
the group walked 480 miles from cape aldrich the northernmost 
point in canada and encountered huge ice walls numerous cracks in 
the ice and temperatures as low as minus 67 
the message they delivered to mrs thatcher is one roberts said 
he wants to get across to american youngsters the pollution 
dangers facing the arctic are symptomatic of environmental dangers 
facing the world and young people must take responsibility for the 
planet they will inherit 
roberts said however i think i have to start with helping 
them to develop greater selfesteem greater selfconfidence 
because when you do that you want better things around you and you 
work toward that 
wearing sandals because of a blister on his heel and still 
sporting a few patches of the frostbite roberts said he has 
learned many things from the first international walk to the north 
pole 
one of the things i learned is that regardless of language 
barriers skin color differences cultural differences when human 
beings get together with a common goal in mind they can get 
that thing done regardless of how difficult the conditions he 
said 
thats exactly what we wanted to prove to the world that 
world powers like the soviet union and the united states can 
cooperate 
lets not count how many more missiles the other guys got 
lets get together on some of these world pollution problems and 
solve them because we can he said 
as a child in the new york city neighborhood of harlem roberts 
said i always knew that there was something more outside of 
where i was living 
helped by an ambitious mother he said he was able to attend a 
private high school he spent a year at northeastern university in 
boston studying engineering before dropping out to teach at outward 
bound an organization that offers wilderness experiences 
british explorer robert swan the expedition leader who became 
the first person to walk to the north and south poles said he 
selected the young man because i wanted darryl to represent a 
group of youngsters in america who no one really seems to be able 
to get through to and people that maybe have lost hope 
he said darryl proved that you can do anything if you really 
try and you keep going 
roberts said it was swans enormous moral support and the 
physical support of soviet physician mikhail malachov that helped 
him through an extremely difficult trip 
what was his feeling when he finally reached the pole 
i was so relieved that i wouldnt have to feel the pain 
anymore and i was almost wrapped in tears because my feet were 
killing me he said 
second was the elation that the entire team had gotten there 
together and that was true to one of our objectives of 
international cooperation 
when roberts returns to new york next week he hopes to start 
lecturing and he would like to meet president bush but his future 
still is uncertain 
this was an incredible risk he said i think im going to 
do something a little more relaxed from now on

sen david boren dokla said friday that he 
advised the white house not to name donald gregg to a top cia post 
because he had become somewhat controversial during the 
irancontra hearings 
when george bush was vice president gregg was his national 
security adviser president bush has since nominated gregg to 
become us ambassador to south korea and the nomination is stuck 
in the senate foreign relations committee 
boren chairman of the senate intelligence committee said he 
acted because he believed that the agency because of the nature 
of its work did not need additional controversy at this time 
it in no way means that i feel that mr gregg should be 
automatically disqualified for other government positions boren 
said 
my personal opinion that he should not be named to a cia post 
was simply based upon my view that he had become somewhat 
controversial during the irancontra hearings boren said 
bushs nomination of gregg to be ambassador to south korea is 
stalled in the foreign relations committee because of greggs 
relationships to key figures in the irancontra affair 
he also faces allegations that he may have been involved 
personally in the illegal resupply of military aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels at a time when that was forbidden by 
congress 
boren said his committee has never held formal discussions about 
greggs qualifications to serve in any post in government 
he added that greggs nomination as ambassador has not prompted 
him to reopen the irancontra investigation 
no one should draw the conclusion that i would support the 
reopening of the irancontra investigation by the congress on a 
major scale boren said the congress has other problems to 
confront the irancontra matter is now appropriately in the 
courts 
boren said that other than helping to resolve problems about 
some of the documents related to the original congressional probe 
i would personally be opposed to reopening the investigation on a 
major scale and have to this point seen no evidence which would 
justify it 
boren said he is not privy to any information regarding gregg 
other than what already has been made public 
greggs nomination is opposed by sen alan cranston dcalif 
who has repeatedly asked the white house to withdraw it 
cranston has vowed to hold additional hearings to probe greggs 
links to the irancontra affair warning that the results might be 
embarrassing to both gregg and the president 
cranston says he is considering calling other witnesses to 
obtain their testimony under oath but has made no decisions 
gregg has told senate supporters he had sought to be named to a 
post for which senate confirmation is needed in order to force the 
issue confront the suspicions about his role and give himself an 
oportunity to clear his name

the us and british embassies friday 
advised their citizens to leave lebanon and the leading beirut 
newspaper predicted a syrian assault on the christian enclave 
defended by gen michel aouns army units 
the us embassy said it was not in a position to arrange 
transportation of citizens from lebanon but americans were 
strongly advised to depart lebanon immediately because of the 
threat posed by the security situation 
an american official at the embassy speaking on condition he 
not be named said there were several hundred americans in 
lebanon most of them dual nationals he refused to be more 
specific 
sixteen embassy employees were evacuated to cyprus on feb 17 
during battles between aoun and the lebanese forces the main 
christian militia that left about 25 in lebanon 
christian radio stations broadcast a statement from the british 
embassy advising the 99 remaining britons to leave lebanon before 
the sea shuttle service stops anew 
ferry service between lebanon and cyprus suspended during the 
heaviest fighting of the past two months resumed last week 
since march 8 beirut has been devastated by artillery duels 
between the aoun forces and a moslem alliance of syrian troops and 
druse militiamen that have killed 359 people and wounded 1393 by 
police count most of the casualties have been civilians 
the us embassy did not explain its timing but the warning 
coincided with a prediction by the daily annahar that the syrians 
would attack to try to oust aoun who heads the christian cabinet 
in lebanons divided government and commands about 20000 men 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league and has become the countrys main 
power broker during 14 years of civil war 
a spokesman for aouns command said christian troops were 
exchanging machine gun fire and rocketpropelled grenades with 
syrians and their allies at souk elgharb southeast of beirut 
no casualties were reported but they fire on us and we fire 
on them this hasnt stopped despite the arab leaguesponsored 
ceasefire the spokesman said by telephone on condition of 
anonymity 
annahar analyst sarkis naaoum said syria will not permit 
the arab league to work out a settlement leaving aoun in charge in 
the 310squaremile enclave north and east of beirut where most of 
lebanons christians live 
repeated efforts by the arab league to implement a truce it 
called april 28 have failed mainly because the syrians and druse 
continue shelling the christian coastline to keep aoun from 
receiving supplies by sea 
naaoum quoted information recently received in east beirut 
the christian sector in saying syria also would not allow the 
emergency arab summit conference due in morocco next week to 
become an arena for confronting its policy in lebanon or 
criticizing it 
the practical translation of these two syrian stands would be 
a serious military escalation different in power and size from the 
flareup recently experienced the analyst wrote the main aim 
of the operation would be to bring aoun down either by 
overthrowing him or by forcing him to step down he said syrias 
plan included destructive bombardment of military facilities in 
the christian enclave and a major offensive by its own soldiers or 
militia allies 
aouns troops and the lebanese forces militia would unite 
against such an offensive said naaoum a wellconnected analyst 
whose columns usually are taken seriously by arab and western 
diplomats 
as he described the military plan the main assault would be 
directed at aouns heavily fortified lines in souk elgharb seven 
miles southeast of beirut 
the strategically located mountain resort commands a network of 
mountain roads leading to the presidential palace at baabda aoun 
and his family have lived in the palace since president amin 
gemayel at the end of his sixyear term last september appointed 
the general to lead a christian government 
gemayel acted when parliament could not agree on a successor 
moslems swore allegiance to salim hoss a sunni moslem who was 
premier under gemayel and the army also split into christian and 
moslem commands 
annahar and other lebanese newspapers reported earlier in the 
week that two syrian mig17 jet fighters flew low over the 
christian enclave monday on an apparent reconnaissance mission

senators made extra money last year selling 
hay pitching jokes collecting pensions writing books and making 
speeches lots of speeches but none had to rely solely on a 
senate salary 
according to financial disclosure statements made public friday 
perhaps onethird of the 100 senators are millionaires and most 
others are wealthy 
most have impressive investments 
and most routinely accepted speaking fees and travel 
reimbursements from specialinterest groups 
heres how some senators supplemented their 89500 senate 
paychecks last year 
alfonse damato rny earned 15000 as a lecturer at cw 
post college in long island ny 
donald riegle dmich made 21 speeches at 1000 apiece to 
washington campus a nonprofit educational organization that 
conducts seminars 
paul simon dill reported 3042 in residuals from four 
appearances on saturday night live 
charles grassley riowa grossed 65000 from five farms but 
after subtracting expenses was left with only 6000 
dale bumpers dark reaped 1760 selling hay off his farm 
bennett johnston dla who heads the senate energy committee 
pocketed 377 in oilwell royalties 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine earned 
22500 in royalties from men of zeal a book he wrote with his 
maine colleague republican sen william cohen which reflected 
their service on the senate committee that investigated the 
irancontra affair 
cohen listed 25763 in royalties including some still coming 
in from a novel he coauthored with exsen gary hart 
alan cranston dcalif received 62906 in pension from his 
service as a california state official and 18246 in social 
security benefits 
robert kerrey dneb who lost a leg in the vietnam war 
reported 18972 from a navy pension 
almost all the 95 senators who filed the required statements 
five were granted extensions reported receiving honoraria which 
usually were fees for making speeches to schools churches and 
specialinterest groups 
sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee listed 46950 in such fees including 10000 from 
elements of the defense industry under the rules he could keep 
only 35800 so he gave 11686 to charity 
richard lugar of indiana senior republican on the agriculture 
committee and former chairman of foreign relations picked up 
72950 for speaking and turned over 37189 to charity his 
audiences ranged from the national pork producers council to the 
national association of arab americans 
wendell ford of kentucky a senior member of the commerce 
committee reported 28500 for speeches many of them to regulated 
groups including the alcohol and tobacco industries that are 
economic powers in his home state 
jake garn rutah former chairman of the banking committee was 
a favorite speaker at financial and banking meetings he was paid 
37700 and gave 2000 to charity 
tom daschle dsd a freshman who serves on the finance 
committee accepted five expensepaid trips four of them with his 
wife they included stops in puerto rico in louisville for the 
kentucky derby in fort lauderdale and miami 
jesse helms rnc and his wife accepted a free fiveday trip 
to paris in connection with american airlines launching nonstop 
service from nashville to paris 
wyche fowler dga was reimbursed by nongovernment interests 
for trips to cuba san francisco and fayetteville ark 
not everything senators touched turned to gold last year 
freshman herbert kohl a multimillionaire did well with his bakery 
stock but his milwaukee bucks national basketball association 
franchise lost 95000 although it generated revenues of 121 
million 
in most cases it is next to impossible to tell a senators 
financial condition from the disclosure statements items of 
income assets and liabilities are listed in broad brackets thus 
6000 interest earned shows up with a value of 5001 to 15000 
a 10 million gain from a property sale would be listed only as 
worth 250001 and up 
some of the wealthiest senators have assets in trusts so the 
statement of edward m kennedy dmass gives no clue that he has 
an interest in trusts worth tens of millions of dollars he has no 
liabilities 
similarly the extensive wealth of jay rockefeller dwva is

two former television news executives 
apologized publicly and were sentenced to probation friday after 
pleading no contest to breaking into computer news files of a 
competing station in what a prosecutor called the first case of its 
kind 
hillsborough circuit judge edward ward agreed to withhold a 
finding of guilt if terry cole and michael shapiro successfully 
complete five years probation and 250 hours of community service 
during probation the former employees of wtsp must take part in 
annual industry seminars to warn others especially journalism 
students how to avoid the pitfalls of a tremendous desire to 
succeed 
cole and shapiro both 33 expressed remorse for raiding the 
files of cbs affiliate wtvt between last november and january at 
the time cole was news director at the abc affiliate and shapiro 
was assistant news director 
before switching to wtsp shapiro had been an assignment manager 
at wtvt and helped set up security for that stations newsroom 
computer including passwords and identification codes 
to gain a competitive edge prosecutors said the pair broke 
into wtvts computer files containing stories budgets contracts 
and plans of news operations 
shapiro was arrested in february and cole his boss was 
arrested in april both men subsequently were fired by wtsp 
the judge said the case involved a violation of trust and 
confidence and crossed the line on ethics 
the court is not going to close any more doors in your face 
ward said i feel you men have earned a chance to have 
society attempt to forgive you 
the judge sentenced each to one year probation on a single 
conspiracy count and five years on 15 other computerrelated theft 
charges he ordered the terms to run concurrently 
ward followed state sentencing guidelines but warned the 
defendants both firsttime offenders that he had the right to 
exceed the guidelines and send them to prison for 22 months 
assistant state attorney chris hoyer said it was the first 
computer theft case involving the news business that he knew of in 
the country 
they knew what they were doing hoyer said at the 90minute 
hearing 
shapiro said im extremely sorry about what happened people 
were hurt by it at the stations my career has been ended i 
accept responsiblity 
i made a mistake cole said i allowed something to happen 
that should not have happened ive ruined my career ive lost the 
respect of my colleagues i dont know what else to say except 
im sorry 
greg jones a wtvt attorney said the proceedings ought to 
send a pretty clear message to anyone who thinks it makes sense to 
compete by cheating 
he would not comment on the prospect of a civil suit

an agreement among lobbyists for state and 
local governments on a bill allowing sales taxes to be collected 
from mailorder buyers has collapsed triggering a sharp dispute 
friday among groups representing the nations mayors and governors 
at issue is the bill sponsored by rep jack brooks dtexas 
chairman of the house judiciary committee that would override a 
22yearold supreme court decision that permits customers to escape 
sales taxes on purchases from big outofstate mail order houses 
groups representing local governments want the bill to include 
provisions guaranteeing that states which would collect the taxes 
from the mailorder retailers will pass along a portion to cities 
and counties 436 million or more a year out of an estimated 24 
billion in currently uncollected taxes according to one estimate 
but brooks bill leaves it to the states to decide whether and 
how to pass on money to local governments and the head of the us 
conference of mayors angrily charged that the national governors 
association had reneged on a signed agreement and agreed to cut the 
cities out of the bill 
this is not just a simple little quarrel said j thomas 
cochran executive director of the conference which represents 
mayors of cities of more than 30000 in population instead 
cochran said the dispute goes to whether or not organizations 
will hold their word 
this is almost personal with me cochran said i dont 
think they think they need us the governors association has taken 
us for granted for eight years under the reagan administration 
this was not just an informal agreement or a bunch of the boys 
getting together over drinks he said when we have an 
agreement in this town it must be kept thats taken seriously in 
this town we had a written agreement signed off by elected 
officials 
ray scheppach executive director of the national governors 
association acknowledged the bill does not match the agreement but 
said most states would act on their own to pass along a portion to 
cover local sales taxes if brooks bill is passed 
he said the mayors position was a little bit naive 
to walk away when you dont get 100 percent of what you want 
from word go i think is rather unsophisticated he said 
the agreement was reached last year by the mayors and 
governors groups the national conference of state legislatures 
and two other groups representing elected municipal and county 
officials after brooks had asked for unanimity among the 
government lobbying groups 
brooks issued a statement friday saying his bill was written to 
impose a minimum of requirements and flexibility 
when brooks introduced his bill earlier this month cochran 
wrote to the nations mayors complaining it is quite simply an 
outrage he wrote 
cochran called reporters to his office friday to denounce the 
bill and said he was angered by reports quoting anonymous state 
officials as saying the mayors were being crybabies over the 
deal he said the opposition of the mayors would jeopardize the 
bill 
however scheppach and a source on brooks committee staff who 
insisted on anonymity expressed doubt the mayors would kill the 
bill 
the real impetus for the bill they said comes from retailers 
who object to the discount that mailorder competitors are able to 
offer consumers by avoiding state and local sales taxes

tiananmen square the symbolic center of power in 
china remained the heart of prodemocracy protests saturday 
despite the mobilization of troops to restore order 
before dawn friday premier li peng and communist party chief 
zhao ziyang visited some of the more than 3000 students who have 
been on a hunger strike in the vast square for a week 
li and zhao boarded two of the several dozen buses parked on the 
100acre square that have sheltered the fasting students after a 
short visit the leaders left without promising to meet demands the 
students have raised for ending the strike such as an official 
dialogue with communist officials broadcast live on tv 
throughout the day student leaders debated their next move 
ambulances with sirens wailing raced out of the square to take 
failing fasters to hospitals for treatment rumors of troop 
movements swirled through the crowd 
tens of thousands of other students some from provinces as far 
away as inner mongolia camped in solidarity with the fasters many 
wore white headbands and armbands with slogans of support 
the square was filthy from a week of occupation with garbage 
was piled high in several places and broken bottles strewn across 
tiananmens stone tiles hygiene crews spraying disinfectant wound 
through the crowd 
trucks carrying bannerwaving workers and students constantly 
lumbered down the streets surrounding tiananmen other groups 
marched through the square to support the fasters 
by evening student leaders decided to stay in the square but 
stop the hunger strike the fasting students descended from the 
buses carrying dirty quilts and blankets under their arms and sat 
down nearby 
about 930 pm the squares official loudspeaker system began 
broadcasting speeches of li and president yang shangkun who 
revealed troops were moved to beijing to restore order drowning 
out rival student broadcasts 
large groups gathered around the dozens of speakers listening 
in the eerie light cast by the squares lampposts they 
occasionally jeered li and angrily shouted obscenities 
as the speeches were rebroadcast the students defiantly sang 
the internationale the socialist anthem the incensed strike 
leaders speaking from a bus their makeshift headquarters 
immediately announced the hunger strike would resume and claimed 
all students in the square would participate 
human chains began forming around the perimeter of the square to 
act as a line of defense against any troops trucks filled with 
supporting workers raced down beijings streets toward tiananmen 
early saturday and a pack of up to 100 motorcylcists also roared 
by 
as the tension mounted students remained defiant im not 
afraid to die shouted one hunger striker who vowed not to eat 
until the student demands were met

wall street financial experts on friday called 
president bushs savings and loan bailout plan a banana 
republic scheme that will cost taxpayers 30 billion to 50 
billion more than a democratic alternative 
a special task force of the house budget committee was told the 
extra expense of paying for the bailout through 30year offbudget 
bonds to preserve the illusion of deficit reduction will likely be 
10 times the 38 billion to 45 billion the administration has 
acknowledged 
this is an incredible price to pay for budgetary window 
dressing said bert ely who heads a financial consulting firm in 
alexandria va billions of dollars can be saved if the cleanup 
is funded for a few years with shortterm borrowings until 
longterm rates decline 
comptroller general charles bowsher head of the governments 
general accounting office agreed with ely and representatives of 
wall street investment houses that bushs sampl plan will tax the 
public tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary interest costs 
the administration has acknowledged taxpayers will have to pay 
up to 45 billion more over the 30year life of the private bonds 
than if the bailout costs were borrowed directly through the 
treasury 
ely however estimated that the extra cost of bushs plan at 
497 billion over 30 years assuming the administration is right 
in its assertion that interest rates will drop by more than half 
between now and 1995 
bushs strategy he said makes sense only if one believes 
that longterm interest rates are at or near their low point 
david jones chief economist for aubrey g lanston amp co said 
there has been a substantial underestimation of the added costs 
in bushs financing plan 
because of the yearly federal deficits he said the treasury 
still will have to annually borrow through additional securities 
most of the estimated 5 billion in yearly interest payments on the 
bonds 
these interest payments of course will grow exponentially 
over time as long as the federal budget remains in deficit jones 
said 
if longterm interest rates average a more realistic 8 
percent he said the added expense of bushs plan compared to the 
one approved thursday by the house ways and means committee is 
283 billion 
as i was making the calculations the term banana republic 
came up he said theres not much difference between that and 
the united states if you have to borrow money to pay interest on 
debt thats a sad fiscal state to be in 
the task forces hearing was held one day after the house ways 
and means committee rejected bushs proposal and formally voted to 
finance the bailout directly and make the 50 billion taxpayer part 
of the federal deficit 
bushs plan would increase the deficit over the next three years 
by only the 35 billion in interest costs on the bonds the 
democratic alternative would swell the deficit by 93 billion this 
year 233 billion in fisal 1990 and 138 billion in fiscal 1991 
through direct treasury borrowing but with lower longterm interest 
costs to taxpayers

iran is suing the united states in 
the world court for financial compensation for the 290 people 
killed when the uss vincennes shot down an iranian airliner a 
court official said friday 
tehrans move came less than a year after the iran air jet was 
hit by two american missiles and exploded thousands of feet above 
the persian gulf all passengers and crew perished in the july 3 
1988 incident 
irans fundamentalist government has asked the court to rule 
that the government of the united states is responsible to pay 
compensation to the islamic republic to the amount to be 
determined by the court as measured by the injuries suffered by 
the islamic republic and the bereaved families 
a copy of irans request which was filed wednesday was 
obtained by the associated press 
iran did not provide an estimate of the damage suffered 
according to e safavi a spokesman for the iranian embassy in the 
hague 
at the time of the incident president reagan offered 
compensation to relatives of the victims but he ruled out any role 
for the iranian government in settling damage claims 
it was not immediately known whether the bush administration was 
planning to take part in the proceedings 
thomas hodges a spokesman for the us embassy here said a 
copy of the iranian application was sent to the secretary of state 
in washington where it is being studied he declined further 
comment 
on friday the world court was considering when to proceed with 
the case hearings do not begin until arguments have been filed in 
writing a process that usually takes months 
the world court is the judicial branch of the united nations 
officially known as the international court of justice it has no 
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its 
rulings 
the crew of the vincennes erroneously identified an iranian 
passenger airbus plane as an iranian air force f14 fighter plane 
and shot it down 
irans application to the world court charges the united states 
has violated an international treaty on terrorism against airplanes 
the 1971 geneva convention for the suppression of unlawful acts 
against the safety of civil aviation 
it is the second case in a decade pitting the united states 
against iran at the world court 
ten years ago the carter administration filed suit against iran 
over the fate of 55 american diplomats held hostage at the us 
embassy in tehran the affair which made washington break 
relations with tehran 
iran which did not appear in court was ordered to immediately 
release the hostages tehran ignored the ruling the hostages 
ultimately were freed in january 1980 after an elaborate deal was 
negotiated with the help of algeria 
the united states withdrew from proceedings in the other major 
world court case in which it was involved in 1984 when nicaragua 
sought a halt to us support for the rebels known as contras 
only days before the complaint was filed the reagan 
administration canceled its acceptance of world court jurisdiction 
in central american affairs the court sided with the sandinista 
government two years later 
only 49 of the 159 un member nations have accepted the courts 
authority as compulsory in settling conflicts between states the 
united states is one of them

the navy declined friday to say whether 
sabotage is under investigation as a possible cause of the april 19 
explosion on the battleship iowa that killed 47 sailors 
a virginia newspaper reported that foul play was being looked 
into after the sister of a crewman who was killed told authorities 
that her brother and a surviving sailor had taken out life 
insurance policies naming each other as beneficiary 
both policies taken out more than a year ago were for 50000 
with a doubleindemnity clause in case of accidental death the 
sister told the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar of norfolk the 
newspaper said the sister spoke on condition that her and her 
brothers names not be disclosed 
officials contacted by the newspaper confirmed that the nis and 
the fbi were questioning the beneficiary 
but a navy spokesman at the pentagon lt bruce cole said 
friday that he had no details on what the nis was looking into and 
did not know if sabotage was a target of the investigation 
in every large accident investigation such as this its 
standard procedure to ask the naval investigative service to assist 
in exploring every possible avenue which might lead to further 
understanding of the causes and circumstances of the tragedy 
cole said 
the newspaper also reported that navy investigators have learned 
that the no 2 gun turret where the explosion occurred was 
significantly undermanned and that a number of those working in the 
turret lacked required training 
the turret one of three on the 887foot ship had far fewer 
crew members assigned than either of the other two despite 
recommendations from the iowas gunnery officer two months before 
the explosion that the numbers be increased according to the 
ships battle bill obtained by the newspaper the battle bill 
defines the positions that are to be manned aboard a ship in 
wartime conditions 
the gun turret should have had 90 people inside to perform the 
delicate work of moving gunpowder and shells according to battle 
bill on the day of the explosion 58 men were inside the turret 
normal peacetime ship manning levels are always less than 
wartime manning the navy said in a statement thursday 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified senior officer as saying it 
would be wrong to assume a link between the explosion and the 
manning levels or training levels of those assigned to the turret 
some iowa crewmen familiar with the navys investigation told 
the newspaper taht a significant number of sailors assigned to 
turret no 2 were inexperienced and had not been qualified in the 
equipments use 
a number lacked personal qualification standards or pqs 
ratings a set of requirements that a sailor must complete before 
being qualified to stand watch repair equipment or advance in rank 
but some of the 11 survivors pointed out that their turret was 
rated the best of the three on the ship the iowas commanding 
officer capt fred p moosally has said that the crew of no 2 
turret was his best 
the explosion occurred during the loading of the center 16inch 
gun as the iowa was preparing for gunnery practice north of puerto 
rico

premier ciriaco de mita resigned friday in response 
to sniping by socialist party rivals in his coalition creating one 
of italys periodic government crises a week before president bush 
visits 
negotiations to form what would be italys 49th postwar 
government are expected to take weeks president francesco cossiga 
asked de mita a christian democrat to stay on as caretaker 
after giving cossiga his resignation de mita told reporters the 
socialists left him no alternative to resigning 
bush is to arrive may 26 on the first stop of a european tour 
former president ronald reagan faced a similar situation in june 
1987 arriving in italy after premier bettino craxi resigned 
craxi who leads the socialist party is de mitas main foe and 
prompted the resignation by challenging the fiveparty coalitions 
viability 
us embassy spokesman mark dillen said it is too early to 
say whether there will be a change in bushs plans which include 
meetings with de mita and pope john paul ii 
bushs nominee for ambassador to italy michigan businessman 
peter secchia also has not yet been confirmed by the senate 
maxwell rabb who served eight years held a farewell party 
earlier this week and planned to fly home on saturday but reports 
are that he will stay for the bush visit 
de mita has led the government for 13 months and the socialists 
have accused him for weeks of not showing leadership 
in a closing speech friday at the socialist convention in milan 
craxi demanded a political and procedural clarification and an 
urgent cabinet meeting de mita resigned immediately after that 
meeting 
besides the christian democrats and socialists his coalition 
includes the small republican social democrat and liberal parties 
craxi leads italys thirdlargest party after the christian 
democrats and communists and is trying to regain the premiership 
he and other socialist leaders have accused de mita of failing 
to implement the coalitions agenda of political and economic 
reform including reduction of a deficit projected at 90 billion 
for this year

though justin yu now lives thousands of miles 
from his native china he cant help but feel connected to students 
in beijing who are trying to win political freedoms from a 
staunchly communist government 
i feel like it is happening to me said yu president of the 
chinese language press club in new york and a reporter for the 
world journal the largest chinese language newspaper in america 
i wish i could go home and be part of it 
yu who emigrated to the united states 20 years ago and is now a 
naturalized citizen is one of about 300000 chinese in new york 
many of whom are keeping a close watch on developments in beijings 
tiananmen square 
some 3000 students have been on a hunger strike to pressure the 
chinese government into allowing free speech and a free press tens 
of thousands of other chinese have held vigils to support the 
protesters 
developments overseas have been closely monitored and residents 
of new yorks chinatown often know whats happened before the rest 
of the united states 
on friday while the world was learning that the chinese 
government had sent army troops into beijing to end the 
demonstrations in what amounted to imposition of martial law 
samson ling said he already knew 
we just heard the 27th and 28th armies are moving into 
beijing said ling managing editor of china spring a monthly 
magazine circulated among chinese students in the united states 
canada hong kong and western europe 
weve already gotten telephone calls from people in beijing 
its a pretty tense time now all we can do is wait and see 
in new york which has the united states largest chinese 
population outside of san francisco student groups business 
people and local chinatown residents are supporting the students in 
beijing by holding their own demonstrations and raising funds 
about 1000 people mostly students planned to demonstrate in 
front of the capitol in washington on saturday to ask the us 
government to support the chinese students actions 
students from china studying in america also have sent several 
thousand dollars to the students in beijing according to local 
chineseamerican newspapers most of the money is to help buy badly 
needed telephone copying and fax machines to help publish fliers 
and student newsletters 
support for the demonstrators is nearly 100 percent from 
overseas chinese said peter lee of the centre daily news a 
chineseamerican daily 
its solidified all sorts of people students businessmen 
old established chinatown residents said lee even staunch 
protaiwanese have joined forces with procommunists and agreed to 
leave their conflict behind over this issue 
its really quite an exciting time in china and in america 
said lee 
this is a great event said bu jin 42 a native of shanghai 
who is studying political science at columbia university but 
people outside of china shouldnt expect the whole communist 
government to come tumbling down because of it 
this movement as impressive as it is can hardly be 
considered a revolution he said the students are asking so 
little freedom of speech and freedom of press thats different 
from wanting to change the whole system 
yu says he has mixed feelings about events in his homeland 
on one hand im so happy to see there is hope for chinas 
future but im saddened that students are having to suffer to get 
basic rights were still having to suffer after 5000 years to 
get basic rights that so much of the world has its really 
depressing

the top immigration official in western 
states whose appearance at a party for ferdinand marcos 
embarrassed the white house is likely to be replaced a justice 
department spokesman said 
david runkel chief spokesman for attorney general dick 
thornburgh on thursday described harold ezell as a 
shorttermer in the immigration and naturalization service 
which is part of the justice department 
ezell 52 said earlier this week that he made an error when he 
attended a party given in honolulu in august by ousted philippines 
leader marcos and his wife imelda 
after news organizations obtained a homemade videotape of the 
party last week he said he also erred in leading partygoers in a 
prayer asking for the couples safe return to the philippines 
which would be against president corazon aquinos wishes and us 
policy 
the marcoses have been indicted in new york on charges of 
diverting philippine government money to buy millions of dollars 
worth of real estate marcos who has been hospitalized since 
january for a variety of ailments took a turn for the worse this 
week and was listed in critical condition friday 
i would expect there would be a new ins director in that 
region as part of bringing in a new management team for the ins 
runkel said he would not elaborate on his statement 
ezell said late thursday he had not been told his resignation 
will be accepted ezell who has been western regional director of 
the ins since 1983 has said he would like to continue in the job 
as far as i know this guy runkel doesnt make the decision 
its up to the white house and the attorney general ezell said 
if we dont get to continue i think weve had a big challenge 
and done terrific accomplishments 
the outspoken ezell is credited with playing a major role in 
implementing the federal immigration amnesty program nearly 
900000 of the 15 million illegal aliens who applied for amnesty 
were in the western region 
however some critics have accused ezell of focusing too much 
attention on himself 
his grandstanding style of operation and his constant grabbing 
of headlines did nothing to bring about a better understanding of 
the immigration problem said peter schey executive director of 
the national center for immigrant rights in los angeles 
ezell said if he doesnt keep the job he probably will pursue 
business opportunities he denied reports he is interested in 
running for congress 
ive got zero regrets ezell said of his ins tenure since 
i took this job on i really dont think theres a major flaw to 
hang our heads about weve gathered a good team of 5500 people in 
the ins region and theyve done a good job

union activists and advisers met the interior minister and other 
government officials friday to discuss the political and economic 
accords reached last month 
it was the second meeting of the arbitration commission a group 
set up to oversee implementation of the accords reached between 
authorities and the opposition april 5 
walesa declined to talk to reporters before the start of the 
meeting in the parliament building but the interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak said i am sure we assumed the right direction 
and this is irreversible no matter if one likes it or not 
after the 3hour session walesa said it is important that 
both sides are willing to remove obstacles and understand that they 
will occur but have to be reduced 
jozef slisz leader of rural solidarity said authorities 
accused solidarity of being confrontational and solidarity said 
its posters were being torn down 
a joint communique carried by the official news agency pap said 
authorities criticized the tone of articles in the new opposition 
newspaper gazeta wyborcza and solidarity did the same about trybuna 
ludu the communist party paper 
the accords resulted in the legalization of solidarity after a 
sevenyear ban and provide for partially free elections to the 
national assembly

education secretary lauro cavazos on friday 
announced grants conferences and other steps his department is 
taking to promote state and local plans that let parents choose the 
public school their child attends 
i consider choice the cornerstone to restructuring elementary 
and secondary education in our country cavazos said at an 
education press association luncheon we must do away with 
ineffective conventional arrangements that only block reform 
cavazos said he will personally chair four regional strategy 
meetings at which governors legislators state education chiefs 
principals teachers and parents will develop choice strategies for 
their states 
the secretary said he is naming a special adviser to develop 
choice initiatives and a task force to evaluate choice programs 
around the country he also said he is directing that choice be a 
major priority of grants awarded under the 58 million secretarys 
fund for innovation in education 
cavazos president bush and others contend that giving parents 
and students freedom to choose will invigorate schools and assure 
that no child is involuntarily subjected to a secondrate 
education they say competition has created topflight higher 
education in the united states and earlier grades will benefit from 
the same approach 
the most ambitious plan is in minnesota which offers open 
enrollment across district lines postsecondary options and area 
learning centers cavazos said the experiment has inspired iowa and 
arkansas to enact open enrollment legislation and said 21 states 
are considering choice programs scattered individual districts 
most notably east harlem ny also have choice programs 
at the request of the state of minnesota the department will 
conduct a threeyear evaluation of the impact of its program 
cavazos said 
richard miller executive director of the american association 
of school administrators accused cavazos and the bush 
administration of using the choice issue to try to divert attention 
from underfunding in programs such as head start and chapter 1 the 
major federal effort for disadvantaged children 
he said open enrollment choice programs can be beneficial to 
some schools but charged that cavazos is dodging real problems with 
equity and cost in essence the secretarys approach would do 
the least for those who have the least miller said 
the secretary said he is aware of concerns that choice would 
create a twotiered education system one for the fortunate and the 
other for the disadvantaged 
but he said inequities already exist and choice will enable 
parents and students to improve their educational situations 
furthermore armed with the power of choice parents can force 
inferior schools to upgrade or close he said 
asked how districts can pay for the added costs of a choice 
program particularly transportation cavazos said districts 
already are spending an enormous amount of money 
they need to start thinking about where the dollars are going 
and redirect those dollars to where they can have the most 
impact he said if choice is the goal they need to address 
that transportation issue 
cavazos said his department has published a booklet called 
choosing a school for your child available to parents free of 
charge from the consumer information center pueblo colo 81009 
he said two more booklets will be released this summer 
parental choice in six nations and improving schools and 
empowering parents the white house workshop on choice in 
education

sen max baucus dmont was chairing a 
hearing on damage to the ozone layer friday when he announced that 
protecting the earth from the suns killing rays had suddenly 
become very personal 
motioning to the back of his neck he said three and a half 
hours ago my dermatologist called me up and told me i have basal 
cell carcinoma 
its fine it could be taken care of he assured witnesses 
who had come before his subcommittee on environmental protection 
but i understand that it is somewhat caused by ultraviolet rays 
basal cell carcinoma the most common form of skin cancer comes 
primarily from exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight it 
strikes between 300000 and 400000 people a year according to the 
american academy of dermatology it can cause disfigurement but it 
does not spread like other cancers and has a 95 percent cure rate 
baucus subcommittee was gathering testimony on legislative 
proposals to reduce use of chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs 
which poke holes in the ozone layer and let the ultraviolet rays 
through 
cfcs used in refrigerants and some industrial cleaning 
materials are nontoxic when released but break apart into other 
chemical substances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up 
and rise into the stratosphere poking holes in the ozone 
witnesses on friday testified about the pros and cons of 
charging fees on excess profits from the production of cfcs and 
the feasibility of using recycling as a way to minimize release of 
cfcs during manufacturing

a federal judge friday temporarily blocked 
planned drug tests covering 30 employees in the executive office of 
the president and hundreds of workers in the general services 
administration 
responding to three lawsuits us district court judge louis 
oberdorfer issued a preliminary injunction against the random 
mandatory testing which was to have begun as early as next week 
he said that the programs may be overly broad and that there is 
little evidence in the court record of any drug problem among 
employees covered by the programs 
the judge also temporarily enjoined testing of gsa employees 
suspected of using drugs he said the agencys plan must first be 
revised to provide that testing is based on more specific 
requirements reasonable articulable and individualized 
suspicion 
oberdorfer however did allow random drug testing to proceed 
for gsa workers who carry firearms 
the judge said he believed a majority of the supreme court 
would disapprove of the mandatory random testing of the urine of 
the broad range of unarmed employees now slated for testing by the 
gsa and the eop 
thirty employees in the executive office of the president sued 
president bush to stop a drug testing plan which covers the office 
of management and budget the us trade representative and the 
office of administration drug testing for the executive office of 
the president is designed to cover all employees in positions that 
are categorized as sensitive 
oberdorfer said that none of the 30 who filed the lawsuit has a 
white house pass that all are subjected to thorough fbi checks 
before their appointment and that all operate under close 
supervision 
the court record in the lawsuit filed by the executive office of 
the president employees indicated five drug abuse problems in the 
past 40 months involving workers in that office 
the judge said that at the 20000employee gsa there is no 
evidence that gsa made any systematic study of drug use or its 
consequences 
he noted the agency issued an order last year saying that the 
overwhelming majority of its workers have never had trouble 
with illegal drugs 
some 2360 gsa employees are covered by the planned drug 
testing one lawsuit there challenged testing in 11 job categories 
representing hundreds of employees ranging from presidential 
appointees to civil engineers 
a gsa official was able to list only 22 cases in five years in 
which the agency took action against employees relating to drug 
use oberdorfer said

thousands of georgians marched through the streets 
of the capital city of tbilisi on friday in memory of 20 people who 
died in ethnic unrest on april 9 
a dissident arrested the day of the clash between protesters and 
soldiers charged on friday that children in several schools later 
were poisoned by gas that appeared similar to that used against the 
demonstrators 
the poisonings caused a great panic in the city said zviad 
gamsakhurdia in a telephone interview from tbilisi 
he was released from prison on thursday pending trial 
yuri goldadze an editor of the official gruzinform news agency 
said in a telephone interview that many thousands took part in 
fridays 3mile march from the citys medical institute to the 
sion church in tbilisis old town 
the march ended with a requiem service it was held on the 40th 
day after the clash a day of religious significance in the 
georgian orthodox faith 
the national evening tv news program vremya showed streets 
full of people and blackclad mourners crying and holding portraits 
of the dead young men carried flags of mourning and georgian 
national flags and raised clenchedfists during a moment of silence 
among the participants were city and national officials who 
granted permission for the march goldadze said 
he said the march and religious service were absolutely 
peaceful and that the requiem service was shown live on the 
caucasus republics official television 
nineteen people were killed when soldiers moved into a crowd of 
proindependence protesters on tbilisis rustaveli avenue on april 
9 one young man was shot and killed later for violating a curfew 
the clash was another example of the ethnic unrest that has 
upset the caucasus region and many other areas of the soviet union 
but caused a particular outcry because of charges of brutality 
against the soldiers president mikhail s gorbachev called it a 
blow to his reform program 
witnesses said the soldiers beat protesters with shovels and 
georgian officials said the soldiers used a chemical substance that 
had an effect similar to nerve gas on some of the protesters 
however moscow officials said the soldiers only used a chemical 
agent similar but stronger than tear gas 
gamsakhurdia a member of the tbilisi helsinki watch committee 
said a report was broadcast on official tv that some children had 
been poisoned again recently by gas and that officials were 
investigating 
he said children from schools no 55 53 and 101 were poisoned 
and all schools in the city were closed a week ahead of schedule to 
avoid more cases an undetermined number of children were being 
treated for poisoning he said 
protests began in tbilisi in early april against demands by the 
abkhazian minority in northwest georgia to have their area 
transferred to the russian republic but many banners supporting 
complete independence for georgia soon appeared among the 
demonstrators 
the republics communist party chief dzhumber patiashvili took 
responsibility for the violence and resigned 
gamsakhurdia a protest organizer was arrested the same day 
soldiers broke it up he said he faces charges of violating social 
order by organizing protests from last september through april and 
faces up to three years in prison if convicted 
also released were mirab kostava of the st ilya society irakly 
tereteli of the party of national independence and georgy chanturia 
of the national democratic party of georgia he said 
all face the same charges he said

policymakers at the federal reserve in march 
voted to hold interest rates steady unless the slowing of economic 
growth proved inadequate to restrain inflation according to 
minutes of the meeting released friday 
the federal open market committee noting early signs of a 
slackening in economic growth voted 111 at its march 28 meeting 
to leave rates unchanged initially 
but most members felt monetary policy should be adjusted more 
readily and promptly toward greater restraint than toward ease 
the minutes said 
the committee which meets in secret eight times a year sets 
monetary policy for the federal reserve whose main job is to fight 
inflation 
in march 1988 the fed began to gradually push interest rates 
upward in an attempt to cool the economy and thus curb inflation 
since then shortterm rates have risen three percentage points and 
economic growth has shown signs of softening 
most analysts believe the fed is holding off on further 
tightening of credit while it analyzes how the economic slowdown 
will affect inflation 
price increases have been sharp so far this year the consumer 
price index rose at an annual rate of 66 percent over the first 
four months of 1989 up from the 44 percent price increases 
registered in 1987 and 1988 
fomc members in march found recent price increases to be 
disappointing if not entirely unexpected but many wanted to 
wait for evidence to accumulate on the possible need for a further 
tightening of policy the minutes said 
some members felt the current slowing of the expansion might 
be inadequate to restrain inflationary pressures the minutes 
said 
since the march meeting signs of a slowdown have become more 
pronounced and analysts believe the fed is unlikely to push rates 
higher 
the fomc met again this week but minutes of that meeting will 
not be released until after the committees next meeting in early 
july the committee is made up of the seven federal reserve 
governors and the presidents of five of its 12 regional banks 
the committee issues directives that govern the open market 
operations of the federal reserve bank of new york through the 
purchase of government securities from banks the central bank 
influences the amount of reserves the banks have to make loans from 
and thus the price of those loans interest rates 
the committees march directive to the new york bank said the 
fomc seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
positions 
however it added that somewhat greater reserve restraint 
would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable 
in fed parlance the word would carries stronger implications 
than does might 
the lone dissenter from the march vote was fed gov martha 
seger who opposed the tilt toward further increases in interest 
rates according to the minutes 
ms seger earlier this month told a group of home builders that 
with the recent softening in economic growth we need to be very 
wary of slipping over the edge into recession 
a growing number of private economists have expressed concern 
that the feds antiinflation campaign could have the unintended 
effect of causing a recession the latest survey of 50 leading 
economists by the blue chip economic indicators newsletter found 
that twothirds expect a recession to begin this year or in 1990

the hungarian helsinki committee held 
its founding session friday and said it wants to probe human rights 
violations in hungary and elsewhere in the soviet bloc 
the meeting was attended by karl johannes von schwarzenberg 
president of the viennabased international helsinki federation for 
human rights said group member ferenc koeszeg 
participants approved the statutes and elected a 16member 
steering committee including koeszeg a representative of the 
league of free democrats and rudolf joo of the hungarian 
democratic forum 
in addition to monitoring the hungarian situation the hhc 
would like to send observers to neighboring countries to 
investigate circumstances of human rights violations there a 
16page founding document said 
what the government and the police are doing with the 
dissidents in czechoslovakia with georgians and armenians in the 
soviet union with albanians in yugoslavia and with every citizen 
in romania is in profound contraction with the principles of 
helsinki the document said 
all european countries except albania as well as the united 
states and canada signed the 1975 helsinki final act on human 
rights and approved additional rights provisions agreed upon at 
helsinki followup conferences 
the founding statement also said we are convinced that there 
is still a great deal to be done in the area of human rights in 
hungary 
the machinery of coercion is still intact the penal code 
still allows the prosecution and jailing of people on political 
grounds the police are empowered to hold people without access to 
the courts and to restrict their freedom it added 
the committee also said it would try to oversee parliamentary 
and local elections with the goal of free balloting and the 
development of a multiparty system

bernard aronson president bushs choice to 
run latin american policy in the state department said friday that 
some press reports may have overstated soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs apparent pledge to end soviet military aid to nicaragua 
its not clear in what manner military aid will be reduced if 
at all aronson said at his confirmation hearings before the 
senate foreign relations committee 
my impression is that some of the press reports about it have 
been a little more ambitious about what it contains than what it 
may contain aronson said 
the nominee declined to characterize the contents of a gorbachev 
letter on the subject to bush saying that had to be left to the 
president 
he did say that secretary of state james a baker iii very 
much wants to test soviet intentions in the region especially on 
the issues of soviet aid to nicaragua and cuba 
they have an opportunity to demonstrate that in an area of the 
world that is very important to the united states that they want a 
new beginning aronson said 
aronson was asked by sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of 
the panels latin american subcommittee what he thought of white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwaters characterization of gorbachev as 
a drugstore cowboy out to score propaganda points 
i think that as a general rule it is wise to conduct our 
diplomacy based on a discussion of issues aronson said avoiding 
a direct reply 
dodd pressed the question and aronson drew laughter when he 
replied dont ask me to start my tenure at the state department 
by criticizing the spokesman at the white house 
aronson nominated to be assistant secretary of state for latin 
american affairs opened his testimony by pledging bipartisan 
cooperation with the democraticcontrolled congress 
aronsons predecessor elliot abrams presided over latin 
american policy in the reagan administration abrams impassioned 
advocacy of us military support for the nicaraguan contra rebels 
was controversial and he had a stormy relationship with congress 
if i am confirmed ill bring with me a strong belief in 
consultations aronson said at the end of the day we need to 
come together as democrats and republicans to form a bipartisan 
foreign policy 
im not looking to go off to the state department and make 
policy by myself he said 
dodd told the nominee he had been concerned about the nomination 
because of your lack of experience in latin america but he 
added your responses today have reduced my skepticism im 
going to take you at your word on consultations 
questions spanned the latin american horizon and included these 
issues and countries 
should the united states move to normal relations with cuba 
aronson said that if cuba is interested in normalizing relations 
it should stop arming leftist guerrillas in el salvador and stop 
abusing the rights of its own citizens failure to take such steps 
would stand in the way of a major normalization aronson said 
nicaragua if the sandinista government negotiates rules which 
provide a level playing field for the national elections 
scheduled for feb 25 1990 the united states might consider 
easing some of its current sanctions 
el salvador as the newly elected rightwing government takes 
office the united states should insist on real progress toward 
human rights a respect for a free judiciary and the rule of law 
panama the recent election in which thugs allied to the 
countrys military leader gen manuel antonio noriega beat 
opposition candidates makes oldstyle chicago politics look like 
a picnic i think its important general noriega understand 
that the united states is not going to raise these concerns and 
then if the issue is not resolved go back to business as usual 
the decision by the organization of american states to condemn 
the conduct of the panamanian elections and call for noriegas 
removal aronson said that it sends a signal that democracy is 
threatened and that the democratic community in latin america and 
the caribbean cares 
the panama canal treaties i strongly support the panama 
canal treaties just as the treaties were a proud symbol of 
friendship between the american and panamanian peoples the 
abrogation of the treaties would be seen as a rejection of that 
friendship and a return to an earlier relationship i do not think 
it would be a wise or responsible act aronson said 
on democratic governments aronson said that we never get 
into trouble when we defend democracies and we often get in trouble 
when we do not

the florida supreme court took no 
action friday on a state request for a quick decision on the 
validity of an abortion consent law challenged successfully in 
lower courts by lawyers for a 15yearold girl 
they are not going to have any ruling today on that motion 
said supreme court clerk sid white possibly monday 
the girls attorney said that barring action by the state 
supreme court her client was free to end her pregnancy which was 
in its 12th week without the consent of her parents or a judge 
lawyer jerri blair would not say if the girl identified only as 
tw of lake county had obtained an abortion 
the us supreme court refused thursday to reinstate floridas 
abortion consent law clearing the way for the girl and other 
single minors to get abortions without consent until the state 
supreme court deals with the matter 
the state attorney generals office has moved to speed up the 
state supreme court justices review scheduled for september of 
the validity of the 1988 law or allow enforcement in the meantime 
but the court took no action on that request friday 
in papers filed with the court assistant attorney general jerry 
curington argued there is confusion over whether the law is invalid 
statewide 
although the law was struck down by only one of floridas five 
district courts of appeal in daytona beach a 1976 precedent 
apparently means it cannot be enforced in the other four districts 
either he wrote 
therefore curington argued the justices should expedite their 
review or keep the law in effect until they rule on the 
constitutional issues

debate over whether to use research by nazi 
scientists on unwilling death camp prisoners is moot because much 
of the information already has been used the organizer of an 
international conference on ethics said friday 
its wrong to say that the question is whether we should look 
at this data the fact of the matter is that we have looked at it 
and looked at it pretty hard said arthur caplan director of the 
university of minnesota center for biomedical ethics 
americans have cited it more than 20 times in professional 
journals british military physicians talked about it in the 60s 
in fact it was used several times here at the conference when 
scientists described the research and its findings caplan said in 
an interview after the threeday conference ended 
he cited the work of dr robert pozos an expert on hypothermia 
who has gained widespread attention in scientific circles for his 
claim that nazi research should not be wasted even if the means 
used to obtain it were despicable 
pozos conceded in an interview friday that nazi research was 
used in his presentation at the conference the meaning of the 
holocaust for bioethics 
thats fair id take it a step further and say this whole 
conference was in a sense a use of that data pozos said 
pozos told the scientists thursday night the value of human 
life is great and if we have the means to save human life even if 
the data is suspect we should use it 
a professor of physiology and biophysics at the university of 
washington pozos cited tests in which 80 to 90 prisoners at dachau 
were dunked in freezing water sometimes to their deaths to help 
nazi researchers design protective gear for luftwaffe pilots who 
might be shot down over water 
physiologically the data still is valid and has value today 
in terms of describing acute cold stress in water pozos said 
the situation is one in which i think good might come from evil 
asked if he felt guilt about using the data pozos said i 
dont feel comfortable with it the discussion troubles me i have 
very strong mixed emotions about it it wakes me up at three in the 
morning 
but the question is not whether to use the data its how to 
address the fact that it is being used and how that fact should be 
acknowledged 
the conference which caplan said drew 225 scientists 
ethicists theologians and holocaust survivors from eight 
countries also included discussions on the propriety of using nazi 
analogies when discussing abortion and on the relationship between 
medicine and naziism 
eva kor of terre haute ind a survivor of dr josef mengeles 
experiments on twins at auschwitz told a panel discussion at the 
conference thursday night that she was appalled by the idea that 
scientists might use the data 
kor and her sister miriam spent 10 months in auschwitz when 
they were 9 years old of their family only the twin sisters 
survived 
i learned the soap i washed with for two years was made out of 
human fat kor said i had nightmares for years later that the 
soap i washed with was made from my own parents 
velvl greene another panel member who is director of the 
jakobovits center for jewish medical ethics at ben gurion 
university in beer sheva israel said he was sickened and 
appalled by the straightforward manner in which pozos appealed 
for use of the nazi data 
but greene said he agreed the data should be made available if 
it would save lives 
it is not a question of can we use the data but how best can 
we use the data as a memorial he said maybe by memorializing 
it we will never mitigate it but we will remember

a senior west german official said 
friday that washington and bonn have worked out a formula for a 
facesaving compromise in the dispute over natos shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
under the compromise discussed during the washington visit of 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg the us 
administration would accept the idea of negotiations with the 
kremlin if west germany makes clear it does not seek a third 
zero immediate elimination of shortrange weapons 
the reported agreement is mostly symbolic as no date has been 
proposed for the start of superpower talks on the missiles and the 
talks remain conditional on an unspecified improvement in the 
eastwest balance of conventional arms the source said 
but west germany and the united states have been arguing over 
the issue of shortrange missiles for months and the washington 
talks appear to have found a common position for the two allies to 
take with them to the nato summit in brussels on may 2930 
it is no longer disputed that there should be negotiations on 
shortrange weapons said the bonn official familiar with 
stoltenbergs talks in washington but they the talks should be 
prepared carefully and in relation to conventional reductions 
the officials explanation of the agreement suggested that us 
and west german officials had backed down from their previous 
positions 
stoltenberg flew to washington wednesday to meet with us 
secretary of state james a baker iii and defense secretary dick 
cheney 
the west german defense minister appointed only a month ago 
was reported to have taken with him a new plan for resolving the 
dispute that has separated bonn and washington and caused a rift 
within the nato alliance 
stoltenberg was to propose a link between a reduction of soviet 
troops and tanks in europe and the start of shortrange 
negotiations the bonn official said that proposal was accepted in 
principle by the us officials stoltenberg met with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has begun withdrawing 
50000 troops and 5000 tanks from eastern europe and has announced 
that the kremlin will unilaterally cut its shortrange nuclear 
arsenal by 500 warheads 
however us officials have said both gestures fall short of 
what is needed to warrant revision of nato defense policy 
baker told reporters in washington earlier this week that he 
considered shortrange negotiations a mistake under the current 
circumstances 
washington contends nato should stand by its flexible 
response doctrine or retention of some nuclear weapons in europe 
for use in repelling a potential attack by the east blocs superior 
conventional forces 
but as both military blocs have begun dismantling their 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles under the 1987 inf treaty the 
burden of hosting a nuclear option has shifted to west germany 
where most of natos shortrange systems are deployed 
of the 88 shortrange lance missile launchers stationed in 
central europe by nato 76 are in west germany 
bonn has refused to go along with a nato plan to upgrade the 
lance missiles which have a range of about 75 miles with new 
rockets capable of reaching targets as far away as 300 miles until 
the superpowers take some interim steps to reduce the weapons they 
have deployed in europe 
natos plan is widely opposed in west germany for fear it will 
damage improving relations with eastern europe and chances for 
further progress on arms control progress 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze threatened during a 
visit to bonn last weekend that the kremlin might halt destruction 
of its ss23s one of the missiles being removed under the inf 
agreement if nato goes ahead with the modernization project 
it was not immediately clear whether the compromise reportedly 
worked out by stoltenberg and us officials on thursday would be 
acceptable to other members of the 16nation nato alliance or even 
if the junior political parties in chancellor helmut kohls 
coalition would go along

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in an 
interview released friday that he was amazed by the old 
ideological film on president bushs address a week ago on 
ussoviet relations 
his comments in the communist party daily pravda transmitted by 
the tass news agency were the first highlevel reaction to bushs 
may 12 speech at texas aampm university 
the speech of president bush at the texas university i admit 
amazed me shevardnadze said it amazed me with its tone i 
would even say with its somehow old ideological film and in places 
with its didactic inclination 
it seemed to us that our political dialogue already had 
crossed into a new category freed from the blinders of ideological 
rhetoric that we may carry it out without empty polemic cliches 
the minister just back from the sovietchinese summit in 
beijing with president mikhail s gorbachev said it was 
completely incomprehensible to the soviets why bush said the 
soviet union had yielded to washingtons appeals to renew 
negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons 
he said moscow had long been pressing to restart the talks but 
the bush administration delayed while it conducted a review of its 
arms control policy 
still shevardnadze said he found some correct positive 
thoughts in the statements of bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii who visited moscow last week 
and he added we will judge us policies not by their words 
but by their deeds 
both sides said at the end of bakers twoday visit on may 11 
that the new us administration got off to a good start in its 
relationship with the soviet union 
they said they would resume negotiations on strategic weapons in 
june 
gorbachev told baker the soviet union will withdraw unilaterally 
500 shortrange nuclear warheads from east europe this year but 
baker rejected the negotiations the kremlin sought to remove all 
such weapons on both sides 
baker said the soviets still have an overwhelming advantage in 
the weapons that must be reduced further before negotiations can 
begin 
the warheads are at the heart of a dispute in the north atlantic 
treaty organization the united states and britain want to 
modernize and extend the range of natos lance missiles west 
germany leads a group of nato countries that want to start 
negotiations with the soviet union on removing them 
in response to a question shevardnadze denied that moscow was 
trying to put pressure on nato 
he reiterated that the soviet union wants to begin negotiations 
to remove the missiles our position on this question derives 
from common sense and there is nothing threatening in it 
shevardnadze said

the main lobbying group for the major us oil 
companies seeking to blunt public criticism of exxon corps 
handling of the alaska oil spill said friday the company should 
not be faulted for the slow pace of cleanup 
the cleanup moves slowly because it is based upon 
environmental and ecological considerations said charles j 
dibona president of the american petroleum institute 
dibona earlier this week toured prince william sound where 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the exxon 
valdez supertanker on march 24 in the worst oil spill in us 
history 
he said six of the 88 miles of shoreline hit with the heaviest 
amounts of oil have been cleaned up a total of 364 miles of 
beaches was affected by the spill 
in a bid to deflect some of the criticism from exxon dibona 
repeatedly stressed that the company was committed to spending as 
much money as necessary to clean the spill completely even if it 
had to return to the scene next spring 
a transportation department official meanwhile said a report 
to president bush on the government and industry response to the 
spill was critical of everybody for a wholly insufficient 
job of reacting to the accident 
dibona sought to portray exxons effort as being especially 
sensitive to the possibility that the cleanup itself could do 
further damage to the areas wildlife 
he said exxon crews were engaged in a particularly arduous 
cleanup on the north side of smith island and other areas where the 
seasonal seal birthing or pupping is approaching 
slow progress cleaning the first several thousand feet of 
shoreline has discouraged some but the slowness is the result of 
the special considerations associated with these efforts dibona 
said adding that the cleanup needed to be especially rigorous 
because of concerns for seal pupping 
he said progress clearly will accelerate once work proceeds 
beyond the next few weeks 
dibona also downplayed the effects of the spill on fish and 
birds in the area 
there is no evidence of a major fish kill he said adding 
that most migratory birds were not hurt by the oil because they 
were in an area east of the spill

a broad overhaul of soviet civilian nuclear 
safety standards triggered by the 1986 chernobyl disaster will be 
completed this summer a senior soviet official said friday 
the revised general safety rule will include new safety 
requirements that correspond to standards set by the international 
atomic energy agency said vadim m malyshev chairman of the state 
committee on supervision of nuclear power safety 
some of the requirements are even higher than the 
international rules he added 
malyshev spoke in an interview with two american reporters 
following talks with his us counterpart lando w zech jr 
chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission 
a fiveman soviet delegation of nuclear regulatory officials 
visited the calvert cliffs nuclear plant in maryland on wednesday 
and is scheduled to tour the indian point nuclear station and the 
brookhaven national laboratory both in new york next week 
us regulators visited soviet nuclear facilities last august 
malyshev and zech announced after their meeting at nrc 
headquarters that they had approved plans for an exchange of 
nuclear safety inspectors as part of a broad cooperation agreement 
signed in april 1988 
a twoperson team of soviet inspectors will spend about seven 
weeks at the catawba nuclear station near rock hill sc and an 
american team will spend a similar period at the zaporoshye nuclear 
facility southeast of kiev in the ukraine 
each side will study the others inspection techniques and 
operator safety procedures 
malyshev speaking through an interpreter said a broad review 
of safety standards was undertaken following the april 1986 
chernobyl accident in the northern ukraine that killed at least 31 
people and released a cloud of radiation that eventually circled 
the globe it was the worst nuclear accident in history 
malyshev did not give specific examples of changes in soviet 
safety standards but he said a revised and reedited set of 
rules would be ready by june or july 
the soviet official took issue with a report earlier this month 
that the local communist party chief in kiev was complaining of 
declining attention to safety at chernobyl where reactors not 
involved in the accident are still operating 
i think that is incorrect malyshev said i feel the level 
of requirements has been raised and the safety culture as its 
called has become significantly higher 
malyshev also said safety regulators were studying when and 
whether to decommission about 12 oldgeneration civilian nuclear 
plants the soviets have a total of 45 civilian nuclear reactors 
we think the closest possible date for decommissioning those 
would be sometime before the year 2005 but it may well be 
considerably earlier than that he said 
he cited two reactors already picked for decommissioning the 
no 2 unit at the beloyarskiy station situated in the ural 
mountains near the city of sverdlovsk and the no 2 unit at the 
novovoronezhskiy station near the city of voronezh in the russian 
republic

the governing liberal democratic party adopted a 
political reform plan friday in hopes of repairing a reputation 
left in tatters by a bribery and influencepeddling scandal 
the plan proposed to prime minister noboru takeshita on 
thursday would put lower limits on some political donations 
reduce the number of parliament seats and require all legislators 
to disclose their assets only cabinet members now are required to 
reveal their wealth 
it also would require cabinet members and party officials to 
leave their party factions said masaharu gotoda former chief 
cabinet secretary and chairman of the party political reform 
committee 
five factions dominate the party each with a leader who aspires 
to be prime minister the factions are blamed for much of japans 
bigmoney politics because the power balance among them is 
determined largely by their financial strength 
in a scandal that began last summer and has reached the top of 
politics and business the recruit co is accused of of trying to 
buy favors with large donations and insider stock deals that 
benefited about 160 politicians bureaucrats and business 
executives 
gotoda described the reform plan to reporters as 
forwardlooking and said the most important thing is how to 
implement it 
similar scandals have been repeated every 10 years or so and 
this proposal is also intended to eliminate the root of such 
scandals he said 
the reforms now go to the parliament as legislation and are 
expected to be enacted by november 
provisaions include a ban on speculating with political funds 
requiring that the funds be in government bonds or deposited in 
banks a ban on fundraising parties by cabinet members which are 
a common way to dodge limits on political donations and reducing 
the need for campaign money by gradually lowering the number of 
parliament seats from 512 to 471 
analysts said they found some willingness in the party to make 
the changes necessary to regain public confidence but many 
remained skeptical of its ability to abandon the old practices 
koichi kishimoto a prominent critic of politics said the party 
includes people whose prime concern is how to cling to their 
power 
this is the most serious crisis to date for the liberal 
democrats who have governed japan since 1955 
party leaders including takeshita and his predecessor yasuhiro 
nakasone took recruit money and takeshita admitting to accepting 
the equivalent of 11 million in various forms the prime minister 
has said he will resign soon

at taffys luncheonette as elsewhere 
in the small towns of northeastern massachusetts there was an air 
of resignation friday the look that hangs over a town that just 
lost in the semifinals against the team from the big city 
that prevailing wind resulted from a nuclear regulatory 
commission decision thursday to allow lowpower testing at the 
nearby seabrook nh nuclear power plant its an important first 
step to a fullpower license and a defeat for those who for two 
decades have fought the plants opening 
betty a customer who would give her opinion but not her last 
name summed up theres too much money involved in it and money 
talks 
weve known from almost day 1 that at some point this would 
happen said norma beit chairperson of citizens within the 
10mile radius an antiseabrook group weve always known it 
nrc was a kangaroo court and it has been 
still many in this coastal region say they arent ready to 
surrender 
for one thing seabrooks opponents insist the federal courts 
not the nrc will have the final say in whether seabrook ever puts 
out even a watt of electricity the nrc put its decision on hold to 
allow for a possible court appeal if that fails lowpower testing 
could begin in a week 
the administration of gov michael s dukakis and the citizens 
groups opposed to seabrook argue that it would be impossible to 
evacuate the region during a nuclear accident particularly during 
the summer months when thousands jam the narrow roads leading to 
the beaches 
the geography of the area and the availability of 
transportation resources are key said tom moughan of amesbury 
also there are the dramatic wind shifts a change in the 
direction of a radiation plume can blow it as far as haverhill 
within a matter of minutes 
i dont know how they let them start building without a full 
evacuation plan said bob goldthwaite manager of atkinsons 
lumber in newburyport its difficult to get a safe evacuation 
plan look at chernobyl we saw the cloud over here how far 
can you run 
arguments like that one are now being made before the nrcs 
atomic safety and licensing board which since march has been 
holding hearings in boston on the evacuation plan for massachusetts 
communities within 10 miles of the plant the plan was developed by 
new hampshire yankee operator of the facility after massachusetts 
officials refused 
seabrook officials say the plant is safe and is badly needed to 
meet new englands energy needs into the 21st century they argue 
that their evacuation plan which includes alerting the plants 
massachusetts neighbors by sirens mounted on trucks and 
helicopters is sufficient 
the evacuation plan must be approved before the plant is 
licensed to run at full power but state officials say that if the 
panel approves the plan they will appeal to a higher court 
ingrid sanborn a resident of west newbury for 23 years did not 
attend the first protests against seabrook in the early days she 
said she chose instead to work through the system attending 
meetings in new hampshire and massachusetts and becoming 
increasingly discouraged with what she saw 
she predicted residents would not give up 
the people in this area sanborn said will go to whatever 
length they have to

the agriculture department said friday it has 
approved a permit for the university of kentucky to conduct a field 
test of tobacco containing a mouse liver gene that regulates the 
concentration of heavy metals 
eventually officials said the research could lead to a 
reduction in disease by making it possible to keep soilborne toxic 
metals largely in the uneaten roots of leafy vegetables 
heavy metals have been implicated in many disease processes 
and can be consumed by humans when eating leafy vegetables like 
spinach or lettuce said larry b slagle acting administrator of 
the departments animal and plant health inspection service 
tobacco can be used as a model crop to help understand 
genetically engineered traits before transferring them to other 
plant species he said 
the mouse liver gene instructs the plant to make a protein 
called metallothionein which binds tightly to heavy metals such as 
cadmium mercury and copper in greenhouse tests university of 
kentucky scientists found that the protein lowered the level of 
cadmium on tobacco leaves by about a fourth 
slagle said the field trials will be in lexington ky 
beginning in late may and continuing through the summer

a top solidarity leader cautioned friday that 
poland could face a violent social upheaval despite the new 
political arrangement in that country 
the real danger to the new polish policy is not the resistance 
of hardliners but the economic situation said bronislaw geremek 
a historian who has served for nine years as a top adviser to lech 
walesa and is emerging as a senior statesman of the polish 
opposition 
geremek met friday with vice president dan quayle and with 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and addressed a 
seminar at the wilson center of the smithsonian institution 
speaking at the wilson center geremek warmly praised a speech 
on polish affairs given by president bush last month in which the 
president pledged economic assistance if the government carries 
through with economic reforms 
the direction was very good in president bushs speech we 
found the enunciation of a general policy said geremek 
polands communist authorities have relegalized solidarity 
which they outlawed and tried to crush under martial law from 1981 
through 1983 and they have agreed to elections next month in which 
solidarity and other opposition groups will be able to put forward 
candidates for the first time 
under the agreement a coalition consisting of the communists 
and allied parties is guaranteed a majority in the sejm or lower 
house of parliament but no quotas are set for a newly created 
senate 
equally important the agreement sets no quotas for communist 
domination under elections scheduled four years hence and it 
allows solidarity to publish its own masscirculation newspaper for 
the first time since the declaration of martial law in december 
1981 
we signed the agreement because we felt that an explosion of 
political unrest in poland could destroy a political deal 
geremek told the wilson center seminar 
the urgency is not overstated and i am not sure that we have 
obtained a comprehension of that from the government side he 
said 
communist officials have said they signed the agreement to widen 
political support for an economic reform program they have been 
pushing unsuccessfully for years 
the existance of strong trade unions is a danger to economic 
reforms said geremek referring not so much to solidarity which 
has agreed to work for the reforms but to official unions that 
have been pushing for higher wages 
at the end of the year the deterioration of the economic life 
of poland could destroy what could be a national rebirth he 
said we have a situation in which solidarity having gained 
tremendous moral authority may have the ability to prevent that 
explosion 
geremek forecast a poland in which communist authorities enjoy 
increasingly less power but which would not withdraw from the 
sovietled defensive alliance a step that prompted the invasion of 
hungary in 1956

former sen william proxmire dwis who 
waged a running battle against government waste and extravagance 
during his 31year senate career on friday issued his first golden 
fleece award as a private citizen 
his target multimillion dollar spending to help educate 
doctors by the public health service of the department of health 
and human services 
proxmires point physicians make more money as a class than 
virtually any other group of americans and can easily afford to 
finance their own educations even if they have to go into debt 
james brown a spokesman for hhss public health service said 
proxmires reference to the program he was harpooning was too vague 
to ascertain which one he meant 
its difficult to respond to this because we dont have 
specifics brown said there are a number of programs in which 
money is spent to educate doctors so it is impossible to determine 
which he means 
although proxmire said the program he wants eliminated costs 
100 million a year brown said he was not sure of the figure 
for example brown said one program dating back to the 1970s 
provides special training for new doctors to become primary care 
physicians this year 59 million will be spent on the program 
this is a program this administration and the previous one 
have tried to eliminate but the congress keeps putting the money 
back in brown said 
the administration wants to cut the program because it has 
already accomplished what we wanted to do getting doctors into 
the primary care areas he said 
proxmire said he believed that program was the one to which his 
award pertained and said both congress and the administration 
should share the blame for wasteful spending 
he said the executive branch should have taken a stronger stand 
and insisted the money be taken out of the budget 
if they the administration had made their case with 
sufficient force if they had publicly said this is a waste of 
taxpayers money theres no question congress would have had to 
react and eliminate it proxmire said 
at a news conference at the national press club proxmire said 
american doctors represent the worlds best compensated 
occupation 
there is no shortage of doctors to justify subsidizing their 
educations he said proxmire pointed out that while there were 142 
doctors for every 100000 americans in 1950 that ratio has 
increased to 233 per 100000 
doctors are increasing 60 percent faster than the population 
at large the former senator said 
and he says thats not surprising a profession that pays the 
average practitioner and i mean average 120000 a year will 
not not lack for new practitioners he said so what we have is 
100 million of your tax money spent for nothing 
proxmire issued his nonsenatorial golden fleece in a small 
burst of self promotion 
he is starting a nationwide weekly column syndicated by united 
features in which he will tell the country what he thinks about 
subsidizing the education of doctors as well as other issues 
the column will be proxmires first newspaper job since he was 
fired as a reporter by the madison wis capitol times in 1949 he 
says 
since then he has run his own publishing company served in the 
senate and issued more than 150 golden fleece awards in a series 
that was unbroken from march 1975 to last december when he retired 
from the senate 
previous targets include transporation department officials who 
spent 10000 to inspect the transportation system at disney world 
and government studies of why people fall in love and why prisoners 
want to escape from jail

mississippi burning has closed 
after a quiet fiveday run in the town portrayed in the movie 
about the deaths of three civil rights workers 
the film had been scheduled to open may 24 at the ellis theatre 
several months after its national premiere 
i found out it was the last week of schools and graduation so 
i moved it up to may 1014 shelly steiger whose family has 
owned philadelphias only theater for more than 35 years said 
friday 
steiger said the fiveday run was the way i play all my 
pictures he said he never considered extending the time because 
it would not pay off in a town of about 7000 people 
attendance was better than average steiger said although he 
could not provide figures most came to see it out of curiosity i 
think he said 
steiger suggested that many who wanted to see the film had done 
so in meridian 40 miles to the southeast where the movie opened 
jan 27 and ran for eight weeks 
monty royal manager of ramps cinema in meridian said the movie 
was the years biggest money maker for his theater in the city 
where federal trials of those accused in the civil rights murders 
were held 
most people were very understanding of the fact that hollywood 
made a movie that was entertaining royal said generally 
everybody that i saw said it was one of the better movies that they 
had seen and they did think the atmosphere that was played in the 
movie was indicative of the times 
mississippi burning is a fictionalized account of the 
federal investigation into the murders of james chaney andrew 
goodman and michael schwerner in neshoba county their bodies were 
found in an earthen dam near philadelphia six weeks after their 
deaths on june 21 1964 
the orion pictures release was praised by critics and won an 
academy award for best cinematography the movie was harshly 
criticized by people involved in the civil rights movement 
particularly blacks who said it gave the fbi too much credit 
steiger said he observed little reaction from philadelphia 
audiences 
it was just a very quiet crowd they had very few comments 
he said those who said anything said it was overblown so much 
of it didnt happen 
stanley dearman publisher of the weekly neshoba democrat 
newspaper agreed saying its just not being talked about very 
much 
dearman added that he was disappointed that steiger had 
slipped the movie in and slipped it out 
i would have loved to have been able to interview people 
exiting the movie to get their reaction said dearman who said 
he was out of town when mississippi burning opened 
steiger said the movie was advertised on the two local radio 
stations as usual

communist officials in slovenia 
said friday that yugoslavias most liberal republic needs an 
independent news agency the official tanjug news agency reported 
the slovenian news agency would compete with tanjug and would 
help in making the news reporting more objective an official 
of the republics socialist alliance a communistled mass 
organization was quoted as saying 
the belgradebased tanjug is now the only news agency in 
yugoslavia 
the northern republic of slovenia whose leadership advocates 
regional autonomy greater democracy and closer ties with the west 
has long been at odds with the republic of serbia where officials 
favor greater central control and a stronger federal government 
slovenian officials claim the serbian press including tanjug 
is conducting a media war against democratic processes in 
slovenia 
the founding of the slovenian news agency would help in 
avoiding biased and unobjective informing of the public 
slovenian officials reportedly said adding that the competition 
would also be good for tanjug 
in another development slovenias official youth organization 
demanded a retrial of four people sentenced to jail by a military 
court tanjug reported 
three slovenian journalists from the outspoken mladina youth 
weekly and an army sergeantmajor were sentenced last july to jail 
terms ranging from 10 months to four years on charges of possesing 
a classified document 
the action sparked a wave of public protests in slovenia which 
culminated with a rally of about 30000 people in the regional 
capital ljubljana on may 8 
the protesters claimed the charges and closed trial were rigged 
by the military to punish the journalists for publishing numerous 
articles sharply criticizing the armed forces 
the youth organization also demanded that the defendants be 
allowed to get civilian legal counsel instead of the military 
attorneys stipulated by army regulations 
under yugoslav law official requests by such organs must be 
taken into consideration by the regional authorities

national park and forest 
managers have taken too narrow a view in forming policies such as 
the suspended practice of allowing forest fires caused by nature to 
burn an expert said friday 
the key point is the parks can no longer be considered 
ecological or social islands university of washington professor 
james agee told the greater yellowstone coalition 
they are tied to surrounding areas for better or for worse 
the park manager who thinks he is independent of surrounding 
lands is living in a fantasy land 
agee said the goal in any future policies should not be to allow 
natural fires to burn for their own sake but to achieve natural 
changes in landscapes 
agee a fire resource management expert was a featured speaker 
at the influential private environmental groups first annual 
meeting since last summers devastating fires burned sections of 
nearly half of the 22 millionacre national park the coalition 
claims a membership of 3100 individuals and 60 organizations 
nationwide 
when the yellowstone fires were raging out of control in july 
the interior department suspended a let burn policy adopted in 
1972 under which naturally caused forest fires were allowed to burn 
unless they threatened lives or structures 
yellowstone spokeswoman joan anzelmo confirmed friday that 
lightningcaused fires will be fought in the park this summer 
agee said fire management policies in the future will have to be 
based on the ecosystem concept applying policies to areas in a 
region with similar ecologies 
we can no longer rely on the myth of natural regulation 
said the chairman of the university of washingtons division of 
forest resource management these are not closed systems 
changes in the worlds climate also will have to be considered 
agee said and current policies are not sufficient to the task 
we must look at a network of land managed for multiple 
goals he said we must recognize that the boundaries of the 
parks are permeable barriers 
and any policy must reflect the impact of man and his role in 
natural processes agee said 
agees comments followed welcoming statements by jim schmitt 
executive vice president of the coalition board who said ignorance 
among politicians the media and the public were to blame for the 
criticism heard about the management of the fires last summer

oliver norths prosecutors said friday they 
gathered their evidence independently from the former white house 
aides immunized congressional testimony given in 1987 
the government made the assertion in a federal court filing 
urging rejection of norths request for a posttrial hearing on the 
issue 
in his testimony on capitol hill north detailed many of the 
activities for which he was later accused of crimes including the 
three felonies for which he was ultimately convicted 
under a 1972 supreme court ruling the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh is required to show that its evidence wasnt 
derived from norths immunized testimony 
norths lawyers are seeking the hearing in an attempt to get the 
case against him dismissed they have said the grand jury that 
indicted him and the jury that convicted him might have been 
tainted by exposure to his immunized testimony 
but prosecutor david zornows response said the government 
demonstrated before and during the trial that its evidence had been 
collected without taint from norths 1987 testimony 
zornow said the allegation that the juries may have been tainted 
was speculation that was unfounded and irrelevant 
the thorough inquiry which the court has already made on the 
grand jury issue more than sufficiently discharges any supervisory 
duties that the court may have the prosecution asserted 
the prosecution also said the court and lawyers conducted a 
searching questioning of jurors in the north case before trial 
regarding any possible exposure to norths congressional testimony 
the exnational security council aide was found guilty may 4 of 
aiding and abetting an obstruction of congress altering and 
destroying classified documents and accepting an illegal gratuity 
north also is asking us district court judge gerhard a gesell 
to require that each member of the prosecution team be subjected to 
questioning at a hearing on possible taint from norths immunized 
testimony 
the government demonstrated before trial the extensive 
procedures adopted by independent counsel to insulate his staff 
including the three associate counsels who tried the case said 
zornow

law enforcement officials and scientists 
from across the nation met here friday to learn more about finding 
buried bodies by using an unusual study of buried pig carcasses 
pigs come closest to humans in bone structure blood type 
said kim castellano an investigator with the douglas county 
sheriffs office 
her agency and the arapahoe county sheriffs office began the 
buried pig carcass study last fall dubbing the project pigs for 
pigs in the ground study 
on friday the rocky mountain division of the international 
association of identification opened a twoday conference that drew 
140 law enforcement officials and scientists 
this is groundbreaking research no one has really studied the 
effects on buried bodies for law enforcement purposes said steve 
adams president of the rocky mountain division and a detective 
with the aurora police department 
volunteer scientists and law enforcement personnel have been 
studying pig burial sites at the highlands ranch law enforcement 
training facility since last september 
investigators said they have observed changes at the sites such 
as different plants growing around the graves they have collected 
insects that appear at the sites above and below ground and 
gases emitted from the ground 
the study has employed bloodhounds aerial photography and 
infrared sensing devices too during what may become a fiveyear 
project officials said 
the idea of using buried pigs was developed last summer 
investigators from the arapahoe and douglas county sheriffs 
departments and the colorado bureau of investigation found 
themselves talking about how difficult and expensive it is to 
search for hidden bodies 
the immediate results of the innovative study have been so 
dramatic that the rocky mountain division has attracted its largest 
conference audience ever said tom griffin of the cbi 
this is the most unusual conference in law enforcement ive 
ever seen with one effort said douglas county sheriff steve 
zotos 
the main thing that surprised me was the accuracy of the 
bloodhounds in locating the pig carcasses said castellano 
they went right to the pigs 
conferees have come from as far away as fairbanks alaska and 
illinois and texas and represent all branches of law enforcement 
from local police department to the fbi organizers said 
the research project also has brought in entomologists 
botanists anthropologists geologists archeologists and 
geophysicists 
after a concluding panel discussion saturday the conferees were 
expected to go out to the actual burial sites to study firsthand 
the clues and observe the changes in the areas

a 17yearold british math prodigy has 
accepted a oneyear post as a visiting lecturer at harvard 
university becoming one of the youngest ivy league faculty members 
ever harvard officials said friday 
ruth j lawrence was taught by her father in their home in 
huddersfield england and had never been to school before she 
entered oxford university at age 11 in 1983 
she graduated from the prestigious british university just two 
years later at age 13 and expects to receive a doctorate in 
mathematics there this year 
shes a very pleasant wellbalanced person happy to talk 
about various topics and not particularly aggressive or 
particularly shy said vaughan jones a professor of mathematics 
at the university of california at berkeley 
lawrence was courted by several leading american universities 
including berkeley and the institute for advanced studies at 
princeton university in new jersey before she accepted harvards 
offer 
jones who has visited lawrence in england said she is a 
vegetarian and likes bicycling on a tandem bike with her father a 
computer consultant 
while at oxford she earned a reputation as the best 
undergraduate ever in math there jones added 
harvard officials said she will arrive in the fall and spend her 
first semester in cambridge doing research free of teaching 
responsibilities in the spring she is scheduled to lead a 
graduate seminar on knot theory an area of theoretical mathematics 
dealing with knots and similar curved three dimensional objects 
keith ramsey a graduate student in math at harvard said 
students and faculty are curious to hear the british wunderkind 
theres been a lot of attention given to the fact that shes a 
teenager but i think that most of the interest we have is in 
fact going to be in what she does rather than in her being a 
prodigy he said 
harvard officials said they believed lawrence would be the 
youngest woman faculty member in the ivy league 
iris milotsky a spokeswoman for the american association of 
university professors in washington said a handful of child 
prodigies previously have taught at top universities 
its certainly unusual but not unprecedented she said 
one of the most famous of the prodigies was cotton mather who 
entered harvard at the age of 12 and received his degree three 
years later in 1678

amnesty international said friday that witnesses 
alleged that israeli soldiers summarily executed a palestinian 
activist in a west bank village in february 
the londonbased human rights organization demanded that israeli 
authorities urgently investigate the death of atwah lufti umar 
hirzallah 26 in deir abziye near ramallah 
it said the jerusalem post quoted unidentified israeli military 
sources on march 1 as saying people trying to block a road hurled 
rocks at a passing military patrol and soldiers fired killing 
hirzallah because they feared their lives were endangered 
amnesty said witnesses gave this account in sworn statements 
hirzallah and four others walked into deir abziye around 9 pm 
on feb 27 after taking home to a nearby village a friend who was 
wounded in earlier clashes with israeli soldiers 
the five were stopped by two israeli soldiers who had been 
waiting concealed behind a wall and were ordered to raise their 
hands 
one soldier turned a flashlight on them then focused it on 
hirzallah and the other soldier shot hirzallah with an m16 rifle 
at almost pointblank range 
the soldiers told the others to sit on the ground and villagers 
later were allowed to take hirzallah to ramallah hospital where he 
was pronounced dead 
the victims family was ordered to bury the body within hours 
amnesty said it telexed prime minister yitzhak shamir on april 
28 saying it was ready to turn over the statements to an impartial 
inquiry authority if assurances were given that the witnesses would 
not be endangered it said no response was received 
the statement said amnesty previously requested investigations 
into the killings of palestinians during the 17monthold uprising 
against israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip and 
this is the first time it has expressed fears of one being the 
result of a deliberate extrajudicial execution

the government outlined proposals friday to limit 
crossownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets in an attempt 
to prevent control from falling into a few hands 
home secretary douglas hurd said owners of national newspapers 
would be prohibited from having more than a 20 percent stake in any 
independent television station new radio stations and the 
satellite channels directly awarded by the government 
the ownership restrictions could hamper the expansion plans of 
britains biggest media investors notably rupert murdochs news 
corp and publisher robert maxwell both already own major 
newspapers 
murdochs company also controls britains only satellite 
station sky television 
maxwells interests include holdings in cable television and a 
planned satellite station he also has expressed his intention to 
bid for a new television license the government plans to offer 
owners would not be forced to sell properties they now hold 
said a spokeswoman for the home office who was not identified in 
accordance with british practice 
under the proposals regional and local newspapers would be 
limited to a 20 percent share of any regional tv and radio licenses 
in their geographic areas 
the same 20 percent limit would be placed on crossinterests 
between direct broadcast satellite companies independent tv and 
national radio license holders 
in a written response to a question in the house of parliament 
hurd said the proposed controls underscored the governments 
determination that ownership in the independent broadcasting sector 
should remain widely spread and that unhealthy concentrations of 
ownership and excessive crossmedia ownership should be prevented 
a comprehensive broadcasting bill including the proposals will 
be presented to parliament late this year

representatives of at least 22000 striking 
teachers and school officials negotiated for a second day friday as 
the first week of the walkout ended with high absenteeism and 
wasted cafeteria food 
only 259120 students in the nations second largest school 
district came to class friday out of a total enrollment of 551759 
said district spokesman shel erlich the week started with 329000 
students reporting 
a total of 11113 credentialed teachers showed up friday 
including 8660 regular teachers and 2453 substitutes normally 
there are 26250 teachers 
the united teacherslos angeles union and the los angeles 
unified school district continued talks under a news blackout 
imposed by a state mediator 
at this point im cautiously optimistic that maybe we can move 
forward i hope those hopes are not dashed this afternoon at the 
meeting said utla president wayne johnson at a downtown rally 
that drew about 2000 strikers 
with student attendance nearly cut in half cafeteria workers 
face a nearly impossible game of guessing how much food to prepare 
each day the result has been considerable waste 
only 112 of the districts 573 school kitchens have signed up 
for a program to donate unused food to various agencies said carol 
noelting deputy director of the food services branch 
we did another mailing to the schools recently to see if we 
could drum up more business she said 
the utla represents 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers 
counselors nurses and librarians 
some strikers have applied in the adjacent districts of 
alhambra arcadia la canada and south pasadena but none have 
been hired 
since the disclosure wednesday that the state will enjoy a 25 
billion tax surplus over the next two years several wage offers 
have been made 
johnson said he was confident some of the surplus would go to 
the los angeles school district under proposition 98 which 
designates for public schools virtually all surplus funds above a 
certain expenditure limit 
he said the union would like a threeyear contract with a 26 
percent raise including a 10 percent raise the first year 
the district said it could not sweeten its 215 percent offer 
over three years until it was sure it had the funds but offered a 
contingency wage package of 24 percent over three years if it did 
receive some of the money 
the strike is the districts first since a 23day walkout in 
1970 
currently teachers annually earn from 23440 in beginning pay 
to 43319 to those with doctorates 98 extra course units and 19 
years experience

an eightnation african summit meeting this 
week has produced the first hopes of a greater willingness by the 
angolan government to enter into serious peace negotiations with 
usbacked rebels a bush administration official said friday 
but a representative of the rebel group here said he saw no 
change in the angolan governments position 
although details of the meeting remain sketchy the us 
official said angolan president eduardo dos santos for the first 
time expressed support for the concept of reconciliation with 
the unita rebels 
reconciliation can only come in the context of negotiation 
said the official asking not to be identified he noted that 
angolas marxist government has steadfastly refused to engage in 
such talks with the anticommunist insurgents 
unitas longstanding policy has been to promote negotiations 
leading to national reconciliation and ultimately to free 
multiparty elections 
the summit meeting held last tuesday in the angolan capital of 
luanda marked a departure from the angolan governments prior 
insistence that neighboring countries not have a role in seeking a 
solution to the countrys destructive 14yearold civil war 
at one point the official speaking to a small group of 
reporters alluded to the possibility of a breakthrough in the 
angola deadlock but acknowledged that state department information 
on the details of the angolan governments position was thin 
last december the united states brokered an agreement that 
calls for independence and black majority rule in namibia coupled 
with the withdrawal of cuban forces in angola over a 27month 
period 
us officials have been encouraging angola to open serious 
negotiations with unita sooner rather than later because the 
countrys negotiating position will weaken as the number of cuban 
troops declines 
according to official estimates the cuban presence has dropped 
by about 8000 since the agreement was signed five months ago the 
total now is believed to be about 44000 
apprised of the us officials position a local unita 
representative jardo mukeilia said i dont necessarily share 
his optimism 
the angolan government is still insisting the unita rebels lay 
down their arms and then reintegrate into angolan society as part 
of a national reconstruction effort he said 
he added that dos santos referred to reconciliation in the 
context of amnesty and clemency and not as the result of a 
negotiating process 
in addition to angola the nations attending the luanda meeting 
were zambia zimbabwe zaire the congo gabon mozambique and sao

burmese troops on friday shelled a 
rebel stronghold in the offensive to crush a 40yearold insurgency 
in eastern karen state a thai border patrol officer reported 
he said soldiers peppered the kaw moo ra camp rebel camp just 
across the moei river from thailand with mortar shells 
the officer speaking with the condition he not be identified 
estimated that about 1200 karen guerrillas are defending the camp 
against about 3000 soldiers 
government forces began shelling kaw moo ra on thursday two 
days after overrunning the major rebel base of wangkha 1 miles to 
the south 
wangkha was the fifth karen strongold to be captured by army 
units since the government launched an offensive in december 
a government spokesman told a news conference friday in rangoon 
the burmese capital that at least 43 rebels were killed in the 
battle for wangkha he said 35 soldiers were killed and 95 wounded 
the burmese government has said 600 guerrillas and 177 soldiers 
perished in the battle for maela the last camp to fall before

along thailands mae sot district

for their insurgency the karen national union has an estimated 
4000 combatants and is the largest of a dozen ethnic groups 
battling the burmese government 
karens began their revolt in 1949 a year after burma achieved

a large industrial organization is urging the 
government to more than double its spending on defenserelated 
research and development 
cricis claim the suggestion by the federation of economic 
organizations known as keidanren is aimed at making the nation a 
military power 
in a report submitted to the defense agency keidanren said the 
share of research and development expenditures in the defense 
budget should be increased to more than 5 percent the minimum 
share allotted in major western advanced countries 
a defense agency official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said friday the federations suggestion would be considered in 
preparing the new defense plan the current fiveyear plan totaling 
765 billion ends in 1990 
in the defense budget for fiscal 1989 which began april 1 595 
million was allotted for research and development that is 21 
percent of the total defense budget which is expected to be 
approved later this month 
the united states earmarked 123 percent of its defense budget 
to research and development in 1988 that would be about 104 times 
the amount spent by japan 
britain spent 117 percent of its defense budget on research and 
west germany 54 percent according to defense agency figures 
keidanrens suggestion was not made in connection with the joint 
usjapan project to coproduce japans next generation jet 
fighter known as the fsx according to masao kanamori who led the 
federations 80member committee that compiled the report 
the fsx project was approved tuesday after long debate by the 
us senate with an amendment insisting the united states be given 
more than 40 percent of the production work some congressmen 
criticized the project as a giveaway of us technology 
the congressional debate led some japanese to question japans 
reliance on us technology for its defense 
japan originally wanted to produce the fsx on its own but agreed 
to joint production under us pressure 
most of japans defenserelated hardware including its f15 
jets is produced by japanese manufacturers under license from the 
original us makers 
keidanren officials want japan to develop its own defense 
technology 
a onesided flow of technology is not good kanamori told 
reporters recently he is the chairman of mitsubishi heavy 
industries ltd japans leading defense contractor 
in its report keidanren called on the government to accelerate 
construction of largescale facilities that exceed privatesector 
capabilities such as wind tunnels used in tests for aircraft 
engines and missile ranges 
there is no testing range for longdistance missiles in japan 
and defense agency personnel conduct missile training at a us 
army facility near el paso texas 
japans commercial technology is outstanding and now they 
japanese businesses are challenging military technology said 
haruo fujii a commentator on military affairs japan may rely on 
us technology during the next 10 to 20 years but japanese 
industry wants this country to become a military power that 
requires no dependence on americans 
under the present fiveyear plan japans selfdefense capability 
is to be raised to enable its armed forces to repulse a limited 
smallscale attack japans 240000member selfdefense forces is 
the only customer for its military industry arms exports are 
banned although japan can transfer defense technology to the 
united states under an accord 
japans constitution drafted by us occupation forces after 
world war ii renounces war the issue of a military buildup is 
sensitive in japan and in other asian countries seized by japanese 
forces during the war

west german defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg ending two days of talks with secretary of state james 
a baker iii said the two had made progress in forging a 
common stance on the future of natos shortrange nuclear missiles 
the overall discussions were very very encouraging the 
defense minister said hours after a senior west german government 
source said in bonn that the united states and west germany had 
agreed in principle on a compromise 
the germans gave secretary baker a proposal on the shortrange 
nuclear forces issue said a senior white house official we 
made a numer of changes and suggestions late today the united 
states returned a paper to the germans with a number of explicit 
conditions to consider no responses have yet been received as far 
as we know we do not have an agreement 
but the official said its fair to say theres been progress 
we are exchanging papers and studying specific language 
asked if they expected to reach a compromise before a critical 
nato summit meeting opens may 29 the official said obviously 
wed like to do that 
stoltenberg talking with reporters before a meeting with vice 
president dan quayle declined to comment on whether there was an 
agreement in principle on the issue which has threatened to split 
the alliance 10 days before the nato summit meeting 
pressed on whether he and baker had made progress stoltenberg 
said 
we work for a common position so we have to argue and try to 
come together and we made progress 
one washington diplomatic source close to the discussions said 
baker and stoltenberg were trying to come to a gentlemans 
agreement on the missile dilemma before the 16nation nato summit 
meeting in brussels may 2930 
but that source said no final agreement was expected to emerge 
from the bakerstoltenberg discussions as both men wished to 
consult with their superiors about their talks 
at the state department baker huddled with the defense minister 
for an hour in an unusual oneonone session before allowing other 
officials to enter it was their second round of talks in as many 
days 
the west germans have insisted that the united states take the 
soviet union up on its proposal to open talks on the arsenals of 
shortrange nuclear weapons maintained by nato and the warsaw pact 
the bush administration has balked saying such negotiations 
would be a mistake because they would lead to the elimination of 
the nuclear weapons nato needs in the face of the warsaw pacts 
superiority in conventional arms 
stoltenberg came to washington to indicate that his government 
was prepared to be more flexible about the timing of such 
negotiations and that bonn favored a compromise delaying formal 
talks on the shortrange missiles until there is significant 
progress in cutting back the soviet blocs conventional forces 
stoltenberg was leaving friday for bonn and a meeting sunday 
with chancellor helmut kohl one source said 
baker flew to president bushs retreat in kennebunkport maine 
where the chief executive has summoned his top arms control 
advisers to discuss natos nuclear arsenal 
the president was also preparing a welcome for french president 
francois mitterrand at the seaside retreat saturday 
the two leaders are expected to discuss the missile matter 
mitterrand has spoken out against the elimination of the 
shortrange weapons but has also said a nato decision on replacing 
the aging weapons need not be made before 1992 
earlier the west german government source said in bonn that the 
united states had agreed to support the concept of negotiations to 
reduce shortrange missiles in return for west german assurances at 
the nato summit that the talks would not be aimed at removing all 
such weapons 
the bonn source said west germany would go along with the rest 
of the alliance on a statement of unity that would make it clear 
nato does not yet seek the elimination of shortrange nuclear 
weapons only reductions 
the project to extend the range of the shortrange nato missiles 
has been shelved until at least 1991 the official said 
the united states and britain have pressed nato to move ahead 
with updating its lance shortrange missiles and have said no talks 
on the weapons should be agreed to until a conventional balance is 
achieved with the warsaw pact 
most of the 88 lance launchers and their 700 singlewarhead 
rockets are based in west germany with a present range of about 75 
miles they are considered battlefield weapons and are designed to 
be put to use primarily on german territory

an 80yearold woman who has been picketing 
in front of a courthouse for two years won the support of the local 
naacp chapter friday in her bid to free her grandson from prison 
morgan miller 31 has been in prison for five years for an 
armed robbery he contends he did not commit and his case should be 
reopened said lee williams local director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
williams said he has read transcripts of the trial and looked 
into the case he said he was appalled at the number of 
inconsistencies including the fact that another man had confessed 
to the robbery 
this case was pushed through the court system without regard 
to the facts the system needs to right itself im really 
convinced hes innocent williams said 
williams said he has asked the national organization to 
investigate the case and to hire charles carter a lawyer who 
helped free lenell jeter from a texas jail jeter a computer 
programmer was wrongly convicted of robbing a fastfood 
restaurant a judge ruled 
williams said the miller case was brought to his attention by 
reaber brown who has been picketing twice a week for two years in 
front of the lucas county courthouse ms brown sold her house to 
pay for her grandsons legal fees 
lucas county prosecutor anthony pizza said his office welcomes 
anybody to look at the facts of the case we have no problems with 
that 
i feel sorry for his grandmother but i commend her for her 
persistence pizza said but there isnt much more that can be 
done at this point 
miller was convicted of aggravated robbery and assault in 1984 
in connection with the dec 14 1983 robbery of a fastfood 
restaurant in which a toledo police officer was shot and wounded 
miller was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison and is in the 
lebanon correctional institution 
williams said a number of points were ignored during the trial 
he said miller a professional musician had no police record 
miller is physicially similar to joseph clark who allegedly 
confessed to the holdup clark is on death row for two murders 
miller was identified by a witness from a group of men in which 
he was the only black 
miller also said he was at the restaurant with a friend who was 
home on leave from the navy earlier the night it was robbed when 
miller went on trial the friend was supposed to testify but did 
not receive notice about the trial until several days after it had 
ended 
pizza said clark confessed to the holdup and later recanted the

president bush met with top military 
advisers at his seaside home friday to review plans for a nato 
summit threatened by discord and to discuss strategy for arms talks 
with the soviet union 
as talks were under way in washington to ease the nato crisis 
bush met at his vacation retreat with defense secretary dick 
cheney joint chiefs chairman adm william crowe national security 
adviser brent scowcroft and other aides white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said no final decisions would be 
announced friday from the meeting 
under cloudy skies and in chilly weather bush and his advisers 
posed for pictures in front of the windswept sea wall near his 
home but did not comment on their talks 
the session came on the eve of the arrival here of french 
president francois mitterrand who generally backs bush on the nato 
dispute 
mitterrand and his wife danielle will spend the night in a guest 
home on bushs compound located on a rocky point jutting out into 
the atlantic ocean 
natos harmony has been shaken by a dispute largely between the 
united states and west germany 
west german chancellor helmut kohl facing domestic pressure for 
disarmament has called for eastwest negotiations soon on reducing 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
bush has rejected the idea arguing western europe needs the 
weapons to compensate for the sovietled warsaw pacts large 
advantage in troops tanks and other conventional forces 
the snf shortrange nuclear forces issue of course is one 
thats under consideration right now and is driving the meeting 
of bush and his advisers fitzwater said 
he said he did not know if a compromise could be struck before 
the nato meeting opening may 29 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii held a 
second day of talks with west germany defense minister gerhard 
stoltenberg to try to resolve the dispute 
baker flew to kennebunkport and joined bush scowcroft and john 
curley the us ambassador to france for a game of golf mugging 
for cameras on the 18th hole bush admonished photographers to be 
quiet 
as the president prepared to swing a baby cried bush stopped 
and theatrically said please this is very important were two 
down 
white house chief of staff john sununu also was to fly here 
friday 
the west germans also oppose a usbritish effort to more than 
triple the range of existing lance missiles to just below 300 
miles the aging usbuilt lance now can hit targets from about 
75 miles and most of the 88 launchers and 700 singlewarhead 
missiles are based in west germany 
mitterrand at a news conference thursday before leaving paris 
spoke out against elimination of the shortrange nuclear weapons 
but said nato did not have to decide about modernizing the weapons 
until 1992 
fitzwater denied that mitterands comments urging a goslow 
approach on modernizing natos nuclear forces were in conflict with 
the us stance 
president mitterrands comments yesterday indicate that his 
position is very similar to ours he shares our general concern 
about the strength of the nato alliance fitzwater said 
aside from the nato flap bush and the military advisors 
discussed details of a defense strategy review dealing with 
strategic nuclear weapons and arms control 
fitzwater said bush would disclose some findings of the review 
in a speech wednesday at the us coast guard academy and so 
they need to make some final judgments before that address 
occurs he said 
the review also will put in place the groundwork for the 
resumption of strategic arms talks between the united states and 
soviet union 
fitzwater also brushed aside reports that mitterrands party was 
unhappy with his accommodations in kennebunkport 
as far as i know the accommodations are satisfactory to the 
french delegation the discussions of accommodations have gone 
quite well we dont have any problems he said 
the new york daily news quoted unidentified sources as saying 
mitterrand was unhappy with the size of the bed and the height of 
the toilet in the house where hell say the house owned by bushs 
mother dorothy walker bush is next to the presidents home 
the article also said that barbara bush was upset about the 
mitterrands visit claiming it to be disruptive 
fitzwater said the bushes had decided to restrict press coverage 
of the mitterrand visit within the oceanside compound 
the family feels their home is their private residence and 
should not be used for publicity purposes they want to keep it 
personal and i think thats reasonable he said 
bush plans to travel to greenwich conn on sunday to visit his 
ailing 87yearold mother a white house aide said friday 
hes just coming in to see her and then hes leaving said 
john meserve the press aide 
the presidents mother was released from greenwich hospital may 
11 after four days of treatment for a blood clot in her right leg 
the hospital said

country joe mcdonald whose rock band country joe 
and the fish appeared at the woodstock festival remembers how 
strained his life was growing up in a communist family 
joan sokoloff a 48yearold therapist grew up in boston in the 
1950s but she might as well have spent her childhood on another 
planet while other children were watching father knows best 
sokoloff the daughter of communists was contemplating world 
change 
i couldnt care less if they were investigated as communists 
or not said mcdonald who grew up in southern california all 
i cared about was when i went to a cub scout meeting or went to 
play baseball i didnt feel comfortable anymore 
said sokoloff they my parents always used to say that the 
revolution is just around the corner so there was always a sense 
that we were working toward something imminent 
mcdonald and sokoloff are two of five socalled red diaper 
babies the children of communists who appear in children of 
the left a new documentary by filmmaker eric stange the 
60minute film traces the evolution of children raised as 
communists who are now adults in a conservative america 
the topic is a hot one loyalties a sons memoir a new 
book by former washington post investigative reporter carl 
bernstein is the story of bernsteins childhood in a communist 
family 
bernstein writes about the conflicting legacy left by communist 
parents his story is woven out of what he says are the torn 
loyalties and lasting repercussions of a communist childhood 
stange found that communist parents left a mixed legacy some of 
their children remained communists one became a reagan 
conservative but almost all remain political and most vote 
stange 35 a former reporter and editor for the boston herald 
had made one previous documentary the pitch of grief when he 
decided to make a film about the children of communists he knew 
several as friends and found out about others through them a 
network exists among them as adults he said formed from childhood 
when communist families often sent their children to the same 
progressive summer camps and schools 
but stange said that even now many who grew up in communist 
households were still hesitant going public about the experience 
the penalties were too great in the 50s he said 
stange spoke to 50 former red diaper babies interviewed 15 
on tape and culled five for his film the term red diaper 
babies has several rumored origins one is that communist parents 
in the 20s were so poor that they used the red flags they received 
in return for their party dues to diaper their babies 
i found an incredible mixture of pride and anger he said 
it was a way of looking at the world that was much more open and 
diverse and worldly than what most american kids were getting 
the film which premiered last month in cambridge and was 
coproduced with the newton television foundation will also be 
shown at new yorks public theater this month and in los angeles in 
june 
the stories that unfold on camera are generally happy ones 
though they participated in one of the most tumultuous periods in 
american history stanges subjects recall their childhoods with 
more pleasure than pain 
eugene dennis jr son of the former general secretary in the 
american communist party was a longshoreman for many years and is 
now a historian in the film tears come to his eyes as he recalls 
how safe he felt held in the arms of singeractorwriter paul 
robeson at one point during the worst of the communist witch hunts 
in the 50s 
david horowitz the son of public schoolteachers in new york 
edited the leftist magazine ramparts in the 60s he has since 
become a bestselling author of biographies with david collier and 
a conservative republican richard healey whose mother was a 
highranking communist leader in southern california edits an 
antinuclear magazine 
the film uses archival footage to trace the relatively swift 
downfall of the communist party in the united states which had 
formed in 1919 and enjoyed peak years in the 30s and early 40s 
children of the left also outlines the turmoil that marked 
the partys rapid decline beginning with the red scare initiated 
in the 50s by the house committee on unamerican activities 
chaired by sen joseph mccarthy the execution of julius and ethel 
rosenberg in 1953 and revelations in 1956 that soviet leader josef 
stalin was a murderous dictator 
several of the subjects of the film recall their parents were 
jailed regularly joan sokoloff remembers the day one of her 
mothers arrests made the front page of the boston globe her 
struggle to overcome her own embarrassment and her eventual pride 
in her parents work 
healey recalls his childhood years at communist party meetings 
and picnics as the happiest moments of my life 
growing up with ideals like that with a world view of wanting 
a better life for people it was still a very rich way of life 
said sokoloff

the brownrobed nun moves from shrub to 
shrub carefully watering a welltended row of plants along the 
edge of a broad lawn in the middle stands a 23foot wooden cross 
but the serenity of the scene vanishes just a few feet behind 
her 
there stand the gray barbedwiretopped fence and square guard 
towers of auschwitz headquarters of a nazi concentration camp 
complex where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945 
and the peaceful hollowedout lawn with the flowers and the 
cross where the nun works is in fact a former gravel pit where 
political prisoners were gunned down by their nazi executioners in 
194041 
the 14 nuns of the barefoot carmelite monastery built in a 
former nazi storehouse on the auschwitz camp perimeter are not 
answering questions these days reporters are politely turned away 
at the gate 
they are at the center of an international controversy 
their very presence at the camp is deeply offensive to jews who 
resent christian religious symbols at the place that was the main 
engine of hitlers final solution the site of death for an 
estimated 25 million people whose only crime was being jewish 
calls for the nuns removal were repeated by jewish leaders in 
western europe israel and the united states this spring after the 
roman catholic church missed a february deadline for moving the 
sisters to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built at 
an undetermined site farther from the camp 
the agreement to move the nuns and build the prayer center 
within two years was signed in geneva on feb 22 1987 at a 
meeting of 18 jewish and roman catholic leaders and the removal of 
the convent was to be carried out by the archbishop of krakow 
cardinal franciszek macharski 
but now a polish newspaper is waging a campaign to keep the nuns 
at the cloister they founded in 1984 and the issue is gaining 
support from some residents who argue that the nuns are not harming 
anyone 
the newspaper slowo powszechne universal word the organ of 
the progovernment lay catholic group pax published an open letter 
assailing the plans to move the nuns 
the letter accusing the jewish side of illegal demands 
to ruthlessly carry out an illegal eviction says that the 
nuns should stay because the building they occupy is not actually 
within the camp also it argues the main killing site for jews 
was not in auschwitz itself but at the muchlarger subsidiary camp 
birkenenau about a mile away 
but krzysztof sliwinski a catholic journalist for the liberal 
church weekly tygodnik powszechny maintained such arguments are 
disingenuous 
although it isnt on the strict grounds it is just two or 
three meters beyond the fence he said symbolically it is in 
the camp 
sliwinski said he does not expect the slowo powszechne campaign 
to alter the plans to move the convent which were confirmed by the 
church episcopate earlier this year but he sees the controversy as 
symptomatic of the wider problems in catholicjewish relations in 
poland 
here there is a sort of unresolved tension between catholics 
and jews he said the relationship is characterized by deep 
misunderstandings resentments and mutual ignorance 
poland is overwhelmingly catholic and poles have difficulty 
imagining why anyone would object to the nuns being next to the 
camp where so many people were killed including roman catholic 
priests and nuns and tens of thousands of nonjewish poles 
sliwinski said that one aspect of the problem is that after the 
decision was made to move the monastery it was never properly 
explained to the people 
jews number barely 10000 people in poland and are virtually 
invisible in social life the nazis killed 3 million of the 
countrys 34 million jews and most of the survivors emigrated 
the last wave after a communist antisemitic purge in 1968 
at the convent itself a theater before world war ii there are 
no outward signs that the nuns are planning to move they have 
planted their garden for another year and workmen moving in and out 
apparently are making improvements inside a way of the cross 
with 13 stations has been put next to the camps walls 
the church hierarchy still says it intends to move the nuns but 
said in a bishops statement it had run into to difficulties 
the difficulties are not a manifestation of ill will 
the statement said in part they result from administrative 
formalities in part from the history of oswiecim itself from its 
significance and the symbolic meaning of this place for the polish 
nation 
as oswiecim is for jews a symbol of shoah remembrance for 
poles it remains the place of bloody martyrdom of the polish nation 
for us poles both the construction of the center as well as 
the presence of the carmelite nuns there in the spirit of the 
agreement signed feb 22 1987 in geneva have a great significance 
for the future 
church spokesmen were reluctant to discuss the dispute further 
the rev stanislaw dadat of the krakow curia said only that 
arrangements were being made to secure land about 350 yards from 
the camp for the interfaith center and to gather building materials 
the polish government says it is not involved in the dispute 
we are not a side in the conflict but would like to see it 
solved so that both sides catholics and jews are satisfied 
said edward kotowski of the state office of religious affairs we 
think that both sides which reached an agreement should stick to 
it

the submarine uss squalus lay on the 
atlantic floor and in the forward torpedo room gerald mclees and 
his shipmates sat quietly conserving oxygen and hoping that 
someone would realize their routine test dive had gone tragically 
wrong 
shortly before as the crew of 59 had prepared to test the 
boats ability to submerge within 60 seconds while running at high 
speed everything was normal said mclees recalling the 
sinking 50 years ago tuesday he was then a 25yearold chief 
electricians mate 
as the subs trial run began 13 miles off the new hampshire 
coast a panel of green lights indicated that all the hull openings 
were closed and the captain lt oliver naquin gave the order to 
dive 
suddenly water began pouring into the engine rooms 
apparently 31inchwide valves used to draw air in when the sub 
was on the surface had opened without tripping warning indicators 
in the control room an inquiry later identified the cause as a 
mechanical malfunction 
my reaction was to get everything shut off said allen carl 
bryson who at the time was a 21yearold machinists mate second 
class if there was any panic it was all in the end we didnt 
have time for things like that 
mclees and bryson and their shipmates worked to seal off their 
forward battery compartment but water was not the only menace they 
faced as the sub tilted bow up and descended 
chief electricians mate lawrence gainer noticed that seawater 
had shorted out one of the ships two batteries creating a rapid 
voltage drain 
he wedged himself into a narrow crawl space to shut off the 
power 
it was two big switches he had to pull when he pulled one of 
them it threw such an arc that the arc didnt break until he 
pulled the other one mclees said 
the light seared his eyes damaging them permanently but 
gainer probably saved the boat bryson said 
even so the trouble was just beginning for the squalus before 
its ordeal was over 26 of the 59 crewmen would be lost the rest 
credited their survival to the first nontest use of a special 
rescue chamber 
naquins submarine now without light or communications he 
ordered bryson to herd crewmen forward as chlorine gas formed from 
a seawater reaction in the battery compartment 
petty officer 3rd class lloyd maness was on watch near a 
critical hatch between the control room and the subs rapidly 
flooding rear compartments according to a 1988 article in the 
journal naval history as maness strained to close the 200pound 
hatch he heard panicked voices calling keep it open keep it 
open writer carl la vo recounted 
five men staggered uphill halfswimming to safety maness 
then pulled the steel door shut behind it no one would survive 
la vo wrote 
the lack of power kept the crew from signaling the portsmouth 
naval shipyard in kittery maine but authorities realized there 
was trouble when the squalus failed to send a surfacing message one 
hour after it announced it was starting its dive 
the squalus sent a buoy to the surface with a telephone line 
attached and periodically fired red smoke rockets 
the sculpin the squalus sister ship was dispatched from 
portsmouth and lookouts spotted the smoke rockets 
some 240 feet below the squalus crew was cheered by the sudden 
churning of the sculpins engines we knew somebody had spotted 
us anyway mclees said 
but it was 23 hours after the sinking before the submarine 
tender falcon arrived from new london conn carrying the mccann 
rescue chamber a nineton diving bell that would be lowered to a 
hatch on the sub and used to bring up survivors 
mclees was one of the first to ride up bryson and naquin were 
in the last group 
with navy divers john mihalowski and william badders inside the 
bell made a final descent for the hazardous mission of opening a 
hatch to check for survivors in rear compartments the two found 
water right up to the neck of the hatch concluding that 
there couldnt possibly be any life down there badders now 
dead told a naval institute interviewer in 1971 
mihalowski and badders received the medal of honor for their 
role in the rescue 
relief changed to sorrow as the survivors returned to the 
shipyard 
mclees single at the time watched other men joyfully reunited 
with their wives on the pier 
of course there were some there their husbands didnt come 
back he said 
mclees returned to the squalus less than a year later after the 
boat was salvaged and rechristened the sailfish he served aboard 
during seven world war ii patrols in the pacific 
the sailfish was decommissioned at portsmouth on oct 27 1945 
its conning tower was placed in a park at the shipyard which holds 
an annual memorial service

directing the economy isnt like guiding a 
spaceship yet a lot of investors are making the comparison they 
are looking for an economic soft landing from the long expansion of 
the 1980s 
convinced it can be done they are putting their money on the 
line bidding up stock prices and creating a great deal of 
excitement about the possibility of new highs in the market 
averages 
the popular reasoning is that as the economy cools interest 
rates will fall and falling interest rates generally are good for 
stocks low rates reduce business costs and they attract money that 
might have gone into bonds 
the softlanding thesis has gained many adherents brokers are 
calling old customers with new tips market letter writers are 
talking about 3000 points on the dow jones industrial average 
business week magazine declares a soft landing will send the 
market soaring stocks are exciting once again 
what may be missing from the scenario however is the most 
essential of all the ingredients that make up market prices and 
that is profits 
an economic cooling might indeed be accompanied by lower 
borrowing rates but wont it mean lower profits too 
historically and logically thats been the case and if profits 
decline what will hold prices up 
while some investors might dwell to their advantage on that 
question others are wondering why we should expect the federal 
reserve to guide the 77monthold economic expansion to a gentle 
kind soft landing 
that sort of denouement is to be wished for of course but 
wishing wont make it come for decades economic soft landings 
have been a dream but hardly an accomplishment the economy reacts 
in ways that cannot be forecast 
it was popular in the 1960s for example to talk about fine 
tuning those who directed fiscal policy would join with monetary 
officials to make the economy dance to a sweet melody in which 
every note would be perfect 
that notion didnt even last the decade before the 60s were 
done the idea of finetuning had been trashed 
because the economy was manageable president lyndon johnson had 
reasoned we can make it produce not just butter but guns too but 
the recordhigh inflation and interest rates that followed 
represented a crash for the finetuning idea 
today the equivalent of fine tuning is soft landing can it be 
done maybe if we have managed to assimilate a great deal of 
information from the past 
meanwhile what about profits can they hold up can stock 
prices hold 
the answer to the profits question might come later this year 
when yeartoyear comparisons could turn negative at the moment 
profits compared to a year ago look healthy but those comparisons 
might turn paler in october it doesnt take losses to make an 
investor reconsider just a slowing of gains 
because the stock market usually anticipates such things the 
possibility of a decline in the growth of profits could have 
significance for investors right now 
nobody knows whether the stock market is going to soar to the 
heavens but in the next few weeks many investors will be asking 
themselves if the economic technicians like those in the space 
program have the skills for the job

fears that hong kong 
investors and immigrants will change the placid ways of this scenic 
pacific city have surged into the open with charges of racism not 
far behind 
mayor gordon campbell who is sponsoring a series of public 
forums intended to calm the escalating controversy said people are 
looking for an easy way to explain the rapid changes tied to the 
citys growth 
i think theres no question that people are concerned he 
said in an interview i think the fears are real so lets 
shine the light on them 
soaring housing prices and high profile projects in commercial 
real estate in the past year have made asian specifically hong 
kong investment the hottest topic in the area 
the local newspapers are devoting full pages to letters to the 
editor about the issue 
native vancouverites will be made to feel like strangers in 
their own city as the influx of asians and their capital freezes 
them out wrote one reader to the province 
this is a golden opportunity to absorb investment and skilled 
professionals said another on the same page it is of 
paramount importance that british columbia not just become a 
prosperous province but also maintain a harmonious multicultural 
environment for all its inhabitants old and new 
the debate covers a wide range including the increasing number 
of asian children in neighborhood schools 
perhaps no project has attracted as much attention as the 16 
billion pacific place project on the false creek downtown 
waterfront lands where expo 86 attracted attention to the city 
li kashing the hong kong magnate who is the projects major 
financier purchased the lands from the city for the canadian 
dollar equivalent of 269 million the government must bear the 
substantial cost of removing industrial waste from the site 
theres an old chinese saying that a big tree gathers the 
wind stanley kwok a senior vice president of concord pacific 
developments ltd said in explaining the attention paid his 
companys massive project 
wherever theres change one thing will stand out said 
kwok who has been in vancouver for 21 years just like any north 
american neighborhood nobody wants change 
about 20 percent of the vancouver area population of 12 million 
is of chinese origin many of them people whose families have been 
in canada for generations 
the external affairs department in ottawa has estimated that 
investment from hong kong will increase sharply to 33 billion in 
canada this year from 2 billion in 1988 
always in the equation is 1997 when control of hong kong goes 
back to china from britain 
racism mayor campbell said gets to be a very quick answer 
thats wrong 
the heated housing market that sent the average price of a 
vancouver home up by some 45 percent to 181282 at the end of 
march from 127344 has been hard for vancouver residents to ignore 
the supply and demand got out of balance and there was a 
major price correction upward said jerry jackman senior vice

graham johnson a sociologist at the university of british

has been a constant problem in the region since the first chinese 
arrived in 1858 but has boiled over in the past year 
what you have going on is a degree of scapegoating he said 
johnson said the change has been the movement of chinese 
immigrants out of traditional ethnic neighborhoods to the affluent 
west side where the tearing down of modest older properties and 
replacement by huge homes became a noticeable trend 
johnson said the number of chinese immigrants has not increased 
sharply over past periods with an estimated 5000 last year but 
the arrival of affluent immigrants has not taken place to this 
extent before 
all of this raises a lot of hackles he said one doesnt 
see a very swift solution to some of the problems that we

the temple of the siwan oracle where 
the superstitious young conqueror alexander the great was told he 
was a god sits in ruin on its hillside perch 
shali a majestic 13thcentury fortress that protected siwans 
from medieval bedouin marauders is a sandcastle of rubble 
stripped of its glory by neglect and the oasis infrequent but 
devastating desert rains 
the village silversmith is gone along with most of the 
elaborate jewelry he crafted gigantic bangles that jingled from 
the oasis richly costumed women 
berber and sudanese heritage have blended into siwan life along 
with other tongues and cultures carried over saharan sands to form 
its roots and distinct language 
so much made siwa only 85 miles from libya unique in egypt 
and much of that is gone 
but much is left 
as it has for a thousand years life in siwa begins before dawn 
with the muezzim calling moslems to prayer from minarets of mosques 
scattered through the oasis date palms and olive groves 
then a donkey serenade begins hundreds bray echoing through 
the palms followed by a chorus of roosters 
earlymorning markets open to the cloppetyclop of donkeys 
pulling kerussahs family carts driven by caftanwearing men or 
boys wives and mothers covered headtotoe in flowing blue 
embroidered shawls called milayah sit behind with smaller children 
covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service sharing bumpy 
roadways with military trucks and with increasing frequency 
tourist buses from cairo 
camels never made it big in siwa donkeys are cheaper 
until the early 1980s virtually all sounds and sights in siwa 
would have been familiar to siwans centuries earlier but four 
years ago a highway became the oasis umbilical cord to egypt and 
the arabic language 
the threehour 190mile drive from mersa matrouh on the western 
egyptian coast covers generally the same desert route over which 
2000 years ago people from around the mediterranean alexander 
among them trekked for more than a week seeking the wisdom of the 
famed desert oracle 
more recently buyers for chic boutiques in cairo and europe 
have traveled it taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts 
siwans have been put on parade for an evergrowing number of 
often scantily dressed visitors 
television invaded siwa in 1986 and more than 1000 sets were 
sold the first week like their fellow egyptians siwans go to bed 
chatting about the latest plot twists of falcon crest or knots 
landing 
young siwans now heading in increasing numbers for higher 
education in cairo and alexandria have far fewer traditions to 
remember but many more influences to contemplate 
but for siwas 10000 inhabitants the infusion and confusion 
hasnt been all bad 
a yearold us aid project gives them clean water for the first 
time extracted from salty subterranean pools the desalinated 
water costs 5 piasters just over 2 cents a jerrycan which even 
the poor can afford instead of 75 piasters 30 cents when water 
was trucked from outside 
electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic but 
czechoslavakian generators are being installed that promise a 
constant power supply 
one aid project is working to save siwas soul 
more than a year ago marc perron then canadas ambassador to 
egypt asked siwan officials what his country could do for their 
changing oasis help us save our heritage they said 
everybody talked for years about how to save siwa that its 
cultural heritage must be saved but nobody did anything about 
it said heba elkholy fund coordinator at the canadian embassy 
in cairo 
the canadian project aimed to build a traditional siwan house in 
the old way using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young 
women old skills 
now nearing completion the twostory house going up in the 
village garden will become a museum dedicated to siwan culture and 
a reservoir for handicrafts 
six miles away in a poor desert village khadiga ismail sami 
has spent the last year teaching five cheerful girls aged 11 to 
15 to embroider bridal scarves in the siwan way siwan girls who 
marry about age 14 must have an extensive bridal trousseau 
including seven elaborate wedding dresses 
mrs sami is among nine women team leaders each passing along 
her sewing or basketmaking artistry to five girls 
the canadian project has supplied each of mrs samis 
apprentices material for bridal scarves which can take several 
months to complete 
once finished she has the option of keeping them or selling 
them back to the project for 5 egyptian pounds about 2 each 
a bride has to have these scarves for her wedding mrs sami 
said if she has to buy them readymade she will have to pay 75 
pounds 30 for one scarf 
miss elkholy the canadian coordinator said she considers 
both efforts a first step in saving siwas unique traditions 
young girls today prefer watching television to making 
handicrafts she said but once we begin selling the products 
and the women can see the results i believe the traditions wont 
die

the stock markets behavior this year has evoked 
an old wall street maxim when stocks are rising they climb a 
wall of worry 
the idea has a simple basis in logic as long as people with 
money to invest are worried about the business outlook and 
skeptical about market prospects they keep a lot of their buying 
power in reserve 
this money provides the fuel that keeps a rally going as more 
and more investors gradually are converted to the bullish camp 
conversely when fear fades and everyone is content with 
business prospects the market becomes vulnerable to a setback 
because everyone already owns stocks 
the way to invest successfully then is to practice contrary 
opinion buying when things look darkest and selling in the 
bright sunshine 
given this simple premise why isnt everybody who ever invested 
in the stock market now living a life of ease 
well one problem is that acting on a contraryopinion approach 
requires going against the human emotions of greed and fear 
another arises from the frequent difficulty of gauging the 
conventional wisdom that you as a contrarian are supposed to be 
betting against 
such a situation prevails right now on wall street some 
analysts see extreme caution while others claim to detect outright 
complacency 
several times during the postcrash recovery worries have 
switched from recession to boom and its associated inflation 
acceleration and back again says philip roth analyst at 
shearson lehman hutton inc now we seem to have both worries at 
the same time 
in our opinion we dont have to worry about an important peak 
in stocks until concerns about the economy abate 
only then will a drawdown in cash reserves and excessive 
optimism occur undermining the technical strength of the market 
other analysts by contrast contend that the majority of 
investors have been lulled into a dangerous confidence that the 
federal reserve can engineer a soft landing for the economy 
restraining inflation without causing a recession 
investors as is typical late in a trend when enthusiasm 
reigns have assumed that all is for the best a slowdown that 
would never dream of turning into the teensiest bit of a 
recession maintains justin mamis who writes a market commentary 
for cowen amp co in new york 
in fact as is beginning to be said there never has to be a 
recession again except perhaps in the stocks one doesnt own 
its not exactly a wall of worry any more 
people who seek to go against the prevailing sentiment have 
developed scores of statistical yardsticks to try to measure it 
one of these calculated by investors intelligence of new 
rochelle ny uses the percentages of 130 investment advisory 
services it classifies as bullish bearish or on the fence 
early this month the ranks of the bears shrank to 33 percent 
the lowest number since the crash in 1987 investors intelligence 
describes sentiment as neutral for the shortterm 
but that kind of thing doesnt scare an optimist like richard 
evans at dow theory forecasts in hammond ind 
while the markets move to new highs has generated some 
interest the level of skepticism on wall street remains stubbornly 
high he declares 
theres no big trouble ahead he says until there is some 
greater consensus that a bull market is under way

young afrikaners have begun 
questioning their role as apartheids heirs 
in recent months the first antiapartheid newspaper published 
in afrikaans has doubled its circulation to 8000 and provided 
publicity for a new wave of alternative culture 
three antiestablishment afrikaner rock bands have been drawing 
enthusiastic crowds at campuses and theaters during an 
unprecedented nationwide tour 
the movement is small as yet 
most afrikaner children grow up in tightknit conservative 
families and attend rigid state schools where curriculum is 
tailored to fit government ideology young white men must serve two 
years in the military prolonging the period in which they are 
screened from other ways of thinking 
afrikaners have a very authoritarian tradition children are 
meant to be seen and not heard said max du preez editor of the 
7monthold newspaper vrye weekblad free weekly this has 
retarded the growth of young people were all late bloomers 
du preezs newspaper is aimed both at readers who already have 
broken with apartheid and at those who still condone the concept of 
whiteminority rule under the national party government 
we have a converting role a responsibility to stimulate 
afrikaners who are on the verge of breaking away and to provide a 
new home for them du preez 37 said in an interview its 
been a very lonely place to be to be an afrikaner who has broken 
with apartheid 
it doesnt seem lonely at the boisterous concerts of the voelvry 
free bird rock n roll tour which succeeded despite being 
banned from several places one of the touring groups is called die 
swart gevaar the black menace and is a phrase used in 
describing whites fears of a black majority takeover 
dirk uys manager of another group called the gereformeerde 
blues band told one music writer were bringing home a lot of 
those homeless people who have never been able to identify with the 
current state of afrikaans culture 
says the leader of the blues band johannes kerkorrel if you 
can make a language into rock n roll it cant be an oppressive 
language any more 
along with the alternative music movement is an upsurge in 
provocative topical afrikaans drama with new works surfacing 
regularly from universitybased playwrights 
this radical school of dramatists challenges and even 
undermines the principles and mores on which afrikanerdom is 
based said the weekly mail an englishlanguage antiapartheid 
newspaper 
about 60 percent of south africas 5 million whites are 
afrikaners descendants of dutch and other european settlers who 
began arriving here 337 years ago only in 1948 did the afrikaners 
take full control of the government and they proceeded to enact 
the harsh segregation laws of apartheid force millions of blacks 
from their homes and suppress campaigns for black rights 
small numbers of afrikaners have opposed apartheid since the 
1960s and their ranks have grown since the widespread black unrest 
of 198486 but most remain opposed to black majority rule and 
uninterested in learning about other political perspectives 
mike joubert who last year was president of the student council 
at the university of pretoria said most of the 22000 students at 
the afrikaanslanguage school were preoccupied with academics and 
social life and had a very strong antipathy toward any kind of 
political activity 
they were very uninformed said joubert a nephew of foreign 
minister pik botha they accept anything they read or see on 
television 
only a few hundred students were active in either leftwing or 
rightwing political groups said joubert who is now in business 
school many of the others might accept major political reforms but 
would need to be led in that direction he said 
at the university of stellenbosch the most prestigious 
afrikaans university a slightly more liberal mood prevails a ban 
on the voelvry tour provoked emotional protests and there was 
widespread support for a group of 18 students who went to zambia in 
april to participate in forums that included members of the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
the dutch reformed church by far the largest afrikaner 
denomination has suffered fewer defections of young people than 
major protestant churches in the west according to dr pierre 
roussouw a senior church official 
he said more than 90 percent of the youths who are baptized by 
the church complete the process that leads to adult membership 
services at university chapels are packed he said 
there are victims of secularization and were worried about 
that he said but we have much to be thankful for 
one of the factors behind the churchs strength said roussouw 
is christian national education the education system at white 
public schools that promotes afrikaner nationalism 
calvinistoriented bible study and a whiteoriented view of 
history 
the dutch reformed church has repudiated its former endorsement 
of apartheid but roussouw said it would never abandon its support 
of christian national education 
we sometimes underestimate the power of the school system 
said du preez its a very potent force the history courses 
the language bible study praying for the president raising the 
flag 
most afrikaners in their 20s and 30s sense that black majority 
rule is inevitable du preez said but they have deep worries and 
uncertainties about how that change will affect them 
i feel so sad as i look at my people theyre the most unfree 
people in this country he said theyre resented by everybody 
else theyre angry and afraid and confused

at the prestigious corner of friedrichstrasse and 
unter den linden in east berlin stands the sovietblocs only hotel 
to earn western recognition as one of the worlds most luxurious 
but the grand hotels 350 plush rooms and apartments are 
available only to the carriers of convertible currencies such as 
dollars and few east europeans will brave the doormens steely 
stares for a peek at the opulent art nouveau lobby 
like all businesses in east germany the government is the owner 
and as such can smooth more than the sheets for its most valued 
clients 
the hotels shiny black mercedes limousines are virtually waved 
through border controls while other western travelers are forced to 
line up for the lengthy ordeal of passport checks and currency 
declarations 
hotel staff can settle the details with the foreign ministry 
later 
likewise with a mere signature they can they arrange a visa 
extension or western bank transfer tasks that through the normal 
bureaucracy can take hours 
the grand opened in august 1987 and last year earned the 
designation by the new yorkbased leading hotels association as one 
of the 200 best hotels in the world 
its emergence typifies the kind of turnkey business deal east 
germany wants with the west 
while soviet polish and hungarian companies have been pressing 
for western cooperation to develop and share new hardcurrency 
sources like tourist facilities east berlins authorities are 
resistant to sharing control or profit 
we have not been riding this fashionable wave of activity over 
joint ventures said the grands deputy director hartmut kaske 
those countries running hotels and other businesses under joint 
ventures with the west do so out of economic necessity we are not 
that weak 
financing for construction of the hotel was arranged by the 
japanese company kojima which built the grand the east german 
government has paid off the loan and the hotels profits are 
channeled to it as reimbursement 
kaske said in an interview the hotel will have paid for itself 
within 10 years although its occupancy rate of less than 40 
percent is well below that considered a breakeven point for 
western hotels 
the hotel draws mostly businessmen and prominent visitors with 
its rates ranging from the equivalent of 150 a night for the 
smallest single room to 2000 for one of the two penthouse suites 
all 800 employees are east germans who are paid significantly 
less than western workers in similar jobs the national average for 
personal income is about 600 a month and most consumer service 
jobs pay well below the average 
gudrun goslar the hotels public relations director says 
exclusivity is part of the grands attraction for the western 
businessmen who make up about 80 percent of the guest list 
it would be foolish to condemn what is available here just 
because some people cant afford it she remarked during a tour 
of the luxury suites with private saunas and handmade porcelain 
lamps 
east german officials make no apologies over the luxury provided 
for the westerners in contrast with the austere accommodations 
available for east germans 
we built this hotel to be able to offer a good product on the 
international market kaske said we operate on the old 
capitalist principle that when the customer is happy he buys 
more 
he said much of the initiative to build a luxury hotel in east 
berlin came from the foreign trade officials whose western 
counterparts had complained of poor accommodation 
while the grand hotel is uniquely lavish for a communist 
enterprise with a 340label wine list and an indoor orange grove 
for communing with nature guests can still find a few reminders of 
which side of the border they are sleeping on 
dialing direct to western cities is possible but the few 
international telephone lines available are frequently engaged for 
hours 
tuxedoed security men stand guard throughout the seventier 
atrium lobby but a few hardcurrency prostitutes are allowed in to 
the polished bars and dimly lit salons 
accompanying the full breakfast delivered to rooms on white 
linen is an imported exotic flower but a dull morning newspaper 
the communist partys berliner zeitung 
a west german businessman who did not want to be named said he 
stays at the grand hotel several times a year because its the 
closest thing to civilization one can find here 
he added that the hotel was very comfortable but going 
outside is a little like waking up from a good dream

president bush never cared much for the 
100day test even though he took it now hes closing in on 130 
days which may prove a better grading period 
that comes a week from tomorrow the day bush confronts a 
troublesome west german ally at a nato summit in brussels and 
thats only one of the firstsemester exams coming due soon 
among the others 
the cracks in his bipartisan courtship of the democratic 
congress which passed a 455 hourly minimum wage bush promises to 
veto as too high congressional approval came by margins short of 
the twothirds needed to override a veto democrats said bush was 
using the veto threat to try to prove himself tough 
the crisis over panama where military boss manuel antonio 
noriega so far is resisting domestic opposition pressure from the 
organization of american states and us demands that he quit or be 
kicked out after invalidating an election observers said he rigged 
in the first place 
the wrangle over bushs proposals to rescue the tottering 
savings and loan system with a federal subsidy a bill he wanted 
passed on a crisis timetable some democrats have demanded the cost 
be part of the federal budget and therefore the deficit instead 
of being handled separately that also could become a veto issue 
the revival so far lowkey of the irancontra questions bush 
shoved aside during the 1988 campaign some democrats want to 
reopen the congressional investigation of the case to explore 
disclosures the government made at the trial of oliver north 
bushs nomination of a former top aide to be ambassador to south 
korea is being held up by democrats who say they want answers on 
his role in the affair 
passing his own judgment on his first hundred days because 
everybody else was anyhow bush pronounced himself off to a good 
start and theres more to come 
its coming fast 
the president leaves on friday for a weeklong trip to western 
europe with the nato summit meeting the major and most challenging 
event his foreign policy review is done now and there are issues 
that will not wait at the nato summit that will be west germanys 
insistence on prompt negotiations with the soviet union on 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
the bush administration is determined to keep those weapons in 
place which means in germany as a shield against the overwhelming 
soviet advantage in conventional arms and manpower 
thats proving a difficult line to hold with continental allies 
who see a lessening of the soviet threat bushs spokesman marlin 
fitzwater has called the soviet peace initiative a series of 
public relations gambits the president and his men have said 
repeatedly they are not going to yield on the nuclear weapons 
question until the soviet union agrees to major verified cuts in 
its conventional forces 
nevertheless bush has said that western differences can be 
worked out and that he looks for a smooth summit in brussels 
some conservatives read into that a possibility that bush may 
waver for the sake of harmony leadership is not the same as 
consensusbuilding said burton pines senior vice president of 
the heritage foundation a conservative think tank 
pines said that unless bush sticks to his shortrange weapons 
in the nato dispute the germans will figure that they hold the 
cards because they can fracture the harmony and consensus of the 
alliance 
even when they like his policies as in the nato situation 
conservatives tend to worry about bush because they see him as a 
leader sometimes too given to compromise too bent on 
bipartisanship his leadership over 100 days or 130 and probably 
over four or eight years will not satisfy their yearning for the 
certainties of ronald reagans conservatism 
but the more important and general judgment will come on results 
at the 100day checkpoint there werent any there hadnt been 
time so when bush summarized what hed done it was long on 
prospects he told of his proposals and his agreements with 
congress deals that avoided headon fights on such issues as a 
budget resolution and nonmilitary supplies for the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
now the compelling issues are coming up for action and some of 
them will not yield to compromise or fit bipartisanship

with student loan defaults approaching 2 
billion the education department is ready to tighten the screws on 
schools turning out more than their share of delinquent borrowers 
new regulations due by months end target what many consider 
the crux of the problem profitmaking vocational schools that 
survive primarily on student financial aid and have a loan default 
rate three times the 12 percent national average 
these private schools train people in everything from 
cosmetology and truck driving to business and commercial art 
although their students receive only about a quarter of all 
federally guaranteed loans such schools account for 40 percent of 
all defaulted loan dollars 
the regulations from education secretary lauro cavazos will 
prescribe a series of increasingly tough actions against schools 
depending on their default rates with those above 35 or 40 percent 
in line for the most stringent treatment 
former education secretary william bennett favored a 
harshersounding plan to start automatic proceedings to limit 
suspend or terminate participation by schools with default rates 
above 20 percent some 2354 institutions more than half of them 
profitmaking vocational schools fall into that category 
education department officials citing administrative problems 
with the bennett plan say the graduated cavazos approach is 
actually stronger medicine 
i can assure you that more of the shoddy schools with default 
problems will feel more pain sooner under what lauro cavazos is 
doing than they would have under the bennett proposal said 
deputy undersecretary charles kolb 
stories of exploitation and abuse by unscrupulous trade school 
operators have been rampant for years with students routinely 
depicted as victims of shady recruiting techniques and shoddy 
education 
witnesses at congressional and other legislative hearings have 
described students incapable of doing the coursework whether from 
low iqs illiteracy or having virtually no knowledge of english 
those that can learn sometimes receive little training in the 
skills they signed up to study 
students often drop out of a program with nothing to show for 
their efforts except a debt of 2500 or more even graduates can 
find they lack the skills they need to compete in the job market 
proprietary school associations protest that their members are 
being unjustly tainted by a few bad apples at the same time 
however they are moving to tighten accreditation procedures 
upgrade admissions standards and promote loan default management 
plans 
department officials contend that high default rates are a sign 
of bad school management career school executives counter that 
such rates reflect instead the poor urban academically risky 
students served by many of their institutions as well as a lack of 
diligence on the part of outside loan collectors 
you can have a high default rate and a superb school said 
stephen blair president of the national association of trade and 
technical schools and a former loan program official at the 
education department 
another proprietary group the association of independent 
colleges and schools argues that if just one atrisk student 
succeeds because of a guaranteed student loan the longterm saving 
to society covers the cost of 65 defaults 
some 44 million students borrowed nearly 12 billion in 
guaranteed loans last year to pursue postsecondary education at 
colleges universities and private career schools defaults last 
year totaled 16 billion nearly half the annual federal cost of 
the program the default figure is expected to reach 18 billion 
this year and rise even higher after that 
taxpayers are not the only ones shelling out to cover defaults 
lenders are becoming vulnerable as well 
the most expensive foulup ever occurred earlier this year in 
california when federal guarantees on loans worth 14 billion were 
voided by a loan servicing companys failure to follow proper 
collection procedures nine major us and foreign banks sued last 
month in an attempt to make the loan trustee the bank of america 
take responsibility for their losses which could reach 650 
million 
in addition to requiring certain steps of schools with soaring 
default rates officials said the departments combination of new 
rules administrative actions and legislative proposals may include 
prorata refunds to victimized students 
disclosure of the track records of vocational schools 
including completion and job placement rates to inform prospective 
students promote competition and alert the department to problem 
schools 
mandatory loan counseling for all firsttime student borrowers 
more stringent requirements to determine if students without 
high school diplomas or their equivalent who are permitted to 
borrow money for some programs can truly benefit from the 
coursework 
some way to curb unethical recruitment practices including 
pieinthesky pitches made outside prisoner rehabilitation 
programs welfare offices and drug treatment centers 
incentives for states to institute systems to garnish wages 
thereby avoiding costly litigation against defaulters who have jobs 
tighter monitoring of schools and guarantors by the department 
which is currently investigating and prosecuting a wide range of 
abuses 
the departments inspector general james b thomas jr 
recently told congress that one company continental training 
services inc with headquarters in indianapolis enrolled students 
who were not proficient in english 
in addition thomas said individuals who had physical 
disabilities which would prevent them from driving a truck or from 
obtaining a license to do so were enrolled individuals were 
enrolled who could not get licenses because of prior driving or 
criminal records 
thomas said employees at hausman computer associates of new york 
city created high school diplomas for students who were not high 
school graduates to make them appear to be eligible for federal 
student aid 
at la tees beauty school in chicago he said time cards 
state inspection records and signin sheets are examples of records 
falsified to reflect attendance when the student was actually 
incarcerated was on a leave of absence or had dropped out of 
class 
angelo aponte new york citys commissioner of consumer affairs 
told a state legislative committee in march about an auto mechanic 
training course that had no cars and little equipment students 
only got a chance to work on cars if a students car needed 
repairs he said 
aponte said the education director of the fortune society which 
helps exprison inmates told him she met daily with exoffenders 
about to enroll in courses they could not possibly complete 
why would one admit a thirdgrade reader into a computer 
programming course aponte quoted her as asking or tell a man 
with a fourthgrade math level that in six months hell be applying 
for a job as an accountant why would anyone give potential 
students the answers to admissions tests or tell them they will be 
admitted anyway even if they fail the test and why would anyone 
operate a computer programming course without a computer on the 
premises

amway corp may have gotten cold feet about 
pursuing a takeover of avon products inc because it decided the 
two directsales companies wouldnt be a good match suggests 
avons chairman james e preston 
preston also says he is convinced avon shareholders and sales 
representatives will be better off if avon remains independent 
permitting management to carry out current plans 
however avons stock plunged 712 a share to 33 in heavy new 
york stock exchange trading thursday a day after amway withdrew 
its 21 billion bid 
during an interview thursday preston said amways decision to 
withdraw the 39ashare takeover proposal hours after avons board 
unanimously rejected the offer may have been prompted by second 
thoughts about the feasibility of joining the two companies 
preston supplied copies of letters sent to him by sales reps 
disturbed by the prospect of having amway as a corporate parent 
several of the letters were addressed to amways cofounders 
richard devos and jay van andel and denounced the way amway 
distributors do business van andel is chairman of the privately 
held company and devos is president 
one of the correspondents avon representative constance m 
wendt of jacksonville fla told the amway executives our 
prayers are for a continued strong united family the avon family 
and avon traditions known to our loyal consumers for the past 104 
years of service 
the letters were described by preston as just a sample of the 
huge amount of correspondence avon received since amway an ada 
michbased directselling concern started making takeover 
advances 
amways statement that it would operate its own distributor 
network separately from avons directsales business if it 
prevailed in its takeover attempt apparently did not alleviate the 
concerns preston said 
in a survey avon conducted nearly half of avons sales reps 
which operate independently and arent avon employees said they 
would cease selling for avon if amway acquired control of the 
company 
preston said avons worldwide image as a beauty products company 
would be impaired by a linkage with amway 
meanwhile preston said avon will step up efforts to improve its 
balance sheet the emphasis will be placed on reducing costs which 
have been averaging 53 percent of sales the goal is to shave the 
percentage to 47 percent by 1990 
as an example of where costs would be trimmed he said the use 
of premiums to attract customers would be scaled back or 
discontinued in avons directselling operation these premiums are 
items that companies give away to customers when they make a 
purchase such as a free tote bag for buying a certain amount of 
makeup 
he said any possible expansion of avons lines will be aimed at 
complimenting the companys primary focus on beauty products 
people dont want to buy their fragrance from a company that 
sells dog food or toilet brushes he said 
in a letter to shareholders thursday avon forecasted sales from 
direct selling will grow by 7 percent to 8 percent this year 
sales in its retail operation which consists of some of the 
countrys topselling fragrances such as giogio and red will grow 
faster these avon scents are sold at department stores and other 
retail outlets not by avons independent sales force 
preston said in the interview that numerous parties which he 
did not name have expressed interest in acquiring avons retail 
fragrance business amway said it would have sold it off if it took 
over avon 
preston who also is avons chief executive officer said he is 
thrilled by the strong performance of the prestige fragrance 
business and has no intention of selling it 
avon has been restructuring and the process is to be completed 
this year with the divestiture of its remaining businesses in the 
health care services field the company lost 4045 million in 1988 
due to losses on discontinued operations sales totaled 306 
billion last year

reversing their earlier position pilots union 
leaders at striketorn eastern airlines said 170 eastern pilots can 
go to work for the companys northeast shuttle if it is sold to 
developer donald trump 
the pilots who already have been hired for the planned trump 
shuttle had said they planned to defy union leaderships earlier 
position directing them not to work for trump until the eastern 
strike was over 
trumps agreement to buy the business for 365 million from 
eastern parent texas air corp still must be approved by the 
federal bankruptcy court 
the master executive council of the air line pilots association 
at eastern had asked its pilots not to work for trump or receive 
further training for the trump shuttle as long as the strike 
against eastern continued 
after a meeting thursday with trump shuttle officials the 
pilots leadership decided prospective trump pilots would be 
approved to start training said dan ashby a spokesman for alpa in 
new york 
in an earlier message to pilots jack bavis the head of the 
eastern pilots union had directed that no pilot including those 
who have accepted employment with the trump shuttle will engage in 
any training of any kind until the strike is over or until the 
master executive council endorses another course of action 
easterns unions have opposed a sale of the profitable new 
yorkwashingtonboston shuttle and other eastern assets 
the company has been in bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists 
union strike that was joined by easterns pilots and flight 
attendants unions and virtually grounded the airline 
in a letter dated may 2 to henry duffy national president of 
alpa pilot bill sanford said the trump pilots have to question 
whether the association is working toward our best interest at 
trump if the master executive council continues to interfere in 
our business and alpa continues to ignore us then a reassessment 
and further examination of our alternatives will obviously have to 
be explored 
in recent weeks other prospective trump pilots have sent a 
flurry of similar letters to trump duffy and us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland who is overseeing easterns chapter 11 
proceeding copies of some of the letters were obtained by the 
associated press 
trump shuttle management already has signed labor agreements 
with pilots and flight attendants 
america west airlines which has made a competing higher offer 
for the shuttle has said it mainly would use its own employees to 
operate the service although eastern workers would be eligible to 
apply for jobs america west a regional carrier based in phoenix 
ariz is nonunion 
the company has offered to pay 415 million for the eastern 
shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s 
in addition to the 170 eastern pilots already hired another 40 
or so pilots have been hired for the trump shuttle from other 
carriers and elsewhere before the strike easterns shuttle was 
its only profitable operation since then it has been running 
nearly at full schedule but with skimpy passenger loads as many 
passengers have defected to pan am corps rival service 
eastern said earlier this week that its share of the shuttle 
market split with pan am has dropped to around 23 percent from 53 
percent in december of last year

cable tv programmers are promising viewers yocks 
around the clock with a pair of new allcomedy networks 
mtv networks the viacom inc subsidiary that pioneered 
allmusic programming on cable television in the early 1980s said 
thursday it plans to launch a cable channel devoted to comedy 
programming early next year 
that service would compete with one from home box office unit of 
time inc which disclosed earlier this week it expects to start 
the first allcomedy cable network this fall 
and there may be others columbia pictures entertainment inc 
the movie and television programmer reportedly is considering 
starting a comedy channel with cox cable communications a cable 
system operator based in atlanta 
david andersen spokesman for cox cable said while cox has 
discussed the possibility of teaming up with columbia pictures on a 
comedy channel those discussions are very preliminary 
columbia pictures had no comment on the matter a spokesman said 
nobody has a corner on the concept said larry gerbrandt an 
analyst for paul kagan associates a media research firm based in 
carmel calif 
but he said cable operators may find the concept appealing 
because they need new programming services in their efforts to sign 
up more subscribers 
rob stengel senior vice president for programming at 
continental cablevision inc in boston said he hasnt seen 
specifics on either proposed comedy channel but said the concept 
makes a lot of sense 
there is highintensity consumer interest in comedy he said 
continental cablevision is the thirdlargest cable system 
operator in the nation with about 25 million subscribers 
stengel said he is not certain many cable operators or 
subscribers would be interested in a channel that is just a 
dumping ground for a lot of old sitcoms or things that have been on 
network tv 
but he said a service that offers new material new concepts 
and new forms of comedy could be a valuable addition to a 
systems basic service 
both mtv networks and home box office plan to offer their comedy 
channels as parts of the basic cable service rather than as a pay 
service that customers would have to pay an extra fee to get both 
channels will carry advertising 
mtv networks plans to call its comedy channel the ha tv comedy 
network and said it has been developing it for 18 months 
tom freston chairman and chief executive of mtv networks said 
he planned to offer cable operators and programmers a chance to buy 
a stake in the service a feature that he called a unique slant 
barry kluger a spokesman for mtv networks said another 
difference would be that ha tv comedy would specialize in offering 
longer programs such as original situation comedies and movies 
home box offices plans call for comedy hosts to make liberal 
use of short clips from comedy shows movies and performances in 
their shows 
freston noted that mtv has gained a lot of experience over the 
years with three basic cable services nickelodeon launched in 
1979 mtv music television in 1981 and vh1 video hits one in 
1985 
home box office is the leading pay tv programer with its hbo and 
cinemax services

burger king corp in an attempt to boost sluggish 
sales and improve the focus of its advertising has awarded most of 
its 215 million account to two new york agencies 
the concept of a dualagency partnership allows for 
synergizing some of the best minds in the advertising business 
said gary langstaff burger kings executive vice president of 
marketing 
the fastfood giants new management thursday hailed the 
unorthodox strategy although some analysts speculated the two 
agencies darcy masius benton amp bowles and saatchi amp saatchi 
could end up grappling for control of the account 
im skeptical as to whether two agencies can put burger kings 
interest first over their own individual interests said john 
mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache securities in new york 
darcy will focus on burger kings image and saatchi amp saatchi 
will concentrate on promotions and products according to 
restaurant executives 
the agencies are expected to devise a marketing plan by jan 1 
langstaff said he said he wont know how the account will be 
divided until they submit their plans 
theres a lot to be done theres been a lot of negative stuff 
written said edward j wax chief executive officer of saatchi amp 
saatchi who called the twoagency approach fascinating its a 
big challenge but were excited 
his agency in the past has handled wendys and arbys wax said 
and experienced executives from those accounts will work on burger 
king 
miamibased burger king taken over as part of britainbased 
conglomerate grand metropolitans january acquisition of pillsbury 
co will continue working with several other advertising and 
promotional agencies on special projects 
the pillsbury subsidiary had sales of 54 billion from 5800 
restaurants during fiscal 1988 
burger king fired nw ayer inc which came up with the we do 
it like youd do it theme as its national ad agency last month 
after the campaign was criticized as ineffective ayer will stay on 
through midaugust 
ayer was hired in september 1987 as burger king ended an 11year 
association with j walter thompson of new york thompson created 
the highly criticized campaign featuring a search for herb a nerd 
who had never been to a burger king 
subsequent campaigns from thompson that used the themes this 
is a burger king town and the best food for fast times failed 
to make a significant impression with fastfood customers 
langstaff hired in april after three years with hardees said 
burger king must carve out its own niche and develop its own image 
to differentiate itself from the big boys meaning mcdonalds

if sen patrick j leahy dvt has his way 
the agriculture department will either send its proposal to 
streamline meat inspection back to the drawing board or see 
congress do it through legislation 
if producers of food have learned anything from the alar and 
other scares the last two months it is that this is not the time 
to do anything to give the suggestion of less safety in food 
leahy said thursday 
putting off final decisions on the plans is not enough he said 
the department should just withdraw them and start over 
leahy commented a day after consumer and labor organizations 
charged that a streamlined inspection system proposed by the 
department for cattle carcasses at packing houses could result in 
more contamination of the beef supply 
under the proposal federal inspectors at 40 to 50 of the 
largest slaughter plants accounting for about 80 percent of the 
nations beef would rely more on company workers to keep hair 
mud excreta and other contaminants from the beef supply 
one result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving 
along the inspection route leaving inspectors less time to check 
for abcesses tumors and other abnormalities 
leahy said the nations food supply is now safe but that if the 
usda takes this step im not sure we can guarantee it 
the chairman said in a telephone interview that in his 15 years 
in the senate he had never seen a time when people are more 
concerned about food safety than they are now for decent 
inspection of all types people are willing to pay the tiny amount 
extra that it costs 
leahy said he has been pressing the usda for more than two years 
to make changes in its meat and poultry inspection system and to 
modify some of the proposals it has under consideration 
if changes arent made by the department he said congress is 
going to do it legislatively when it writes the 1990 farm bill 
department officials say they wont decide whether to proceed 
with the proposed inspection revisions until they review public 
comments submitted after the proposal was made dec 1 
the meatpacking industry led by the american meat institute 
wants the plan reviewed by a scientific panel before it is finally 
approved to ensure that meat safety would not be diminished 
a separate but equally controversial department proposal 
announced last november would reduce the number of federal 
inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup hot dogs and other 
processed meat and poultry items 
one goal of this riskbased system would be to use computers 
and other technology to replace some of the daybyday surveillance 
by federal inspectors in processing plants with good records 
the proposed program would ease up on good plants and allow 
a certain degree of selfpolicing but those with poor inspection 
records would be subject to closer supervision 
leahy said both proposals ought to be withdrawn and sent back 
totally to the drawing boards although he added that some 
aspects of each may make a lot of sense and perhaps should be 
reconsidered 
have the agriculture department and secretary clayton yeutter 
gotten leahys message 
i hope they have he said because administratively the 
department could take all the steps necessary to assure safety and 
quality if they are unwilling to do it administratively then i 
can guarantee the congress is going to do it legislatively

a report by the agriculture department says 
the value of us agricultural exports to the soviet union may 
climb to a record level this calendar year 
substantially larger corn sales and much higher wheat prices are 
expected to push the us farm export value to the soviet union 
well above last years 225 billion the departments economic 
research service said thursday in its preliminary report 
exports in 1988 were nearly 2 times the value of shipments in 
1987 and were exceeded only in 1979 and 1984 the report said 
furthermore the united states this year may expand its share of 
soviet grain imports from about 30 percent in 1987 and 45 percent 
in 1988 
last year the ussr took 12 percent of the value of all us 
grain and feed exports and the us share of all soviet 
agricultural imports was an estimated 14 percent the report said 
analysts said soviet agricultural imports from all foreign 
sources in 1989 may climb 10 percent above last years level 
estimated at 165 billion 
grain probably will replace sugar as the leading soviet 
agricultural import in 1989 the report said 
soviet planners remain committed to a high degree of 
selfsufficiency in food and their policies primarily emphasize 
increasing supplies rather than controlling demand it said

idaho has effectively banned the use of alar 
on apples becoming the first state to restrict the use of the 
suspected cancercausing chemical 
even though there is no conclusive evidence of the health risk 
associated with alar the continuing controversy is threatening our 
worldclass product gov cecil andrus said thursday that is 
simply unacceptable 
spokesmen for idahos 26 million apple industry estimated 
growers have lost more than 1 million this season because 
consumers are concerned about the health risks of alar idaho 
produces about 3 million bushels of apples per year 
andrus said the idaho apple commission asked him to restrict the 
use of alar by signing an emergency order requiring anyone who has 
alar to report to the department of agriculture the amount on hand 
a permit must be obtained before it can be used and growers 
marketing any apples treated with alar must notify the state 
state agriculture director richard rush said it amounted to a 
ban on alar for food production 
larry link executive director of the apple commission said 
most idaho growers have stopped using the chemical anyway it 
normally is applied to apples through the end of june to produce 
uniform ripening 
four us senators said they would ask congress to ban the use 
of alar on apples 
derl i derr president of the international apple institute 
has said growers are already planning to eliminate the chemical 
which is produced by uniroyal inc

productivity over the years 
nine years ago in a visit to kansas city petersen who was then

the oil companies and the governments who are 
supposed to clean up after spills did a wholly insufficient job 
of responding to the alaska oil spill says a report sent to 
president bush 
it was the strongest criticism yet leveled in the wake of the 
disaster that spilled 11 million gallons of oil into alaskas 
pristine prince william sound after the tanker exxon valdez hit a 
clearly marked reef 
the 37page report sent to bush on thursday was critical of 
everybody said a department of transportation official 
critical of the state of alyeska pipeline company exxon the 
federal government 
in view of the fact that everything had been going so well for 
so many years i think everybody got a little complacent said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the report was prepared by transportation secretary samuel 
skinner and william k reilly administrator of the environmental 
protection agency they visited alaska five days after the march 24 
accident 
while the report criticized all agencies and companies it also 
noted that even if had better safeguards had been in place the 
largest oil spill in us history was too enormous to contain the 
source said 
skinner has indicated that there is no technology available 
today that could really have coped with that amount of oil in that 
period of time in that particular climactic condition the source 
said 
it escaped in such an incredible hurry so fast that even if 
the equipment had been in place it wouldnt have been enough he 
said 
during their trip to alaska skinner and reilly directed efforts 
by the national response team a group of 14 agencies that 
participated in the cleanup to prepare a report assessing damage 
and cleanup efforts results of the report were reported in todays 
editions of the washington post 
the review noted that although six contingency plans were 
available to cope with accidents their implementation was not 
coordinated or organized 
exxons shipping subsidiary which owns the exxon valdez had a 
voluntary plan but no specific details the report said 
cleanup technologies were primitive and more research should 
done in that area the report said 
alyeska pipeline service co which operates the transalaska 
pipeline and the shipping terminal in valdez had a plan in place 
to break up crude oil with chemical dispersants but it failed to 
take into account that the dispersants were stored in arizona and 
would take several hours to reach alaska the report said 
alyeska was not prepared to respond to this spill it said 
according to the source 
the report recommended that congress pass laws ensuring that 
operators of oil tankers create a fund large enough to pay for 
cleanups it noted that existing oil spill funds would have been 
rapidly depleted if exxon had not voluntarily assumed financial 
and cleanup responsibility for the spill 
earlier this week skinner proposed legislation to increase oil 
spill liability and compensation the bill would require a fund of 
at least 500 million financed by a 13centperbarrel oil 
industry surcharge 
white house officials could provide no details about the report 
i know nothing about a report a spokesman said 
also thursday sen alfonse damato rny accused the 
nations oil companies of taking advantage of the spill to raise 
gasoline prices 
i suspect foul play i say that candidly damato said at a 
news conference in his capitol hill office i suspect an 
opportunity psychologically that the oil companies felt that they 
could increase their prices 
the senator released copies of a letter he sent to energy 
secretary james watkins asking for an expeditious and thorough 
investigation and evaluation of the nationwide gasoline price 
increases since the spill 
gasoline prices climbed an average of 112 percent in april the 
fastest rate on record from 974 cents to 1098 per gallon

congress is finished with the 117 trillion 
federal budget for 1990 in uncommonly early fashion but a 
housesenate spat is delaying money needed this year for veterans 
until at least next week 
the senate gave final approval to next years spending plan 
thursday on a 6337 vote a majority of democrats and republicans 
voted for the plan and it was the earliest lawmakers have disposed 
of their guide for subsequent spending and taxing bills since 1978 
but things did not go quite as smoothly with the veterans 
money which lawmakers have been hoping to provide before they go 
home for the upcoming memorial day recess 
on a voice vote the house provided 12 billion for the 
department of veterans affairs to help see the agency through the 
sept 30 end of the 1989 fiscal year the money would be for 
compensation payments health care and other programs 
the senate on its own voice vote only provided the agency with 
enough money to see it through june 15 estimated to be about 75 
million 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the senate action 
assures americas veterans that weve acted responsibly to 
provide some funds while the differences with the house are ironed 
out 
because congress cannot send bills to the president for his 
signature unless both chambers approve identical measures the 
discrepancy meant final action is not possible until the house 
returns to the capital next week 
the senate left town thursday evening until may 31 meaning that 
if the house refuses to adopt the senates bill the veterans 
money will be unavailable at least until then 
the department and gop lawmakers have said delays in providing 
the money will mean diminished care for veterans at hospitals and 
clinics democrats have said that without the money service 
cutbacks would not occur for several weeks 
by providing only a piece of the veterans money the senate 
left the potential for a mustpass bill future legislation 
containing the rest of the veterans funds to which other 
programs favored by senators can eventually be attached 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
said there are many many programs that need extra money this 
year he cited 66 million he would like for a program that gives 
subsidies to air carriers that serve remote communities 
the veterans money had been held up in the house for several 
weeks because it was part of a multibilliondollar package 
providing money for many programs this year hours of bargaining 
among party leaders resulted in the veterans funds being split off 
and considered separately 
an 822 million chunk of the original measure was for antidrug 
programs which democrats said was needed immediately and 
republicans said could wait until next year lawmakers plan to 
resume their dueling on that issue next week 
congress work on the 1990 budget proved predictably 
uncontentious because the plan merely ratified a deficitreduction 
deal shaped last month between president bush and congressional 
leaders 
that pact achieved a claimed 28 billion in savings cutting the 
projected deficit to 997 billion just within the grammrudman 
balancedbudget laws 1990 target of 100 billion 
that agreement allowed bush to honor his campaign pledge of no 
new taxes and democrats to shield domestic programs from 
spending slashes this preserved political priorities but even 
supporters admitted it limited their ability to shrink the deficit 
for fiscal year 1990 there simply is no broad consensus in 
this body in favor of higher taxes or deeper spending cuts said 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
the budget would pour additional money next year into domestic 
efforts for space health education and lowincome assistance it 
restrains the growth of defense spending to below the inflation 
rate limiting it to 2992 billion 
additional tax receipts of 58 billion would have to be 
collected other savings would come from paring the growth of 
medicare by 23 billion selling 57 billion worth of federal 
assets and raising government fees by 27 billion 
about 15 percent of federal spending next year 181 billion 
would go to pay interest on the national debt which is projected 
to grow to 28 trillion this summer 
the budget does not require the presidents signature

usair is defending plans to purchase eight 
eastern airlines gates at philadelphia international airport 
against charges by the state attorney general that the deal would 
create a near monopoly in pennsylvania 
the objections raised by the pennsylvania attorney general are 
based on an erroneous and simplistic assessment of competition in 
the passenger air transportation markets served from 
philadelphia usair said in comments filed thursday with the 
federal bankruptcy court in new york overseeing easterns financial 
troubles 
attorney general ernie preate moved to block the deal earlier 
this month after usair said it would spend 70 million to buy the 
gates from eastern which filed for bankruptcy protection in march 
after being grounded by a labor strike 
in a petition filed with the court preate said usair may be 
trying to dominate air service in pennsylvania by purchasing the 
gates by dominating the market usair could raise fares he said 
the purchase would give usair the majority of gates at the 
states two largest airports philadelphia and greater pittsburgh 
international 
pennsylvania consumers already enjoy unrestricted air fares 
that are lower than fares offered by other major airlines in 
markets of comparable distance said randall malin usairs 
executive vice president for marketing 
the attorney general also ignored the fact that a recent us 
department of transportation study concluded that usairs average 
fares at pittsburgh actually decreased by 6 percent between the 
first half of 1985 and the first half of 1988 he said 
usair cited its unrestricted fare of 108 one way for the 
185mile flight from pittsburgh to harrisburg fares charged by 
other airlines on trips of similar distance range from 168 to 194 
usair also said its 126 oneway unrestricted fare from 
pittsburgh to philadelphia is more than 40 percent cheaper than 
fares charged by other airlines on similar trips 
the purchase of eight eastern gates at philadelphia would 
increase usairs total at the airport by only four to 19 because 
usair plans to dispose of four piedmont gates the piedmont gates 
are on a concourse separate from the one used by usair 
piedmont and usair plan to merge aug 5 
the eastern gates on an adjacent concourse would be more 
convenient to passengers usair said the additional gates also 
would allow for new service for philadelphia passengers the 
company said 
usair also said there is ample space for other airlines to 
expand their service at philadelphia eleven gates will be 
available when a new terminal is completed in 1991 
usair operates nine daily departures from each of its 
philadelphia gates while seven other major airlines average only 
four departures from their gates 
the attorney generals office will respond at a bankruptcy court 
hearing expected to occur no earlier than june 7 said jack lewis 
a preate spokesman

grain and soybean prices opened lower this 
morning on the chicago board of trade 
soybean prices were down on disappointing export sales figures 
prices also were pressured by overnight rain and forecasts of more 
precipitation over the weekend 
analysts also blamed the drop in corn prices on the rain they 
also attributed the loss to the quiet export market 
the weather also forced down wheat prices however there is 
concern the heavy rains reported in parts of the central plains 
will cause the loss of crops 
prices may be helped by the purchase yesterday of 200thousand 
metric tons of wheat by bangladesh and news of an offer by egypt 
for 300thousand tons 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 405 a bushel corn was 1 cents

two major accounting firms arthur young amp co 
and ernst amp whinney have agreed in principle to a merger that they 
say would form the worlds largest accounting agency the companies 
announced today 
in statements issued in london and new york the companies 
confirmed they have reached an agreement to join their worldwide 
practices into a new firm called ernst amp young 
the partnerships of both organizations will begin voting on the 
proposed merger in june the companies said the announcement said 
it was expected that the firms will begin joint opertation as soon 
as practical after the vote 
in a joint statement the firms said their respective chairmen 
william l gladstone of arthur young and ray j groves of ernst amp 
whinney would become cochief executives of the combined firm 
which will be based in new york young is now based in new york and 
ernst amp whinney is in cleveland 
the combining of our two organizations will give us unrivaled 
professional service capabilities to meet and anticipate needs of 
clients of all sizes at the local level and in the global economy 
into the final decade of the century and beyond the london 
statement said 
we are a good match of skills specialities and cultures which 
we are confident will be integrated effectively it said 
at a news conference in new york gladstone and groves said they 
did not expect to lay off employees or to lose clients due to 
conflicts as a result of the merger 
gladstone said he expects the combined firm will have more 
employees a year from now than the firms have separately today 
most of what we do is serve clients groves said that 
doesnt change when you put two firms together 
a merger would unite the worlds fourth and fifthlargest 
accounting firms creating the no 1 firm with a combined 43 
billion in revenue the firms stated that would surpass world 
accounting leader kmpgpeat marwick which had 39 billion in 
revenue last year 
ernst amp whinney had 22 billion in revenue last year while 
arthur young had 21 billion domestically the joined firms would 
have 202 billion in revenue just ahead of chicagobased arthur 
andersen amp cos 171 billion 
the combined firms also would have 6100 partners and about 
70000 employees working in 100 countries the statement said in 
the united states the combined operation would have 2105 partners 
and 25391 total employees 
a report in bowmans accounting report an atlanta newsletter 
said international partners met last week and details were hammered 
out monday at a secret meeting at arthur young headquarters in new 
york as security guards stood outside 
the newsletter said rumors of the merger had circulated for 
months it said the greatest threat to the combination would be 
competition among partners in canada and england where both firms 
have strong practices 
arthur bowman editor of bowmans accounting report said the 
merger was being taken because of the firms relative positions in 
the middle of the pack of big eight accounting firms he also 
predicted mergers by smaller accounting firms that need to stay 
competitive 
the major emphasis here is both firms are slow growers 
relative to the other big eight bowman said in a telephone 
interview it also creates a lot of pressure on the firms at the 
bottom of the big eight to do something

the harsh montana winter may have dealt a 
permanent blow to the states western cherry industry growers say 
its very grim said polson grower corky morehead head of 
treasure state cherries its a loss of 5 million or 6 
million to the local economy 
there are virtually no cherry blossoms on the trees and while 
some trees are beginning to leaf the leaves are few and scattered 
raising fears of permanent damage 
my concern is for the health of the trees said robert 
mcclain of yellow bay president of the flathead lake cherry 
growers association 
morehead said that if tree losses are heavy i dont think 
well ever see the cherry industry the way it has been 
growers have been saying for weeks that the crop had been badly 
damaged but until now they had hoped that trees in protected 
locations might still blossom and yield partial crops 
but howard thomas a finley point grower said that while hes 
seeing a few blossoms it amounts to two or three blossoms where 
we should see two or three thousand 
the damage occurred jan 31 and in subsequent days when an 
arctic front followed a january thaw temperatures plummeted 50 
degrees in a few hours freezing and splitting trees that had begun 
to lose winter dormancy 
in addition to the damage to sweet cherries most apricots were 
killed along with peaches and nectarines recent mild winters had 
encouraged growers to cultivate those crops

plans for a south american pavilion at walt 
disney worlds epcot center were derailed by prospective partners 
from paraguay according to a damage suit filed in orlando by an 
argentinian company 
the circuit court lawsuit seeking 35 million in damages from 
five paraguayans said the failure of the investors to put up 2 
million for shares in the venture caused the company to forfeit its 
license to operate the pavilion at disney 
the suit was filed by the florida subsidiary of eskantorp sa 
a development company based in buenos aires which said it entered 
into preliminary agreement with disney in 1985 as a developer and 
sponsor of the tourist site 
walt disney world officials would not comment on the suit 
friday saying they had not seen it 
epcots world showcase section includes 11 foreignthemed 
pavilions usually subsidized by the countries involved and 
investors from those nations 
eskantorp said company officials met many times with senior 
officials of the paraguayan government and gen guillermo clebsch 
chief of military forces at that time had agreed that the 
government would be an investor in the pavilion 
clebsch and four paraguayan investors agreed to acquire 10 
percent of the oustanding shares of eskantorp for 2 million to pay 
for the initial planning of the pavilion escantorp said in court 
documents escantorp then entered into an agreement with the 
orlandoarea tourist resort 
however the paraguayans then backed out causing eskantorp to 
forfeit its right to go through with the venture the suit said 
john boudet a lawyer in orlando for eskantorp said the buenos 
aires developer has made an effort to bring in some new 
investors that would allow it to go ahead with the development 
but efforts have not been successful 
the 35 million sought in damages represents the value of the 
license over 25 years boudet said 
another way of looking at it is that its 25 years worth of 
lost profits to eskantorp the lawyer said

a barge normally equipped with cleanup 
gear was unloaded for repairs at the time the exxon valdez ran 
aground and it took workers 10 hours to reload it oil industry 
officials testified today 
after workers loaded the barge with 25 tons of equipment 
including booms a skimmer and other cleanup gear it took 3 hours 
to get it to the stricken tanker said lawrence schier alyeska 
pipeline service cos marine manager 
an investigator asked schier how much oil would had been removed 
from prince william sound if the loaded barge had been docked at 
bligh reef when the ship ran aground march 24 spilling 109 
million gallons of crude oil 
i cant respond to that he said 
on thursday alaskas environmental commissioner said the exxon 
valdez disaster proved the oil industry couldnt fulfill its 
promise to contain and remove a massive oil spill quickly in prince 
william sound 
but an exxon corp executive told federal investigators that it 
was impossible to stop the spread of the crude that gushed out of 
the tanker 
i dont think there was a power on earth that could have 
removed it from the water exxon shipping co president frank 
iarossi said 
iarossi and commissioner dennis kelso testified in the third day 
of hearings before a national transportation safety board panel 
the hearings into the spills cause continue today and are 
scheduled to conclude saturday 
at exxons annual shareholders meeting in parsippany nj on 
thursday environmentalists lashed out at exxon corp by calling 
for the oil companys chairman to resign and for senior executives 
to forgo bonuses to help pay for the nations worst oil spill 
chairman lawrence g rawl tried for hours to deflect criticism 
repeating earlier public apologies and pledging to clean hundreds 
of miles of waters and oilsoaked beaches he also showed a short 
film on the cleanup effort to allay concerns the company is failing 
to do enough 
state and industry officials at the hearings in alaska took 
turns thursday blaming each other for making matters worse in their 
response to the disaster 
kelso said exxon and alyeska pipeline service co failed to meet 
deadlines to get equipment to the spill site as required in their 
contingency plan 
alyeska a consortium of oil companies that owns and operates 
the transalaska oil pipeline and the valdez terminal is 
responsible for initially responding with booms and cleanup gear to 
spills within the sound 
if the powers that were present alyeska and exxon did what 
they had committed to do in the plan it would be a very different 
situation today kelso testified 
iarossi defended exxons response noting his company mobilized 
equipment from around the world and got it to the scene quickly 
despite logistical problems 
even if the required equipment had been right around the 
corner the spills vastness made mechanical removal of the oil 
impractical iarossi said 
the panel also heard more testimony on alcohol abuse a central 
issue in the disaster joseph hazelwood the tankers captain who 
had a history of alcohol problems was fired after he was charged 
with operating the exxon valdez while drunk he has pleaded 
innocent 
iarossi said exxon ships go through rigorous alcohol and drug 
searches involving dogs trained searchers and occasionally us 
customs service agents 
the companys alcohol and drug policy resulted in 55 
disciplinary cases among its ship crews over five years including 
34 firings he said five of those cases were appealed by unions 
and all five were overturned by arbitrators who found the policy 
too severe 
iarossi said it was just by chance that he heard of 
hazelwoods alcohol problem in may 1985 after the captain completed 
a hospital treatment program iarossi noted that such employee 
information usually is kept confidential 
after hazelwood returned to work he was monitored by two 
supervisors who visited him in port twice a month and discussed his 
behavior with the crew it was all iced tea and perrier 
iarossi said

japanese trade officials warned that targeting 
japan for sanctions by naming it an unfair trader in semiconductors 
would be counterproductive american officials said friday 
in regular consultative meetings thursday and friday japanese 
officials explained plans for expanded purchases of foreign 
semiconductors by japanese companies including electronics firms 
and automobile manufacturers 
but the us government remains highly dissatisfied with the 
us share of the japanese semiconductor market an american trade 
official said 
our dissatisfaction is with the fact that the foreign share 
of the japanese market remains at about 10 percent while the 
competitiveness of us firms would indicate a much higher share 
said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
although continuing efforts are being made by the japanese 
government and companies and progress is being made the united 
states continues to be highly dissatisfied with american market 
access the official said 
japanese officials countered that the government is doing its 
best to open the semiconductor market and that japan would react 
very strongly if it is named an unfair trader in semiconductors 
we are doing affirmative action concerning the penetration of 
us semiconductors to the japanese market said hidehiko 
nishiyama deputy director of the americasoceania division of the 
ministry of international trade and industry 
we have been demanding that the us side remove existing 
sanctions so its unimaginable for us to get additional 
sanctions nishiyama said in a telephone interview 
within a few weeks japan may be named for obstructive trading 
practices under the super 301 provision of the 1988 omnibus 
trade act which requires that the us government study sanctions 
against countries that do not remove unfair trade barriers after 
negotiations 
the japanese side expressed the view that the naming of 
semiconductors under section 301 would be counterproductive the 
us official said 
semiconductors are a key issue among the many complaints the 
united states has about japanese trade practices failure to 
implement the marketaccess provisions of the 1986 usjapan 
semiconductor agreement is very serious and affects billions of 
dollars in sales the us official said 
however both the us and japanese sides described the meetings 
as constructive 
there is clearly a commitment by the japanese side to 
improve market access for us semiconductor firms the us 
official said 
both sides apparently did not raise an earlier dispute about 
whether the 1986 agreement between the two countries promised the 
united states a 20 percent share of the japanese semiconductor 
market by 1991 officials from both countries understand that it 
is not constructive to discuss the 20 percent issue nishiyama 
said 
on the issue of highdefinition television miti said japanese 
firms had indicated a willingness to work with us semiconductor 
producers on hdtv projects the us official said 
the two sides also discussed tron a basic computer design 
standard created by a japanese professor that is intended to make 
future computers more compatible and flexible tron stands for 
the realtime operating system nucleus 
participation in the development of tron is open to us firms 
and a number are participating but japanese companies are ahead in 
developing tron products 
because japanese schools and the semiprivate telecommunications 
giant nippon telegraph and telephone corp are considering the tron 
standard for some future purchases the us is concerned about 
preventing government intervention in the marketplace which 
creates a trade barrier said another us official who also 
demanded anonymity

the list of big eight accounting firms is 
shrinking by one robbing another memorable phrase from a business 
lexicon that has already lost the seven sisters oil companies and 
the bunch computer makers 
two big eight members arthur young amp co and ernst amp whinney 
announced friday they agreed to merge to form the worlds largest 
accounting agency 
traditionalists were swallowing hard at the loss of the 
athleticsounding big eight to refer to the nations biggest 
accounting firms 
this has got people buzzing said arthur bowman editor of 
bowmans accounting report in atlanta 
the phrase big eight is dead because no other firm deserves 
membership bowman said big seven is still hard on the ears he 
said but then this isnt a football conference 
the everchanging face of corporate america is erasing one handy 
phrase after another 
seven sisters ceased to work as a term for the worlds largest 
oil companies in 1984 when one of them gulf corp was swallowed 
by another standard oil co of california now chevron corp 
the bunch is no longer a good acronym for rivals to 
international business machines corp since the b bought the u 
the h got out of computers and the c has shrunk drastically 
b was for burroughs corp u for univac later sperry corp n 
for ncr corp c for control data corp and h for honeywell inc 
the fortune 500 biggest industrial companies and the forbes 400 
richest americans wont be outdated because they accommodate an 
everchanging membership the same goes for the dow jones average 
of 30 industrial stocks 
the endangered monikers are those with fixed memberships 
big three means less than it once did for automakers and 
television networks the automakers are losing ground to japanese 
auto plants in the united states the networks face competition 
from cable and such wouldbe fourth networks as fox 
broadcasting cos 
in banking the club of about 15 money center banking 
companies in big cities is losing its glorified status because of 
the success of such aggressive superregional institutions as 
ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
and lost in history are such terms as club 17 for a group of 
powerful investment banks that were sued unsuccessfully by the 
government for antitrust shortly after world war ii 
big eight had an unusually long lineage bowman said the firms 
were identified when the securities and exchange commission was 
created in the 1930s and fortune magazine popularized the term in 
the 1960s the cutoff point made sense because no 8 was more than 
twice the size of no 9 
two contradictory trends account for the disappearance of 
familiar phrases the pursuit of bigness through mergers and the 
defeat of big companies by smaller nimbler competitors 
the death of the dinosaurs actually is the more significant 
trend argues robert sobel a professor of business history at 
hofstra university in hempstead ny 
the tendency today is toward decentralization rather than 
centralization he said friday

miniature porcelain critters decorating an 
office window are the only evidence of animals at avon products 
incs test laboratory 
the cosmetics maker has closed the facility at its research and 
manufacturing center in suffern ny where until early last summer 
it squirted beauty potions on rabbits and mice to determine if the 
concoctions were safe besides disbanding its animaltesting 
operation avon says it hasnt asked independent laboratories to 
test on animals since midmarch and chairman james e preston has 
declared the company will discontinue testing permanently 
it might sound like avon should win plaudits from animal welfare 
activists but its about to get a booby prize 
on june 2 people for the ethical treatment of animals plans to 
bestow a pinocchio award on the avon chairman contending avon 
has lied about its commitment to stopping the use of animals in 
product safety tests and has failed to honestly describe past 
procedures 
avon recently involved in a nasty tussle repelling unsolicited 
takeover advances from amway corp has been receiving lots of 
unwanted attention from petas operatives theyve picketed 
prestons connecticut home and are urging an international boycott 
of avon products 
the pinocchio award a 10foot replica of a nose is bound to 
generate some additional unwelcome publicity 
the problems confronting avon are similar to those facing many 
companies that have relied on animals for decades to test products 
ranging from eye shadow to candy bars 
but avon and other cosmetics makers have been targeted by the 
antianimaltesting movement to heighten publicity even though 
they account for only a tiny portion of the animals subjected to 
lab experiments 
henry spira a longtime animal rights activist and head of a 
new yorkbased coalition that once campaigned against revlon inc 
says pointing a finger at beauty peddlers that use eyeblinding 
tests on rabbits is an optimal strategy 
the juxtaposition of the dream of beauty and the nightmare of 
the rabbits is a perfect protest theme says spira 
moreover there is a strong perception that testing cosmetics is 
a frivolous reason for maiming or killing animals lipstick and 
mascara arent among lifes necessities 
this perception helps evoke more sympathy than if protesters 
targeted animal testing in the development of lifesaving drugs or 
medical treatments 
spira doesnt condone petas tactics against avon and applauds 
companies for taking steps toward recognizing animal rights it 
doesnt make any sense to me to dump on a company thats 
responsive says spira 
susan rich coordinator of petas campaign doesnt deny that 
avon and other companies have moved away from testing 
we certainly acknowledge the progress that they have made 
she says citing the decline in the number of animals used by 
industries avon for example says 2423 animals were used in 
1988 down from 4063 in 1987 and 14500 in 1981 
but she says only constant reminders will keep avon and other 
companies accountable weve not asked these companies to stop 
animal testing overnight but we want them to commit themselves to 
timetables 
the decision was made to intensify pressure on avon partly 
because in petas view the company sent confusing signals about 
its position 
avon chief preston in a recent interview attempted to clarify 
where his company stands 
we are not going to authorize condone or request any 
testing he says however avon opposes prohibiting such tests 
and has lobbied against legislative bans proposed in several states 
part of the reason for this stance may be the rapid 
breakthroughs in skin care treatments and beauty formulas 
suppliers anxious to market these products may want to check 
their safety quickly until nonanimal test methods are readily 
available inventors may have no choice but to test on animals 
moreover preston says some important overseas markets for us 
cosmetics require animal tests avon doesnt intend to ask 
foreigners to change their laws 
there is no us law that requires cosmetic testing on animals 
but the food and drug administration says it will expect companies 
to conduct such tests until alternatives are accepted 
the fda position is that the use of animal tests by industry 
to establish the safety of regulated products is necessary to 
minimize the risks from such products to humans the agency said 
in a recent policy letter 
given these circumstances preston says our position is the 
safety of consumers and the international competitiveness of the 
american cosmetics industry comes first 
for now avon and a few us competitors say they are willing to 
delay introduction of new products until safety can be determined 
through nonanimal tests 
in suspending animal tests last week mary kay cosmetics became 
the latest beautyproducts firm to say it may have to delay release 
of some items 
the drive toward alternatives accelerated in january when noxell 
corp maker of noxzema skin creams and cover girl cosmetics said 
it was screening many cosmetics by applying them to tissue cultures 
in lab dishes instead of squirting them into rabbits eyes 
avon also has replaced this procedure the socalled draize eye 
irritation test 
the test named after a former fda official has been widely 
used for nearly 50 years the solution to be tested is injected 
into the eyes of rabbits usually an albino breed because the 
absence of natural coloring allows easier observation rabbits were 
selected because they lack tear ducts that would help wash away the 
solution 
a growing number of companies in the cosmetics chemical and 
pharmaceutical industries are attempting to validate new nonanimal 
testing methods 
at labs nationwide experiments are done with bacteria cell 
cultures living tissue in test tubes and computer simulations 
some labs like the johns hopkins center for alternatives to 
animal testing were established with financing from companies in 
industries in which animal testing has been standard procedure 
in the end companies may find that nonanimal replacements are 
far less expensive and much more accurate than animal tests 
developed decades ago national testing corp of palm springs 
calif for example says its eytex method adopted by avon is 
significantly cheaper than the draize test 
says activist spira even if there were no animal movement 
the movement for alternatives would continue on its own

they wanted to see what the rains were like over the weekend 
corn prices closed higher on reports of lessthanexpected rain 
in the corn belt corn prices also were supported by reports the 
soviet union and mexico may be in the market soon 
wheat prices dropped on trader disappointment over a lack of new 
purchase orders from the soviets or china the market also was 
affected by good rains in missouri where there were fears of crop 
loss because of dryness

contract for delivery in may at 403 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to 1 cents higher with may at 274 a bushel oats were 2

boeing commercial airplanes has made design 
changes to prevent wiring and plumbing mistakes such as those found 
on 94 boeing jets in a recent governmentordered inspection 
company officials said friday 
boeing said it was using differentsized fittings putting the 
connections in different locations and using labels and 
colorcoding to prevent the problems found in jetliner engine and 
cargo hold fire detection and extinguishing systems 
no design can be 100 percent foolproof for manufacturing and 
maintenance but the new connections should be very close to it 
ben cosgrove commercial airplanes senior vice president said in a 
news release 
the federal aviation administration was expected to approve the 
changes boeing said once approved the new designs will be 
incorporated into production lines this fall and were expected to 
be available for retrofitting in previously delivered aircraft 
shortly thereafter 
in january the faa issued an airworthiness directive requiring 
us operators of boeing jets to inspect for possible miswiring and 
misplumbing systems were inspected on 1600 boeing planes 
including hundreds operated by foreign carriers and 95 
misconnections two on one plane were found and corrected 
no accident or emergency resulted from the miswirings or 
misplumbings although boeing said eight of the misconnections 
would have resulted in false information displays to a flight crew 
the faa said earlier that in one instance involving a 
twinengine boeing 757 flown by a foreign carrier engine fire 
control panel modules were reversed so that a fire in the right 
engine would indicate a fire in the left and vice versa 
probable result is that both engines are shut down from 
extinguishant discharge and fuel cutoff actions the faa 
concluded 
boeings problems with miswiring first received attention in the 
spring of 1988 when japan air lines complained about misconnections 
in a fire suppression system the complaint was among a number 
boeing received from customers about aircraft quality and the 
seattlebased aerospace company has said it has been attempting in 
the past year to improve workmanship 
the faa ordered the inspections jan 31 after limited directives 
turned up problems in 17 aircraft 
the jan 8 crash of a british midland airways 737 in scotland 
raised speculation that the pilot may have been deceived by faulty 
wiring into shutting down his only good engine the cause of that 
crash in which 44 people died is under investigation 
crossed wiring was eliminated as a cause by investigators for 
britains civil aviation administration commercial airplanes 
spokeswoman liz reese said but now we carry that stigma 
cosgrove said the changes include using differentsized wire and 
plumbing connections for different functions

merger fever broke out friday at the highest 
levels of the accounting profession as big eight firms firms arthur 
young amp co and ernst amp whinney proposed combining their worldwide 
practices to create the worlds largest professional services 
organization 
the two firms said they had agreed in principle to a merger that 
would create a 43 billion worldwide organization offering 
accounting auditing tax and consulting services and employing 
70000 people in 100 countries 
the partners of both firms will begin voting on the proposal in 
june and leaders said they were confident the deal would be 
approved 
the new organization would be called ernst amp young and the 
chairmen of the respective firms william l gladstone of arthur 
young and ray j groves of ernst amp whinney would become its 
cochief executives 
gladstone and groves issued a joint statement saying the merger 
will give us unmatched professional service capabilities to meet 
and anticipate our clients needs worldwide 
gladstone told a news conference the new firm would be able to 
serve clients better as they expand in europe where trade barriers 
are coming down 
he said the merged organizations presence also would be 
stronger than the firms are separately in such industries as health 
care manufacturing and high technology financial services real 
estate retailing energy and the media 
groves said ernst amp whinney for example has been a leader in 
service to hospitals while arthur young has been strong in the 
biotechnology field combining operations he said would give the 
new concern much more depth than we were before 
it looks like they are trying to lower overhead costs as well 
as increase their professional coverage in parts of the country and 
the world where they are have weak spots said donald j kirk 
professor of accounting at columbia universitys graduate school of 
business 
kirk a former chairman of the financial accounting standards 
board said the merger could prompt other big eight firms to 
consider mergers we may well see another one or two in the next 
few years he said 
but he said there wont be a quick wave of mergers because of 
the cultural differences among accounting firms they are often 
quite different in their internal training and attitudes he said 
groves and gladstone said they dont intend to lay off employees 
or to lose clients because of conflicts as a result of the merger 
groves said the employees would continue doing what they have 
been doing and hopefully would attract more work gladstone said 
the combined firm will have more employees a year from now than the 
firms have separately today 
they said clients they have spoken with about the deal have 
responded positively to their planned merger 
gladstone said accounting and auditing firms generally are 
sought out for their expertise in a field such as the media or 
energy business and often count competing companies as clients 
the clients recognize that their accountant or auditor will not 
share their financial secrets with anyone else he said 
among the clients of ernst amp young would be the soft drink 
giants cocacola co and pepsico inc oil companies amerada hess 
corp mobil corp phillips petroleum co and financial companies 
american express co painewebber group and transamerica corp 
the merger of arthur young and ernst amp whinney would top the 
previous biggest accounting merger that saw peat marwick combine 
with kmg main hurdman two years ago into a firm called kpmg 
according to the atlantabased newsletter bowmans accounting 
report kpmg was the worlds largest accounting firm in at 39 
billion in world revenue in 1988 while arthur andersen was the 
biggest us accounting firm at 171 billion 
ernst amp whinney posted 219 billion in world revenue and 117 
billion in us revenue last year while arthur young had 205 
billion in world revenue and 843 million in us revenue bowmans

westinghouse electric corp officials said 
friday they were delighted a federal judge in new jersey has 
shifted to arbitration the bulk of the legal allegations made by 
the philippines over a mothballed nuclear reactor 
only one of 15 counts claiming the philippine people were 
harmed by alleged corruption in the contracting of the plant will 
remain in federal court to determine its merits said louis 
briskman deputy general counsel for westinghouse the nations 
largest producer of nuclear power plants 
us district judge dickinson r debevois in newark ruled 
thursday that the claims made by the current government of 
president corazon aquino belong before the international chamber of 
commerce as specified in the contract westinghouse entered with the 
government when ferdinand marcos was president 
this ruling is strong affirmation of the position weve been 
taking since the suit was filed against westinghouse and the 
project architectengineer burns amp roe enterprises inc said 
nathaniel woodson president of the westinghouses international 
division 
attorneys for the philippines argued the corruption surrounding 
the contract was so massive that the federal court should keep the 
case and disregard contract provisions specifying arbitration as 
the forum for settling disputes 
the aquino government claims bribes were paid to the marcos 
government to win the contract and it filed the suit in an attempt 
to void the contract 
the suit also alleges that the 23 billion 600megawatt plant 
on the bataan peninsula which has been mothballed since its 
completion in 1985 is unsafe 
briskman said there is no evidence any of the 17 million 
westinghouse paid in fees to contract consultants in the 
philippines went to marcos as a bribe he said he was confident of 
winning any court case on the remaining count 
westinghouse has claims pending before the chamber of commerce 
in switzerland seeking 30 million in remaining charges on the 
project

the philadelphia stock exchange on friday 
accused the american stock exchange of improperly copying its new 
stock indexbased security a charge the american exchange promptly 
denied 
the exchanges both began trading the securities known as cash 
index participations on the philadelphia exchange and equity index 
participations on the amex a week ago after the securities and 
exchange commission lifted a ban on them 
amex copied parts of the philadelphia exchanges rules for the 
security that were submitted to the sec thomas a russo an 
attorney for the philadelphia exchange wrote in a letter to amex 
attorneys 
the philadelphia stock exchange sought sec approval for the cash 
index participation a security based on the basket of stocks 
represented by the standard amp poors index of 500 stocks in march 
1988 
two weeks later the amex filed with the sec seeking approval 
for its equity index participation a similar instrument 
it took me a few months just to get the rules specific said 
william w uchimoto the philadelphia exchanges general counsel 
i dont think they could develop a product in two weeks thats 
identical to ours 
in a prepared statement read by amex spokesman bob shabazian 
the exchange said there is no basis to contend infringement of 
any purported copyright 
the chicago board options exchange also came out with a similar 
product however uchimoto said because that exchange had not 
begun trading its version and was not aggressively promoting it the 
philadelphia exchange decided not to complain 
if the amex and the philadelphia exchange cannot agree on ways 
to make the amex product substantially different uchimoto said he 
planned to sue to bar amex from trading the security 
he said one change that might satisfy the philadelphia exchange 
would be for the amex security to be tied to an index other than 
the sampp 500 
the index participation products are based on the current value 
of indexes of stocks investors receive quarterly cash payments 
equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividend 
declared on the component stocks of the underlying index 
the complaint came a day after the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals in chicago denied a request by the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange to temporarily halt trading of 
the securities 
fearing the securities would cut into their futures business 
the two chicago exchanges have argued the securities actually are 
futures contracts and should be regulated by the commodity futures 
trading commission rather than the sec

members discouraged crude prices from moving sharply in either

affected by good rains in missouri where there had been fears of

digital equipment corp seeking to avoid layoffs 
despite a sharp drop in earnings said friday it will delay all 
salary increases for its 73500 employees in the united states 
the salary freeze will go into effect july 2 the beginning of 
digitals fiscal year and will be reevaluated in late september 
or october said spokeswoman nikki richardson 
because business is down in the us for digital as well as 
for computers in general we need to control costs in order to 
improve profitability ms richardson said 
digital stock closed at 96625 down 50 cents in composite 
trading friday on the new york stock exchange the stock has sagged 
badly since 1987 when it peaked at 199 a share 
the maynardbased computer maker reported earnings in the 
quarter ending april 1 of 2564 million down almost 16 percent 
from 3051 million a year earlier operating revenues were 312 
billion up 11 percent over the same period of 1988 
ms richardson said no layoffs or early retirement incentives 
are planned she noted that digital has never had a layoff in its 
31year history 
although there is no written guarantee against layoffs digital 
and its employees have a tacit covenant of lifetime job security 
said george colony president of forrester research inc a 
computer market researcher in cambridge 
i think it is virtually impossible for digital to break that 
covenant they cannot do it and i dont think they should do it i 
think this is a better alternative to layoffs he said 
digital imposed a previous salary freeze in 1982 during an 
industry downturn but it was lifted after three months when the 
companys sales turned around 
all us employees will experience the same delay in their 
salary increases regardless of their employment anniversary date 
when salary reviews normally take place ms richardson said 
digitals 52000 employees working abroad will not be affected 
by the freeze because demand and profitability remain strong in 
the international area for digital she said 
analysts said the root of the us downturn is that sales of 
personal computers and groups of pcs linked to socalled local area 
networks are cutting into demand for digitals more expensive 
minicomputers 
if that trend reaches europe and the far east colony said 
digital may be forced to take additional costcutting measures in 
the fall 
we expect the next step will be a redeployment of people from 
headquarters out into the field which would be a de facto layoff 
because people dont want to move from boston to oshkosh he said

holly farms corps latest deadline for 
takeover bids passed friday but a lawyer for rival poultry 
processor tyson foods inc indicated his client would refrain from 
making an offer 
i wouldnt be holding your breath until we bid rodman ward 
a tyson lawyer in delaware said friday afternoon he declined 
further comment 
tyson of springdale ark has pursued holly farms since last 
october and has been battling with conagra inc of omaha neb for 
control of the memphisbased company 
the takeover battle worth about 1 billion is tied up in a 
delaware court and the legal squabbling will likely continue 
regardless of how the bidding goes 
court records indicate that tyson and conagra have been 
negotiating behind the scenes to settle on a buyer of holly farms 
a diversified company heavily involved in fresh fryer sales 
ted bailey a spokesman for holly farms declined to comment on 
the bidding saying a statement would be made after his companys 
board of directors met saturday in new york 
the board will meet about midday but i dont have any idea 
when we will have anything to say he said 
the holly board has voted several times to reject buyout offers 
from tyson a spokesman for conagra failed to return phone calls 
tyson has previously offered holly stockholders 6350ashare 
for their stock but the tender offer is conditioned on removal of 
an asset purchase agreement between holly and conagra 
that agreement would let conagra buy about a third of holly 
farms if the company is sold to anyone other than conagra 
tyson is challenging that agreement in court and has accused 
holly farms of trying to favor conagra as a suitor 
holly stockholders voted last month to reject a proposal to 
merge holly farms with conagra the asset purchase agreement stems 
from that merger plan 
tyson tried to stop the latest bidding for holly farms but 
chancellor maurice hartnett of delaware refused the request 
hartnett said however that the bidding procedures clearly 
favored conagra over tyson

securities and exchange commission chairman 
david s ruder said friday he was concerned about the resurgence of 
program stock trading which could herald a return of market 
conditions similar to those preceding the 1987 crash 
one day after announcing his resignation ruder also said market 
changes since the oct 19 1987 crash when the dow jones 
industrial average plunged 508 points could help deter but would 
not necessarily prevent another collapse 
ruder said he did not believe the stock market was overvalued 
now the dow industrials closed above 2500 friday for the first 
time since the crash 
but ruder said there would be reason to worry if the dow hit 
3000 partly because of the increasing use of computerized program 
trading strategies that some critics have blamed for increasing 
stock market volatility during the time of the crash 
what frankly that i have some concern about is that we have 
had a return to the markets of program activity and portfolio 
trading particularly by brokerdealer firms acting as 
principals ruder told the womens economic round table 
the possibility is we may see a 300 to 600point large price 
rise ruder said if that would happen then i would be 
concerned about a drop to follow that 
the new york stock exchange defines program trading as 
strategies involving the purchase or sale of a group of 15 or more 
stocks most major firms limited their program trading activity 
shortly after the 1987 crash amid escalating public criticism of 
the practice although many recently have increased such operations 
however the average daily nyse volume accounted for by program 
trading dipped to 76 percent in april after two months of advances 
ruder said postcrash defensive measures included better 
communication among brokerages and exchanges automation that has 
improved market efficiency and the installation of circuit 
breaker rules at that mandate temporary stock trading halts in 
the event of huge price drops 
its as though we have resurfaced all our highways now and you 
can drive 150 miles an hour on them and the question is what will 
happen if everybody drives 150 miles an hour he said 
ruder announced thursday he was resigning to resume teaching at 
northwestern universitys law school probably in the fall he took 
over the sec which regulates the nations securities markets in 
august 1987 and has presided over a turbulent period including the 
crash and the governments unprecedented fraud prosecution of the 
investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
ruder denied he was leaving because of any policy disagreements 
with the bush administration and said the move was a personal 
decision that i could not commit to president bush for four years 
as chairman 
i believe that it is important that the president have someone 
to run the commission who is willing to spend a reasonably long 
period of time in the position he told reporters when i asked 
myself would i be willing to stay through the presidency of 
president bush my answer was no 
in other comments ruder praised the growth in the market for 
junk bonds highinterest rate securities used to finance dozens of 
mergers and corporate expansions 
i think the development of an active market in less than 
investment grade debt junk bonds has been a very positive 
phenomenon for our country he said i think that market is 
important in the continued financing of our companies and i think 
its beneficial 
junk bond financing used in corporate takeovers has been 
criticized as rendering the target companies as vulnerable to 
failure during a recession due to their debt burdens 
ruder also defended the secs civil suit and settlement of 
wideranging fraud violations against drexel 
the actvities we outlined in the drexel complaint involve 
injuries to the public by a major professional brokerage firm he 
said and i believe it to be part of my job to prevent 
professionals in our society from taking advantage of the public

volume on the floor of the big board hit a twomonth high of 
24241 million shares up from 17748 million in the previous

that served to reinforce spreading hopes on wall street that the 
federal reserve would succeed in its effort to engineer a soft 
landing for the economy restraining inflation without causing a 
recession 
analysts said stocks also seemed to be benefiting from a sort of 
bandwagon effect 
the recent gains in the market they noted have put pressure on 
money managers who have been holding large cash reserves to try to 
catch up with the performance of their fully invested competitors 
gainers among the blue chips included general electric up at

higher fuel economy regulations for 1990 
modelyear cars wont compel general motors corp to cut production 
of large models in the immediate future gm chairman roger smith 
said friday 
smith speaking at a news conference following the companys 
annual shareholders meeting reiterated statements that an 
increase in the corporate average fuel economy standard which will 
be 275 miles per gallon for the 1990 model year could result in 
closings of plants making large automobiles 
however he said i dont see that happening right now for the 
1990 year as we look forward to it we have to see how the sales 
go 
he refused to rule out plant closings in 1990 for other reasons 
earlier this week transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
he would not seek a change in the regulation requiring automakers 
fleets to average 275 mpg 
that was a break from the reagan administration which granted 
appeals from gm and ford motor co to lower the standard chrysler 
corps fleet which has a larger percentage of smaller more fuel 
efficient cars has had little trouble meeting the requirements 
planning production for the 1990 model year has been under way 
for months gms chevrolet division already is selling its 1990 
lumina sedan 
smith also said that in the fall a committee of the board of 
directors would be formed to search for his successor as 
previously reported smith will step down as chairman of the 
worlds largest industrial company july 31 1990 
at the news conference and the board meeting earlier in the day 
smith said there was no heir apparent 
we dont have a crown prince he told shareholders we 
have a lot of excellent executives 
smith also told stockholders gm was on the way to a 
reindustrialization of itself by the end of the year smith 
said gm will have spent nearly 76 billion on building and 
modernizing plants and other facilities 
today though we still have much more work to do weve made 
excellent progress smith said well go into the 1990s a far 
different company from the one that entered the 1980s 
smith singled out a need for the company to improve its north 
american operations like no 2 ford motor co gms earnings 
during the past several years have been buoyed by european 
operations 
we want to increase our north american passengercar market 
penetration smith said right now it isnt where wed like 
it 
during the 1980s gm has watched its share of the entire 
automobile market shrink from 46 percent as the decade began to 
358 percent on march 10 most of that erosion in market share has 
has gone to ford and overseas automakers

the house energy and commerce committee said 
friday it is investigating allegations of insider stock trading by 
officials of amway corp before the company offered to buy avon 
products inc 
in a letter rep john dingell dmich asked the chairman of 
the securities and exchange commission david ruder to open his 
own probe of the allegations ruder said in new york that the sec 
planned to investigate as it does whenever it receives such 
allegations 
amway a doortodoor sales business headquartered in ada 
mich on may 10 offered 39 a share in a takeover bid for its 
larger rival avon amway withdrew its 21 billion offer wednesday 
dingells committee released a memorandum it had received from 
an unspecified source alleging that otto stolz amways executive 
vice president and william nicholson amways chief operating 
officer apparently intended to profit personally when they 
purchased avon stock in late march and early april before the 
takeover bid was announced 
the memorandum said that irwin jacobs a minneapolis investor 
and a partner of amway also purchased stock prior to the takeover 
announcement jacobs the memorandum said was being paid out of 
profits from trading in avon stock before the takeover announcement 
federal law forbids trading securities based on information not 
available to the general public avon shares rose more than 2 per 
share immediately after the takeover bid was announced 
nicholson said the shares were assigned to the partnership with 
jacobs at cost the transactions were reported to the sec and 
there was no personal profit involved 
this is the standard part of the smear campaign of avon and 
its advisors to divert attention from their own performance or 
problems nicholson said 
avon said no one was available to comment on nicholsons 
assertion 
jacobs said the allegations were preposterous plain and 
simple 
it is strictly politically motivated we welcome any 
government agency that wishes to look into this thing our books 
are wide open to them he said 
a spokesman for the house committee dennis fitzgibbons 
declined to discuss the source of the memorandum 
the allegations are sufficiently serious that the chairman had 
to ask ruder and the commission to look at them fitzgibbons said 
the memorandum said stolz purchased 10000 avon shares on march 
23 and 6600 shares on march 27 at a value of 356000 
nicholson the memo said on april 5 purchased options to buy 
40000 avon shares at 25 per share with the options costing 
70400 
the memorandum alleged that the timing and nature of that 
trading is consistent with attempts to profit personally from 
insider trading not with any purported agency transaction on 
behalf of amway 
meanwhile investors continued to unload avon shares friday 
although the selloff seemed to be subsiding avon stock closed at 
3225 a share off 75 cents in composite new york stock exchange 
trading 
avon stock had reached a 52week high of 4125 earlier in the 
week amid speculation amway might raise its offer or another more 
generous bidder might emerge but after amway withdrew its 
takeover proposal wednesday night avon shares plunged 712 on

electrolux corp a leading homecare 
products company said friday it has agreed to buy the regina 
company inc a new jerseybased maker of products such as vacuum 
cleaners and home whirlpool baths 
terms were not disclosed and the transcation was subject to 
completing a definitive purchase agreement and approval by a 
federal bankruptcy judge 
regina based in rahway nj filed for reorganization under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy laws april 26 
steven cooper senior vice president and general counsel for 
electrolux said electrolux hoped regina would provide a 
different channel for retail distribution 
electrolux a privatelyheld company is primarily a direct 
sales organization specializing in homecare products such as water 
purification products 
cooper said details of the purchase agreement and electroluxs 
plans for personnel at regina were still sketchy 
regina has stated its value at 65 million to 70 million but 
the purchase price was subject to negotiations with the bankruptcy 
judge cooper said 
we want to finish the negotiations as quickly as possible but 
i really cant say how soon that will be he said 
electrolux has listed its annual sales at 400 million reginas 
last full fiscal year yielded about 160 million cooper said 
cooper said a bankruptcy attorney for regina had requested a 
hearing to be scheduled within 15 days 
officials at reginas corporate headquarters could not be 
reached for comment by telephone friday because they had left their 
offices after business hours 
reginas ability to survive as an independent company was put in 
doubt on may 4 when a us bankruptcy judge william tuohey in 
newark nj refused to approve a 5 million financing package 
worked out between the company and its two largest creditors chase 
manhattan bank and philadelphia national bank 
the agreement was contingent on the banks ability to combine 
the new loan with the companys old debt amounting to about 25 
million 
the banks also demanded to be put ahead of all other creditors 
for repayment 
tuohey said he rejected the agreement out of concern for 
unsecured creditors who have total claims of 36 million

boeing co set an industry record for singleyear 
commercial jetliner orders friday when united airlines announced 
its fourth major order for boeing aircraft in two years a 32plane 
package the airline valued at 3 billion 
uniteds firm order for 16 extendedrange 767300ers and options 
for another 16 of the widebody twinjets came just three weeks after 
united gave boeing the largest aircraft order ever with a single 
manufacturer for up to 370 planes valued at as much as 1574 
billion 
and stephen m wolf uniteds chairman and president said his 
companys buying spree isnt over for the year 
a third and major order addressing our widebody needs for both 
our growing pacific service as well as for additional domestic 
airplanes will be forthcoming later this year wolf said from 
uniteds chicago headquarters 
with the new orders boeing has a backlog of 1535 jets which 
should guarantee prosperity for the jetmaker well into the 
mid1990s 
although a crush of orders from airlines and leasing companies 
have raised questions on how well the big three jet manufacturers 
can keep up boeing officials say they have been planning as best 
they can for the new work 
wolf said the new 767s are envisioned for both domestic and 
transatlantic service even though united does not yet fly to 
europe 
in uniteds configuration the 767s will carry about 200 
passengers and will be able to fly from anywhere in the continental 
united states to western europe 
boeing which lists dollar figures only for firm orders priced 
the 16 firm 767s at about 14 billion 
with the order boeing set an industry record for dollar value 
of planes ordered in a calendar year 301 billion for 543 
aircraft that mark also a company record for new orders for the 
fifth year in a row betters the 297 billion for 636 boeing 
planes ordered for all of 1988 
in the past two years united which was formed by boeing in the 
1930s but split off in 1934 has given boeing about 234 billion 
in new business counting aircraft options united now has on order 
every type of commercial jet boeing makes 
uniteds april order was for 120 boeing 737s twinjets and 60 
midsized 757s plus options for 130 737s and 60 757s 
in may 1987 united ordered 15 747400 jumbo jets and 21 737s 
worth a total 21 billion and in april 1988 ordered 30 757s and 
took options on 30 more in a deal worth 13 billion for the firm 
orders 
united has been a good customer for a long time said boeing 
spokeswoman elizabeth reese 
boeing salesmen also are working on getting the united order for 
later this year well be showing them what we have in the 
salesroom ms reese said 
wolf said united would receive its first five 767300ers in 
1991 two more in 1992 eight in 1993 and one in 1994 four of the 
jets on option are to be delivered in 1994 five in 1995 and seven 
in 1996 
the planes will be powered by pratt amp whitney engines 
boeing and its two major competitors mcdonnell douglas corp 
and europes airbus industrie have been blessed with a crush of 
orders in recent years due to concerns about older aircraft 
forecasts of continued rapid growth of air travel and a need for 
planes to meet tougher noise standards and to be more economical 
boeing and mcdonnell douglas both have suffered delays in 
delivering new aircraft boeing with its 747400 jumbo jet and 
mcdonnell douglas with its md11 widebody but boeing officials say 
they dont expect delays to spread to other assembly lines 
ms reese said uniteds new order was anticipated and isnt 
going to impact the production line because we plan things like 
this in advance 
phil condit boeing commercial airplanes executive vice 
president said in a briefing last week that boeing has 
substantially met its revised schedule for delivering the new 747s 
though it has had to negotiate penalties with at least four 
customers 
condit said those delays were due in great part to overly 
ambitious plans to introduce four different variations of the jumbo 
jet simultaneously 
boeing says it is increasing production rates from 27 jets a 
month to 34 by mid1990s and is spending 11 billion on capital 
improvements this year including major upgrades at its renton 737 
and 757 plant and at its widebody factory in everett wash 
condit said boeings production schedules are being planned 
years in advance and that the company is carefully increasing 
production so as not overwhelm its own and its suppliers capacity
