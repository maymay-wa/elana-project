texas sen lloyd bentsen won by acclamation the 
democratic vicepresidential nomination thursday and said he and 
michael dukakis have differences but stand united on basic 
party principles and their determination to regain control of the 
white house 
there was a thunderous ovation as dukakis his wife kitty 
bentsen and his wife beryl ann held hands and acknowledged the 
crowd at the evenings climactic moment after dukakis own 
acceptance speech the band played patriotic music and the 
delegates held small american flags aloft 
jesse jackson and his wife jackie later joined the group on 
stage as did some of dukakis other defeated rivals 
bentsen was the choice of the massachusetts governor and won 
jacksons written endorsement just as his name was being entered in 
nomination 
still when the voice vote was taken to acclaim him the nominee 
many jackson supporters shouted no voicing their continued 
displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the ticket 
fifteen members of bentsens texas delegation refused to join in 
the celebration 
house speaker jim wright the convention chairman declared the 
nomination approved by a twothirds vote and dukakis and bentsen 
signs were thrust into the air the signs changed to 
dukakisbentsen before the new vicepresidential nominee could 
finish his acceptance speech 
bentsen in accepting the nomination attempted to portray the 
contrasts between him and the more liberal dukakis as good for the 
ticket 
we democrats do not march in lockstep behind some narrow 
rigid ideology he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the 
democratic national convention we are not gray grains of oatmeal 
in a bland porridge of privilege 
of course we have differences of opinion bentsen said in an 
oblique reference to the fact that he and the presidential nominee 
disagree on many issues 
but on the basic issues of justice and opportunity we stand 
united he said 
in a sharp attack on the reaganbush administration bentsen 
said america has just passed through the ultimate epoch of 
illusion an eightyear coma in which slogans were confused with 
solutions 
dukakis in his own remarks paid tribute to bentsen saying he 
would speak up if the national security council came up with the 
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for 
hostages 
were going to have a vice president named lloyd bentsen who 
will walk into the oval office and say mr president this is 
outrageous its got to stop the crowd cheered 
jackson supporters had threatened earlier this week to place 
jacksons name in nomination for the no 2 spot on the ticket but 
the dukakis and jackson camps resolved their differences and no 
nomting petition was filed 
jacksons lastminute statement in support of the texan said 
while i may disagree with both governor dukakis and senator 
bentsen on some important issues our interests converge in 
building a coalition to beat the republicans this fall 
some in the audience chanted no contra aid as he started to 
speak and a smattering of no contra aid signs were sprinkled 
throughout the audience bentsen has supported us assistance to 
the nicaraguan rebels which dukakis opposes 
after his speech bentsen was joined on the podium by his 
family including his 94yearold father lloyd he and his wife 
embraced and waved to the crowd which clapped along with the air 
force hymn they held up beat bush again signs and chanted that 
refrain bentsen first won election to the senate in 1970 by 
defeating bush 
bentsen 67 made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1976 
then stayedin the senate two years ago becoming chairman of the 
powerful senate finance committee he has since shepherded through 
his panel some of the legislative initiatives the democrats plan to 
brag about this fall welfare reform medicare insurance for 
catastrophic illness and the trade bill including a 60day advance 
notice for plant closings 
bentsen was nominated by rep dan rostenkowski dill and 
former rep barbara jordan of texas and sen tom daschle of south 
dakota seconded the nomination 
lloyd bentsen has everything it takes to become one of 
americas great vice presidents rostenkowski said lloyd 
bentsen is straightforward lloyd bentsen is smart and yes lloyd 
bentsen is tough he knows that compromise keeps the political 
process running 
sen john glenn of ohio who was considered by many a more 
likely choice for dukakis introduced bentsen to the convention 
you want to know something he said to get to the senate 
in 1970 lloyd bentsen beat george bush and this november he and 
michael dukakis will do it again 
many of bentsens public events in his four days in atlanta 
prior to his nomination were aimed at soothing the democrats who 
had hoped dukakis would pick someone else 
bentsen is more conservative than dukakis and many democrats on 
many issues including his support of school prayer the contra 
rebels in nicaragua and his opposition to gun control 
but his acceptance speech was crafted to highlight something 
nearly all the democrats agree upon beating the republicans 
the reaganbush administration likes to talk about prosperity 
but the farmers in iowa dont hear them he said the oil field 
workers in texas and oklahoma and louisiana dont hear them the 
factory workers in john glenns ohio dont hear them 
the first stop for the new democratic ticket upon leaving 
atlanta friday will be bentsens hometown of mcallen texas 
meanwhile spokesmen for bentsen said that past campaign 
literature exaggerating the number of missions he had flown in 
world war ii had been corrected a few years ago 
official biographies put out during earlier campaigns say that 
as a b24 bomber pilot based in italy bentsen flew 50 bomber 
missions over europe during the war but air force records show 
that he flew 35 combat missions according pan air force spokesman 
in washington maj lou figeroa 
jack devore bentsens press secretary said he is not sure how 
the incorrect number worked its way into the official biographies 
but that bentsen had noticed the mistake a few years ago and 
that subsequent campaign literature did not mention a specific 
number of flights

federal border patrol agents arrested two 
colombian nationals and seized about 1680 pounds of cocaine from a 
rental truck during a routine check at a turnpike gate thursday 
officials said 
the seizure not a record nationally but by far the largest in 
state history was valued at 53 million said mario ortiz 
spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service in dallas 
two men ages 25 and 27 were in custody ortiz said 
john coonce head of the drug enforcement administration office 
in tulsa said the names of the arrested men would not be released 
before friday so their identities could be confirmed 
ortiz said the cocaine was in 14 boxes in the truck which was 
otherwise loaded with new furniture 
the catch was a victory for the miami border patrol office 
which the ins had sought to close by mid1988 in a budgetcutting 
move at the insistence of the states congressional delegation 
the office was kept open with rotating agents from bordering 
states mostly to look for illegal aliens 
agents thursday would not provide details of the cocaines 
suspected origin or destination 
authorities reported confiscating 18744 pounds of cocaine along 
the usmexican border in fiscal 1987 and 3589 pounds in one 
record overland customs seizure on sept 14 1987 
the largest previous cocaine seizure in oklahoma was in 
september 1985 when agents staked out a cessna 421 in oklahoma 
city and seized nearly 725 pounds of cocaine

a psychologist who contended that the 
1942 walt disney classic bambi may be too upsetting for some 
very young children to watch says she didnt expect her comments to 
create such a stir 
i dont have a vendetta against bambi i really dont give a 
darn it was just my ersonal opinion louise bates ames 
associate director of the gesell institute of human development 
said wednesday 
ames who for 25 years wrote a syndicated column on child 
behavior told usa today last week that she personally would not 
take a child 5 years or younger to see the grated animated movie 
which has drawn large audiences since its recent rerelease 
for very young children possibly their worst fear is they 
would lose their mother or father she said 
that is exactly what happens to bambi the young deer and prince 
of the forest whose mother dies offscreen at the hands of a hunter 
its a movie in which a child loses its mother and there is no 
resolution the mother is just gone she saidi felt it would 
be too hard for many children 
howard green a disney spokesman in burbank calif said the 
film contains many moral lessons about life and mans relationship 
to animals which outweigh any possible complaints anyone might 
have 
clearly the film is one of the most respected and critically 
acclaimed of all animated films green said children have been 
seeing it since 1942 and i dont think any damage has been done 
every disney film has an element of fright to it which makes 
them so powerful and emotionally involving he added 
after the newspaper article appeared ames said she was 
bombarded with telephone calls from all over the country 
the personal calls were from parents who agreed with me she 
said a boston rabbi who is an authority on how children relate to 
dying also was quoted as saying it might be harmful for very young 
children to watch the film 
some bambi fans objected however ames participated in a radio 
callin show from phoenix during which she received several angry 
calls 
one man from new york was very angry what do you know about 
all this he asked i said this is not a big issue on my mind i 
dont really care ames said 
some callers said that because a deer and not a human died the 
film provides a way to introduce children more gently to the topic 
of death 
but ames said a young child will not depersonalize the film a 
mom is a mom she said 
green countered that the death of bambis mother is an example 
of classic understatement you hear a shot but you dont see 
anything 
when bambi realizes his mother has not returned home with him 
after telling him to run it is left to his father to tell him what 
happened the father tells bambi that his mother wont be with him 
any more because man has taken her away 
green said the sixth reissue of bambi produced the second 
biggest opening last weekend for an animated disney reissue 72 
million

scientists reported today they had found the 
approximate location of a gene that causes a crippling disease in 
as many as 20000 americans 
the work is a step toward earlier diagnosis of the illness 
friedreichs ataxia and toward detection of healthy people who 
unknowingly carry the gene and can pass it to their offspring the 
researchers said 
scientists hope to isolate the gene as a clue to possible 
treatments the disease now has no cure or specific treatment 
the study was reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by researchers at st marys hospital medical school in 
london the howard hughes medical institute at the university of 
utah school of medicine and the karolinska institute in stockholm 
sweden 
friedreichs ataxia afflicts probably 15000 to 20000 people in 
the united states but no reliable statistics are available said 
donald wood of the muscular dystrophy association which helped 
finance the research 
the lifethreatening disease causes reduced muscle coordination 
and an irregular gait the limbs may become weak and tasks that 
require good coordination such as writing may become difficult 
speech may also be impaired 
the disease appears when both copies of the friedreichs ataxia 
gene that a person inherits from his parents are defective 
genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes the 
new study based on 22 families with three or more affected 
siblings says the friedreichs ataxia gene lies in a particular 
portion of the chromosome scientists call number 9

the night stalker trial has taken nearly 
three years to get underway but it may take until next spring 
before a jury is selected in the case of the grisly crime rampage 
that terrorized the region 
defense attorneys for richard ramirez the 28yearold drifter 
charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies estimate that jury 
selection will last eight months 
the entire trial is expected to take two years the judge who 
scheduled jury selection to start late today has said it will be 
hard to find jurors able to serve in such a marathon proceeding 
superior court judge michael tynan who has presided over the 
case since november of 1986 moved to get the trial under way if 
only symbolically 
we are going to swear in a panel of about 70 folks and examine 
them regarding hardship and any attitudes they have developed 
said tynan 
i will ask people if they can afford to stick around for two 
years for this case tynan said if they say they cant survive 
financially that will be good cause for them to be excused 
ramirez originally from el paso tex was captured by east los 
angeles citizens following a siege of harrowing killings he is 
said to be eager to put his case before a jury 
hes been ready to go to trial all along said attorney 
daniel hernandez who with his cocounsel has filed a blizzard of 
pretrial motions which delayed the trial until now 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney p philip halpin has 
protested delays since the case began 
i am ecstatic about finally going to trial in this case he 
said wednesday and i hope we can move the trial along a little 
more efficiently than weve attended to the pretrial affairs 
ramirez notoriety will be a key subject of inquiry 
the pale shaggyhaired ramirez was the subject of a police 
dragnet before citizens ran him down and captured him 
his sometimes bizarre courtroom behavior fueled speculation that 
he was a devil worshiper at an early hearing he shouted hail 
satan and flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm the symbol 
associated with devil worship was found at some crime scenes and 
on victims in the night stalker case 
prospective jurors who have heard of ramirez and know of his 
outbursts will be asked whether they believe he is guilty and 
whether they can be unbiased 
they will also likely be asked to remember the steamy summer of 
of 1985 when residents of southern california bolted their doors 
and kept their windows closed in fear of the night stalker 
the random killer typically entered homes through unlocked 
doors raped women killed both men and women and stole jewelry and 
other valuables 
at a preliminary hearing for ramirez in 1986 anguished 
witnesses including several women who had been raped told of 
horrific confrontations with the night stalker who invaded their 
homes killed their husbands and demanded they swear to satan 
some murders were ghoulish including one in which the victims 
eyes were gouged out 
the ramirez case has cost los angeles county 128 million in 
court and investigatory fees that doesnt include 15000 a month 
for the defendants private jail cell

two moslems refused to accept a 
total of 513000 in lottery winnings saying their religion bars 
them from taking money from games of chance because that would 
amount to gambling 
rathi ishak general manager of the governmentbacked social 
welfare lottery board told reporters today that a man who won a 
133000 prize in one drawing said he bought the ticket as a 
donation to charity and it would be wrong for him to accept the 
money

jesse jackson officially ended his maverick 
presidential bid wednesday throwing his delegate support to 
michael dukakis in a unity gesture after the massachusetts governor 
clinched the democratic nomination 
jackson watched on television from his hotel suite with his 
family and advisers as delegates to the democratic national 
convention voted in the roll call of states to give dukakis thee 
prize for which the two men had so long competed 
jackson won 12185 votes far more than his 1984 showing but 
still well short of dukakis 287675 nominating majority 
then when the last votes had been counted jacksons campaign 
chairman california assembly speaker willie brown stepped forward 
to move that in the spirit of the jackson campaign and in the 
interests of unity the dukakis nomination be made unanimous 
the motion carried overwhelmingly with a huge chorus of 
ayes and only a smattering of nos from disappointed jackson 
supporters 
jackson had sent word from his hotel that he would dispatch 
brown to urge the convention after the official vote to make the 
nomination of governor dukakis unanimous 
this is the appropriate time for the transition of leadership 
for the fall campaign to take place jackson said 
feelings ran strong among many jackson delegates and several 
from michigan threatened to walk out when dukakis was nominated 
the protest was averted when two dukakis delegates agreed to switch 
their votes to jackson so the michigan delegate count would end in 
a tie according to mayor walter moore of pontiac mich 
jacksons name was placed in nomination by william winpisinger 
president of the international association of machinists who said 
the candidate had ignited the passionate fires of justice in our 
souls 
not since hubert h humphrey has a presidential candidate 
elevated the aspirations of workers and championed their quest for 
worker rights to such heights in the mainstream political 
dialogue he said 
earlier jackson lunched with dukakis at the nomineetobes 
request and also met with democratic stalwarts sen edward m 
kennedy of massachusetts and new york gov mario cuomo to talk he 
said about helping the democrats win 
the dukakisjackson meeting the second in three days lasted 
about 30 minutes while senior staff members talked for an 
additional 45 minutes dukakis spokesman dayton duncan said 
they have been foes in the primary jackson said of the 
campaign aides they will be friends in the fall 
he said the session was basically a getacquainted meeting for 
staff and key policy advisers most of whom do not know each other 
but now must work together since we are in the same boat with a 
common objective that is to win in november 
jackson speaking before his name was placed in nomination said 
that moment would be a great feeling personally but really its 
my name put into nomination for the people who voted for me but 
also for the people who made it possible he said after 
addressing a brunch sponsored by the southern christian leadership 
conference 
and so i suggest as historical dream that at one level its 
political because its delegates and votes on another level its 
sociological because its transforming america in many ways on 
another level its theological its fulfilling the prayers of 
people who fought hard 
its a steppingstone for progress for the future 
jackson began the day by finally taking the step that dukakis 
had wanted since early june answering without evasion the 
question of whether he would endorse the massachusetts governor and 
would campaign enthusiastically for the national ticket in the fall 
oh yes i am jackson said on abcs good morning 
america but in some sensethe relationship i will have with 
the campaign must be defined by gov dukakis this is true for 
mario cuomo this is true for ted kennedy this is true for lane 
kirkland 
jackson was both joking and slightly bitter in his speech to the 
sclc as his second try for the white house wound down to an 
unsuccessful conclusion 
and now im running for vice president jackson said 
invoking fears of a challenge to dukakis choice texas sen lloyd 
bentsen of the sclc 
he suggested that his race prevented him from being on the 
national ticket and belittled suggestions he lacked the experience 
for the presidency 
the fact is we are fighting a cultural crisis the fact is if 
any other candidate had campaigned as hard as i did campaigned 
against those odds and achieved as much that person no doubt would 
probably be the nominee or certainly on the ticket jackson said 
on nbc news today show 
he promised to fight on to another campaign as yet undefined 
our charge today is to learn well the lessons from this 
campaign and build upon it the vision for the next campaign learn 
what is possible he told the sclc 
and so it becomes my challenge just as fannie lou hamer had 
to keep knocking and pushing down doors through barriers and just 
as dr king had to do it im still doing it and im determined to 
push those doors down he said i may not get through those 
doors but my children and your children will get through those 
doors and the white house is within reach i am pushing back 
barriers and removing ceilings off of dreams every day i see it as 
my obligation in a real sense now my mission

five more managementlevel employees at 
the three mile island unit 2 nuclear plant have been disciplined as 
the result of an inquiry into frequent sleeping by a control room 
supervisor company officials said wednesday 
the actions by gpu nuclear corp including dismissal of one 
employee stem from conclusions in an independent report issued to 
the company on june 30 the officials said the report said 
managers at the plant did not aggressively investigate allegations 
that a control room shift supervisor was sleeping on duty thus 
indirectly allowing the situation to continue 
the report said managements failure to fully look into the 
allegations as well as accepting denials by the supervisor and 
discounting statements by others led to inaccurate and distorted 
information being passed through tmi management and to the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
they managers didnt get a full picture of what occurred 
the situation festered said gpu spokesman doug bedell 
an earlier report found the sleeping had occurred as early as 
1983 and continued through june 1987 the shift supervisor was 
fired nov 27 after the release of the first report 
the unit 2 reactor site of the nations worst commercial

the nation initially got the wrong vote from the 
iowa delegation wednesday night as democrats nominated michael 
dukakis as their 1988 presidential candidate 
jerry crawford stepped to the microphone to announce that in a 
show of unity he and state sen thomas mann of des moines would 
jointly announce the hawkeye states vote total 
when crawford said the word unity after announcing 49 votes 
for dukakis convention secretary dorothy bush and her assistant 
promptly announced that iowa had cast all 61 of its votes for 
dukakis 
reached by telephone on the convention floor crawford said his 
intention was to have mann announce that jesse jackson had received 
12 votes 
throughout the convention leaders of the iowa delegation have 
credited mann with stressing party unity above loyalty to a single 
candidate 
the iowa delegates phoned the podium immediately after the error 
was made and the delegation was asked to announce its vote a 
second time 
this time the crawfordmann unity announcement was made without 
a hitch

the environmental protection agencys 
12yearold campaign against hazardous waste is not protecting 
public health and the environment a congressional report says 
the broadranging critique by the general accounting office says 
epa has made only limited progress in administering and enforcing 
the 1976 law covering the handling storage and disposal of 
healththreatening wastes 
the report by the gao the investigative arm of congress cites 
a variety of problems including failure to meet congressionally 
set deadlines inadequate resources shifting enforcement 
approaches and lack of information 
epas progress in regulating hazardous wastes that it has 
identified has been limited and not sufficiently comprehensive to 
protect the public and the environment gao concluded 
the report said epa is regulating about 450 materials known to 
be hazardous with only five having been added to the list since 
1980 
still to be controlled are potentially large volumes of 
hazardous wastes but epa has not determined what industries need 
to be reviewed or how long it will take to assess the suspect 
materials according to gao 
we believe epas limited progress has resulted from the 
absence of an overall waste identification goal and a related 
implementation approach that together would focus and assign 
priorities in the program the study said 
the 1976 law the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
was enacted in response to unregulated toxic dumps such as love 
canal near niagara falls ny but gao said the law is not 
preventing new love canals 
the study quotes epa as saying that as many as half the 5000 
storage and disposal sites regulated under rcra may be leaking 
hazardous materials and could require expensive cleanups 
epa has made very little progress in achieving actual cleanups 
or in setting goals for actual cleanups because of other rcra 
program priorities and the complexity involved in identifying the 
extent of contamination and the level of cleanup required gao 
said 
the study said it could take until the year 2025 to clean up the 
regulated rcra sites through an effort rivaling superfund the 
cleanup program that the epa says could spend 227 billion at some 
2500 abandoned dump sites 
the longer epa waits to actually implement corrective action 
at rcra facilities the greater the risk will become that the 
contamination at the leaking facilities will worsen and that a 
number of these facilities will have to be cleaned up under 
superfund gao said 
the report said there has been widespread and persistent 
noncompliance with rcra regulations by both private sector and 
federal facilities with only about half the regulated 
landdisposal sites meeting standards over the past three years 
gao said that while the principal reasons for noncompliance are 
the technical complexity of the regulations and the costs of 
following them ineffective enforcement on the part of epa and 
states has been part of the problem 
compliance inspections have been increasing the report said 
but when gao investigators went out on 26 of them they observed 
inspectors missing almost as many violations as they cited 
in its 1984 reworking of rcra epa was given 76 specific 
deadlines for taking rcra actions by a congress that was unhappy 
with the agencys progress in controlling hazardous wastes 
as of last april 66 of the deadlines had come due with epa 
missing 38 of them said gao 
gao quoted epa as saying the report adequately describes the 
situation and that officials are working to improve the 
administration of the hazardous waste law on a variety of fronts

with six months left for president 
reagan to get conservative nominees confirmed to federal 
judgeships administration officials are mapping strategy to 
overcome what they say is footdragging by the 
democraticcontrolled senate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the matter of 
judicial nominations was high on the list of topics to be discussed 
today by white house aides at a planning session called by the 
presidents chief of staff kenneth duberstein 
were talking about judgeships and getting our nominees 
confirmed fitzwater told reporters wednesday 
the presidents term will end next jan 20 already according 
to many legal scholars he has named enough judges to life terms on 
federal district and circuit courts to put his conservative stamp 
on the judiciary for many years 
justice department spokesman patrick korten however said the 
administration is concerned about inaction in the senate on pending 
nominations korten said there are 26 judicial nominations awaiting 
senate action 20 of them for district judgeships and six for 
positions on the circuit courts of appeal 
the absence of even one circuit judge on a circuit that only 
has 12 can put a crimp in their ability to handle the workload 
korten said in a telephone interview from washington 
there hasnt been any action on capitol hill for many 
months korten said they have been dragging their feet 
by delaying action on nominations in the closing months of the 
administration the democrats who control the senate could give 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis a chance to make 
the appointments in the event of his election 
jane verman bourgeois spokeswoman for the judiciary committee 
failed to respond to repeated telephone calls seeking comment on 
the meeting and kortens statements 
all federal judicial nominations are subject to confirmation by 
the senate after first being screened by the senate judiciary 
committee 
deputy white house press secretary bj cooper said he did not 
know what strategy duberstein and the white house aides would be 
discussing to push for action on the backlog of nominations 
fitzwater said the judicial nominee situation was one of several 
items to be discussed at todays meeting 
its to go over themes agenda schedule budget those kinds 
of internal matters he said well have a review of all the 
legislation thats now on the hill and what the administrations 
position is 
well talk about any speeches or trips by the president and 
what kind of themes we want or we recommend that be discussed in 
those appearances the spokesman said 
he said duberstein had talked extensively with the president 
about his plans for the election campaign and the final months of 
his administration before reagan came west to vacation at his 
mountaintop ranch north of santa barbara 
fitzwater said the president has talked about a schedule of two 
campaign appearances a week after september he also said two 
political fundraising appearances are planned in los angeles 
during another california vacation that the president plans for 
next month 
when asked whether the president had watched any of the 
democratic national convention on television at the ranch 
fitzwater said i know he was going to watch parts of it my 
guess is he did but i dont really know 
on wednesday reagan signed an 18 billion energy and water 
development appropriations bill that he said reached his desk 
earlier than any other appropriations bill since he became 
president he urged congres to swiftly complete work on the 
remaining 12 appropriations bills for fiscal 1989

underwriters laboratories inc enjoys a 
taxexempt status that is unfair to its competitors and congress 
should take away this special benefit the director of the american 
council of independent laboratories says 
joseph oneil executive director of the council said wednesday 
a 1954 law gave underwriters laboratories the status of a 
nonprofit organization even though the famed research institute 
competes with hundreds of independent testing laboratories that 
must pay taxes 
this is an egregious example of abuse of the nonprofit tax 
status oneil said he said ul is making millions of dollars in 
profits while enjoying an unfair competitive advantage over other 
testing laboratories 
underwriter laboratories spokeswoman sharon dalton said the 
illinois company last year had revenues of 159 million but that 
it does not regard any of this as profit 
she said ul spent about 10 million on nonrevenueproducing 
activities that are for public safety 
ul said ms dalton has developed 541 safety standards 
provides expertise to 620 committees developing safety standards 
and assists several government agencies in developing safety 
standards and documents all of this work she said is done free 
of charge 
it would be difficult to perform these things at the level 
that we do now without the taxexempt status she said money 
earned by ul in testing commercial products said ms dalton is 
plowed back into public interest testing dollar for dollar 
testing laboratories are used by manufacturers to determine if 
their products are safe the products tested by such laboratories 
range from electrical appliances to cosmetics ul is most famous 
for developing testing standards for electrical appliances and 
installations that are used throughout the industry 
oneil said ul organized in 1894 and headquartered in 
northbrook ill originally operated as a nonprofit organization 
he said that in 1935 however the internal revenue service revoked 
the taxexempt status for ul when it was shown that the laboratory 
was conducting commercial testing 
ul appealed the ruling but a federal courts decision supported 
the irs and the laboratory lost its taxfavored status the 
illinois firms tax exempt status was restored oneil said when 
congress abruptly changed the rules in 1954 by adopting a bill 
that granted taxexempt status to laboratories that are testing 
for the public safety 
since then oneil said ul has enjoyed a significant 
advantage and now is moving into a number of testing fields that 
threaten the continuing existence of many independent testing 
laboratories 
all were asking for is a level playing field oneil said 
the american council of independent laboratories is the trade 
association of independent forprofit testing labs oneil said 
it has 370 member firms that operate about 1000 laboratories

farmers collectively may wind up with about as 
much cash income in 1988 as last years record level according to 
agriculture department economists 
some farmers have been hit hard by drought while others were 
only nudged or escaped altogether those are the farmers who were 
able to take advantage of higher commodity prices 
the result is a greater income disparity than usual among 
farmers and from one production region to another depending on 
where the rain fell and when 
although little overall change is expected in income regional 
disruptions are arising because income differs sharply among 
individual farmers from what it would have been with normal 
weather the departments economic research service said 
wednesday 
smaller droughtwithered crops and a sharp drawdown of grain 
held in storage have boosted commodity prices usually by more 
than enough to offset reduced yields the report said 
this years cash receipts from sales are up because of 
higher crop values and sales from past years crops in storage at 
droughtincreased prices the report said however farmers hit 
hardest by the weather are expected to have much lower receipts 
officials said the rise in commodity prices may boost farmers 
gross cash income nationally to a range of 162 billion to 167 
billion in 1988 about 4 billion higher than projected last month 
nationally the gross was about 159 billion in 1987 
gross cash income includes proceeds from marketings and direct 
government payments when cash expenses are deducted what is left 
is called net cash income which was projected at 53 billion to 
59 billion for 1988 compared with the record of 56 billion in 
1987 
the agency also computes net farm income to include 
allowances for the value of goods consumed at home dwellings and 
changes in the value of inventories held by farmers 
on that basis this years net farm income could be in the range 
of 40 billion to 45 billion down from 42 billion to 48 billion 
forecast in june net farm income in 1987 was 46 billion 
officials said the decline 1 billion to 6 billion from last 
year reflects the drop in 1988 production 
direct government payments to farmers including deficiency 
payments to crop producers are expected to decline this year to a 
range of 11 billion to 13 billion from a record of 17 billion 
in 1987 said economist richard kodl the higher market prices are 
trimming the subsidies 
but the biggest reduction will come in calendar 1989 kodl said 
that is because most of the payments for 1988 crops will go to 
farmers next year after usda does the bookkeeping on how much will 
be due 
the report also said 
drought has hurt nonirrigated fruits and vegetables 
especially dry edible beans tart cherries green peas sweet corn 
and snap beans for canning fresh vegetable production tends to be 
irrigated and has survived relatively well 
pasture and range conditions as of july 1 were the worst since 
records began in 1921 farmers have had to sell some breeding stock 
from pastures and the increased need to supplemental feeding has 
driven up the price of hay 
as a result of herd culling meat supplies are increasing and 
prices received for livestock are dropping but increased sales and 
higher prices for poultry and eggs are maintaining livestock cash 
receipts higher feed costs however may push livestock operations 
from profit to loss in the second half of the year

the wife of exiled russian novelist alexander 
i solzhenitsyn is emphatically denying reports that kremlin 
officials have invited her husband to return to his homeland 
saying someone is playing a game on us 
natalya solzhenitsyn in a rare interview wednesday told the 
associated press it is too early to speculate on whether soviet 
authorities will invite him back after 14 years in exile or publish 
his books as was reported 
someone is playing a game on us she said by telephone from 
their home in rural vermont we never received any telephone call 
or letter from soviet officials about publishing his books there or 
about us returning to the soviet union 
mrs solzhenitsyn also said her husband was making no public 
comment on the reforms of kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
solzhenitsyn who will turn 70 on dec 11 has maintained a 
public silence since 1983 two years before gorbachev rose to power 
he stopped speaking publicly five years ago because of his 
literary work mrs solzhenitsyn said he made a decision to 
devote full efforts to literary tasks it is hard to be both a 
public and a literary figure 
asked whether they hoped that soviet authorities would publish 
his books or invite the family to return home mrs solzhenitsyn 
said in my opinion it is not proper to answer a question that 
has not been asked it is not time to speculate 
in 1962 under the reforms of soviet leader nikita khrushchev 
the literary magazine novy mir published one of solzhenitsyns 
novels a day in the life of ivan denisovich a grim chronicle 
of life in a soviet prison camp the book was based on 
solzhenitsyns own camp term the theme that has dominated his work 
khrushchev was ousted in 1964 the thaw ended and 
solzhenitsyns works were banned in the soviet union 
they were smuggled to the west and published however winning 
solzhenitsyn the nobel prize for literature in 1970 he did not 
leave the soviet union to collect the award for fear his return 
would be blocked 
solzhenitsyn was exiled in 1974 following publication in the 
west of the gulag archipelago a multivolume chronicle of the 
prison camps or gulags which he said stretched like a hidden 
chain of islands across the soviet union 
although soviet authorities are now rewriting official histories 
to mention for the first time the millions of people who suffered 
and died under kremlin dictator josef stalin solzhenitsyns works 
still are banned in part because he was harshly critical of 
vladimir lenin revered as the founder of the soviet state 
the appearance of many soviet works critical of stalin has 
prompted wide speculation and persistent news reports that 
kremlin officials would allow publication of solzhenitsyns works 
last month sergei p zalygin the current editor of novy 
mir told reporters he was negotiating with solzhenitsyn to 
publish his novel cancer ward in the soviet union 
mrs solzhenitsyn denied the report up to now we never 
received any communication from soviet authorities on the 
publication of any of his books 
the only letter we ever received from soviet officials was in 
1976 a letter from the soviet embassy in washington informing me 
that i was being deprived of my soviet citzenship because of my 
activities she said my husband has received nothing 
she also denied a report by a bavarian radio station quoting her 
husband as saying he had received two letters from gorbachev 
the station bayerischer rundfunk based in munich reported 
last friday that solzhenitsyn had accepted an invitation from 
gorbachev and that his books would be published there at the time 
solzhenitsyn issued a statement denying the report 
mrs solzhenitsyn became a us citizen in 1985 soviet 
authorities also revoked her husbands citizenship and he has not 
become the citizen of any other country

rep mario biaggis reelection campaign has 
gone into debt as the new york democrat convicted of taking an 
illegal gratuity and under indictment on additional charges 
continues to use campaign dollars to pay his legal fees 
according to biaggis latest report to the federal election 
commission the 10term congressman paid his lawyers 130000 from 
the campaign treasury between april 1 and june 30 1988 in all 
biaggi has spent about 496000 from his campaign coffers on 
lawyers since 1986 when his legal troubles began 
the campaign began the quarter with 37160 on hand and 
collected 16500 in donations from four political action 
committees representing labor unions but because of expenditures 
including the legal fees the campaign wound up the quarter with a 
17872 cash deficit and a 70000 debt representing personal 
loans biaggi made to his campaign during the quarter 
biaggi also has a separate defense fund but his spokesman bob 
blancato has declined to make public its cash flow blancato has 
estimated that biaggis defense ultimately could cost about 1 
million 
the congressman has been on trial for the last four months in 
the wedtech scandal in which he and six others are accused of 
turning the bronx ny military contractor into a racketeering 
enterprise the jury heard closing arguments in the trial wednesday 
in another federal trial biaggi was convicted last year of 
accepting an illegal gratuity in the form of a paid florida 
vacation he was sentenced to 2 years in prison and a 500000 
fine but is free pending appeal 
biaggis two democratic opponents bronx assemblyman eliot 
engel and vincent marchiselli have filed challenges to his 
nominating petitions and biaggi in return has challenged their 
petitions to gain access to the september primary ballot 
the grounds are just general right now but each man has six 
days from the challenge date to specify what he believes is wrong 
with the others petitions state board of elections spokesman

the united states and soviet union are 
expected to sign an agreement this year to cooperate in the war 
against drugs a senior administration official says 
the soviets have started to recognize the problem and the war 
in afghanistan has something to do with it said david l 
westrate head of operations for the drug enforcement 
administration the lead us organization in combating drugs 
john c lawn administrator of the dea and ann b wrobleski an 
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters 
discussed possible areas of cooperation with soviet officials 
during an april 2730 trip to moscow westrate said in an interview 
wednesday 
discussions are continuing and the two sides are expected to 
sign a formal agreement in several months although the exact date 
and place have not been decided he said 
the development is significant because for years the soviets 
denied they had a drug problem the greater openness under kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and the exposure of red army troops to 
hashish and opium in afghanistan have changed that 
the benefits of the agreement to the united states are not 
clear said westrate but the fact that they want to be in the 
international community in this field is important 
you have to be able to pursue these cases beyond your own 
borders he said there is also symbolic value for other 
countries that they should be assisting as well 
lawn and wrobleski met in moscow with officials from the 
interior ministry which supervises national law enforcement the 
foreign ministry the customs service and the procurators office 
which prosecutes cases 
westrate said the proposed agreement will cover at least four 
points 
exchanging information on drug trafficking and drug routes 
exchanging drug samples analysts can determine the region or 
nation in which a drug originated using a chemical signature unique 
to the substance 
training soviet officials expressed interest in learning some 
of the techniques dea agents use in fighting the drug trade 
exchanging data on precursor chemicals such as ether used 
to process cocaine and acetic anhydride used to process heroin 
the soviets told us officials that their main drug problems 
were hashish and opiates apparently smuggled in from afghanistan 
along with diverted pharmaceuticals and substances made in 
clandestine laboratories said westrate 
drug dependence has grown at a rate of 50 percent a year in the 
soviet union the officials told lawn and wrobleski with an 
estimated 150000 to 200000 heavy users of those 60 percent were 
estimated to be under 30 years old 
of those whose who were dependent on drugs 45 percent used 
cannabis mostly hashish 35 percent used opiates such as heroin 
and 20 percent used pharmaceuticals dea officials said 
the soviet drug problem is not rated as serious as that in the 
united states where the dea estimates there are 18 million 
marijuana smokers 11 million cocaine users and 500000 heroin 
addicts 
us officials also have worked out a cooperative arrangement 
with the peoples republic of china earlier this year chinese 
help led to major arrests and the disruption of a heroin smuggling 
ring linking hong kong san francisco and the chinese port of 
shanghai

retired marine lt col oliver north is asking 
that his irancontra conspiracy trial be delayed six months until 
march because of this years presidential election 
north a former white house aide is scheduled to go on trial 
sept 20 as the first of four defendants charged by the government 
with various offenses including conspiracy to illegally divert 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
no fairminded person could argue that this trial should be 
started seven weeks prior to the presidential election norths 
attorney barry s simon said in a brief filed in federal court 
wednesday the intense publicity generated during the final seven 
weeks of a presidential campaign would deny north a fair trial 
simon said the impact of the publicity on the jury would be 
particularly crucial because us district judge gerhard a gesell 
the presiding judge has refused to sequester the jury 
because the conduct at issue in this case is also a key issue 
in the campaign the testimony of key administration officials 
and the impact of that testimony on the election is certain to 
generate intense media scrutiny and commentary beyond anything seen 
before the motion said 
earlier wednesday north two other irancontra defendants and 
the american civil liberties union asked the us court of appeals 
to order the dismissal of charges against the three men because 
their immunized testimony before congress will be used against them 
at trial 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
businessman albert hakim along with the aclu filed briefs in 
which they said the use of the compelled testimony would violate 
the fifth amendment prohibition against being a witness against 
oneself 
at the minimum they said the appellate court should order 
gesell to hold a pretrial hearing to give them an opportunity to

the environmental protection agency is asking 
the public to help decide what are acceptable environmental risks 
and how far such risks should be reduced if many jobs could be lost 
a related question is how much should the risks people face 
depend on where they live 
the agency is asking the questions for benzene one of the 
nations most important chemicals with nearly 12 billion pounds 
sold annually for making gasoline rubber plastics fibers and 
many other chemicals 
benzene causes slightly more than an estimated three cases of 
leukemia a year among people living near chemical plants 
regulatory strategies being subjected to public comment would 
reduce that to one case every other year one case every 550 years 
or something in between 
far more than three leukemias a form of blood cancer are at 
issue the answers will be used to regulate dozens of other 
hazardous air pollutants epa estimates could cause 2000 cancers a 
year 
roughly half the population breathes industrialsource benzene 
almost all in tiny amounts those actually at risk are the very 
small numbers of people living close to sources such as coke ovens 
refineries and other plants 
some 240000 workers are covered by the occupational safety and 
health administration which permits much higher risks 
epa is under court order to revise its benzene regulations by 
december the order requires an initial determination of what is an 
acceptable risk ignoring cost and feasibility then a 
determination of what the statutorily required adequate margin of 
safety should be taking into account cost and feasibility 
the strictest of the agencys four possible approaches could 
mean 131 plants could close throwing 30000 to 40000 people out 
of work similarly 44 coke byproduct plants might close with the 
loss of 7000 jobs 
meeting with reporters wednesday epa administrator lee m 
thomas said when you make that first decision acceptable risk 
depending on how you make it you may have dramatic consequences 
in plant closings and job loss its very difficult not to take 
them into account 
i dont accept the inevitability of plant closings thomas 
said because the agency has not considered and wants comment on 
the extent to which it can get companies to develop new 
technologies in response to tougher new standards 
existing or planned regulations would control 90 percent to 95 
percent of emissions in question and its that remaining 5 
percent that is really where the debate is he said 
thomas said he decided that before deciding on a riskreducing 
approach the issues should be laid out much more thoroughly and 
we needed a public process including a washington public hearing 
sept 1 
risks permitted by government vary widely epa generally has 
tried to reduce lifetime risks of cancer when they are one in 
10000 or larger and has tended to ignore risks of one in a 
million or less 
maximum permitted workplace exposure to benzene means a one in 
100 chance of leukemia according to osha 
the average risk of dying in an auto accident is about one in 
100 the risk of cancer at sea level from natural background 
radiation is about one in 1000 a womans risk of breast cancer is 
about one in 10

a consumer health group is criticizing the 
food and drug administration for proposing to allow continued use 
of sulfites which the group says can make food deadly to more than 
a million americans 
an unpublished memo from fda commissioner frank e young rejects 
proposals to outlaw the preservative chemicals in foods not now 
covered by a limited ban and to require labeling of 
sulfitecontaining foods served in restaurants 
the memo to health and human services director otis bowen 
obtained by the associated press on wednesday proposes to keep 
sulfites in the category gras or generally recognized as 
safe a ban on their use on fresh fruits and vegetables would 
remain in effect and a further ban applying to previously exempted 
fresh potatoes is expected by the end of the year 
the partial ban went into effect in 1986 primarily to prevent 
the use of sulfites in salad bars where it was used to keep 
lettuce crisp and to make other vegetables and fruit look fresher 
youngs memo said that a 1987 sulfite labeling requirement for 
some packaged foods would be extended to additional items but they 
would not include dehydrated or frozen potatoes which would remain 
exempt 
the chemicals which have been used in foods for decades and 
more recently in some drugs to protect their potency are 
considered harmless to most people 
the center for science in the public interest or cspi said 
wednesday that the fdas position endangers up to a million 
asthmatics and others who have severe reactions to sulfites 
including the possibility of death within hours after ingesting 
food containing the chemicals 
the center a privately funded consumer health group says 
sulfites have caused comas brain damage and at least five deaths 
mitch zeller staff attorney for the consumer group predicted 
that the fdas position would be approved by the department of 
health and human services saying it does so little and bends 
over backwards to placate the food industry 
the memo asks for action on the proposed regulations by july 30 
youngs memo which fda spokesman chris lecos said was not meant 
to be made public until the proposed regulations are approved 
acknowledges that many new uses have been found for sulfites and 
that a significant number of individuals have experienced 
severe allergictype responses 
other fda officials have estimated that sulfites are dangerous 
to about 10 percent of the 10 million people in the united states 
with asthma and to a small number of nonasthmatics according to 
lecos 
but the fda maintains the reaction is essentially allergic and 
does not justify an allout ban of the chemicals in food or drugs 
the memo says the available safety data does not support a 
complete ban or an extension to foods other than those already 
covered except for fresh potatoes 
restaurant labeling would be labor intensive and difficult to 
enforce the memo says adding that it would require regular 
inspection of over 500000 eating establishments 
lecos said the fda had no comment on the memo other officials 
acknowledged the existence of the memo and proposed regulations but 
said it was not for public release the ap obtained a copy from a 
source outside the agency

with jesse jackson still in his hotel suite 
california assembly speaker willie brown took on the ritual role of 
asking the democratic party to unify behind its presidential 
nominee wednesday night 
brown the national chairman of jesse jacksons presidential 
campaign told the cheering crowd that he had just talked to 
jackson and that jackson had asked him to make the nomination of 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis unanimous 
brown did not miss a chance however to point out that jackson 
won more votes than any other runnerup in history 
brown said he had received a telephone call from jackson asking 
him to move acclamation just five minutes before he took the 
action and that jackson was laughing and joking in the phone call 
he simply said please make it by acclamation at my request 
and do it with the same appropriate sensitivity as weve attempted 
to conduct ourselves with during the campaign brown said 
the convention agreed to the motion with only barely heard 
dissenting votes

indifference smug selfsatisfaction and meanness that too long has 
masked the heartbeat of america who has ignited the passionate 
fires of justice in our souls as no other contemporary has the man 
who has dared sound our call to greatness

issues into public view and the political dialogue

the reagan administration is objecting to the 
strings the soviets attached to their offer to dismantle the 
disputed krasnoyarsk radar complex in siberia 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley on wednesday said 
the soviet union should meet its obligations under the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty by agreeing to scrap the facility 
without delay and without conditions 
on tuesday viktor p karpov the soviet foreign ministrys top 
arms control specialist said the soviets would dismantle the radar 
complex if the two governments resolved their differences over the 
abm accord 
if an understanding to abide by the abm treaty as signed in 
1972 is reached the soviet union will be ready to dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on 
the part of the united states karpov said 
in santa barbara calif white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the krasnoyarsk facility should be dismantled without any 
strings attached 
the fact is that we have long said the krasnoyarsk radar is a 
violation of the abm treaty and should be dismantled he said 
we welcome their remarks in the sense that they do acknowledge 
that it is a violation of the abm treaty and in that 
acknowledgement we believe ought to be recognition that it should 
be torn down but no strings and no deals 
karpovs offer seemed to be a soviet concession since the 
soviets previously had insisted on disrupting us plans to upgrade 
radars in britain and greenland that moscow had questioned 
mrs oakley said krasnoyarsk would be one of the central topics 
of the review of the treaty the two sides are obliged to hold by 
october we are concerned about a variety of soviet abmrelated 
activities that suggest the ussr may be preparing a territorial 
defense mrs oakley said 
the treaty constrains us and soviet antimissile defenses on 
the theory the prospect of devastating retaliation might deter a 
potential aggressor 
reagan contends the steps taken so far by the united states to 
develop a shield against soviet rockets the socalled star wars 
defense are consistent even with a broad interpretation of 
the treaty but critics say he may be preparing to abort it before 
he leaves office next january 
james p rubin research director of the private arms control 
association said the soviet offer to dismantle krasnoyarsk 
appears to be eminently reasonable he said as long as the 
administration clings to its illegal reinterpretation of the abm 
treaty the us demand that krasnoyarsk be dismantled will have a 
hollow ring to it 
rubin said krasnoyarsk was in violation of the treaty but its 
military significance was small if the united states proceeds to 
declare krasnoyarsk a material breach of the treaty it will be 
clear to all they are seeking to scuttle the treaty he said 
the national campaign to save the abm treaty a coalition of 
former us negotiators and other private citizens said us 
security interests dictate that the two nations discuss radar 
compliance generally and seek a negotiated solution to the 
krasnoyarsk violation before the administration takes the drastic 
step of charging a material breach 
while reagan charged in two reports to congress that krasnoyarsk 
violates the 1972 accord he has not decided whether to declare it 
a material breach that is a legal step that could permit the 
united states to breach other provisions of the treaty which is 
considered a bedrock of arms control efforts

universal pictures says a 10 million offer to 
buy the controversial film the last temptation of christ so it 
can be destroyed is a threat to constitutional rights 
in a fullpage advertisement in thursdays editions of the new 
york times the washington post and the los angeles times the 
studio rejected the offer by bill bright founderpresident of san 
bernardino califbased campus crusade for christ 
while we understand the deep feelings and convictions which 
have prompted this offer we believe that to accept it would 
threaten the fundamental freedoms of religion and expression 
promised to all americans under our constitution said the 
advertisement which was in the form of a letter to bright 
in the united states no one sect or coalition has the power 
to set boundaries around each persons freedom to explore religious 
and philosophical questions whether through speech books or 
film the ad said 
these freedoms protect all of us they are precious they are 
not for sale 
bright offered to reimburse the studios estimated 10 million 
expenditure on the movie if universal turns over all copies of the 
film so they can be destroyed 
the studio says the last temptation of christ is a look at 
the human side of jesus the movie is directed by martin scorsese 
who once studied for the priesthood and stars willem dafoe as 
jesus barbara hershey as mary magdalene and harvey keitel as judas 
iscariot 
in a dream sequence jesus comes down off the cross and has a 
sexual relationship with mary magdelene 
in its advertisement universal said only in totalitarian 
states are all people forced to accept one version of truth in any 
case martin scorsese has stated clearly that his film is a work of 
fiction and that it is based on a novel not the gospels 
it makes no claim whatsoever to be any more than a reflection 
of his own personal exploration 
the advertisement said bright did not attend a july 12 screening 
in new york for religious leaders 
it said many leaders were not offended by the film and even 
felt that it could be a tool for fruitful discussion

a former nun whose family abducted her last 
month from a renegade new york convent says she was brainwashed 
there and is grateful to be home 
brainwashing is an information disease said mary susan 
greve the former sister mary cecelia its when you dont have 
information you dont have the whole picture 
thats why i can say i was happy at the convent i only had 
their side of the story and now i am happy to be back home 
happier than i was because i have the whole picture 
ms greve 22 of cincinnati was dragged by her family from the 
st joseph novitiate convent in roundtop ny on june 26 
in an interview published in wednesdays editions of the 
cincinnati post ms greve said she was sometimes unhappy after 
entering the convent in september 1986 in her second year as a 
nun she felt more comfortable but was then pressured when 
relations deteriorated between her family and the convents 
spiritual leader the rev clarence kelly 
members of her family were longtime followers of kelly but they 
became disturbed at his conservative practices which were not 
sanctioned by the roman catholic church in rome and left his 
congregation 
kelly has maintained ms greve was brainwashed by her family 
into believing the convent was a cult the church however has 
said little since new york police dropped charges against the 
family 
im not going to go back to a convent ms greve said she 
maintains her faith saying what people dont understand is that 
the catholic faith is a way of life and that is how i plan to live 
my life 
she wants to finish college to get the teaching degree she left 
halfcompleted when she joined the convent 
the traditional religious order at the convent follows the 
teachings of the roman catholic church before vatican ii which 
gave bishops a greater influence in church affairs gave the laity 
a more active part in the liturgy and liberalized church positions 
with regard to noncatholic and nonchristian faiths 
on tuesday she taped an interview for the phil donahue 
show the show televised wednesday pitted her her mother 
susan and her brother david against kelly 
she sat quietly during the show but spoke up when questioned 
and interrupted at the shows end to make her point

a federal judge who refused to order the 
release of documents related to the probe of alleged fraud on 
pentagon defense contracts said public disclosure of the 
information would harm the process of the investigation 
us district judge claude a hilton on wednesday rejected a 
motion by the washington times to unseal the affidavits that 
triggered judicial authorization of dozens of searches by federal 
agents around the country on june 14 
the governments investigation centers around allegations that 
defense contractors and private defense consultants many of them 
former pentagon employees bribed defense department employees for 
inside information considered crucial to winning 
multimilliondollar contracts 
representing the newspaper jerome barron told hilton that the 
massive publicity already sought by the government in the middle of 
june has put all defense contractors under a cloud 
he said the best way to clear the air is to reveal what 
information the government has barron also argued that release of 
information could permit corrective action to be undertaken 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica prevailed in his argument 
that release of the material could tip off prospective defendants 
and lead to destruction of property not yet obtained by 
investigators 
there have been no charges filed no indictments the 
government is in the middle of a grand jury he told hilton 
hilton agreed saying it seems to me that release of this 
information now would harm the process 
while conceding the case has great public interest aronica said 
theres a greater public interest and that is that this 
investigation move forward with diligence and dispatch 
barron said he didnt know if hiltons ruling would be appealed

secondhand knowledge of attacks on him by a succession of speakers 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
bush said hed neither watched nor listened to any part of the 
democratic convention while on the fishing trip in wyoming 
however aides said bush watched the convention briefly wednesday

desperation

george a reference mostly to the vice presidents efforts to 
disassociate himself from some of the reagan administrations major 
problems bush responded four days in the wilderness is the 
answer 
i dont want to be cute with you but ive been out of contact 
for four nights and three days he told reporters 
we stayed in the same tent we caught a lot of fish we 
went to bed early and had a minimal discussion of politics he

sight for four days on his fishing trip bush said he did not think 
his activities would upstage the democrats

a quarterounce wad of chewing tobacco kept 
in the mouth half an hour produces about as much nicotine in the 
bloodstream as smoking three cigarettes a university of california 
researcher reported 
dr neal l benowitz a uc professor of medicine and chief of 
pharmacology at san francisco general hospital said his study may 
even underestimate the amount of nicotine absorbed in the 
bloodstream because some users of chewing tobacco and snuff keep it 
in their mouths for hours 
a halfounce chunk of tobacco kept in the mouth for an hour or 
so could cause as much absorption of nicotine as eight to nine 
cigarettes benowitz said wednesday 
his report is based on measurements of smokeless tobacco made 
during a fourday study involving 10 volunteers it is being 
published in the july issue of the clinical phamacology and 
therapeutics journal 
nicotine is the most addictive chemical in tobacco and has been 
linked to such health dangers as increased blood pressure and heart 
rate as well as damage of blood vessel walls

wyoming firefighters battling a nearly 15000acre blaze two 
miles from yellowstone national park gathered equipment to create 
an artificial rain storm wednesday to keep the fire from jumping 
lines while california firefighters struggled with two blazes 
believed started by arson 
fires also raged on in alaska colorado and utah 
in wyoming the fire had consumed at least 14857 acres of 
bridgerteton national forests teton wilderness and officials 
expected it to cross into the park in the next few days 
spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said if the fire does cross over onto 
park land it will not be fought because of the parks policy of 
letting natural fires burn 
we havent even set a date or estimation for containment or 
control said forest spokesman doug huntington 
the more than 600 firefighters have made inroads but the 
behavior of the fire is running them ragged especially in the 
blowdown areas of downed timber on the fires southern edge 
around enos lake said dale jarrell the incident commander 
officials were hoping on thursday to start up a sprinkler system 
with marine pumps and hoses to moisten the yellowstone meadows on 
the border of yellowstone national park and some 2 miles from the 
flames said fire information officer ed waldapfel 
yellowstone officials already were monitoring a halfdozen 
smaller fires covering more than 15000 acres scattered throughout 
the park 
while all of yellowstones roads and front country campsites 
were open camping restrictions were imposed throughout the 
backcountry and some backcountry campsites were closed 
two blazes in northern californias calaveras county had burned 
at least 9000 acres by wednesday evening forestry officials said 
the fires on tuesday destroyed at least three houses a mobile 
home and other structures worth about 500000 california 
department of forestry spokesman robert watson said at the fire 
camp in railroad flat officials said they suspect arson although 
they have not found any incendiary devices the blazes erupted at 
about the same time and followed arson fires set in the area monday 
crews plan to dig 13 miles of control lines that will allow the 
fires to burn at least 16000 acres said chief state fire 
spokeswoman karen terrill the blazes were about 40 percent 
contained by evening 
although the two fires are separate crews are treating them as 
one in their strategy they are burning southeast toward the 
mountain resort community of arnold on highway 4 the town of 
sheep ranch and scattered homes and subdivisions the area is 
about 150 miles east of san francisco in the sierra nevada 
rugged terrain gusting winds and heavy smoke hindered 
firefighters who got a slight respite from the 100plus degree 
weather of previous days when temperatures eased into the mid90s 
elsewhere in the state a 4700acre fire in los padres national

a federal judge says america was 
sending a signal to drug traffickers when he sentenced carlos 
lehder rivas to life imprisonment without parole for smuggling tons 
of cocaine into the united states 
cocaine is viewed as a national tragedy in this country 
us district judge howell w melton told the colombian drug dealer 
wednesday those who profit from this are the worst kinds of 
offenders 
the harsh sentence life plus 135 years in prison and fines 
totaling 350000 was a signal of our society that it will 
strongly punish those fueling this cancer of drugs melton said 
the judge also said lehders criminal motivation was greed 
adding that he showed no concern for the destruction of others 
there was no visible reaction from lehder who wore a gray 
business suit 
lehder 38 a reputed leader of colombias violent medellin 
cartel was sentenced for smuggling 33 tons of cocaine from his 
homeland via the bahamas to rural airstrips in florida and georgia 
he was convicted on 11 counts of conspiracy importation of 
cocaine and possession with intent to distribute melton also 
ordered the confiscation of lehders possessions in the bahamas 
three homes an airstrip hotel condominium and marina 
the seizure is in dispute with the bahamian government 
contending the united states has no right to the property and that 
it intended to assume possession 
lehder contended he had been a hostage to prosecutor robert 
merkle who resigned as us attorney for central florida shortly 
after the sevenmonth trial to run for the republican us senate 
nomination 
lehder claimed merkle used him as a symbol of evil to generate 
free publicity for his senate campaign 
he charged he had been kidnapped and illegally brought to the 
united states because he had been a political leader in colombia 
working to overthrow the uscolombia extradition treaty 
outside the courtroom merkles replacement us attorney joe 
magri dismissed lehders allegations 
he said the judge had fairly justly and appropriately socked 
it to a hoodlum 
the heavy sentence sends a clear message that were serious 
about stopping narcotics traffic magri said calling lehder a 
cocaine narcoterrorist 
the defendant who said he had dual citizenship in the united 
states and colombia asked melton to deport him to colombia or 
germany 
defense attorneys edward shohat and jose quinon had asked the 
judge to impose a 20year sentence at most which they said would 
be four times longer than the terms being served by the smugglers 
who testified against lehder 
they said lehder would appeal the conviction and sentence 
after listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections 
from lehders attorneys to presentence reports melton told the 
defendant that the government had presented monumental amounts of 
incriminating evidence against you 
testimony during the lengthy trial alleged that bahamian 
officials including prime minister lynden o pindling helped 
lehders drug ring smuggle more than 20 tons of cocaine into the 
united states 
pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations 
lehder was arrested and extradited to the united states last 
year after a gunbattle at his mansion in medellin 
he also is under indictment in miami for his role in the cartel 
and there is a sealed indictment against him in los angeles but 
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on 
those charges 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif a 
pilot in the drugsmuggling ring stood silently earlier in the day 
as he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined 25000 for his 
conviction on a single conspiracy count government witnesses had 
testified that he ferried 2500 pounds of cocaine on at least seven 
flights from the bahamas

the united states and japan have reached 
agreement on a pact to end or relax japanese import quotas on 
various us processed food products 
under the accord japan will end quotas on seven food categories 
by april 1 1990 and partially lift quotas to substantially 
increase access or provide compensation on four other categories 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said late wednesday 
the pact is a further example that with persistence and 
perseverance the united states can open markets abroad for our 
products 
i am pleased that we were able to finally reach an 
agreement to implement the report of gatt the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade which ruled that japans quotas were illegal 
under international trading rules he said 
this sets a precedent for other pending cases we have before 
the gatt in which the united states is denied access to foreign 
agricultural markets 
the japanese embassy said full agreement was reached wednesday 
after a final threeday round of negotiations between yeutters 
office and a delegation from tokyos ministry of agriculture and 
fisheries 
it ends a dispute spawned by a 1986 us complaint against 
quotas in 12 categories of processed foods 
after japan blocked the formation of a panel of inquiry twice a 
panel report last november found the quotas on 10 categories were 
illegal by gatt standards 
the report adopted by the gatt council on feb 2 allowed japan 
to continue its import restrictions on two categories peanuts 
and dried peas and beans if the quotas were increased in other 
areas 
yeutter said he expected last years 480 million in us 
exports to japan to double by the end of the threeyear settlement 
period with unlimited export potential throughout the next decade

american soldiers exchanged gunfire 
with intruders this week at the same fuel storage depot where 
similar shooting occurred in april the us southern command said 
no one was reported injured in the tuesday afternoon and evening 
firefights at the arraijan tank farm near howard air force base 
the command said in a statement wednesday 
it said there have been several intrusions since the beginning 
of june 
the statement said a marine patrol encountered two armed 
intruders at 3 pm tuesday outside the tank farm 
the intruders failed to heed an order to stop and fled into 
dense jungle when a marine fired shots into the air the southern 
command said 
five hours later a group of marines patrolling the eastern side 
of the fuel depot ran into six intruders two of whom were wearing 
night vision devices the statement said 
the group began encircling the marines who determined the 
maneuver was hostile and opened fire the intruders returned 
fire the statement said 
the marines and intruders exchanged another round of gunfire 
before the group stopped firing and fled it said 
the command said the shooting incidents each lasted only 
several minutes in their totality in the span of about an hour 
the statement did not speculate on the intruders identities 
an initial search of the area only revealed footprints and 
authorities were conducting a more detailed investigation it 
said 
the 807acre fuel storage depot is in a hilly jungled area 
about five miles west of panama city and about 1 miles west of 
howard air base 
in april the southern command contended there were four 
intrusions at the depot by what one spokesman called highly 
trained professionals 
a marine sentry was killed april 11 when fellow guards 
accidentally shot him as they were investigating the first of the 
alleged intrusions by what the command described as eight men in 
dark uniforms 
neither the panamanian government nor its defense forces had any 
immediate comment on tuesdays incidents 
in april they ridiculed us accounts of intrusions saying the 
marines apparently fired at swaying palm trees 
the defense forces are commanded by gen manuel antonio noriega 
who was indicted in the united states in february on charges of 
trafficking in colombian cocaine 
the reagan administration has for months sought the ouster of 
noriega panamas de facto leader through a series of economic 
sanctions and unsuccessful negotiations

illinois republican gov james thompson came to 
this convention city to taunt the democrats but wound up hinting 
that hed make a good running mate for gop candidate george bush 
as the democrats embraced the ticket of michael dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen who differ on a number of issues thompson stressed 
his compatibility with the vice president 
george bush and i agree on a lot of things said thompson a 
fourterm governor who was an early bush supporter 
im too moderate for some people but ive never been told im 
too moderate for george bush he said 
thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job 
applicant vice presidential hopefuls traditionally refrain from 
tooting their own horns 
there are a number of qualified candidates thompson said 
theres no lack of talent in our party 
thompsons support gave bush a boost in the illinois primary 
where he thrashed his gop rivals after an impressive showing in the 
south 
since then thompson has been mentioned as a vice presidential 
prospect and thompsonbush bumper stickers have appeared in 
springfield the illinois capital 
thompson was in atlanta on wednesday to carry the gop banner he 
clearly relished the task signaling whats certain to be a 
republican effort to focus attention on jesse jackson as part of 
the democratic team 
gov dukakis has accepted jesse jackson as his partner in this 
campaign elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher 
than his nominal running mate lloyd bentsen thompson told 
reporters 
thompson said it was a clever strategy by dukakis to offer 
bentsen as the soothing reassuring conservative 
but he said my guess is those two partners of the troika 
dukakis and jackson will soon leave bentsen in the dust 
thompson added with bentsen whispering in one ear and jackson 
whispering in his other ear who is dukakis going to listen to 
i think thats the question the american people need to have 
answered

some senators are known for what they believe 
but sen lloyd bentsen of texas is best known for what he has done 
in a 40year political career win elections and then get the job 
done in office 
i know there are those who would take perhaps the political 
version of a st ignatius approach saying that they want pure 
ideology he says and if you practice that to the ultimate 
you finally have yourself a party of one and you sure dont win 
any elections 
bentsen the democrats vice presidential choice believes in 
winning 
the son of a wealthy landowner in the rio grande valley lloyd 
millard bentsen jr was a 24yearold world war ii veteran when he 
won his first office hidalgo county judge 
at 27 in 1948 he won a seat in the us house of 
representatives making him the youngest congressman at the time 
during his first term he cast a vote against the poll tax which 
was being used to keep blacks from voting he was one of just two 
southern congressmen to vote that way and he frequently now points 
to that as an example of his strong commitment to civil rights 
people were beginning to talk about bentsen as a governor or 
senator but in 1954 he dropped out of politics after only three 
terms in the house 
bentsen and his wife beryl ann a former fashion model whom he 
married while in the service moved back to texas to raise their 
two sons and one daughter over the next 16 years bentsen built a 
successful insurance and investment business that left him a 
millionaire 
his father now 94 told him if he left politics he would never 
go back but the bug bit him again in 1970 
bentsen entered the democratic primary and upset incumbent sen 
ralph yarborough in the general election he defeated republican 
rep george bush a feat hes now trying to repeat in the national 
arena 
as a senator bentsen has gained a reputation as a lawmakers 
lawmaker a dealmaker not always the stuff presidential 
candidates are made of he found that out in 1976 when he made a 
run for the democratic nomination for president and was defeated by 
the former georgia governor jimmy carter he kept his senate seat 
though and was reelected with a powerful 60 percent six years ago 
as chairman of the senate finance committee for the past two 
years bentsen has racked up an impressive string of 
accomplishments 
the panel has approved welfare reform legislation currently 
before a housesenate conference committee and president reagan 
has signed a bentsenpushed catastrophic illness protection bill 
expanding the medicare system 
the huge trade bill vetoed by reagan also came through his 
committee including the 60day notice for plant closings that led 
to a reagan veto the democratic congress just sent the notice 
provision back to reagan as a separate bill and campaign issue 
tucked into the trade bill is a provision repealing the windfall 
profits tax on oil an example of bentsens successful blend of 
local interests and national issues its part of a theme that runs 
through bentsens career compromising to get things done 
lloyd is ideal says house speaker jim wright a friend for 
more than three decades he doesnt go overboard in any 
direction 
bentsens not the backslapping touchyfeely kind of politician 
typical of capitol hill his style is often described as aloof and 
patrician something he disputes by citing his campaign swings 
through the barrios of south texas where he speaks with the 
residents in fluent spanish 
but people still recall when a young staffer once made the 
mistake of calling him lloyd we worked very hard to earn the 
title senator he admonished the youth lets use it 
bentsen walks the halls of the capitol with an erect athletic 
gait that belies his 67 years he was playing tennis only hours 
before michael dukakis picked him up in washington for the trip to 
atlanta 
he has the demeanor of a conservative businessman but his 
senate voting record has been consistently middleoftheroad 
according to ratings given by both liberal and conservative groups 
it would be wrong to say bentsens priorities have drifted without 
a rudder his issues just dont cut cleanly across the ideological 
spectrum between political extremes 
bentsen is a conservative certainly compared to dukakis on 
national defense and foreign policy he has voted for aid to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua and for the mx missile spending that 
dukakis strongly opposes 
on domestic issues he supports prayer in schools and opposes 
restrictions on handguns again positions opposite those of his 
more liberal running mate dukakis has called president reagans 
1981 tax cuts a monumental mistake but bentsen not only voted for 
them but was one of the earliest supporters of reducing business 
taxes to spur economic growth years before reagan came to power 
on the other hand he was a supporter of the equal rights 
amendment and of legal abortions though not always spending 
federal money on them 
and while dukakis has been critical of political action 
committee fund raising bentsen is a master in 1987 shortly after 
becoming chairman of the senate finance committee bentsen formed a 
10000aseat breakfast club for lobbyists to raise money for 
his senate campaign 
bentsen who has also supported campaign reform legislation 
quickly disbanded the club after it was made public and calls it 
a doozy of a mistake 
neither bentsen nor dukakis will admit to any consternation 
about those differences indeed dukakis asserts that he doesnt 
want a clone for a vice president bentsen says its just a case 
of practicing the politics of inclusion that will win the white 
house for the democrats in november 
and that kind of pragmatic approach to politics and issues could 
well be the two mens greatest commonality 
bentsen seems happy with his ascension to the ticket and 
comfortable with it 
back in his days as a world war ii bomber pilot bentsen once 
was forced to land his disabled plane on a strip on the island of 
viz in the adriatic an armed group came out to meet the americans 
i climbed out of the plane and walked toward them hoping they 
were friendly only to have a man about my age emerge from the 
group bentsen said in an article he later wrote 
i said dont i know you 
he looked at me and said sure youre bentsen i used to 
sack groceries for your mother when she went to the grocery 
store 
he still clearly enjoys that feeling of recognition

they never run out of words 
house speaker jim wright had prepared his speech as chairman of 
the democratic national convention but had only one chance to 
rehearse it so he memorized the first sentence and planned to read 
the rest from the prompting device in front of the lectern 
i got up there and delivered that first line with all the 
enthusiasm and emotion i could muster he said later i looked 
at the teleprompter for the second sentence and it was sen 
robert byrds speech they had put the wrong speech on 
wright said that because he hadnt brought a written text he 
had only three choices when he mounted the podium tuesday night 
i could either go ahead and muddle through it or i could just 
deliver byrds speech or i could just say thank you and sit down 
the third option probably would have been best

struggling not to say i told you so texans 
who touted houston as a better place than atlanta for the 
democratic national convention have started lobbying to capture the 
partys 1992 convention 
the pitch began on the crowded floor of the omni arena wednesday 
night when texas delegates donned tshirts bearing an inviting 
message to democrats who are weary of gridlocked aisles and fights 
for seats in the convention hall 
we have space for you in 92 the shirts said 
the space problem was dramatized when officials locked the 
omnis doors for the second consecutive night wednesday because of 
overcrowding some convention delegates were excluded from the 
hall at least temporarily on both nights 
wed like to show them what a real convention center looks 
like said don ward of the houston convention and visitors bureau 
which is gearing up for another shot at the 1992 convention 
houstonians had offered their massive new george r brown 
convention center as the best place for this years convention 
democratic national chairman paul kirk opted instead for atlanta 
ward said the convention would have made 60 million for houston 
while providing democrats with a more comfortable setting 
the george r brown would contain three omnis you could keep 
all the press and everything under one roof he said 
the 13000member press corps here is housed in the spacious 
georgia world congress center adjacent to the omni 
while delegates jammed the omni floor wednesday night for the 
michael dukakis presidential nomination houstonians including 
mayor kathy whitmire gathered in their convention center to watch 
the proceedings in atlanta on television 
texas state democratic chairman bob slagle who joked that his 
home town of sherman has livestock barns larger than the omni was 
among the texans who were striving to avoid saying i told you 
so in atlanta 
its always embarrassing when anybody gets locked out of a 
democratic convention for any reason we pride ourselves on 
inclusion its a shame and im sorry it happened he said 
its not the most useful hall we ever worked in slagle said 
of the omni if you like being crammed in like a sardine its a 
pretty nice place to be 
claire giesen an aide to rep mike andrews in houston is the 
lead cheerleader for the houston 92 effort she observed that the 
tshirts and stickers did not mention either political party and 
also could be used to lure republicans to houston in four years 
ms giesen complained that the omni is too small and that 
transportation is poor but she had nothing but praise for the 
hot humid weather that convention delegates endured here until 
recently 
the weather has been great perfect weather she said as she 
distributed stickers featuring a big blue 92 which can seem 
like the average humidity on a summer day in houston

here is the text of the speech delivered by 
coretta scott king at the democratic national convention 
five weeks from today on august 27 we will commemorate the 
25th anniversary of martin luther king jrs dream for america by 
marching on washington once again 
on that august afternoon in 1963 more than 250000 people from 
all walks of life assembled in the lengthened shadow of the lincoln 
memorial on that day martin luther king jr stood before the 
nation and the world and declared his dream for america 
martins dream was embraced by many americans some like medgar 
evers john and bobby kennedy and countless others already 
mentioned here this week have sacrificed and even given their lives 
in pursuit of that dream 
under martin luther kings jrs leadership the civil rights 
movement awakened the conscience of america and achieved great 
victories in the struggle for equality his accomplishments are 
much in evidence in this historic convention the state of 
mississippi for example was described by martin as sweltering 
with the heat of injustice yet in 1986 mississippi elected 
michael espy the first grandson of a former slave to the congress 
since reconstruction 
it has also sent to georgia this week a former confederate 
state a fully integrated delegation to this convention shared by 
a black man black americans have made great strides in the 
political arena as speakers of state legislatures as chairs of 
eight congressional committees and theres even a black american 
william gray sharing the congressional budget committee and this 
conventions platform committee 
and tonight i want to pause to say jesse martin would be 
proud of you and we are all proud of you by the way you have 
broadened and expanded the base of political participation in 
america so many who were formerly locked out are now locked in as 
a disciple of martin luther king jr your campaign has brought new 
hope to millions who had given up on ever participating in the 
political process 
these accomplishments serve to remind us that todays dreams can 
be tomorrows reality but we must be willing to work together to 
pray together to struggle together in the spirit of noneviolence 
to fulfill martins dream 
the leaders of this convention gov michael dukakis lloyd 
bentsen jesse jackson and jimmy carter have beautifully 
demonstrated the power of nonviolence at work in the healing and 
reconciliation that has taken place at this convention 
gov dukakis i want to commend you for conducting your campaign 
on a consistently high plane and spirit i come to this convention 
tonight to remind you that this is what the dream is all about i 
come also to remind you that for many americans the dream is still 
deferred despite the progress of the last 25 years something is 
still wrong when 32 million americans are living in poverty in the 
richest nation on the face of the earth and something is very 
wrong when nearly 13 million of them are children this is a 
national disgrace 
we cannot allow this to go unchallenged as americans let us 
take the challenge of making those whom the bible call the least 
of these victims of aids the poor and the homeless a top 
priority let us not abandon the victims of neglect 
it would be tragic a tragic mistake to attract the haves 
to any political party at the expense of the have nots we can 
feed our hungry 
we can provide decent housing for all of our citizens we can 
provide jobs skills training and day care for the poor and 
unemployed so that they can put bread on their own tables 
we can help every american who wants to work to be productive 
to do so we can end the violence of nuclear war apartheid 
racism joblessness terrorism drugs and the violence in our 
homes in our schools and in our streets if only we can find the 
will and we must 
and finally my brothers and sisters we can be proud of our 
economic prosperity and the blessings of freedom but if we want to 
be and if we want the gospel of freedom spread and human rights 
throughout the world we must lead by our moral example we can 
and we must be peacemakers i ask you my friends please do not 
forsake martins dream and i join jesse jackson in appealing to 
you to keep hope alive 
i challenge you to remember the dream 
thank you

there were hugs laughs and more than a few 
nostalgic tales when former officials and staffers of jimmy 
carters administration got together and rehashed the good ol 
days 
and those were the good old days said connie plunkett a 
former campaign worker and state department official under carter 
she was among 400 guests who jammed the carter presidential center 
for the lavishly catered reception 
were just here to have a good time not talk politics 
carter said he and his wife rosalynn obviously were having a good 
time as they circulated among the crowd 
the guests included former sen edmund muskie of maine former 
cia director stansfield turner and former aides jody powell and 
bert lance two members of the carter inner circle affectionately 
known as the georgia mafia 
its not every day you get a free drink off of jimmy carter 
quipped powell who served as carters press secretary 
carters three sons and daughter amy also attended the 
reception among important carter administration figures who did 
not show up were former vice president walter mondale and white 
house chief of staff hamilton jordan whose mother is seriously ill 
muskie who served as secretary of state during the last eight 
months of carters term said he had mixed emotions about his stint 
in the administration 
it was a damned good time said the 74yearold muskie who 
now practices law in washington it was an exciting time but my 
outstanding image of those days is of the iranian hostage crisis i 
just wish we could have gotten those hostages out earlier 
muskie also said he is happy to see that carter is beginning to 
play a more important role in the democratic party than he has in 
recent years 
from now on i think youll see a different attitude about 
his presidency and about him he said 
rosalynn carter said she felt her husband always has been 
popular with rankandfile democrats 
it was the party officials who turned against jimmy following 
his defeat in 1980 she said i think the people always have 
given him a warm reception and have seen him as a good person even 
if they didnt necessarily think he was an effective president 
mrs carter said she enjoys being out of the pressure cooker 
that is the white house its wonderful not being on stage all 
the time she added 
im also enjoying this party she said ive talked with 
people i havent seen in years 
the carters moved through the crowd separately hugging 
laughing and chatting with friends some of whom sought the former 
presidents signature on photographs or on copies of his newly 
released book on trout fishing 
at one point a friend held up her young daughter a toddler 
whom he hugged and kissed carter an indefatigable campaigner when 
he was seeking the presidency in 1976 then laughed and added 
im a little out of practice at this sort of thing 
at one point an aide stepped up and wiped the lipstick from 
carters cheek after he was kissed by three successive admirers 
this is great carter said grinning broadly as he moved 
away through the crowd hugging kissing and talking about those 
days when a peanut farmer from plains ga was the president of 
the united states of america

donna alexanders previous letters to politicians 
always brought formletter replies but her letter to texas 
treasurer ann richards got a personal response on national 
television 
i felt kind of embarrassed a little bit said ms alexander 
who watched the monday night keynote speech while wrapping up a 
tupperware party at her home in lorena texas 
in her speech ms richards quoted at length from ms 
alexanders letter to her about the difficulties faced by average 
families the letter was written on a lunch break after ms 
alexander heard that families would be the key note in the keynote 
speech 
for a number of years ive wondered if people like us are the 
forgotten she wrote were not the poor and were not the 
rich were not the very young or the aged were the average 
american family 
the alexanders earn about 50000 a year and have difficulty 
making ends meet for themselves and their three children she said 
she is an administrator at a mental retardation treatment facility 
her husband joe is a telephone installer 
ms alexander 39 said she was inspired last year after hearing 
ms richards speak at a meeting of mental retardation professionals 
it was like sitting ay my coffee table talking with somebody 
over a cup of coffee like she was speaking right to me she was so 
dynamic yet so warm i knew right then i had found a new hero 
ms alexander said wednesday in a telephone interview 
she gave ms richards permission to quote from the letter but 
only if her name would not be used 
when the word lorena came on everybody was surprised my 
knees were weak here was my hero talking straight at me she 
said 
its been a long time since i had a hero she added calling 
john and robert kennedy her last heroes 
i was shocked that she used so much of the letter ms 
alexander said i hope it makes people aware of whats happening 
in middleclass america 
among the things happening to middleclass america is that 
families are too busy to play active roles in politics she said 
this year for the first time since she has been eligible ms 
alexander did not vote in the texas presidential primary 
the day just went by and i didnt get it done she said 
apologetically

in the pageantry of the roll call of states it 
almost seemed that delegates to the democratic national convention 
had a decision to make they didnt but thats show business 
and show business is what national political conventions have 
become they are unrivaled as the greatest shows in american 
politics their central decisions are made in advance far from the 
convention hall by voters not delegates 
nowadays conventions are scripted and scheduled to the minute 
while the schedules seldom work the schedulers try to enforce 
them the better to play to national television convention roles 
from keynote speaker to alternate delegate reward and recognize 
party leaders and workers 
they bring together the disparate sometimes conflicting 
elements which in coalition make up the democratic and republican 
parties only then do northeastern liberals sit in sidebyside 
unity if not always in full accord with sun belt conservatives 
so jesse jackson makes his peace with the ticket he wanted to 
lead then join and while some of his delegates grumble they 
nonetheless agree that gov michael dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen 
are more to their taste than vice president george bush and the 
running mate he has yet to name 
for a week or so every fourth year there really is a national 
democratic party and a republican party people can see and 
identify thats important in a process built around a twoparty 
system that exists because it evolved not because it was written 
down anywhere 
modern conventions dont call the tunes they dance to the music 
in atlanta delegates caucused and convention whips counted 
heads all as though there were something still to be settled 
there wasnt but the exercise proceeded as it always does 
dukakis sealed his democratic presidential nomination on june 7 
capturing a delegate majority six weeks before the convention the 
nomination was a ritual dukakis got 287625 votes jackson 
12185 then on a motion from the jackson side the convention 
made it unanimous 
republicans will conduct a similar rite on aug 17 in new 
orleans formally awarding the nomination vice president george 
bush captured for certain on april 26 bush is unopposed 
not since 1952 has a national convention taken more than one 
ballot to name its nominee adlai e stevenson won the democratic 
nomination on a third ballot that year defeating thensen estes 
kefauver of kentucky who had won the presidential primaries but 
couldnt make it stick 
now primaries rule and conventions ratify 
there was preseason speculation that this time might be 
different that a divided democratic field might deadlock the 
primaries and therefore the convention forcing multiple ballots 
and opening the way for a lateblooming candidate that never was a 
realistic prospect the primary election arithmetic precludes it 
at the next democratic convention there will be even less 
delegate leeway in a concession to jackson the democrats agreed 
to tie 1992 delegate votes even more tightly to the primary 
election numbers 
four republican conventions ago when thenpresident richard m 
nixon was renominated in 1972 a minutebyminute convention script 
leaked out to the consternation of the gop leadership it outlined 
a clockwork convention with spontaneous demonstrations 
included and timed to the minute republicans were embarrassed to 
have their makebelieve spontaneity unveiled 
theres no embarrassment about such matters now convention 
scripts are released in advance they seldom make the timetable 
but they try the nominating session ran about an hour behind 
schedule 
presidential nominees used to stagemanage some suspense into 
the proceedings by waiting until the final day before naming a 
running mate it wasnt publicly discussed in advance bad form 
not in atlanta dukakis announced his choice of bentsen for vice 
president six days before the convention the 1984 ticket also was 
complete before the convention began 
but the show goes on a political extravaganza tailored for 
television not even the delegates are essential some of them were 
kept out along with latearriving spectators and journalists when 
the fire department decreed that the hall was overcrowded and 
barred access during the tuesday and wednesday night sessions 
anyone who wasnt in by midevening wasnt admitted 
this is not a superdome said democratic chairman paul g 
kirk jr for all intents and purposes its a live tv studio 
the atlanta omni normally seats 16237 and that doesnt include 
the floor where the delegates are sitting for the convention 
capacity is 11000 a grandiose multitiered platform from which 
convention business is conducted takes a big bite out of the 
convention floor space if the thing could fly it would look like 
a star wars space ship worthy of darth vadar 
between the monster platform and the proliferation of broadcast 
booths and press stands the democrats are meeting in a shrunken 
room 
kirk said the overcrowding that led to the closed convention 
doors had nothing to do with the size of the hall he said there 
were too many people 
if you like being crammed in like a sardine its a pretty 
nice place to be said texas democratic chairman bob slagle 
then again if you dont like being crammed in like a sardine 
it is best to steer clear of national conventions

the semicircle of children eyed kitty dukakis 
intently as she talked about peer pressure about accepting an 
amphetamine from a friend and about 26 years of addiction that 
followed the words i want to say to you are dont start she 
said 
she also spoke of the fear and eventual joy that came with 
her successful effort to end her dependence on stimulants 
i gave credit for everything good that happened to me to the 
pills because i didnt think i could do anything without them 
she said describing the steps that led to her decision to seek 
treatment in 1982 
life is so much sweeter now a beaming mrs dukakis told the 
children as her husband michael stood by her side 
the children hearing the story were gathered wednesday outside a 
community center in conyers a predominantly black community near 
atlanta they could have been anywhere in america 
as dukakis crisscrossed the country in his successful quest for 
the democratic presidential nomination he made antidrug efforts a 
major issue and his wife his top spokeswoman for the cause 
he talks of tough law enforcement but also compassionate drug 
education she speaks of dramatic mood swings and skipping from 
doctor to doctor to gain a new prescription for the pills she took 
each morning from age 19 to 45 
i couldnt stop using them and i became dependent she told 
the children in conyers 
when asked how she kept getting new prescriptions she said i 
think most physicians and people in the country didnt think they 
were dangerous 
she then detailed how she hid her addiction from her husband 
who met his future wife seven years after she began taking 
amphetamines to lose weight and her decision to enter a minnesota 
treatment clinic in 1982 in the middle of her husbands successful 
campaign to regain the governorship he had lost four years earlier 
i was very scared she said i was afraid because for 26 
years every morning i had taken a pill a mindaltering pill 
at that time dukakis said his wife was receiving treatment for 
hepatitis when she disclosed her addiction at an emotional 
announcement last year dukakis defended his decision to lie about 
his wifes condition in 1982 
mrs dukakis in a recent interview said the decision was made 
to keep her treatment private because at that time i could not 
handle the public scrutiny i was embarrassed and vulnerable and 
afraid 
but now her victory over drug dependency has become a powerful 
message of her husbands campaign 
i feel strong and confident in myself and what i have done 
she said and secondly and as important or more important one 
of the tenets of recovering is helping other people

new york gov mario cuomo says michael dukakis 
will win the white house in november and serve for two terms 
putting to rest any thought of a cuomo presidency 
governor dukakis will be president dukakis for eight years and 
by then i will be i hope somewhere on a bench cuomo said at a 
news conference outside the omni just before dukakis won the 
nomination wednesday night 
ill be too old eight years from now said the 56yearold 
governor who once was the most talked about possible contender for 
the 1988 nomination i think i will be a footnote in history i 
hope an unambiguous footnote 
before leaving the convention to fly home to albany after 
casting his delegate vote for dukakis cuomo said he didnt feel 
snubbed at not being asked to play a role at the convention by 
dukakis 
and cuomo as convention delegates gave the nomination to 
another northeastern liberal governor who is the son of immigrants 
insisted he had no regrets at all about not running himself 
the governor refused to discuss the possibility of dukakis 
losing in november 
hes not going to lose cuomo said 
when it came to this years convention cuomo called dukakis 
decision not to invite him to speak a perfectly appropriate 
judgment and i told him that 
cuomo who electrified the 1984 convention with his keynote 
address met privately tuesday with dukakis on monday both 
dukakis and jesse jackson had told cuomo they didnt have the time 
to meet with him 
i was sitting there with him he offered me cheese he offered 
me fruit i said hello to his mother i didnt feel snubbed said 
cuomo i spoke to them the convention delegates in 1984 have 
you forgotten already 
asked if dukakis had requested cuomos presence on the podium on 
thursday night at the end of the convention a traditional honor 
accorded prominent party members cuomo said he hadnt been asked 
its unimportant whos on the podium or unimportant whether 
im on the podium he said 
cuomo didnt endorse dukakis until after all the primaries had 
ended and dukakis had the nomination locked up the new york 
governor also refused to rule out accepting a convention draft for 
the nomination until well into the primary season 
despite that cuomo and dukakis have said their relationship is 
good 
cuomo said he would do whatever he could for dukakis in new york 
and elsewhere consistent with what i do as governor and were 
very busy as everybody knows

the keynote speaker and dozens of other 
dignitaries were locked out of the democratic national convention 
because of overcrowding in the omni arena forcing them to miss the 
climax of their confabulation 
delegates party leaders convention staffers and reporters 
milled about in frustration outside the blockaded walkway to the 
hall wednesday as the delegates inside nominated massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for president 
it was the second time in as many nights that the hall was 
closed by fire marshals some of those locked out angrily denounced 
the democratic national committee for choosing the relatively small 
arena for the convention of more than 4000 delegates 
i want to go vote i want to hear the nominations i dont 
understand this said blanche preston mcsmith a delegate who 
traveled from auke bay alaska to cast her vote for jesse jackson 
they wont let me in 
whos sitting in my seat i want him out thundered michael 
stein a delegate from chicago i am being prevented from 
representing the people who elected me this is an injustice 
its outrageous 
others including the party leaders caught outside the hall 
accepted their fortune mildly there was no hassle at all said 
texas treasurer ann richards the keynote speaker monday night i 
came late and the hall was full 
she went back to her hotel room and watched the roll call on 
television 
rep robert garcia of new york barely made it into the hall and 
said he had left behind colleagues including sen j bennett 
johnston of louisiana and reps paul kanjorski of pennsylvania jim 
slattery of kansas and brian donnelly of massachusetts 
seen standing outside were sen bob graham of florida reps 
peter rodino of new jersey and les aspin and gerald kleczka of 
wisconsin former wisconsin gov patrick lucey and bert lance a 
jackson adviser and former director of the office of management and 
budget for president carter 
if pete rodino and les aspin are on the outside im with 
them lance said rodino managed to gain entry later aspin did 
not despite his delegations appeal from the convention floor for 
him to be admitted 
critics of the omnis selection had warned that it would be too 
small to accommodate convention crowds fire chief william h hamer 
said he would allow about 12500 people inside there were 11000 
seats and the dnc stationed workers at each door to count those 
entering and leaving 
atlanta mayor andrew young earlier blamed the crowding on 
reporters in the hall but joel justice a delegate from atlanta 
said convention planning was at fault 
we thought we had all this problem worked out beforehand he 
said evidently it didnt work out exactly like they planned

if the democratic national convention seems more 
like a hollywood production than a political event hollywood 
producer gary smith has done his job 
shouting staccato bursts of instructions into a telephone 
headset smith is orchestrating every minute of the action from a 
control center its occupants call tech tower the top tier of the 
imposing camera stand opposite the podium 
kenneth mack is coming in lower the lights hold it hold it 
lower the podium and music 
with the singing of the national anthem safely under way the 
producer could lean back and relax for three minutes 
smith a trim man with a mustache glasses and a yellow tie 
sits before five television monitors surrounded by notebooks 
telephones and a timer that he clutches anxiously when politicians 
go into overtime at the rostrum 
his crisp directions are heard over an open line by the 
orchestra conductor the podium stage manager the teleprompter 
operator and his partner dwight hemion director of television 
coverage for the partys satellite service to stations across the 
nation 
as the convention opened wednesday at 6 pm smith was in his 
element directing preparations for a boy scout color guard 
gesticulating at his operatives on the podium scribbling notes on 
his schedule requesting frequent changes of lighting from don tyra 
sitting beside him at a console 
by 830 pm the program was nearly an hour behind byebye to 
introductions of the youngest delegate and former house speaker 
carl albert so long for the second time to a videotaped tribute to 
party secretary dorothy bush 
smith was not worried there was a 46minute recess built into 
the session but when it came officials apparently had not decided 
whether to cancel it or not there were long seconds of emptiness 
at the podium 
some music smith yelled into his headset some music 
the orchestra obliged and the officials shortly decided to go on 
with the show 
it wasnt the only time smith had to do some quick thinking 
when a delegate scheduled to introduce three governors began 
speaking into a dead microphone from her place in the indiana 
delegation smith quickly turned on a mike in front of him 
ladies and gentlemen he announced in a deep voice the 
governor of colorado roy romer 
often by gestures alone smith issued lighting instructions to 
go black or brighten up suddenly or slowly and by the subtle 
movement of tyras finger on a control the hall would fall silent 
all eyes on the podium a demonstration would explode or wane on 
cue with bright or fading lights 
nearly five hours before the california delegation clinched the 
nomination for the massachusetts governor smith was explaining to 
tyra how to dramatize the moment youll feel it in the hall 
he said well bring the lights down theyll say california and 
well bring the lights up 
tension mounted as the moment approached sneak em down 
sneak em down smith told tyra stand by ready to bring em 
up ready music not now not now as the california delegation 
started cheering its own lieutenant governor 
then the announcement california gives 235 votes to dukakis 
go music smith yelled tyra zipped up the lights the

issues the way some politicians do hes wrestled them to the

for greekamericans among the democratic 
delegates the nomination of michael dukakis was a culmination of 
their dreams in america as well as a tribute to their heritage in 
greece the place where democracy was born 
america is my country but tonight im greek in my heart 
said nick poulos who immigrated from athens in 1955 built his own 
construction company in new jersey and in the last year raised 
more than 1 million for dukakis campaign 
like other delegates and supporters of greek heritage on the 
floor of the omni some sporting tshirts exclaiming yassou 
or right on poulos said his heritage gives him a special 
bond with dukakis 
i worked hard to be a success and tonight i see again that 
this country gives you the opportunity to be whatever you want to 
be said poulos who left the republican party for dukakis 
agnes anthonakes ricko credits her parents dinnertable 
discussions of civil duty and social responsibility with her 
interest in politics its a greek trait she said 
maybe it was because democracy was born in greece the 
massachusetts delegate said he dukakis reflects all of our 
american values as well as our forefathers values 
dukakis parents immigrated from greece his father panos put 
himself through college and medical school and became a successful 
family doctor specializing in obstretics his mother euterpe worked 
in the mills and became a schoolteacher 
as a massachusetts politician from the comfortable boston suburb 
of brookline dukakis rarely mentioned his greek heritage he was a 
candidate who spoke for middleclass suburbanites interested in 
clean efficient government rather than a representative of 
bluecollar immigrants 
then in a trip to greece in 1976 he discovered his roots and 
slowly he began mentioning his familys story the classic tale of 
uneducated immigrants building successful lives in america 
but in his presidential campaign dukakis found that the 
american dream played well he rarely failed to mention his 
parents especially when campaigning before others relatively new 
to this country 
when he talks of his roots in speeches he tells of other 
immigrant groups as well of the american immigrant story he 
always says something in spanish when before a hispanic audience 
but greekamericans say hes talking to them and as one of 
their own was nominated for president they were overwhelmed 
its a feeling you cant explain said ohio state dukakis 
director anne drake who was born anastasia drakopoulos probably 
the only other people who can understand that feeling here tonight 
are the black baptists with jesse jackson i understand that 
feeling they have its an awesome feeling 
dukakis she said represents the american dream for us and 
for every other immigrant group 
terre haute ind mayor pete chalos arrived in the united 
states from greece at age 14 he believes dukakis nomination 
reaffirms the ideals that drew his father across the ocean 
this is probably the only country where the son of an 
immigrant can become president chalos said this tells people 
that even if your dad came from a foreign country and didnt speak 
english that well thats not a handicap you can still accomplish 
something 
leo condos said as a child he remembered his father wishing 
there would be a greek president someday 
tonight i get to vote that dream in for him condos said 
the greek immigrant like most immigrants wants a better life 
for his children and then he wants to turn around and pay the 
country back 
michael dukakis fulfills that dream for a lot of immigrants 
condos said yassou

van endrefs thirsty southern illinois fields soaked up a heavy 
rain that he and other farmers call a godsend but experts say 
recent showers in the midwestern farm belt dont bode an end to the 
drought 
the corn crop overall has been hurt quite considerably because 
the needed rains came about two to three weeks too late said 
john unger a crop statistician for the us department of 
agriculture in illinois 
and the rain may be only a respite in its 30day outlook the 
national weather service predicts more hot dry weather 
abovenormal temperatures and belownormal rainfall for the 
nations heartland 
us agriculture secretary richard lyng inspected a cornfield in 
central minnesota on wednesday saying the damage is the worst hes 
seen in eight droughtravaged states over the past two days 
weve educated ourselves a great deal lyng told edgar traut 
and his wife kathleen who own a 320acre dairy farm near st 
cloud minn 
but the recent rainfall average 1 to 2 inches across the 
midwest gave farmers like van endref something to be happy about 
his 2000 acres near elkville ill got nearly 4 inches of rain 
since sunday 
endref says he expects a 50 percent corn crop and a 75 percent 
soybean crop enough at least to cover his production costs 
it doesnt look as bleak as it did just 10 days ago when it 
looked like we wouldnt raise a thing he said wednesday night 
in our immediate area its made a big turnaround 
herman krones 2800acre farm in du quoin ill which 
president reagan visited last week was drenched by more than 3 
inches of rain in 24 hours 
its a godsend krone said 
in central arkansas pulaski county greg chapman beamed as his 
droughtshriveled soybean field got a dose of rain 
im smiling chapman said as he watched the downpour from a 
farm shop in scott three weeks ago i thought it wouldnt rain 
again for the rest of the year 
but other farmers were left high and dry 
i cant even remember the last rain said a discouraged 
sonny wiederkehr a texas rancher with 3000 acres who said his 
parched pastures look like the pavement 
despite the rains restrictions on lawn sprinkling remained in 
effect in many cities including at least five chicago suburbs 
in kentucky this weeks rainfall has helped recharge ponds 
streams and rivers said mike callahan a weather service 
hydrologist in louisville 
the ohio river is actually starting to come up now he said 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said 
higherthannormal rain is expected over the next five days for the 
atlantic and gulf coast states and the region comprising tennessee 
kentucky west virginia and southern ohio 
but the weather is expected to continue to be drierthan normal 
in the area from michigan and wisconsin stretching southwest 
across the cornbelt states to kansas oklahoma and north texas 
mississippi officials predict a 600 million loss in state 
agriculture although the rain has improved grazing conditions for 
cattle subsoil moisture still has not returned 
in general its improving but if the rain stops well be in 
the same situation said linda moore of the mississippi 
cooperative extension service 
recent rainfall doesnt mean the droughts over with of 
course because weve got a big rain deficit added meteorologist 
john wright of the weather services midwest agricultural weather 
service center at purdue university in indiana 
lyng told the minnesota gathering he plans to brief president 
reagan next week about his drought visit

the federal communications commission is a 
step closer to allowing telephone companies to provide cable 
television services 
in a series of actions wednesday the fcc indicated it favors 
lifting an agency regulation and a separate law that bar telephone 
companies from running cable companies in their own service areas 
the fcc voted tentatively to recommend to congress that it 
repeal the 1984 prohibition and directed its staff to begin the 
process of repealing its own rule against such activity 
the commission called the prohibitions a draconian form of 
regulation no longer needed because the cable industry has become 
large and strong enough to compete with the telephone companies 
the fcc said allowing telephone companies to operate cable 
systems will increase services for customers including home 
shopping and video phones as well as providing an additional 
source of pay television programming

congressional lawmakers for handing him an 18 billion spending 
bill for water and energy earlier than any appropriations bill in 
his presidency 
reagan signed the bill while on vacation in california on 
wednesday and also commended congress for holding spending to 
levels acceptable to his administration 
the bill was the first regular spending measure to get reagans 
signature since december 1985 
in recent years spending battles between the administration and 
congress have spawned huge catchall spending measures enacted at 
the end of the fiscal year 
in his statement on signing the bills reagan urged congress to 
complete the remaining 12 appropriations bills with similar haste

a former presidential candidate was set 
free by leftist guerrilla kidnappers and called on the government 
to hold peace talks with the rebels who had demanded talks as a 
condition for his release 
the government which made no promises after newspaper editor 
alvaro gomez hurtado was abducted may 29 indicated after his 
release wednesday night that it might talk to the guerrillas 
church bells rang and drivers honked horns around this capital 
city of 6 million after the release of the 69yearold gomez 
hurtado who had been abducted in a hail of submachine gunfire that 
killed one of his bodyguards 
gomez hurtado the conservative party candidate who lost the 
1986 presidential race to president virgilio barco vargas is the 
some of former president laureano gomez hurtado 
in a telephone interview he said he was released on the 
outskirts of bogota where he caught a taxi to his home 
about 5000 people joyfully screaming alvaro alvaro alvaro 
gathered in a park in front of his apartment building within an 
hour 
gomez hurtado flanked by his wife and other family members 
smiled as he waved to the crowd from the window of his apartment 
leftist guerrillas rightwing death squads and powerful drug 
traffickers are active in colombia and have kidnapped and killed 
public officials in the last five years 
as the editor of the bogota daily el siglo gomez hurtados 
columns favored a military solution to the guerrilla problem but 
in the interview he seemed to have changed his position 
the episode of my kidnapping has been a confirmation that we 
are living in difficult times and that it is necessary to look for 
national reconciliation he said referring to the possibility of 
peace negotiations 
the april 19 movement one of five guerrilla groups in colombia 
had said it kidnapped gomez hurtado and was demanding peace talks 
barcos government refused to make any promises to the rebel 
band known as m19 but the rebels agreed last week to release 
gomez hurtado anyway perhaps because the kidnapping outraged 
colombians more than any previous guerrilla undertaking 
shortly after gomez hurtado was released barco put out a 
cautious feeler that seemed to indicate a willingness to begin 
peace talks with the rebels 
the government will persist in its earnest desire for peace 
and will do its utmost in searching for reconciliation between 
colombians he said in a statement read for him over nationwide 
television and radio 
early in the abduction gomez hurtado was reported fatally 
wounded but he said wednesday that he was not wounded and that the 
only physical problem he had during his captivity was a stomach 
ailment 
i was treated well and when i needed any medicine it was 
given to me without delay he said 
in a communique released on week ago in panama city the m19 
said it would release gomez hurtado the communique read by papal 
nuncio jose sebastian laboa came after five hours of negotiations 
in the vatican embassy in the panamanian capital 
it said the decision had been made in the spirit of finding 
routes that lead to a more equitable society to the preservation 
of human rights and reconciliation among colombians 
peace talks with the estimated 10000 to 20000 leftist 
guerrillas is a volatile issue in colombia 
army generals business leaders and congressmen say the 
guerrillas tricked president belisario betancur with their demands 
for peace talks in 1982 the opponents say the guerrillas used the 
negotiations to recuperate from severe setbacks against government 
security forces 
betancurs government negotiated a ceasefire with four of the 
five leftist guerrilla groups including the m19 but the truce 
collapsed within a year 
barcos government has kept up contacts with one of the 
guerrilla groups the colombian revolutionary armed forces 
those talks have gone nowhere fighting between the group and 
government security forces has been fierce since barco took office 
on aug 7 1986

wants her freedom after having served more than seven years of her 
15yeartolife prison term for the murder of scarsdale diet 
developer dr herman tarnower 
mrs harris supporters are seeking to gather signatures on 
petitions to send to gov mario cuomo to reinforce her personal 
letter requesting executive clemency 
as of aug 23 mrs harris will have served 7 years at the 
bedford hills correctional facility state law requires that half 
the minimum sentence be served before clemency can be considered

the jean l harris defense fund in monroe nh said wednesday

to kill herself when she accidentally shot tarnower four times 
she first sought clemency two years ago after suffering two 
heart attacks 
but the governors threeperson clemency committee turned her 
down pointing out the timeserved provision and declining to grant 
her a waiver of that requirement 
now that the requirement has almost been met supporters are 
more optimistic 
mrs harris attorney michael kennedy said he was preparing a 
brief detailing why cuomo should free mrs harris and all the 
documents mrs harris letter and the petitions would be sent to 
albany in late august or early september 
anne crowley a spokeswoman for the governor said mrs harris 
request would receive the same scrutiny as any other case 
each case is individual and thats how theyre reviewed she 
said 
any clemency granted by cuomo must be approved by the state 
parole board 
since her incarceration mrs harris has written two books one 
an autobiography stranger in two worlds and another due for 
release next month they always call us ladies about prison

proposed friendly takeover by the nephew of the late walt disney 
who announced a bid that values the instantfilm company at 284 
billion 
roy e disney an investor with an estimated personal wealth of 
560 million announced the offer wednesday and disclosed that he 
already owns 69 percent of polaroid through his familys shamrock 
holdings inc 
polaroid based in cambridge mass responded it was reviewing 
the 40ashare cash offer with the help of outside advisers but 
suggested management would look unfavorably on a buyout 
referring to a retrenchment plan involving layoffs and 
costcutting that was announced last week polaroid said in a news 
release we firmly believe that this is without doubt the right 
course for polaroid and for all of its shareholders employees 
customers and communities 
polaroids stock shot up 6 a share to 40 a share on the new 
york stock exchange on wednesday 
polaroids retrenchment plan announced july 12 was widely seen 
as an antitakeover measure and analysts said the timing of the 
shamrock offer suggested it was the trigger for the polaroid 
changes 
it would be very hard to say theyre unassociated william 
relyea who follows polaroid for eberstadt fleming inc in new 
york said of the offer and the changes announced at polaroid 
polaroid said it would cut up to 8 percent of its us workforce 
and save 50 million a year by reducing overhead and research and 
development costs the company also announced it would repurchase 
300 million of its own shares and create an employee stock 
ownership program that owns 14 percent of the companys stock 
polaroid also said it would enter the 7 billionayear world 
market for conventional film challenging eastman kodak co and 
fuji photo film co ltd 
disney described polaroids planned foray into the conventional 
film business as a misguided attempt to regain momentum in the face 
of a stagnating market for instant cameras and film 
the announcement appears to be a pedestrian attempt to 
give the company new direction disney lieutenant stanley p 
gold shamrock president and chief executive officer said in a 
news release it betrays polaroids heritage of invention and 
creativity in the development of new products and markets 
gold also denounced polaroids stock repurchase and employee 
stock ownership plans as a management entrenchment scheme 
in a letter delivered to i macallister booth polaroid 
president and chief executive officer shamrock proposed that 
polaroid management cooperate with the takeover offer 
polaroid has 71 million shares outstanding including a recent 
issue of 10 million shares that created the employee stock 
ownership program the 40ashare offer thus places a value of 
284 billion on the company 
shamrock already holds 493 million shares or 69 percent to 
buy the rest at 40 a share would cost shamrock 264 billion

communist authorities will free 95 young 
men convicted or awaiting trial on charges of avoiding the military 
draft the staterun news agency pap said 
wednesdays announcement came two days before the anniversary of 
the 1944 establishment of polands sovietsupported government and 
one week after parliament enacted a law allowing conscientious 
objections to military service 
but the most prominent conscientious objector slawomir 
dutkiewicz 24 a supporter of the outlawed peace group freedom and 
peace will not be freed 
the dispatch said dutkiewicz who friends say has been on a 
hunger strike since november and is being forcefed refuses to 
perform alternative nonmilitary service required by the new law 
pap said those to be freed include eight people sentenced to 
prison for refusing military service because of their personal 
moral convictions and 86 who refused for religious reasons 
the releases have been prompted above all by humanitarian 
principles this is one more proof of democratization of life in 
this country of respect shown for citizens views and convictions 
of consistency in the pursuit of the policy of national 
reconciliation the agency said 
in addition a prosecutor will ask for acquittal of one 
unidentified person who refused induction into the army for 
pseudopacifist motives pap said 
the decision came on a motion of the chief military prosecutor 
to the council of state chaired by polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski 
its not a surprise said freedom and peace founder jacek 
czaputowicz whose group has waged a threeyear civil disobedience 
battle for enactment of a conscientious objectors law 
its very positive except for dutkiewicz it means they 
accepted our goals they accepted alternative service as an 
institution and now we see that they would like to release almost 
everybody 
he said the group would continue to press for dutkiewiczs 
release 
under the new law people can apply for alternative service 
working in a state enterprise for moral or religious beliefs a 
draft board comprised of military and civilian members will judge 
the applicants 
if granted alternative civilian service is to last one year 
longer than regular military service under polands draft law 
every young man is required to serve two years in the army or one 
if he is a university graduate 
czaputowicz said hsi group has been successful because its goals 
were very concrete it was realistic as we see now 
last month the group achieved another chief goal changing 
polands military oath to remove a reference to serving alongside 
the soviet red army 
now is a good time for such demands because of perestroika 
said czaputowicz referring to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign for fundamental social and economic reforms that do not 
challenge the leading role of the communist party 
we can pressure the authorities he said and now is the 
time because of gorbachevs peace offensive they authorities 
dont want people in prison 
government spokesman jerzy urban said tuesday that if draft 
resisters were freed time served in prison probably would be 
applied against their alternative service obligations 
july 22 the communists national day was when martial law was 
lifted in 1983 it has been associated with amnesties of various 
kinds

a congressional research agency citing the 
increasing rate of aviation accidents involving pilot error says 
the federal government should encourage airlines to tighten their 
screening of people flying the nations crowded airways 
the general accounting office report released this week stopped 
short of calling for new regulations but says the federal aviation 
administration should encourage commercial air carriers to use the 
governments computer files to verify records of pilot safety 
the report by the gao a bipartisan research arm of congress 
said airlines spurred by deregulation hired some 9700 new pilots a 
year over the last four years 
the national transportation safety board meanwhile cited pilot 
error as a factor in 95 percent of all commuter plane accidents and 
63 percent of major airline accidents in 1985 
between 1980 and 1984 by contrast 57 percent of commuter 
accidents and 42 percent of major airline accidents had pilot error 
as a factor gao said 
the high percentage of accidents and incidents in which pilot 
error was a factor and accidents involving pilots with a history 
of safety transgressions indicate that airlines should use 
available resources to help assure that the pilots they hire fly as 
safely as possible the report said 
the ntsb earlier this year pinned the blame on an aug 16 1987 
crash of a northwest airlines flight at detroits airport on the 
failure of the two pilots to follow required checklist procedures 
for takeoff the crash killed 156 people on board and a 
fouryearold girl survived 
the air line pilots association attacked the report when it was 
released in may saying the safety board didnt give enough weight 
to mechanical failure of cockpit instruments 
in its report gao said the federal requirement for security 
checks involves only verifying pilots employment history for the 
prior five years 
airlines are responsible for developing their own hiring 
criteria in line with corporate preferences gao said 
it said 62 percent of the airlines surveyed did nothing to 
verify pilots certificates and 56 percent did not check with the 
faa to check on past safety violations fliers may have 
the research agency said for instance that pilots of a 
commuter plane that crashed in durango colo in january had 
received warning letters from the faa but the airline was not aware 
of the citations 
airlines should be encouraged to use the faas own computerized 
listings including the accidentincident data system and the 
enforcement information system to verify what the pilots provide 
and to give a broader background of the pilots gao concluded

a grand jury declined to indict five police 
officers for shooting an unarmed drugaddicted woman to death 
after a car chase but a sixth was charged with initially trying to 
cover up his role in the shooting 
the panel cleared the five officers of any criminal wrongdoing 
in the april 27 shooting of lidia ferraro 32 of fairview nj 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau announced wednesday 
the panel ruled that mrs ferraros death stemmed in part from 
her own actions and from an incorrect police radio transmission 
however the jury indicted sgt john oconnor 30 on charges he 
attempted to cover up his role in the incident by replacing three 
spent cartridges after he fired at mrs ferraros car in violation 
of police rules later he admitted he had shot at the car 
the shots were mistakenly reported over the police radio as 
shots fired by mrs ferraro 
oconnor who faces up to four years in prison if convicted on 
the charge of tampering with physical evidence pleaded innocent 
and was released without bail at his arraignment in state supreme 
court in manhattan a few hours later 
all six officers face possible departmental charges for firing 
their weapons in violation of regulations those rules allow 
officers to shoot only when a felony has been committed and police 
are in a lifethreatening situation they do not allow an officer 
to fire to stop a car 
oconnor has been suspended capt mark frances of the police 
departments field investigation unit said the other officers are 
on modified assignment 
the 8minute drama began when mrs ferraro high on drugs ran 
a red light morgenthau said officers in a radio car tried to stop 
her and the chase was on up and down streets of east harlem 
at one point oconnor stepped in front of mrs ferraros car 
and tried to stop it as the car swerved around oconnor he fired 
three shots at the tires 
morgenthau said mrs ferraro appeared not to hear officers as 
they shouted over the police cars public address system for her to 
stop 
assistant district attorney kristine hamann said toxicology 
reports showed she had therapeutic amounts of valium and 
methadone in her system and enough heroin and cocaine to cause an 
overdose in some people 
mrs ferraros husband guy said she was in a 
drugrehabilitation program 
because a radio transmission said 1013 shots fired police 
officers who joined the chase believed mrs ferraro had fired the 
shots a 1013 call means an officer needs help 
when mrs ferraros car stopped she leaned over toward the 
floor morgenthau said the cops mistakenly believing she was 
armed because of the radio warning and her movement inside the car 
shot her dead 
ms hamann said 16 shots were fired at mrs ferraro during the 
chase eleven bullets were fired after she stopped and she was hit 
five times 
a lawyer for the ferraro family john sullivan called the 
shooting an outrage the family has filed notice of a 25 million 
wrongful death suit against new york city

eastern airlines and its machinists union plan to 
continue contract talks despite reports that the moneylosing 
carrier is preparing to lay off 4000 workers and make deep service 
cuts 
the layoffs would affect mostly nonunion reservations and 
airport workers the miami herald reported most of the cuts would 
affect eastern destinations in the west and diminish kansas city 
mos status as a hub

carriers work force by 125 percent in up to 20 cities by this 
fall are expected to be announced friday

cooperation said charles bryan president of machinists district 
100 and head of easterns 12000 mechanics and groundservices 
workers they have no credibility absolutely none

management on safety matters could be jeopardized by the imminent 
reductions

air corp parent and three union leaders including bryan under 
federal guidance signed a peace treaty aimed at resolving disputes 
over safety matters 
in miami eastern spokesman robin matell called tuesdays

miami and atlanta and closed a reservations center in chicago

nine reservations centers

miami for briefings friday when negotiators for eastern and the 
pilots union are also scheduled to meet

parliament representing the area said wednesday it is 
unacceptable that the northwest should be made the worlds 
dustbin

importation on health grounds 
we understand that the rubbish will contain untreated waste 
from new york hospitals as well as animal fats and rotting 
vegetation councilor derek bateman was quoted as telling the 
daily telegraph newspaper the rubbish will not be covered so we 
will have the prospect of it blowing all over cheshire and exposing 
people to potential health risk 
the garbage which would have arrived in opentopped containers 
in liverpool would have been dumped on 390 acres owned by the 
company and leased by the council the telegraph reported 
a spokesman for the department of the environment said wednesday

a team of explorers plans to raise the worlds 
largest 19thcentury steam whaling ship from the frigid depths of 
the chukchi sea off alaska and even has visions of sailing the old 
vessel again 
the 177foot whaler orca which sank in september 1897 after it 
got wedged between two pieces of floating ice is like an 
underwater time capsule said project director dan w shirey 
we have found that the yearround belowfreezing temperatures 
of the water makes the ocean environment marine organismfree no 
other area of the world can offer such ideal preservation 
conditions for marine antiquities 
indeed the vessel once the pride of americas whaling fleet 
is believed to be so well preserved that shirey dreams of sailing 
it to a new home perhaps next to the queen mary in long beach 
calif or to the south street seaport in new york 
in this melting pot of new york the ship could find a home 
under the shadows of the lady statue of liberty herself he 
said at a news conference wednesday at the explorers club a 
private organization of professional explorers and scientists 
ninetyone years ago the orca owned by the pacific steam 
whaling co of san francisco sank sternfirst in about 100 feet 
of water off point franklin alaska the captain and crew escaped 
you couldnt have asked for a gentler shipwreck said 
shirey a former coast guard searchandrescue diver who founded 
the ocean research center of the arctic a nonprofit organization 
for preserving the regions maritime heritage it was established 
in 1985 at point barrow alaska 
on aug 6 he will lead a team of nine explorers to a base camp 
at peard bay alaska they will survey and photograph the wreck 
using small boats sonar and remotecontrolled undersea vehicles 
until about sept 30 when the ice moves back into place for the 
winter 
the 25 million phase 2 dredging beneath the 628ton vessel 
attaching large slings to its frame and lifting it with barges is 
to begin late next summer 
time is limited because a proposed offshore pipeline might 
disturb the historic wreck shirey said at the explorers club 
which is underwriting the 150000 first phase 
we found the whaling ships timbers to be wormfree and as 
structurally strong as if they were hewn and assembled in 1987 
said shirey 
scott murray dive coordinator said that in 1982 he helped 
raise a 186foot metal ship that sank in the 1930s in panama but 
no vessel as old as the orca has ever been recovered whole he said

when he saw one of the characters in the 
movie wall street led away in handcuffs after being arrested 
for insider trading tom dorsey thought about his newest employee 
and smiled at the irony 
the movie character faced the prospect of adjusting to life in 
prison dorseys employee thomas walker is finding his niche in 
the world of finance after being paroled from the state 
penitentiary 
the convicted felon is a graduate of an investment strategies 
course dorsey taught in the prison walker kept in touch with 
dorsey until his release last november and now is a securities 
analyst for dorsey wright and associates 
he created his own position dorsey said he would come in 
at night and read the wires and work with the computers on his own 
and eventually i started giving him certain tasks before long he 
became instrumental in the operation 
walker 31 was convicted in 1979 of arson armed robbery 
burglary and solicitation for murder and was sentenced to 36 years 
in prison 
i dont know if i could have gotten a job in this business if 
it hadnt been for tommy walker said getting your foot in the 
door is the hardest part 
walker who was a business administration major at the college 
of william amp mary before he ran afoul of the law said that before 
college he already had met a lot of people who were maybe a 
little shady 
most of the things we were involved in were burglary and 
arson he said we always rationalized what we did by saying 
our victims were probably insured 
walker said the solicitation for murder conviction was based on 
an undercover officers testimony that he tried to have the officer 
kill three people who had testified against him 
walker said it was the excitement of living on the edge that 
prompted his criminal behavior 
its like turning on miami vice he said you can either 
sit there and watch it or you can play miami vice i was playing 
it 
dorsey who was a vice president at wheat first securities 
before opening his own business in 1987 said walkers criminal 
background likely would have kept him out of other firms 
theres no way we could have hired him at wheat he said 
but all i care about is performance i dont give a damn if he 
has been in prison 
walker had served three years when he signed up for dorseys 
first investment strategies course 
i was always interested in business anyway said walker who 
is continuing his education at virginia commonwealth university 
when i heard about tommys course bells and whistles went off 
dorseys course started with the basics of supply and demand 
and he used the analogy of convicts swapping or selling cigarettes 
to illustrate his lessons when the students advanced further they 
were given a fictitious 15000 to invest with prize money going to 
the three who made the greatest profit 
i didnt do very well with my 15000 walker said i was 
too conservative 
but dorsey still was impressed 
he was one of the more quiet and reserved students dorsey 
said but he never missed a class and he always completed his 
assignments on time it was obvious he was serious about this

a pregnant 29yearold woman facing prison 
for fatally poisoning her son could receive a lenient sentence if 
she is sterilized a judge said 
she has no need for any more children i cant order this but 
she could consider sterilization it would be a mitigating 
circumstance said superior court judge roy f jones at a hearing 
wednesday on the medical status of melody baldwin 
jones proposal was called outrageous by the indiana civil 
liberties union 
miss baldwin whose baby is due in september pleaded guilty 
june 10 to child neglect she could be sentenced to 20 years in 
prison for admitting she gave joshua baldwin 4 a fatal dose of a 
depressant in may 1986 
miss baldwins sentencing was postponed last week because of 
medical problems including excessive vomiting she was under close 
observation in a psychiatric ward after trying to remove an

she was not in court wednesday but her lawyer michael j 
donahoe said he would tell her about the sterilization proposal

residents of the ancestral home of michael 
dukakis feasted on lamb danced and drank ouzo toasts early today 
at an allnight party to celebrate his nomination as the democratic 
presidential candidate 
more than 200 people gathered at the village cafe cheered wildly 
as staterun greek television announced in its midnight newscast 
that the massachusetts governor was certain to get the 
nomination 
its an important event for our village tonight its one more 
step towards the november election said costas stefanou 42 
president of the this mountain village of 640 residents on the 
northern aegean island of mytilene 
the crowd toasted the man they call our michalis with beer 
and ouzo an aniseflavored drink that is an island specialty then 
they feasted on spitroast lamb and danced to bouzouki music 
watched by a line of children perched on a fence wearing mike 
dukakis for president buttons 
both of dukakis paternal grandparents were born in pelopi but 
moved away in the 1880s to open a store in the turkish town of 
edremit where the governors father was born edremit is 40 miles 
from mytilene across a narrow aegean sea strait 
a local priest the rev lefteris kamiris said that nov 8 the 
presidential election date is especially auspicious for the 
island 
now that michalis has the nomination theres no way hes not 
going to get elected on that day kamiris said 
kamiris said nov 8 is the feastday of st michael the patron 
saint of pelopi that day too marks the date in 1921 that 
mytilene was granted independence from turkish rule 
kamiris who paints icons sacred pictures of saints displayed 
in greek orthodox churches also was responsible for the signs 
that identify pelopi in greek and english as the hometown of 
michael dukakis 
we feel proud that someone from our island can get so far 
its changed our lives he said 
a trickle of tourists has started coming to pelopi looking for 
the dukakis family home 
all the visitors bothered us a bit at first but we dont mind 
now its good to have people wanting to visit the house where it 
all started said yiannis manolis whose father bought and 
rebuilt the ruined dukakis home in 1933 
the yellowing sale contract signed by panos dukakis the 
governors father is proudly shown to visitors 
panos dukakis emigrated to the united states in 1913 and became 
the first greekamerican to graduate from harvard medical school 
the village council already has renamed the main street michael 
dukakis street and intends to offer the presidential candidate a 
mountainside plot of land where he can build a summer home 
michalis could do some gardening maybe grow watermelons 
said stefanou who recalled that on his one and only visit to 
pelopi in 1976 the governor enjoyed the local melons 
were proud that someone who hails from pelopi might become 
the most powerful man in the world said alexander chiotellis 
who acted as dukakis host on that visit and claims to be his 
second cousin 
the villagers mostly sheep and goat breeders also say a 
dukakis election victory might improve the quality of life in 
pelopi 
if hes elected the government may finally decide to pave the 
top part of the road to the village after all if he comes here as 
president he cant drive up a dirt track stefanou said 
a selfstyled local poet already has composed what he calls an 
ode to dukakis 
dukakis comes from our village our beautiful island of 
lesbos eleftherios yiannakos recited on wednesday night 
lesbos is the ancient greek name for mytilene 
all the villagers are lovingly concerned to see him as 
president in america the 20line poem continues

police said today they have destroyed 
the criminal records of about 38000 people sent to army 
reeducation camps in a 1980 crackdown on dissent 
police said the names were removed from police computers and 
other lists to prevent unfair treatment of the former suspects 
having such a record would make it difficult to get employment

to army barracks for reeducation periods of four to six months 
in an extensive crackdown in 1980 after he seized power with 
military backing 
authorities said at the time that people sent to the camps were 
criminals and hooligans dissidents contend many were 
antigovernment activists and innocent of any crimes 
dissidents have claimed a number of people were killed or 
injured in the camps 
army chief of staff lee jongku told the national assembly 
wednesday that the army operated the reeducation camps in 1980 to 
purify criminals opposition lawmakers called for government 
compensation to victims

the death of a vice officer who was wounded twice 
during a robbery and shot a third time after pleading with the 
gunman for his life was a coldblooded execution police said 
homicide investigators said late wednesday they had no new leads 
and have made no arrests in the death of officer elston howard 26 
who was to be married in two weeks 
they said however they have a good description of the gunman

raid jacket and at that point shot the officer at least twice 
turner said 
after the gunman fired the officer attempted to struggle with 
the armed suspect police spoksman al baker said 
the officer fell to the ground and as he was laying on the 
ground begging the suspect not to shoot at him anymore the 
suspect fired again he said 
it was just a straight coldblooded execution homicide 
sgt john silva said 
the gunman then robbed the clerk telling him give me the 
money or youre going to be next silva said the man fled in a 
vehicle with a small amount of cash 
howards partner was moving their unmarked police car when the 
shooting occurred and did not realize what had happened police 
said 
howard had been with the police department for five years and is 
the first houston police officer killed in the line of duty in six 
years 
in january dallas police officer john chase was killed while 
begging for his life from a vagrant man standing over him with the 
officers own gun taken during a scuffle the vagrant was cheered

a mayor who donned a white turban red cape 
and two rubber snakes as he proclaimed national voodoo week is 
an embarrassment and should be removed from office alabamas 
attorney general said 
but florala mayor ht mathis 85 said he was only seeking 
publicity wednesday with his candlelit midnight news conference 
near a table covered with halloween masks and a black rubber bat 
attorney general don siegelman has accused mathis of 
mismanagement and improperly pardoning drunken drivers mathis is 
fighting the charges and faces an impeachment trial next month 
he continues to be a threat to the public safety and an 
embarrassment to the people of florala and covington county 
siegelman said 
mathis said the voodoo week is aimed at promoting publicity and 
peace for his town of 2200 on the alabamaflorida border 
mathis denied believing in black magic and said the media had 
turned him into the voodoo mayor so he would use the 
opportunity for publicity 
the voodoo story like a television commercial has notified 
thousands of people that florala is a solid little town and its 
ideally located for any type of industry mathis said 
mathis attracted national attention last fall when he sprinkled 
what he said was voodoo dust around city hall 
following the initial reports of the voodoo dust mathis said 
the powder actually was cornstarch he placed there because the 
police chief believed in voodoo the chief denied such beliefs 
in a telephone interview wednesday mathis said the powder was 
neither voodoo dust nor cornstarch 
back right after i was elected we had some information that we 
had some witchcraft going on in city hall and we figured it was 
making a difference somebody gave me the idea that if i sprinkled 
sulfur and put up some pictures of owls that would take care of it 
scare them 
they tell me people who are interested in witchcraft are 
definitely scared of sulfur sure enough the socalled police 
chief came in and pitched a fit what it was i just wasnt careful 
enough 
police chief av patrick has denied believing in the occult 
but declined to comment wednesday i just dont put nothing in 
the paper i dont even want to talk about it

prime minister brian mulroney has rejected an 
opposition demand that he call a general election before the 
ratification of a historic trade agreement with the united states 
at an appropriate time there will be an election the 
conservative leader said wednesday 
mulroney and president reagan signed the uscanada free trade 
agreement on jan 2 the treaty would eliminate tariffs in the 150 
billion a year trading partnership and dismantle nontariff 
barriers in investment energy and other sectors 
the issue of free trade with the united states has divided 
candians for a century 
during a heated exchange in the house of commons on wednesday 
the opposition liberal party vowed to block ratification until 
mulroney calls an election 
liberal leader john turner said canadians have a right to vote 
on the wisdom of linking their economy more closely with the united 
states 
let the people decide he said this is a basic democratic 
issue allowing the people of canada to decide on a matter which is 
critical to our future 
turner who served briefly as prime minister in 1984 maintains 
that a trade pact would make canada subservient to its giant 
neighbor 
unable to defeat the deal in the elected house of commons where 
mulroneys conservatives have 208 of the 282 seats turner asked 
the liberal majority in the appointed senate to delay passage until 
after a general election 
the upper chamber has amending powers that can delay legislation 
for a year or more 
liberal senate leader allan maceachen said the chamber would 
comply with turners request 
the free trade agreement is scheduled to go into effect jan 1 
1989 provided parliament and us congress pass implementing 
legislation the reagan administration is expected to introduce the 
final legislative package to congress next week 
sen majority leader robert byrd dw va said wednesday that 
a canadian election wouldnt automatically hold up us approval of 
the agreement 
the house of commons approved it in principle july 6 and has 
scheduled a third and final reading in midaugust after committee 
hearings the legislation then goes to the senate which has a 
large liberal majority 
canadas two opposition parties the liberals and socialist new 
democrats accuse mulroney of sacrificing the nations sovereignty 
but mulroney claims the deal will create prosperity and shield 
canada from us protectionism 
we have today a violation of one of the most fundamental 
precepts of british parliamentary democracy where the leader of 
the liberal party asks the senate to hijack the most fundamental 
rights of the canadian house of commons the prime minister said 
turner said that if the conservatives are reelected the senate 
would pass the freetrade legislation quickly before the jan 1 
effective date 
mulroneys fiveyear term expires in september 1989 but he can 
call an election any time prime ministers usually choose the 
fourth year of their mandate but mulroney has delayed an election 
call until parliament passes freetrade and other key legislation 
turners action could force mulroney to rethink his strategy and 
go to the voters this fall canadian election campaigns normally 
last two months 
this means that if mulroney wants to get the bill passed in time 
for the startup date of the trade deal an election must be called 
by about midoctober

north korea today proposed a meeting of all north 
korean and south korean legislators to debate a declaration of 
nonaggression drafted by the north 
north koreas official korean central news agency said the 
proposal was made in a letter today to south koreas national 
assembly speaker kim chaesun 
the news agency said the letter was from chairman yang hyong sop 
of north koreas supreme peoples assembly it proposed that the 
meeting be held in august in the north korean capital pyongyang 
said the news report monitored in tokyo 
there was no immediate reaction in seoul to the norths proposal 
both koreas have proposed nonaggression pacts in the past 
however this was the first time a proposal was made to debate a 
nonaggression pact through a joint southnorth parliamentary 
meeting said radio press a japanese agency that monitors 
communist broadcasts 
korea was split into the communist north and the capitalist 
south at the end of world war ii in 1945 the divided halves fought 
the threeyear korean war that ended in an armistice signed between 
the usbacked united nations command and north korea on july 27 
1953 
a full text of the letter carried by kcna said the north 
proposes the joint parliamentary meetings be held alternately in 
seoul and pyongyang following the proposed initial session in the 
north korean capital with yang and kim serving as cochairmen 
yang would preside over the meetings in pyongyang and kim over 
the ones in seoul it said 
in seoul kims aides confirmed the national assembly speaker 
recieved the north korean letter through the truce village of 
panmunjom inside the korean demilitarized zone the officials 
however said the contents of the letter would be distributed to 
the various political parties in the national assembly before it 
was made public 
the norths letter read all the participants will take part 
freely in the debate of agenda items and as for the method of 
adoption it will be good we think to decide by majority in 
combination of ballots and show of hands making our deputies 
equivalent to your members for the fairness and justness though 
the number of our deputies to the supreme peoples assembly is 
bigger than yours 
the norths rubberstamp parliament which meets only several 
days during an annual regular session in february or march had 655 
members when it was elected in november 1986 the souths national 
assembly has 299 members 166 of them opposition members

five managers at the three mile island 2 
nuclear plant have been disciplined for not doing enough to stop a 
control room supervisor from sleeping on the job the plant 
operator says 
gpu nuclear corp said wednesday it had fired an employee 
reassigned two and reprimanded two 
the action was prompted by an independent report critical of 
managements role in dealing with the sleeping allegations said 
gpu spokesman doug bedell 
following company policy the workers were not identified 
the report by former new jersey division of criminal justice 
director edwin h stier concluded that managers did not 
aggressively investigate allegations in 1986 and 1987 that the 
control room shift supervisor was sleeping on duty thus indirectly 
allowing the situation to continue 
the shift supervisor was fired nov 27 after an earlier report 
by stier found the sleeping had occurred as early as 1983 and 
continued into 1987 
the unit 2 reactor site of the nations worst commercial 
nuclear accident has been shut down since 1979 the shift 
supervisor oversees staff fireprotection systems and radiation 
monitors at the plant 
the latest report said management failed to probe the 
allegations fully accepted denials by the supervisor and 
discounted others statements resulting in inaccurate and 
distorted information being passed on to the nuclear regulatory 
commission 
there was a breakdown in communication between the operating 
crews and the gpu managers immediately above them such that the 
managers failed to learn the extent of the supervisors 
inattentiveness the report said 
nrc spokesman karl abraham said the agency had received the 
report but had not made a determination whether there were any 
regulatory violations 
bedell acknowledged that the allegations had been handled poorly 
they managers didnt get a full picture of what occurred 
the situation festered bedell said we have lessons to learn 
as far as supervisory techniques this was not handled well

running today in the armenian republic despite a strike call by 
activists seeking to annex a part of neighboring azerbaijan 
residents and staterun media said 
soviet authorities increased pressure on leaders of the 
5monthold campaign to make nagornokarabakh part of armenia the 
government on wednesday ordered a leading armenian nationalist 
paruyr ayrikyan stripped of his citizenship and expelled 
speakers at a wednesday night rally in yerevan armenias

leaderships refusal to alter the status of nagornokarabakh a 
mostly armenian enclave that has been part of azerbaijan for 65 
years

no obvious effect in yerevan today

mass transit is running the former political prisoner said in a 
telephone interview 
the official tass news agency in a dispatch from the city of 
11 million said that since monday more and more industrial 
enterprises of armenia have begun to work at a normal pace 
those who did not work or didnt work at their full capacity 
are returning to their jobs in yerevan kirovakan and other 
cities tass said 
a watch officer at armenias ministry of internal affairs which 
handles police matters said everybody is working and the 
situation is normal he identified himself only as grant 
however a worker with the gostelradio state broadcasting 
authority in stepanakert nagornokarabakhs administrative center 
said today that a general strike begun in may in the mountain 
enclave was continuing 
the people are embittered said the worker who refused to 
give his name we dont know what to do but we know that the 
refusal to make nagornokarabakh part of armenia wasnt just 
most armenians are christians while most azerbaijanis are 
moslem most of the disputed regions 160000 people are 
aremanians the armenians there say they are discriminated against 
by the azerbaijanis 
the presidium of the supreme soviet with the blessing of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev ruled monday that annexing the region 
to armenia would violate the soviet constitution since azerbaijan 
had objected to the transfer 
activists said at least 400000 people attended wednesdays 
rally near a yerevan historical institute those figures could not 
be independently confirmed because moscowbased western reporters 
are prevented from traveling to the region 
speakers at the rally read the official tass news agency report 
about ayrikyans expulsion people raised fists and shouted 
ayrikyan ayrikyan freedom freedomsaid an activist who spoke 
on condition of anomymity 
the presidium on monday also authorized police to take 
essential measures to end strikes and any activities directed 
at kindling national strife and attempts to misuse democratic 
rights for antidemocratic purposes 
todays tass dispatch from yerevan attacked leaders of the 
annexation drive by name accusing them of criminal activities and 
of trying to stir up ethnic tensions

kazaryan of armenias academy of sciences tried to provide a 
coverup for shadow economy dealers for clans of careerseekers 
and bribetakers

karabakh committee a group created to organize the annexation 
drive were arrested when they brought 35 gasoline bombs to a 
monday rally in yerevan tass said 
it called the committee a group of demagogues who wish to 
further their selfish aims under the cover of problems of 
nagornokarabakh and said some members received wages during an 
earlier general strike in armenia 
the first major target of the official crackdown was ayrikyan 
39 who has been jailed or exiled for 17 years beginning in 1969 
for his political activities 
tass said the presidium stripped him of citizenship wednesday 
and expelled him for his active instigation to interethnic 
strife the news agency did not say where the activist was headed 
or whether he had left soviet territory 
ayrikyan helped organize the drive to annex nagornokarabakh and 
provided frequent reports to foreign correspondents he was 
arrested march 25 and charged with defaming the soviet state

being his cousin to one of the great parts 
its a very special time in your life said miss dukakis 
just hours before she was to present the democratic presidential 
nominee to the delegates before a nationwide television audience 
many of whom saw her spirited pitch for him when she accepted an 
academy award in april 
my dream was and still is to play the great parts she said 
in an interview on cbstv asked if being the candidates cousin is 
a great part she replied it certainly is

acceptance speech

convention hall michael dukakis and the leadership and values he 
will bring to america 
the seasoned stage and movie actress acknowledged being a bit 
nervous about her appearance at center stage of the democratic 
national convention 
on broadway you get a chance to rehearse she said here i 
dont get much of a chance to rehearse 
dukakis and miss dukakis fathers both greek immigrants 
were brothers and raised their families near each other in the 
boston area she now lives in new jersey where she failed in an 
attempt to win election as a delegate for dukakis but was later 
named an atlarge delegate 
when she accepted the oscar for her supporting role in the movie 
moonstruck miss dukakis held the trophy high over her head and 
called out ok michael lets go 
that came just before the new york primary which dukakis won in 
the early part of a string of primary victories that secured him 
the nomination 
he returned the surprise a few weeks later strolling 
unannounced onto the set of a boston television program as she was 
being interviewed

campaign audiences of his and his cousins successes declaring 
1988 the year of the dukaki a comment she also made backstage 
after claiming her oscar

and said she spoke to dukakis several times she promised to 
campaign vigorously for her cousin in the fall campaign

dukaki she shrugged her shoulders in a manner characteristic 
of her politician cousin

vietnams foreign minister has pledged 
to try to resolve by the end of the year 70 cases of missing us 
servicemen that the united states considers of highest priority 
voice of vietnam said today 
minister nguyen co thach was quoted as saying he welcomed us 
participation in joint excavations for the remains of missing 
servicemen 
the united states is trying to account for nearly 1800 
americans missing in action from the vietnam war which ended in 
april 1975 with a communist victory over the usbacked south 
vietnamese government 
us forces lost 58000 soldiers during the war 
the radio broadcast monitored in bangkok said thach wrote a 
letter july 9 to retired gen john w vessey a special 
presidential envoy in which he urged the united states to carry 
out all agreements relating to humanitarian issues relating to 
vietnam 
the letter apparently referred to an august 1987 agreement 
between thach and vessey in which vietnam agreed to accelerate the 
search for mia remains in return washington sent in medical teams 
and encouraged private agencies to help the former enemy with 
medical problems including rehabilitation of veterans disabled in 
the war 
hanoi has indicated it wants more us help 
the official radio said vessey welcomed vietnams readiness to 
hold joint excavations for remains it said that in a letter 
monday vessey said he hoped cooperation between the two countries 
could be expanded and also affirmed that the us side will 
continue trying to respond to vietnams humanitarian concerns 
in august 1987 vessey gave thach a list of 70 cases of missing 
us servcemen and he asked vietnam to pursue them on a priority 
basis washington says that in these socalled discrepancy 
cases there is strong evidence the vietnamese know what happened 
to the missing men 
voice of vietnam said vietnams foreign minister nguyen co 
thach affirms vietnams efforts to solve before the end of this 
year 70 cases of americans missing in action considered priority by 
the us side he welcomes the us side for joint efforts in 
seeking out and excavating the remains of mias in august september 
and october this year 
in late 1985 the two countries carried out a joint excavation 
of a us b52 crash site to search for remains but there have 
been no additional excavations despite vietnamese pledges to hold 
them 
this month vietnam turned over what were believed to be the 
remains of 25 us servicemen one of the largest returns of 
remains since the war ended

the democratic prize in his grasp at last 
michael dukakis readied the convention speech today that he hopes 
will distill the essence of his presidential candidacy and 
mobilize a united party for victory this fall against republican 
george bush 
the 54yearold massachusetts governor formally claims the 
nomination tonight with a nationally televised acceptance speech 
concluding the most harmonious party convention in more than a 
decade 
its all a little bit like a play said dukakis his face 
breaking into a smile the moment californias delegates gave him 
the roll call majority that assured his triumph wednesday night 
over jesse jackson 
i feel terrific the nominee said 
dukakis visited the convention hall early today for a second 
look at the podium accompanied by aides he asked numerous 
questions about the setup and took notes with paper and pen 
he cleared the rest of his schedule today to give himself plenty 
of time to apply his personal finishing touches to one of the most 
important speeches of his political career 
for much of the public that will be watching this speech it 
will be the first serious look at who michael dukakis is and where 
he wants to take this country said christopher edley the 
campaigns issues director so an effort to distill the essence 
of the candidacy is perfectly appropriate 
dukakis watched the climactic roll call on television from his 
hotel suite a few blocks from the omni convention hall in downtown 
atlanta he was surrounded by his mother euterpe his wife kitty 
and their children kara andrea and john as well as top aides and 
friends 
cheers they shouted raising champagne glasses to celebrate 
dukakis allowed himself little display of emotion he smiled 
jabbed the air with his right fist and lifted his glass to toast 
the end of a long and tumultuous contest 
dukakis worked on his speech wednesday after meeting briefly 
with jackson his former rival to discuss the fall campaign 
dukakis sat in an easy chair in the bedroom of his hotel suite 
revising a draft of his speech with a pen 
good good was all he would say in describing progress on 
the speech that his aides said already had been through three major 
rewrites 
the aides said dukakis planned no major surprises in his speech 
but would stick to the basic themes he had laid out during the 
primaries 
edley said dukakis would focus mainly on economic opportunity 
and security for americans through affordable housing quality 
education health care and advance notice of plant closings to 
workers losing their jobs 
he also planned to demand a redirection of us foreign policy 
in such regions as central america and south africa 
dukakis has strongly criticized administrationbacked us aid 
to the contra rebels fighting nicaragua as well as the 
administrations dealings with the south african government which 
he says has engaged in terrorist acts 
his aides said dukakis would not try to elicit the kind of 
emotion that jackson arouses with his fervent oratory but would 
seek to display the consistency of the message he has delivered 
throughout his campaign for the nomination 
the message doesnt change from week to week the themes dont 
change from week to week edley said theres a steadiness to 
what this campaign is about and a line of continuity from his 
announcement speech straight through to the inaugural address 
edley said the dukakis speech like jacksons on tuesday night 
would be kind of a greatest hits collection from his earlier 
campaign speeches 
were going to let dukakis be dukakis edley said 
he will criticize the republicans for romantic attachment to 
the status quo in both domestic and foreign policy edley said 
but the speech is not planned as stridently partisan 
it will be a positive speech edley said there is not 
going to be a harsh partisan edge to it that is not the dukakis 
style

the copilot thought to have been at the 
controls of a commuter plane that crashed feb 19 killing 12 
people had been all over the sky in training flights a 
veteran pilot has told federal investigators 
kathy digan didnt have a feel for the airplane robert 
haller said in a march interview with the national transportation 
safety board her landings were interesting to say the least 
twice she almost put us in the weeds 
according to documents released wednesday by the ntsb digan was 
believed to be flying the twinengine plane because pilot walter 
cole acknowledged an air traffic controllers clearance to take off 
on the night of the crash that killed everyone aboard 
the pilot using the radio customarily would not be at the 
controls the safety board said 
moments after takeoff in heavy fog from raleighdurham 
international airport the richmond vabound american eagle metro 
iii plane crashed into the shore of a reservoir 3000 feet from 
the airports 10000foot runway 
a barry strauch the ntsbs chief investigator said ms 
digans problems did not necessarily mean she caused the crash in 
a telephone interview from washington strauch told the news and 
observer of raleigh the agency hadnt determined the cause 
the ntsb has said ms digan had spotty training records but was 
qualified to fly the plane on the night of the crash 
although no mechanical failure has been found in the planes 
engines or propellers strauch said other mechanical components are 
still being tested 
in two documents haller an american eagle pilot described 
problems he noticed in training flights with ms digan in september 
1987 she didnt know where she was in relation to the airport 
he said she was all over the sky 
in a sept 15 evaluation report haller noted ms digans 
deficiencies in flying a metro iii she is way behind the 
airplane has not developed a feel for the airplane is having a 
hard time handling the speed has a tendency to over control and 
she has real underlined problems landing 
made two decent landings in fullmonth haller wrote her 
flying was not improving during the month she continued to make 
the same mistakes 
haller discussed ms digans problems with other airline 
officials the documents said one told him that ms digans mother 
was seriously ill and that her ability would improve once she got 
over family problems 
haller who now works for eastern airlines stated in march that 
the last comments he heard regarding ms digan indicated she was 
improving 
in september haller and billie minix an american eagle 
employee designated by the federal aviation administration to check 
pilot qualifications agreed ms digan was not qualified to fly the 
metro iii 
earlier in july minix had recommended firing ms digan after 
she failed two landing tests while trying to qualify on a metro ii 
a predecessor of the metro iii with slightly shorter wings and less 
powerful engines 
documents released wednesday also include sworn statements from 
a top faa official that ms digan was not qualified to make a 
takeoff on the night of the crash 
the documents also include statements from avair which operated 
american eagle and faa officials saying the pilots met 
requirements avairs lawyer william f womble jr also said the 
pilots met training requirements

the times of london independent said in an editorial today 
gov michael dukakis has proved that he is a highly successful 
campaign chief executive he now has to prove that he can campaign 
he can raise money far more than his rivals he showed 
himself sufficiently able in matters of policy to survive the early 
loss of his principal adviser his tough not to say brutal 
treatment of the rev jesse jackson has insured against one of the 
easiest jibes aimed by republicans at democratic leaders that they 
are weak under pressure 
he can learn from past mistakes it is plain that the chief 
errors made by the democrats in the last two presidential races 
will not be repeated above all the link to narrow but vocal 
singleinterest campaigns has been broken 
the inclusion of mr jackson as a third force behind the 
ticket has been done without apparent cost in terms of unacceptable 
policies the convention declined to support mr jacksons calls 
for increased taxes on the wealthy or an undertaking on 
nofirstuse of nuclear weapons 
the democratic platform this year is for the first time in 
many campaigns not a liability to the candidate

le figaro conservative on dukakis certainly his lack of 
humor his mechanical elocution his technocratic vocabulary his 
stormy character hes said to have fragile nerves are not in 
his favor but he compensates for these faults with a serious 
nature and a sense of organization without fail and his 
mediterranean charm drawn from contained passion pleases women 
the result is that the party is more united than it has ever 
been does the credit go to mike dukakis himself to the choice of 
a southern conservative lloyd bentson as running mate to the 
support of jesse jackson to all of these elements put together 
opinions as always are split

illegal prolibyan activities in the united states an 
administration source says 
the man mousa hawamda is a naturalized american who was 
identified wednesday at an arraignment hearing for six of those 
arrested in the alleged scheme which prosecutors said involved 
diversion of libyan funds to support antiamerican activities 
hawamda was described as a libyan intelligence operative who 
operates under the guise of a washington travel agency owner 
us attorney henry hudson said that based on information 
received by the fbi hawamda was involved in a potential plot to 
assassinate a high government official of the united states 
hudson did not identify the official or give any other details 
but another official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the target was north a former national security 
council aide and a major player in the irancontra arms and money 
scandal 
north who was fired from his nsc post in november 1986 over 
allegations that he illegally funneled money to the contra rebels 
in nicaragua masterminded counterterrorism operations against 
libya including the april 1986 aerial bombing of tripoli 
during the congressional hearings on the irancontra affair 
north said threats against his life had prompted him to install a 
security fence around his home 
the eight who were arrested wednesday by the fbi were brought 
before judges and ordered held without bail pending detention 
hearings later this week six of the men appeared before a us 
magistrate in nearby alexandria va and were then led out with 
their hands and legs shackled another one was being held in 
detroit the eighth was picked up in denver 
hudson said defendant saleh mohamed guima alrajhi 32 had 
given the libyan government a list of us officials who may have 
been involved in the 1986 us bombing of libya the prosecutor 
said this was done for the purpose of retaliation by libya 
this is a rare case a sensitive case involving national

obtained much of the information leading to the arrests from 
informants whose lives were in danger 
our intention is to try and protect them as long as 
possible hudson said

peoples committee for libyan students based in mclean va the

for the company according to the fbi

pay for some 200 americans among them black muslims and indians 
to travel to libya for antiamerican demonstrations 
the violations carry a possible penalty of five years 
imprisonment and up to a 250000 fine 
travel to libya is prohibited by us sanctions imposed on that 
country in 1981 and 1986 because of its alleged involvement in 
international terrorism however the united states allowed the 
libyan organization to open an office here in 1986 in order to 
provide financial support for some 200 libyan students in the 
country 
in affidavits presented to the court the prosecution said 
hawamdas manara travel agency in downtown washington was begun 
with 35000 provided by libyan intelligence the agency supplied 
false billing information to the student organization to hide the 
real use of the money according to the documents 
the other defendants are the student committees chairman 
milad shibani 34 former chairman salem omar zubeidy 39 a 
graduate student at the university of michigan mahdi mohammad 
abousetta 35 ramadan taher belgasem 33 adel ali sennosi 30

civil rights and womens groups winning over some skeptical 
delegates and trading accolades with jesse jackson and michael 
dukakis

growth the 67yearold senator told reporters wednesday 
bentsen took more than an hour to practice his speech wednesday 
in a room backstage at the omni convention center joined by his 
wife beryl ann known as ba he returned to the hall today to 
check out the podium from which hell give the address

a man accused of a bombing outside a 
nuclear weapons laboratory nov 28 will be confined to a mental 
hosital for 18 months in a deal with prosecutors under which 
criminal charges will be dropped 
the agreement concluded wednesday with stephen dwyer 40 of 
palm desert was reached a day after us district judge marilyn 
hall patel criticized the governments handling of an immunity 
agreement with him 
we felt it was in the governments interest and the publics 
interest to secure his commitment to some facility rather than risk 
the outright dismissal of the case and his release said 
assistant us attorney joel levin 
dwyer was charged with setting off a dynamite bomb next to the 
lawrence livermore laboratory a facility 40 miles east of san 
francisco where us nuclear weapons are designed he could have 
received up to 40 years in prison 
the bomb demolished a laboratory employees car damaged three 
other cars broke dozens of windows and scattered debris for 400 
yards 
dwyer was charged with interstate transport of explosives 
making and possessing a bomb and damaging federal property 
from the standpoint of my client hes going to be getting 
some medical help that i think he needs said public defender 
barry portman theres no getting around what he did this isnt 
a person with all his wits about him 
the fbi said dwyer a miner bought materials for the bomb at a 
shop in reno nev 
dwyers lawyers had contended the charges were based on evidence 
provided by dwyer under a promise of immunity prosecutors said the 
agreement was not binding because dwyer lied about a bomb at a 
nuclear facility in the los angeles area 
the agreement was not written down because of the apparent 
urgency of the situation said j stephen czuleger the federal 
prosecutor who handled the case in los angeles 
patel on tuesday said she was unsatisfied with the cursory 
casual way the government had handled the immunity agreement

fourengine dc6 went down wednesday night said a lafourche parish 
sheriffs dispatcher who would not identify himself 
there apparently were no survivors but you never know 
sheriff duffy breaux said wednesday 
the taca international airlines charter was on a fivehour 
flight from san salvador el salvador to new orleans with 22000 
pounds of handicrafts seafood plants electronics and other 
cargo said gary mascaro taca cargo manager at new orleans 
international airport

forced down short of the airport 
an faa controller who asked not to be identified said the 
planes pilot reported at 720 pm wednesday that he had just 15 
minutes of fuel remaining that he would be unable to reach new 
orleans and had to find a closer airfield 
the nearest field north of grand isle at fouchon had a 
3000foot runway but the propellerdriven dc6 needed 5000 feet 
and its pilot decided to ditch the faa spokesman said 
the plane hit a levee and crashed in a drainage canal about 300 
to 400 yards west of louisiana highway 1 about 40 miles south of 
new orleans breaux said the area is surrounded by swamps and

a mistake that damaged a space shuttle 
booster rocket intended for a crucial test firing resulted from 
confusion during a shift change at morton thiokols plant a nasa 
official said 
the accident occurred july 9 when a worker testing one of the 
rockets three field joints inadvertently switched pressurization 
lines and damaged insulation that helps contain superhot exhaust 
gases during flight 
the damage at thiokols plant west of here delayed a testfiring 
of the rocket motor this month until late august company officials 
said 
thiokols booster was redesigned after a presidential commission 
found that a faulty joint was responsible for the jan 28 1986 
explosion that destroyed the space shuttle challenger and grounded 
the us manned space flight program 
the booster firing test is the last of five required on the 
redesigned rocket before shuttle flights can resume 
royce mitchell director of nasas shuttle rocket motor program 
said a replacement shift had come on duty just before the accident 
and the fresh workers incorrectly believed the first crew had 
checked the equipment 
that little significant piece of data was lost between the 
two crews mitchell said in a telephone interview tuesday from 
the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
he said the second crew would have discovered the hoses were 
improperly attached if they had checked them before the 
pressurization test one of many tests in preparation for a 
testfiring 
he said that after the accident company workers and nasa 
officials inspected the motor and found that a seal had been 
deformed when the hose sent 950 pounds per square inch of pressure 
into the joint instead of the intended 100 psi 
the joint was repaired and the rocket is being reassembled for 
the test firing

a former nuclear engineer with westinghouse 
electric corp says he was fired for raising safety concerns at a 
georgia nuclear plant but the company says he was dismissed for 
punching a supervisor 
in a lawsuit against westinghouse terry dysert said the 
pittsburghbased company fabricated the assault charge to justify 
his dismissal 
he said he actually was fired for complaining about faults in a 
safety system at the vogtle power station near augusta ga that 
could prevent control room operators from recognizing problems in 
the reactors core 
a worstcase scenario would be what happened at three mile 
island dysert 39 formerly of pittsburgh and now of coconut 
grove fla said wednesday 
westinghouse spokesman bob henderson said georgia power co 
which built the plant investigated dyserts complaints and the 
matter was resolved to the satisfaction of georgia power the 
nuclear regulatory commission and even of dysert 
westinghouse which designed the georgia plant denied there 
were any problems of the sort he alleged 
the employees dismissal was totally unrelated to the safety 
concerns he had raised henderson said westinghouse employees 
are encouraged to express safety concerns and may do so without 
fear of intimidation or harassment 
labor department area director john obrien while acknowledging 
that dysert was not a diplomat about the matter concluded 
earlier that dyserts safety complaints ruffled feathers and 
ultimately led to his termination 
obrien noted that westinghouse had previously disregarded the 
alleged assault 
however administrative law judge george pierce to whom 
westinghouse appealed rejected dyserts claim to be a protected 
whistleblower under the law and said he was fired for the alleged 
assault not for raising safety concerns 
in his suit filed friday in state court in philadelphia dysert 
contends he was fired in july 1986 for complaining about the 
adequacy of tests performed on a monitoring system in the unit 1 
reactor at vogtle which went on line in june 1987 after more than 
15 years of controversy over cost and safety 
the instruments monitor water levels in the primary cooling 
system critical to the reactors safe operation 
dysert said he found three problems a leak in the emergency 
cooling system oil in the system and faulty electronic equipment 
gauging water levels which he said his supervisor ignored 
there is the potential that if the system was used alone the 
plant operators would be led to make a wrong decision they may 
decide theres no problem at all he said 
dysert said his supervisor transferred him when he asked to have 
the tests rerun he was later fired accused of having assaulted 
his team leader in the parking lot of a georgia motel after work

the us survey foot which is defined as 12003937ths of a 
meter 
thats less than a millionth of an inch longer

irans parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani said today he wept listening to ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini say that iran would accept a un ceasefire resolution 
tehran radio reported 
rafsanjani also told iranians not to question the decision 
we should not ask why and how not create more problems for 
the society rafsanjani who is also commander of the armed 
forces said in parliament 
a un team will visit iran and iraq this week to try to work 
out details of implementing the resolution 
the radio monitored in nicosia also said that four more bodies 
from the iran air jetliner shot down by a us missile july 3 had 
been recovered the bodies all male were found near the southern 
coastal city of bandarlengeh about 120 miles from the area of the 
southern persian gulf where the plane went down it said 
the bodies of 186 of the 290 people on board have been 
recovered the navy said troops mistook the plane for an f14 
fighter and shot it down 
the radio report said iran obtained the equipment needed to 
search for the flight recorder and would begin hunting for it soon 
us officials have said they hope the recorder will reveal 
whether the civilian pilot monitored warnings from the missile 
cruiser uss vincennes 
the islamic republic news agency reported that iraq shelled the 
village of sardasht in northern azerbaijan province along the 
soviet border and killed one civilian and injured two 
on wednesday khomeini said he accepted the advice of other 
iranian leaders and agreed to a un resolution calling for a 
ceasefire in the war between the persian gulf neighbors that began 
in september 1980 
rafsanjani said iranians could take stock of the reason for 
accepting un resolution 598 some time in the future and that 
they would accept the fact that khomeini changed his mind 
until this week khomeini had been adamant in opposing an end to 
the war and vowed to continue until president saddam hussein of 
iraq was driven from power 
rafsanjani repeated that iran will continue to man the 
warfronts and mohsen rezai commander in chief of the 
revolutionary guard corps said the same in an interview today 
if any change occurs in the resolution we will stand against 
it and will respond to any aggression rezai said 
khomeini in his statement stressed how difficult it was for 
him to accept the resolution 
i shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more 
deadly to me than poison but i am happy to submit to gods will 
and drank this cup for his satisfaction the 87yearold 
revolutionary patriarch said wednesday 
although the statement said he could not immediately reveal the 
reasons for changing his mind it said he acted on the 
recommendation of military and political leaders khomeinis 
statement was his first since the government said monday it would 
accept the ceasefire resolution 
irans acceptance of un resolution 598 does not mean the war 
is over khomeini said but he said the decision was not just a 
tactic to allow the iranian military to regroup iraq has made that 
accusation

dave barry the miami heralds humor columnist 
decided to see how long it took to become the subject of the news 
medias attention at the democratic national convention so he put 
a box on his head 
within seconds a photographer snapped a picture of barry and 
two other newspaper columnists who had decided to found people 
with boxes on their heads 
barry said he created his group to find out how desperate for 
color stories the press corps had become at a convention that 
lacked surprises in the main political events 
he writes in todays editions that he got the idea after seeing 
reporters surround a woman who simply wandered by carrying her pet 
rat 
i enlisted bob morris and erik lacitis who are also newspaper 
columnists and therefore like myself do not have even a tiny 
shred of human dignity and we went out to the protest zone and put 
cardboard boxes on our heads it took seven seconds for the first 
newspaper photographer take our picture he wrote 
he said he knew interviews got into at least two georgia 
newspapers and the baltimore sun and a nice writeup about the 
rally went out nationwide on the associated press wire you might 
have seen it if youve been reading any of the news reports 
emanating from this convention which i doubt 
barrys column confirmed suspicions the ap writer had advanced 
in his story that the guy with a box on his head giving the 
interview was himself a journalist perhaps a journalist who had 
been in the sun too long

assembly speaker willie brown to the convention hall to move for 
the nomination of dukakis by acclamation 
it is appropriate tonight that the focus be on the delegates 
the vote and the nominee jackson said in a statement 
and jackson emphasized that he wanted the focus tonight on lloyd 
bentsen dukakis choice for vice president 
no petitions to place jacksons name on the vice presidential 
roll call a move he had hinted at last week were submitted by 
this mornings deadline 
just mr bentsens said rick boylan an aide in the 
convention secretarys office 
jacksons campaign had picked up the forms to place his name in 
nomination for the no 2 spot but they were not used of course 
delegates may vote for anyone they like on the roll call at 
tonights session 
earlier dukakis and jackson had met to begin combining their 
campaigns for dukakis race against republican george bush 
jackson and campaign aides said it was what he called a get 
acquainted meeting to follow up on the unity pact he and dukakis 
reached on monday 
but he also spent wednesday recalling a formative part of his 
life at a luncheon with civil rights colleagues from the southern 
christian leadership conference he talked about what it meant 
historically to have his name placed in nomination even though he 
did not win 
later jackson watched on tv in his hotel suite surrounded by 
family and a handful of friends as he was nominated by william 
winpisinger president of the international association of 
machinists 
winpisinger in a dramatic tribute lauded jackson as a man 
who has dared sound our call to greatness 
this is a man of history a mover and shaker in the power 
struggles of freedom and tyranny of democracy and autocracy 
jesse jesse jesse the crowd chanted then changed the 
refrain to the jackson slogan keep hope alive 
jackson said having his name placed in nomination was a great 
feeling personally 
but really its my name put into nomination for the people 
who voted for me but also for the people who made it possible 
he said 
he said the event had triple significance 
at one level its political because its delegates and votes 
on another level its sociological because its transforming 
america in many ways on another level its theological its 
fulfilling the prayers of people who fought hard he said its 
a stepping stone for progress for the future 
for the immediate future jackson plans to campaign for the 
democratic ticket with dukakis giving him the money to do so 
the candidates meeting wednesday was arranged on short notice 
at jacksons request after dukakis called to congratulate him on 
his stirring convention speech tuesday night aides said 
it was the logical next step in implementing the 
relationship said a top jackson adviser ann lewis she said the 
meeting in part allowed dukakis top campaign staff including paul 
brountas and campaign manager susan estrich to get to know the 
voices on the other end of the telephone with whom they will be 
dealing in the general election campaign 
the plan discussed wednesday is for dukakis to tap into 
jacksons operation in states where jackson ran strongly and has a 
good campaign organization she said 
jackson said the session was basically a getacquainted 
meeting for staff and key policy advisers most of whom do not know 
each other but now must work together since we are in the same boat 
with a common objective that is to win in november 
one participant district of columbia delegate walter fauntroy 
said things are going beautifully in the talks 
jackson also met with sen edward kennedy dmass and new york 
gov mario cuomo 
cuomo said he went to congratulate jackson on the rousing 
convention speech he delivered 
he will be a continuing force in this party for a long time

a former us navy intelligence specialist who 
defected to the soviet union told millions of soviet television 
viewers that the united states targeted the french embassy when it 
bombed libya in 1986 
glenn michael souther 31 said he had access to secret 
photographs used to plan the april 14 1986 bombing attack on 
tripoli the libyan capital 
in washington a pentagon spokesman col david shea said 
any suggestion that we would intentionally bomb an embassy is 
absolutely ludicrous and not worthy of any further response the 
french government had no comment 
souther who disappeared a month after the bombings while the 
fbi was investigating him for alleged espionage appeared wednesday 
on a onehour primetime special on staterun television the 
camera looks at the world 
two or three days before the raids souther said he was working 
in a navy laboratory that processes satellite photographs and 
learned that one target was the french embassy he did not say 
where the laboratory was 
one of the lowerranking guys in the laboratory came up to me 
and said glenn you wont believe this were bombing this 
building and right here is the french embassy souther said as 
pictures of the american warplanes swooping toward targets came up 
on the screen he spoke in both russian and english 
an announcer then charged that the french embassy was targeted 
in retaliation for frances refusal to allow us bombers to fly 
over its territory en route to libya 
foreign reporters who visited the bombed area after the raid saw 
damage to the french embassy in the bin ashur neighborhood of 
tripoli 
the united states said its warplanes bombed terroristrelated 
targets in tripoli and benghazi libya and that civilian 
structures were hit by mistake 
two days after the raid thendefense secretary caspar w 
weinberger said the damage to the french embassy might have been 
caused by an american plane that was apparently shot down in the 
raid he said it was not because the embassy was either a target or 
near a target 
the attack was mounted to retaliate for libyas alleged 
involvement in an april 5 1986 attack on a west berlin discotheque 
that killed an american soldier and a turkish woman and wounded 50 
people 
the us attack involved planes from two aircraft carriers off 
libya as well as 11 warplanes which flew from england libya and 
the soviet union have called the raid statesponsored terrorism 
a navy official in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said souther helped analyze valuable satellite 
intelligence data the official said the pentagon was quite 
concerned about what he might have given the soviets 
souther told a television interviewer he became disenchanted 
with american foreign policy and was harassed by the fbi 
i found myself having to make a decision that turned my life 
around souther said i had to leave my country my family my 
buddies and close friends my only fault was that i believed that 
my own personal convictions were my rights the fbi thought 
otherwise they followed me i lost my future and they restricted 
my freedom 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia reported sunday that 
souther had been granted asylum 
souther did not indicate whether he had spied for the soviet 
union before leaving the united states or whether he was 
cooperating now with soviet intelligence he did not say what his 
current job was but said he was living in a comfortable moscow 
apartment 
souther served aboard the aircraft carrier uss nimitz from july 
1976 to november 1978 he was assigned to the 6th fleet command in 
naples italy in april 1979 
after an honorable discharge in october 1982 souther worked as 
an intelligence specialist at the headquarters of the 2nd fleet 
command in norfolk va 
when he left active service he enrolled in old dominion 
university in norfolk where he majored in russian language

teenage drug abusers tend to commit more 
crimes find it harder to hold a job and do poorly in school but 
infrequent drug used appeared to do no harm to relationships 
educational achievement and mental health according to the authors 
of a federally funded study published today 
drug abusers leave school earlier start jobs earlier and 
form families earlier said michael newcomb adjunct associate 
professor at the university of california at los angeles 
however moving into adult roles without adult maturity 
creates severe strains on virtually all aspects of a drug abusers 
life 
newcomb and professor peter bentler both in uclas department 
of psychology put eight years of research into the study of more 
than 700 teenagers first contacted in los angeles county when 
they were 12 to 15 years old 
it challenges the current emphasis on thwarting drug abuse by 
challenging teenagers to ignore peer pressure to use drugs 
emphasis would be better placed on reducing the abuse regular 
use and misuse of drugs among teenagers the authors argued 
focusing simply on handling peer pressure such as the just 
say no approaches may placate concerned but naive parents 
teachers and funding sources the study said but is an 
incomplete approach to confronting the task of preventing drug 
abuse 
some drug experts disputed that assertion wednesday 
it seem to me that one of the best ways to prevent people from 
becoming heavy users is to reduce the number of people who are 
users at all said lloyd johnston who heads an annual survey of 
drug use among high school seniors sponsored by the national 
institute on drug abuse 
drugs studied were alcohol marijuana hashish hypnotics 
cocaine stimulants psychedelics inhalants narcotics and pcp 
infrequent drug use once a month or less had little or no 
effect on users newcomb said he said teenagers who used moderate 
amounts of alcohol but no other drugs showed increased social 
integration and increased selfesteem 
he speculated that those who used no drugs other than alcohol 
may have been better adjusted than those who used other drugs 
stressing that he was not encouraging alcohol use newcomb said 
alcohol may be socially facilitative we use it in cocktail 
parties all the time 
teens who abuse drugs however divorce more quickly suffer 
from greater job instability commit more serious crimes and are 
generally more unhappy in their personal lives and relationships 
newcomb said

a thai prince has come here to try to settle a 
prolonged tugofwar over an ancient relic at the art institute of 
chicago that bangkok claims was illegally removed from the country 
22 years ago 
the 900yearold stone sculpture called a lintel or 
crosspiece over a door or window has inspired protests from 
chicago to bangkok by thais who claim it is an important cultural 
icon that was whisked out of their country 
the art institute however says it was a gift from a 
foundation bought legally in bangkok in 1966 
its become a little political football art institute 
director james n wood said wednesday he met this morning with 
prince subhadradis diskul an expert in art and archeology who 
arrived here late wednesday 
what were looking for is an agreement after good facetoface 
negotiations wood said i dont think the most important thing 
is to establish guilt i dont think it will be productive at all 
to talk in those terms 
on july 4 about 30 thai university students staged a peaceful 
protest in bangkok outside the us embassy urging the us 
government to help return the ancient lintel 
the relief carved from the surface of a stone and titled 
birth of brahma with reclining vishnu on a makara depicts the 
hindu god vishnu reclining on water it dates to cambodias khmer 
dynasty from 8051250 ad 
the thai government says it belongs over a doorway in the 
cambodian temple of khao phanomrung in northeastern thailand 
the piece is central to the whole temple said wutisak 
lapcharoensap a university of chicago graduate student who has 
organized sidewalk protests at the art institute in terms of 
historical interest this piece is very important 
wood had suggested earlier that he would be willing to loan the 
piece to thailand in exchange for another art treasure but on 
wednesday he declined to talk about a specific plan 
what were looking for is something that will satisfy the just 
demands of both parties we need to hear what the prince has to 
say wood said 
the piece was purchased by a dealer in bangkok who sold it to a 
new york dealer who finally sold it to the alsdorf foundation of 
winnetka ill said art institute spokeswoman eileen harakal 
the carving was on loan to the art institute from 1967 until 
1983 when the foundation made it a gift she said 
it was sold on the open market in bangkok ms harakal said 
there have been a lot of misunderstandings on that point and i 
want to make that clear 
the thai embassy in washington wrote to the foundation in 1976 
saying the piece may have been illegally removed from thailand the 
foundation wrote twice in 1976 and 1977 asking for proof but 
never received any ms harakal said 
to this day no proof has been given she said 
the sculpture was taken off display during the spring and is now 
in storage at the art institute but thais say it belongs to them 
mana treelayapewat vice secretary of the student federation of 
thailand said during the protest earlier this month that he and 
three other student leaders had submitted a letter to the embassy 
and a garland to the american people for the fourth of july 
the students carried placards reading happy birthday the great 
america and the lintel belongs to thailand

survivors of former soviet leader leonid i 
brezhnev have been stripped of unmerited privileges and will 
receive only the retirement benefits they earned by their own 
labor pravda said today 
the decision reported by the communist party daily was a further 
blow to the legacy of brezhnev whose name is now virtually 
synonomous with corruption and stagnation and whose reign is blamed 
for many of the problems that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is 
combatting 
the move also bolsters gorbachevs call for social justice and 
could broaden public faith in his reform program 
brezhnev led the move by topranking kremlin officials in 1964 
to topple nikita s khrushchev he replaced khrushchev as communist 
party chief and held the post until his death in 1982 
galina brezhnev his daughter scandalized moscow with her 
highrolling lifestyle in the final years of brezhnevs rule 
official media have said galinas husband yuri churbanov will 
be put on trial for abusing power during his five years as deputy 
interior minister and for accepting bribes equivalent to 270 years 
pay for the average soviet factory worker 
in an interview with the social minister of the russian 
federation viktor a kaznacheyev a pravda correspondent said 
there were rumors that galina her brother yuri brezhnevs brother 
yakov and churbanovs father mikhail were receiving a special 
pension 
kaznacheyev replied i can announce that a decision has been 
taken in our ministry according to which all the named people have 
been deprived of their undeserved pensions and other privileges 
he said they had been left with normal pensions in accordance 
with the positions that they held and according to the norms that 
are defined by legislation 
kaznacheyev did not specify what retirement benefits the members 
of the brezhnev clan would retain it was a harsh decision by 
soviet standards under which the survivors of supreme state or 
government officials often retain access to private country homes 
lavish moscow apartments and other perks 
the kremlin however has been looking with increasing disfavor 
on the legacy of the brezhnev years as gorbachev wages his campaign 
for a modernized economy and a reduction in bureaucrats powers in 
january the soviet government stripped brezhnevs name from a 
city town squares and a moscow neighborhood claiming citizens had 
demanded a decisive break with the late leaders legacy of 
corruption and economic stagnation

sheepshearing considered something of 
an art in rural australia may soon be done by a robot being tested 
on blindfolded sheep researchers said thursday 
the robots developers are using the same technology used to 
build cars but the project presents some unique problems said dr 
neil evans manager for research and development at the australian 
wool corp 
every car has the same shape every sheep has a different 
shape evans said he said the process gets even more complex as 
the shearing gets closer to the sheeps skin 
evans said despite the difficulties several robot prototypes 
have been built and tested on blindfolded sheep 
from the sheeps point of view its probably better than 
conventional shearing he said without elaboration 
researchers at the university of western australia have already 
spent 11 years and 325 million on the project said evans

european language because she said the language inevitably would 
be english 
minister for european affairs edith cresson said europeans 
should work together to defend french as well as italian german

be able to talk to each other 
interviewed on rtl radio the minister said plans to eliminate 
the borders among the 12 european economic community countries 
should not apply to language 
there should not be a single language in europe because it 
would inevitably be english she said 
children in the netherlands or denmark all speak a foreign 
language and sometimes two she said there is no reason why 
our children if we start them young learning languages in an 
attractive and lively way could not do it

floods and disease spread by 
contaminated water have killed at least 370 people since the annual 
monsoon rains began late last month officials and news reports 
said thursday 
cholera and gastroenteritis have reached epidemic proportions in 
new delhi overwhelming hospitals and prompting severe criticism of 
how the city handles water and sewage facilities 
cases of the two diseases also have been reported in uttar 
pradesh and punjab states north of the capital officials 
throughout the region have urged people to boil water used for 
drinking or cooking 
agriculture minister bhajan lal said this years monsoon which 
began in late june and is expected to last through august has been 
the best for crops since 1983 and should bring good yields of grain 
and vegetables for indias 800 million people 
crops depend on the annual rains but the monsoon also is 
putting too much water into heavily silted rivers water seeping 
through garbage and sewage has contaminated wells 
the number of people killed by drowning or house collapses rose 
to to 212 on thursday with 12 deaths reported in kashmir a 
northern state and the western state of maharashtra indian news 
agencies reported 
at least 96 people have died of cholera and gastroenteritis in 
new delhi this month acording to government figures issued 
thursday many were children 
a new delhi official who insisted on anonymity said more than 
7152 people had been treated in the citys hospitals more than 
four times the number for all of july 1987 he reported 239 
confirmed cholera cases 
fifty deaths from the two diseases were reported in punjab state 
to the north and 12 in ghaziabad near new delhi in uttar pradesh 
state 
heavy rains have sent rivers over their banks in 11 of indias 
25 states said am bhola a central water commission official he 
estimated at least 25 million acres of land were underwater 
bhola criticized state governments which are responsible for 
flood control for concentrating on stopgap measures and delaying 
dam construction we find that the states do not allocate full 
funds for flood prevention he said 
news dispatches said roads were submerged and telephone lines 
down in northern himachal pradesh state landslides blocked 
highways near the hill town of darjeeling and rail service was 
disrupted in eastern assam state 
in new delhi the spread of waterborne disease has overtaxed 
health facilities to the point that some hospitals put three 
children in a bed and patients lie on blankets on the floor 
much of the disease is found in densely populated slums near the 
yamuna river that are not connected to the city water system and 
rely on wells 
the opposition janata peoples party demanded this week that 
the mayor of new delhi and its lieutenant governor the chief 
administrator resign because of criminal negligence and 
concealment of facts 
a party statement said official figures understate the death 
toll and 200 people may have perished from waterborne diseases it 
said city officials were directly responsible for the spread of 
the epidemic 
an editorial thursday in the times of india said much of the 
disease was spread by contaminated water taken by slum dwellers 
from shallow wells provided by the city and declared 
the delhi administration did not anticipate the water 
contamaination a sad reflection of its indifference the concerned 
officials were simply not ready with a strategy what are considered 
to be statistically established annual deaths 
city agencies blame each other 
officials of the delhi development authority previously 
responsibile for water and sanitation in the slums say no problems 
existed when authority was transferred june 1 to the delhi 
municipal corporation

two nuns who were threatened with 
expulsion for supporting a right to an abortion said today they 
have resigned from their order 
in june officials of the roman catholic church had sent word 
from rome that they would not proceed with the process to 
dismiss sisters barbara ferraro and patricia hussey from the 
sisters of notre dame de namur 
we now believe that the leadership has affirmed the right to 
be a member and hold public positions on noninfallible teachings 
that differ from official church teachings the nuns said in a 
letter of resignation made public today 
the controversy began in 1984 when hussey and ferraro along 
with 95 other catholics signed an advertisement in the new york 
times saying that there is a diversity of opinion about abortion 
with the church 
since then the church repeatedly has asked hussey and ferraro 
to retract their support of a womans right to choose abortion the 
nuns have refused

a school district that used to be 
the laughing stock because of its financial troubles now has 
enough money to give 1000 scholarships to all its collegebound 
graduates 
we can afford it said superintendent peter corona weve 
managed these funds so well that we can now put more into the 
education of our students 
the scholarship fund is similar to muchpublicized private 
endowments promised to students in oakland and new yorks harlem 
district everybody gets a fair shot corona said well pay 
for books supplies everything 
the scholarship plan was approved unanimously monday by the 
board of education it could amount to about 30000 next year for 
the estimated 30 seniors who would be eligible 
these poor kids dont have anything corona said of students 
in the district with one high school one elementary school and 
fewer than 500 students the district is 99 percent minority 
were telling them that theres a light at the end of the 
tunnel and we really care about you he said 
the district located between oakland and berkeley was broke 
and on the verge of extinction five years ago 
most students come from singleparent households supported by 
welfare and the districts income had fallen becuase of budget 
cutbacks and inefficient management said corona who took over in 
1982 
corona is credited for much of the districts turnaround since 
it was forced to take a 600000 state bailout loan in 1983 staff 
and expenditures were cut drastically and the district gradually 
built its funds he said 
this district used to be the laughing stock he said it 
isnt that way anymore what weve had to overcome in this district 
far surpasses what iacocca had to do with chrysler

the california delegation was poised to give 
michael dukakis a nominating majority sneak em down sneak em 
down producer gary smith told his light man stand by ready 
to bring em up ready music not now not now go music 
the floor demonstration erupted on cue and smith exhilarated by 
his handiwork stood up and clapped before returning to the 
business before him orchestrating the democratic national 
convention for tv consumption 
from the boy scout color guard to the singing of the national 
anthem through endless speeches and stirring musical interludes 
smith was on alert barking instructions and throwing hand signals 
to operatives all over the cavernous hall 
lower the lights hold it hold it lower the podium and 
music smith yelled into his telephone headset as a 13yearold 
walked on stage to lead the national anthem 
no sooner had he finished than smith was gesticulating wildly at 
the podium from his lofty perch atop the camera platform a 
makeshift control area known familiarly as tech tower nothing 
serious the boy scouts in the color guard couldnt figure out when 
to leave i told them to watch me he explained 
smith a compact man with glasses and a mustache relaxed 
occasionally with a cigar but spent much of his night in overdrive 
his eyes flickered among five television monitors he covered his 
podium schedule with scribbles he answered his red phone 
incessantly and he talked steadily into an open headset line to 
the stage manager the teleprompter operator the orchestra 
conductor and his partner the director of the show dwight hemion 
in contrast lowkey sound and lighting technicians sipped cokes 
and ate tacos at their wide consoles controlling the convention 
atmosphere almost offhandedly between bites 
ive worked for everyone from sting to kiss said don tyra 
who designed the convention light system this is not as 
fastpaced but its very critical due to the fact that youre live 
to the world theres no room for error any mistake will be seen 
by millions 
there were plenty of small mistakes but smith handled them 
when an indiana delegate tried to introduce three governors 
using a dead mike smith sized up the situation instantly and 
switched on a mike at his desk ladies and gentlemen he said 
in the deep voice of a master of ceremonies referring to his 
podium schedule the governor of colorado roy romer 
the schedule was in constant flux as the program fell further 
and further behind smith said he wasnt worried because a 
46minute recess had been built in for just such a possibility 
but when the recess arrived party officials had not yet decided 
whether to cancel it long seconds passed with an empty podium and 
apparent anarchy in the hall 
ah but there really was someone in charge some music 
smith shrieked into his headset some music on with the show 
between his shouts to the conductor and the simple hand gestures 
he used to communicate with tyra smith drew combinations of music 
and lighting that literally stopped and started floor 
demonstrations in addition to underscoring dramatic or significant 
moments 
plans for the instant dukakis would clinch the nomination were 
made nearly five hours before it happened as california lt gov 
leo mccarthy was telling delegates that the least his state could 
do to atone for sending the nation ronald reagan was to send george 
bush home wherever that is 
californias going to be putting him over the top smith 
told tyra they want california to pass on the first round of 
voting youll feel it in the hall well bring the lights 
down theyll say california and well bring the lights up 
tyra took the hall slowly into darkness as the moment 
approached then blasted it with light as california announced its 
235 votes for dukakis the orchestra burst into a medley of its 
a grand old flag and the washington post march smith was so 
moved or perhaps relieved that he stood and clapped briefly 
along with the exuberant delegates 
but he was quickly back to himself turn the lights down a 
little bit he told tyra keep the spotlights going a 
horrible realization dawned is nbc gone is nbc gone yes 
into the headset ok cut it the orchestra fell instantly 
silent the demonstrators subsided 
the networks it turned out had abandoned the long 
demonstration and returned to local programming it was a cue that 
smith the veteran hollywood professional could not ignore

among european broadcasters covering the 
democratic national convention tony naets henceforth will be known 
as the man who blew up the foreign pool at atlanta 
in this case the pool in question is a small orange 
inflatable variety it sits on bare asphalt in a small clearing 
among 22 mobile office trailers clustered together in a fencedin 
section of a subterranean parking lot on the outskirts of the 
convention center 
at night during convention lulls the foreign reporters who 
work in the complex sit around the pool they drink beer and toss 
coins into the water as they trade gossip and news tidbits 
some people jokingly call this complex the european 
ghetto said naets the new yorkbased bureau chief of the 
european broadcasting union a cooperative that includes 37 nations 
the eub is the largest member of the foreign broadcasting 
service an organization set up by the american television networks 
to provide working facilities and technical assistance including 
satellite access to foreign broadcasters 
weve got about 400 people working in this complex said 
bill headline a cable news network executive who is running the 
fbs operation at the convention 
the broadcasting operations in the fbs complex range in size 
from the cbc which had four trailers and more than 60 employees 
to monaco radio with just one reporter 
this place may not look like much headline said but it 
is a very sophisticated technical operation that provides our 
clients with video and audio feeds a collective studio and 
standup positions both here and in a sky booth at the convention 
hall 
the catch of course is that all 39 broadcasting agencies using 
the facilities must share the one studio and the two standup 
positions 
these people are professionals and they understand theyre at 
the bottom of everyones list headline said the democrats are 
blatant enough to simply say outright that the foreign broadcasters 
really dont matter to them because their viewers arent voting in 
this election 
still conditions have been trying at times said francois 
champey a broadcaster for la cinq a french television station 
it can be pure hell she said there are six or eight 
cubicles in the editing trailers and somebody in the one next to me 
always seems to be yelling in loud italian or german when im doing 
a taped voiceover 
naets looked out the window toward the village green where 
the orange plastic wading pool sat steaming in the sizzling 
afternoon sun 
were taking all of our trailers with us down to new orleans 
for the republican convention in august he said ill be 
taking the pool along too but unfortunately we wont have a 
village green down there instead well be lined up in grid like 
an american trailer park 
what about the coins in the pool 
ill scoop them out when i deflate the pool since im the one 
who blew it up he said laughing

former prison guard danny dill still has 
nightmares about the day 10 years ago when he clung to life bloody 
and swollen on a cellhouse floor for two hours while rampaging 
inmates beat and stabbed three fellow guards to death 
but dill dreams that the story of his ordeal at the pontiac 
correctional center will make prisons safer 
it was pure hell but i believe god spared me for one reason 
to speak out and try to change things said dill who is 
completing a book on his experiences at the prison that holds some 
of the states toughest criminals 
however some things have not changed since the riot on july 22 
1978 no one has been convicted of murdering the guards and 
despite improvements in security officials say another deadly riot 
could happen 
in addition to the three guards who were killed three were 
wounded and there was more than 4 million in damage to the 
19thcentury prison in a residental neighborhood in this small 
northern illinois city of 11000 people 
dill 40 left the department after two years on medical leave 
and 38 operations in one year the other wounded guards returned to 
pontiac 
i still have nightmares said dill i think of my fellow 
officers and friends who were tortured and killed 
this anniversary does not pass easily well always 
remember said corrections commissioner michael lane i believe 
the place is more safe and humane than it was 10 years ago but it 
is not safe enough 
the violence erupted on a quiet saturday morning when 550 
inmates were being taken from an exercise yard to their cellhouse 
and 600 more prisoners were leaving an auditorium after a movie 
about 250 riotequipped officers restored order the violence 
was over in an hour and the prison was declared secure eight hours 
after it all began hundreds of homemade knives and other weapons 
were recovered 
they wanted to take control of the whole prison said dill 
gang leaders had a list of targets we were tough but firm and 
they didnt like that i heard every one of our names called out 
dill maintains the riot was planned and should have been 
expected state officials said it was a surprise perhaps 
triggered by the heat overcrowding or a gang fight that got out of 
control 
thirtyone inmates were indicted on charges ranging from 
burglary to murder but only eight eventually were convicted on 
the lesser offenses 
the guards families sued prison officials and in 1984 a 
federal jury ruled there was negligence and awarded the plaintiffs 
852637 however an appeals court set aside the judgment in 1986 
saying the guards knew the risks when they went to work at the 
prison 
the state must protect those it throws into snake pits but 
the state need not guarantee that volunteer snake charmers will not 
be bitten the appellate opinion said 
there have been some improvements at pontiac there are more 
guards and fewer prisoners the state also has spent about 306 
million since 1978 for new guard towers more fencing catwalks and 
better lighting 
lane calls those bandaids for a prison that needs major 
surgery 
he wants the state legislature to approve money for new 
cellhouses and to recognize that despite the opening of some new 
prisons the department needs additional funds to handle an overall 
prison population that has doubled to 20000 in 10 years 
were out of room now said lane the population is going 
back up at pontiac i have no place else to go with them 
since 1978 two other employees have been killed at the pontiac 
prison 
there may be fewer inmates but they are younger more 
aggressive more volatile and more gangoriented said bob 
ellinger president of the local guard union pontiac is still a 
very dangerous place

next month 35000 of the faithful will 
congregate at graceland at the grave of elvis presley and pay 
homage to the king of rock n roll on the anniversary of his death 
only problem is elvis born jan 8 1935 died aug 16 1977 
could be out visiting friends or vacationing according to a new 
book and assorted tabloid stories 
this is not amusing to employees at graceland 
elvis is alive rumors have floated since elvis death turned 
his memphis tenn mansion into a wailing wallcumtourist trap 
but in recent months theyve been the focus of talk shows radio 
programs and and this story 
tabloid readers responding to a spot the king campaign 
have reported sighting elvis watching a stock car race in 
minnesota fishing in upstate new york and dining in the california 
wine country 
if the king only temporarily abdicated how has he avoided 
detection a man with 45 gold records 80 topselling albums 170 
hit singles and millions of obsessive fans 
elvis cover if he is alive is theres so many elvis 
lookalikes explains gail brewergiorgio author of the book is 
elvis alive which questions many of the circumstances 
surrounding elvis death 
do you know of anybody who has more imitators the person on 
the street could be fooled by a lookalike or it could be 
elvis brewergiorgio said in a telephone interview this week 
presley was not immediately available for comment but among the 
evidence cited by brewergiorgio to support a living elvis 
elvis graceland grave has his middle name spelled aaron its 
spelled aron on his birth certificate his marriage license and in 
most crossword puzzles convinced yet 
many fans believed elvis looked different and waxen in his 
coffin in fact that it was a wax replica cooled by an air 
conditioner to prevent the false king from melting like the wicked 
witch of the west how about now 
the incredible elvis tape a 60minute cassette which purports 
to present telephone conversations recorded four years after elvis 
death the king explains his need for privacy his travels around 
europe and his desire to get back on stage 
i needed the rest even more than i knew says the taped 
voice and after about a year i started missing the people and 
the entertaining its been a constant battle growing beards 
and this and that to keep from being recognized 
still skeptical 
well brewergiorgio also points out that an anagram for 
elvis is lives and you still dont believe 
some fans believe 270000 people nationwide have called to hear 
the tape with 50000 of them voting on whether elvis was alive 
the vote has been running 2to1 in favor of a living breathing 
elvis said gerry sindell chairman of tudor publishing which put 
out the book 
each caller paid 50 cents per call to vote and 2 to hear the 
tape 
diane pullman of brooklyn a presley fan since 1953 who spent 
the last several years in an effort to have elvis birthday 
declared a national holiday doesnt discount the staged death 
theory 
i was walking myself near the walker theater when i saw this 
guy who looked just like elvis presley mrs pullman said it 
could be him unless he had plastic surgery 
todd morgan a spokesman at graceland flatly dismissed the 
story 
all of us who work here when we go home and see our families 
our friends other business people the first thing we hear is 
seen elvis lately or has he come home yet its beginning to 
get aggravating said morgan 
is it fact is it fiction perhaps its best to end with the 
final words from is elvis alive 
around the 10th anniversary of the death of elvis presley an 
atlanta attorney who had been working in the gary hart campaign 
responded to the rumor that gary hart would run again with this 
statement the probability of gary hart seeking the nomination for 
president of the united states is as unlikely as believing elvis 
presley is still alive 
less than four months after this statement gary hart again 
announced his candidacy for president of the united states

two teams of un observers will travel to 
iran and iraq in the next days to work out details of a ceasefire 
in the war and investigate the situation of war prisoners un 
officials said today 
un spokesman francois giuliani told reporters that iran had 
given assurances of safe conduct and cooperation for the teams but 
that iraq had not yet made a similar commitment 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced wednesday 
that military observers would travel to the warring nations to help 
implement a un ceasefire resolution passed one year ago but not 
accepted by iran until monday 
giuliani said perez de cuellar was dispatching a second team to 
investigate the situation of prisoners of war in both countries 
repatriation of pows is part of the un plan to end the nearly 
8yearold war 
iraq has complained that thousands of its prisoners of war in 
iran are tortured and murdered 
giuliani said the second group was being asembled in geneva and 
was expected to go to iran over the weekend then visit iraq it 
will return to geneva to prepare its report he said 
the mission will endeavor to ascertain the facts and inquire 
into the concerns expressed by the two governments with a view to 
ensuring observance of relevant rules of international humanitarian 
law giuliani said 
un officials said the eightmember group of military observers 
will leave vienna and jerusalem in the next few days it will 
include military officers from the un truce supervision 
organization based in jerusalem two observers already in tehran 
and baghdad and raymond sommereyns a senior officer in the office 
for special political affairs in new york 
the exact itinerary was not announced but the group was 
expected first to visit tehran this weekend then travel to baghdad 
ltgen martin vadset will head the group 
we will start from scratch and the main issue now is to have 
the parties agree on the technical implementation of a truce which 
can form the foundation for the peace negotiations vadset said 
the 57yearold norwegian general was in vienna and was 
interviewed by norwegian media 
the first dozen or so observers eventually will be joined by up 
to 250 officers from various countries who would monitor ceasefire 
implementation 
the group investigating the prisoner of war situation includes 
wolfram karl professor of international law at the university of 
salzburg austria torkel opsahl professor of international law at 
the university of oslo norway and maj gen rene bats of the 
belgian army giuliani said 
gb ramcharan a senior political officer in the un 
secretariat will accompany the mission he said 
giuliani also said that perez de cuellar had no comment on 
iraqs fivepoint proposal to help implement the ceasefire 
resolution 
that proposal contained in a letter released wednesday called 
for direct formal unsponsored talks between iran and iraq 
along with iranian promises not to attack iraqi or other shipping 
in the persian gulf 
iran rejected the idea of direct talks 
on monday iran announced after a years delay that it had 
accepted security council resolution 598 which demands an 
immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a peace plan to 
end the war 
iraq at first calar a message saying iraq wants direct talks with 
iran 
iraq proposed opening talks at the united nations then moving 
them to baghdad and tehran iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar 
mahallati told reporters iran rejected direct talks 
but another iranian diplomat mohammad javad zarif said his 
country will observe a ceasefire during the technical teams visit 
and continue an informal ceasefire later if iraq does the same 
iraq raided iranian industrial targets on tuesday and iran 
responded in kind on wednesday today iraq shelled the village of 
sardasht in northern azerbaijan province killing one civilian and 
injuring two irna said 
perez de cuellar said the team would limit its consultations to 
military aspects of the ceasefire i expect the report of the 
team will allow me to announce the implementation of the 
resolution 
the peruvian said that would include naming the day the 
ceasefire takes effect setting dates for the beginning and 
completion of troop withdrawals and exchanges of war prisoners and 
setting a date for the beginning of negotiations on a lasting peace

a woman convicted of criminal neglect in her 
sons death has been offered the possiblity of a reduced sentence 
if she is sterilized 
melody s baldwin faces a possible 20year sentence after 
pleading guilty to neglect of a dependent in the sept 5 1986 
death of her 4yearold son joshua 
miss baldwin 29 is seven months pregnant she was hospitalized 
last week for treatment of malnutrition authorities said 
when she was unable to appear in court for her sentencing 
hearing july 13 marion superior court judge roy f jones ordered 
her confined for the health and safety of the fetus and appointed 
a guardian to protect its interests 
miss baldwin has agreed to surrender the child for adoption 
at a hearing wednesday on miss baldwins medical status jones 
recommended to miss baldwins attorney michael j donahoe that 
miss baldwin undergo sterilization and suggested that he might 
reduce her sentence if the procedure is completed 
the judges remarks followed testimony by two physicians that 
miss baldwin may have tried to interfere with her intravenous 
feeding 
from what i have heard already and whats been presented to 
the court i think its the courts position shes the type of 
person that definitely does not need any children in the future 
jones said 
the judge said that although he had no jurisdiction over whether 
miss baldwin opts for sterilization i dont think its something 
that i think we should leave unsaid 
donahoe said he would pass along the judges recommendation to 
miss baldwin who did not attend the hearing 
representatives of the indiana civil liberties union called 
jones proposal outrageous and an impermissible condition of 
sentencing 
the us supreme court struck down the sterilization of 
criminals in 1942 said iclu attorney richard waples 
timothy l bookwalter a lawyer appointed by the judge to guard 
the fetus interests said he favors sterilization 
we cant protect her every time she gets pregnant she is a 
dangerous person and could kill this kid too he said 
during wednesdays hearing psychiatrist balwant s mallik said 
miss baldwin is sane but has a personality disorder and is suicidal 
testimony during the sentencing hearing july 13 revealed that 
miss baldwin had induced her son to take lethal levels of 
antipsychotic drugs which had been prescribed for her 
while the child was hospitalized nurses discovered that someone 
had disconnected alarms on the cardiac and respiratory monitors 
his condition deteriorated and he was declared brain dead on sept 
3 he was removed from artifical life support systems two days 
later and was declared dead

nearly half of the patients who had heartbypass 
operations in three hospitals either should not have had the 
procedures or could have done without them a new study says 
eliminating unnecessary coronary bypass operations could lead to 
reduced health care costs and improved patient care said the 
study published in fridays edition of the journal of the american 
medical association 
only 56 percent of the 386 coronary bypass operations performed 
in the three randomly chosen hospitals from a western state in 
1979 1980 and 1982 were justified meaning the benefits outweighed 
the risks the study said 
ann shoben a spokeswoman for rand corp whose researchers did 
the study declined to identify the hospitals 
it found that 14 percent of the operations were performed for 
inappropriate reasons and 30 percent for equivocal reasons 
meaning they could be argued either way 
bypass operations first performed 20 years ago numbered about 
230000 last year in the united states at an estimated cost of 6 
billion according to national figures this is more than double 
the number performed in 1980 
the study certainly points up some problem areas as we sit 
here watching the cost of health care rise so quickly said dr 
constance monroe winslow who conducted the study with four 
colleagues at the university of californialos angeles center for 
the health sciences 
while doctors may disagree on whether bypass surgery should be 
performed in the equivocal cases the authors concluded that few 
would argue with the proposition that the services should go first 
of all to patients with clearly appropriate reasons for their use 
when confronted with scarce resources planners may wish to 
use this type of information to help make difficult allocation 
decisions 
a typical bypass operation can cost about 30000 
in the surgical procedure doctors take a vein from somewhere 
else in the body and use it to reroute blood around a blockage in 
the coronary arteries 
the authors cautioned that although the study is representative 
of patients undergoing bypass surgery in western states further 
work is needed to generalize these results to the rest of the 
united states 
dr jack copeland a university of arizona heart surgeon who 
heads the schools nationally known hearttransplant program said 
im not aware of too many instances where there has been an abuse 
of this kind of surgery 
i dont doubt there are some abuses but i would doubt that 
its as significant as one might think looking at such an 
article he added 
in an editorial that accompanied the study in the same issue 
dr albert g mulley jr and dr kim a eagle of massachusetts 
general hospital and the harvard medical school said doctors often 
disagreed on the criteria for determining whether a bypass 
operation is justified 
the ucla researchers used a system designed for the rand 
corpucla health services utilization study to rate the 
appropriateness of bypass surgery the system was devised by a 
ninemember panel of physicians 
the study defined appropriateness to mean that the expected 
health benefit of a bypass including both quality of life andor 
longevity exceeded the expected negative consequences including 
the risk of death by a sufficiently wide margin 
mulley and eagle said that if appropriateness ratings made by a 
panel in great britain were applied even more bypass operations 
would have been considered unjustified 
policymakers should resist the temptation to use 
appropriateness ratings as a quick fix they said the real 
need is for more information about the outcomes of medical 
practices

north korea proposed thursday that the legislatures 
of the two koreas meet in its capital of pyongyang to debate a 
nonaggression pact drafted by the north 
south korean officials in seoul had no immediate reaction to the 
proposal it appeared unlikely however that pyonguangs call 
would lead to a breakthrough in the strained relations between the 
rival nations 
the south korean government has insisted that it handle any 
contacts with the north the national assembly which has a 
majority of opposition lawmakers agreed with that position in june 
north korea refused earlier this month to accept two proposals 
by the seoul government for wideranging political economic and 
humanitarian talks on easing tension as a step toward eventual 
unification of the peninsula 
korea has been divided into the communist north and prowestern 
south since 1945 and the two sides fought a war from 195053 each 
government insists it is the sole legitimate ruler of korea and 
denounces the other as a puppet regime and dictatorship 
the north korean offer was reported by pyongyangs official 
korean central news agency monitored in tokyo 
the agency said the norths supreme peoples assembly proposed 
that all south korean national assembly members and all north 
korean deputies meet first in august in pyongyang then in each of 
the two capitals 
the report said standing committee chairman yang hyong sop of 
north koreas parliament made the proposal in a letter sent 
thursday through the panmunjom truce village to south koreas 
national assembly speaker kim chaesun 
in seoul kims aides confirmed he received the letter but said 
its contents would be distributed to the nations political parties 
before it was made public 
south korean officials said yangs letter was a response to a 
letter from kim sent through panmunjom on monday in which he 
urged the north to compete in the 1988 olympic games beginning 
sept 17 in seoul

stress disorders have afflicted some 
survivors medical personnel and rescue workers involved in the 
deadly collapse of a department store 
fourteen people were killed and 47 others were injured when the 
amigo store collapsed july 7 
tamara cowen a 35yearold nurse who supervised a triage center 
near the store said she still cannot remember everything she did 
in the hours after the disaster 
ms cowen identified bodies as they were pulled from the rubble 
and scheduled doctors and nurses around the clock to treat victims 
and exhausted rescue workers 
for days afterward she said she could not sleep without 
dreaming she was back at the treatment area the sound of dump 
trucks and bulldozers ringing in her ears she cried and 
repeatedly returned to the scene after the rubble had been cleared 
counselors at valley regional medical center said ms cowen 
suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder a normal response 
to such an upsetting experience 
psychologist jay martinez led a counseling session last week at 
the hospital where a group of mostly medical professionals 
expressed their feelings after the disaster all reported some form 
of posttraumatic stress including feelings of irritability 
frustration helplessness and guilt martinez said 
dr ralph jones another counselor working with disaster 
survivors said the stress disorder is the same thing many of the 
vietnam veterans experienced and are still experiencing 
jones said he counseled one woman who is afraid to leave her 
house especially if it means going downtown other survivors are 
irritable toward family members or have suppressed emotions 
altogether 
the major thing is to get them to talk about it express 
their feelings jones said 
it is important for those affected to revisit the disaster site 
accept what happened and move on martinez said for that reason 
city officials held a memorial ceremony on the lot once it was 
cleared

a drug dealer who disguised himself as a 
lawyer nearly escaped from prison but was tripped up by his 
distinctive walk authorities said 
elrader ray ray browning jr was wearing street clothes an 
afro wig and false mustache and was carrying a briefcase and a copy 
of the rules of criminal procedure when he summoned a guard and 
asked to be released from the prisons attorney interview room 
saturday said assistant us attorney john gordon 
a guard who hadnt recognized browning on sight did recognize 
his jaunty gait gordon said the inmate got no farther than the 
interview room door the prosecutor said 
inside the briefcase authorities found a drivers license a 
credit card a jail jumpsuit and the glue that apparently had been 
used to affix the mustache 
all we can hypothesize at this point is hed been squirreling 
away these items gordon said 
loose ceiling tiles in the interview room at terminal island 
federal prison indicated that the items may have been brought in by 
visitors to the low to mediumsecurity facilty over the last few 
weeks he said 
browning said to be the leader of a 2 millionamonth cocaine 
and heroin ring acted as his own attorney during a trial at which 
he was convicted of 43 drugrelated felonies he faces a mandatory 
term of life without parole at sentencing aug 22 
deputy us marshal walter dayton said browning and another man 
met with attorney larry elkins in the interview room saturday 
elkins left about an hour before the escape attempt gordon 
said he added that authorities had been unable to reach elkins a 
call to his office before business hours today went unanswered 
the incident was the seventh escape or attempted escape in the 
last four months at terminal island the only federal prison in the 
los angeles area 
warden rd brewer attributed the recent rash of escape attempts 
to a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of prisoners awaiting 
sentencing housed at terminal island which he said was never 
designed to house the kind of highrisk inmates often held there

authorities in that southeast asian nation wish to improve 
relations with the west the biggest step has been withdrawal of 
some vietnamese forces from cambodia

jointly with the united states on concerted efforts to resolve the 
issue of american military and civilian personnel still missing and 
unaccounted for from the vietnam war said state department

vietnamese foreign minister to discuss accelerated cooperation on 
humanitarian issues of concern she said 
last august vessey gave the vietnamese a list of 200 
discrepancy cases describing 70 of them as compelling and 
warranting urgent action 
vessey asked by president reagan to handle unresolved

evidence that they survived their incident and were captured or 
otherwise came under vietnamese control or about whom the 
vietnamese authorities should have information 
the us statement said we have long urged vietnam to agree to 
joint activities such as field investigations surveys and 
excavations to expedite the resolution of the powmia issue 
the vietnamese offer is an encouraging development that will 
facilitate this objective and we look forward to greatly expanded 
cooperation in the coming months it said the two governments

the soviet union and china have agreed to meet 
in beijing next month in an attempt to work out a peace settlement 
for vietnameseoccupied cambodia a us official said thursday 
if successful the talks could remove the remaining obstacle to 
a summit meeting between the worlds two biggest communist powers 
who have been at odds for some 30 years the official said 
this is the first time the two sides are holding a meeting with 
cambodia as the sole agenda item although they have been 
conducting periodic talks on the foreign ministry level since 1982 
the official said the soviets will be represented at the august 
meeting by deputy foreign minister igor rogachev and the chinese by 
foreign ministry official zhu qizhen the official said 
while neither the soviets nor the chinese have a direct role in 
the longrunning cambodia conflict both powers hold sway over 
allies who are directly involved 
secretary of state george shultz was informed of the planned 
talks during his visit to beijing last week said the official 
speaking only on condition of anonymity 
but he cautioned that the success of the cambodia meeting hinges 
on the upcoming cocktail party talks among the threeparty 
cambodian guerrilla coalition vietnamese officials and the 
vietnamappointed government in the capital of phnom penh 
the talks are scheduled to begin monday in indonesia but prince 
norodom sihanouk former head of the cambodian resistance movement 
is already predicting failure 
sihanouk who resigned this month from the presidency of the 
threeparty guerrilla coalition accused vietnam on thursday of 
being unwilling to conduct serious talks 
vietnam moved into cambodia in 1979 driving out the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge rulers who killed hundreds of thousands 
of people in their bloody fouryear rule china has promised shultz 
it would seek to prevent khmer rouge leader pol pot from returning 
to cambodia the official said 
under pressure from moscow vietnam announced in may that it 
would withdraw its estimated 125000 troops by 1990 
the us official said china had indicated to the united states 
that soviet cooperation over cambodia would clear the way for a 
rapprochement china had also been holding out for a soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan which began in may after more than 
eight years of occupation

two members of the striking writers guild of 
america say they were told by the head of 20th century fox that a 
gentlemans agreement between producers and directors has 
blocked a settlement of the walkout 
according to two of 40 guild members who met tuesday with barry 
diller chairman and chief executive officer of fox inc diller 
said the alliance of motion picture and television producers agreed 
privately with the directors guild of america last year on payments 
for tv reruns 
the two writers spoke on condition that they not be identified 
he said that the producers had made a gentlemans agreement 
with the dga that they would not give the wga a penny more for 
residuals one of the writers in attendance said he said that 
the producers felt obligated to uphold that agreement he said we 
cannot go back on our word to the directors guild 
diller would neither confirm nor deny the report 
glenn gumpel executive director of the dga said that he was 
not going to contradict barry dillers statement however he 
would not say whether the dga had entered into such an agreement 
with the producers 
we dont negotiate for the wga gumpel said writers are 
entitled to ask for and negotiate for whatever they want to 
cheryl rhoden spokeswoman for the writers guild said dillers 
reported admission in the 20th week of the strike answers many 
questions about the refusal of the alliance to negotiate 
i got tremendously uspet when i heard about dillers 
comment said del reisman vice president of the wga and 
cochairman of the negotiating committee 
but if such a pact existed why didnt he talk about it 
earlier its incredibly late in the negotiationg process to come 
out with that kind of statement 
the wga and the producers have been sharply divided over 
payments for reruns since the strike by the 9000 film and tv 
scriptwriters began march 7 
union leaders have said repeatedly that the producers have been 
largely unwilling to make any compromises on payments for tv shows 
rebroadcast domestically and all programs shown overseas 
the strike has resulted in sweeping layoffs throughout the 
entertainment industry 
the dga is considered to be one of hollywoods most potent 
unions because its members once on strike can shut down all 
television and film production effects from a writers strike on 
the other hand are felt more slowly 
herb steinberg a spokesman for the producers alliance said 
dillers remarks were taken out of context 
what the alliance said to the directors was that there was no 
more money for residuals steinberg said to give the writers 
any more would destroy any credibility they have to be 
consistent 
the wga is not going to get any more for television 
residuals than any other union that has been our bargaining 
position from the very beginning and we have not wavered from that 
the writers dont deserve any more than the dga steinberg said 
negotiators for the wga and the producers are scheduled to meet 
with each other and a federal mediator on saturday the talks will 
be the first between the full negotiating teams since june 16

the state department on thursday denied 
charges by an american who defected to the soviet union that the 
united states targeted the french embassy when it bombed libya in 
april 1986 
deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley called the allegations 
ridiculous and absolutely untrue 
glen michael souther a former us navy intelligence specialist 
who recently defected to the soviet union said on soviet 
television wednesday that he had access to secret photographs used 
to plan the bombing attack on tripoli he said that he learned that 
the french embassy was a target several days before the raid 
foreign reporters who visited the bombed area after the raid saw 
damage to the french embassy in the bin ashur neighborhood of 
tripoli 
a soviet announcer charged that the embassy was targeted in 
retaliation for frances refusal to allow us bombers to fly over 
its territory en route to libya from bases in britain 
the pentagon had no immediate comment on southers allegations 
however two days after the raid thendefense secretary caspar 
w weinberger said that damage to the french embassy may have been 
caused by an american plane that was apparently shot down in the 
raid and was not the result of the embassy being a target or near a 
target 
the simple correct answer is we dont know how that damage 
occurred weinberger said then but its a mile away from any 
of the target areas and it was specifically rejected as a target 
even though theres a large intelligence building right next to the 
french embassy 
mrs oakley said us diplomats have requested soviet assistance 
in arranging a meeting with souther such meetings are considered 
normal practice for the purpose of ensuring that a defector is 
acting under his own free will

abc might cut back its primetime coverage of the 
gop convention in august because the democratic national convention 
has been such a bore abc news president roone arledge said 
thursday 
it might be less at the republican convention depends on what 
they do arledge said 
nbc news president lawrence k grossman said nbc would not cut 
back on the gop out of fairness after giving so much prime time 
exposure to the democrats but would reassess the amount of 
coverage in 1992 
cbs which scheduled an extra hour of coverage for thursday 
plans to stick to the same schedule for the republicans and defends 
extensive prime time coverage in the future id do more not 
less said anchor dan rather 
ratings for convention coverage have been in a steady decline 
since 1976 ratings for this years democratic convention were 
boosted by jesse jacksons appearance on tuesday night but overall 
have been about 10 percent lower than in 1984 
regardless ratings and shares and so forth this is a moment 
perhaps the only moment and there are four days of it when the 
american people can get to know the political leaders said cbs 
news president howard stringer otherwise its a minutetwenty 
and sound bites 
but arledge said he thinks the spectacle of a staged convention 
increases the cynicism about politics in this country 
particularly among young people who look at this and just cant 
imagine that the windbags and speeches and demonstrations and 
orchestrated happenings are an important part of the political 
process 
if the parties want to continue to do that its their 
business not mine i think its a mistake arledge said 
earlier this year the networks were excited by the prospect of 
contested nominations in both parties and the idea of returning to 
gaveltogavel coverage was even discussed but by the time the 
democrats arrived in atlanta there was little drama left 
nevertheless all three networks devoted two hours a night of 
prime time to the convention 
as for future coverage arledge said i think it might be less 
in 92 if the situation were identical 
nbcs grossman said he would cut back on coverage in new orleans 
when the gop meets if the network had not devoted more time to the 
democrats vice president george bush has the nomination sewed up 
but he hasnt yet selected a running mate 
on a basic editorial judgment we would be hard put not to go 
to an hour special a night summarizing the convention in new 
orleans except for the fundamental issues of fairness and 
balance grossman said 
the networks are not constrained by law to give equal time 
because the conventions are considered news events 
as for 1992 prospects grossman said i think the networks 
will all play a role but it would be hard to think that we would 
give the same kind of coverage we may do hourly summaries 
former cbs anchor walter cronkite who has been covering 
conventions since 1952 agrees they have become less functional 
we are in the position of covering a staged entertainment and 
it turns out the parties are not nearly as good at that as they are 
at politics 
but he did not favor cutting coverage i think its a shame 
the public is not more attentive to these proceedings the mere 
gathering of these people in one hall is i think fascinating into 
itself 
not everything in life can be or should be made for 
television some things are more important rather said not 
everything in life can be or should made to conform to 
entertainment values

told about prostitution arson and even soliciting a killing 
we have been shocked by the ugliness of this organization how 
big it was how extensive it was said mayor dorothy johnson 
the jury selected from racine county about 125 miles to the 
south began deliberating thursday in the case against william 
evers evers 49 who once owned massage parlors is charged with 
three counts of racketeering 32 prostitutionrelated charges and 
one misdemeanor theft charge 
in closing arguments defense attorney eric stearn said the 
community was trying to blame evers for all its problems 
at a preliminary hearing in september in fact a judge blamed 
the community 
none of it would have been possible without the patronage of 
the people of the fox river valley reserve judge albert twesme 
of galesville had said they are the ones who made all this 
despicable behavior possible it was they who made these activities 
lucrative 
twesme said he had been shocked by testimony that some of the 
prostitutes were busiest after sunday church services 
appleton a community about 64000 on the fox river in 
northeastern wisconsin is home to several paper companies a 
university freshly painted homes clean streets and plenty of 
smiling faces 
this is considered a family community said william welch 
president of the fox cities chamber of commerce 
outagamie county assistant district attorney john des jardins 
who called more than 100 witnesses and introduced nine boxes of 
state exhibits described a criminal enterprise that ran a 
prostitution network in appleton oshkosh and green bay dating back 
to the late 1970s 
johnson and investigators pointed out that many of the patrons 
of the businesses came from other areas to appleton which has 
become a retailing center in the area 
if anything perhaps government and attitudes here are so 
clean that people are so circumspect that when a problem like this 
comes up it gets more attention said welch 
des jardins said prostitution was no greater a problem in the 
fox valley than in other areas of similar size but the evers case 
may have opened peoples eyes 
it wasnt running rampant but there was a lot more going on 
that some people thought the prosecutor said 
twesme said he did not know how it could have gone on so long in 
the community 
how is it able to go on in all our metropolitan area maybe 
people look the other way i dont know he said in a telephone 
interview 
johnson mayor since 1980 said the city never turned its eyes 
away and she believed it was a credit to the city that local police 
and authorities pursued the case 
she said appleton was one of the states fastestgrowing cities 
and the case described in court is not an unusual situation by 
any means in any city that is growing 
investigators first began receiving some information on the 
businesses in 1980 the appleton investigation began in late 1986 
and officers over the years made arrests for ordinance violations 
said appleton police lt john parker 
it was an unusual situation for this community we knew it was 
there but we had to build our case parker said 
you can keep arresting the girls and the proprietors and 
managers parker added but what good does it do

democratic officials and delegates to the partys 
40th national convention seem convinced that this weeks lowdrama 
show of balance and unity may be just the ticket for michael 
dukakis fall campaign against george bush 
optimism was unmistakable here as democrats examined the 
implications of the dukakisbentsenjackson pact forged as the 
convention week began 
were on the threshold of putting together one of the most 
powerful coalitions in recent history party chairman paul kirk 
said thursday 
throughout many of the 50 state delegations as dukakisbentsen 
backers began to explore their tentative alliance with jackson 
supporters the implications of having a moderate white southerner 
on a ticket embraced by jesse jackson seemed to offer attractive 
possibilities 
jacksons people and dukakis people are now one and the 
same said jackson campaign chairman willie brown on thursday 
many delegates said they were struck by jacksons call tuesday 
night for democrats to find common ground whatever their 
ideological differences he began with a salute to former president 
carter and then brought civil rights pioneer rosa parks to the 
stand for a salute 
it takes two wings to fly he said 
that was clearly the thinking that motivated dukakis as he 
worked over the past two weeks to juggle two delicate political 
deals the addition of bentsen to his ticket and the courtship of 
jackson and his supporters for the fall campaign 
his success in holding together the new coalition in working 
with both bentsen and jackson without alienating supporters of 
either could be a key to dukakis success in a close election 
and in building the sort of partywide base that eluded carter 
during his term of office 
people come to conventions for different reasons usually to 
fight or win said illinois attorney general neal hartigan a 
white party regular whose state delegation featured a sometimes 
fractious racial split this time you can smell it people want 
to win 
following dukakis wednesday night victory for the nomination 
rep charles hayes of chicago said i cant help but say my 
preference is jesse but im willing to face up to what is real 
what is real is bentsen the moderatetoconservative texan who 
was blasphemed by another illinois congressman rep gus savage as 
a white male southern reaganite warhawk about whose nomination 
i am insulted 
marching to the beat of his own drummer savage said that if 
dukakis wants to pander to white southerners with the bentsen 
choice tell them to get their votes from the white south 
thats just what more prominent black leaders said they have in 
mind 
the white elected officials in alabama from the senate down 
to the courthouse need to go out and support the ticket 
birmingham mayor richard arrington said in an interview they did 
not do it with mondale 
in a thursday evening address he told the convention 
as we do battle this fall take note my friends the enemy is 
not in this hall in this hall we have family i am from 
birmingham we know about strife discord hurt feelings shattered 
dreams dashed hopes but we also know about healing rebuilding 
putting differences behind us about yesterdays enemy being 
todays ally 
mayor joe riley of charleston who has seen many democratic 
presidential candidates flame out in his home state said he sees 
bentsen attracting the swing vote in south carolina the 
independents who sometimes vote republican and sometimes vote 
democratic 
that might not make the difference in a state as conservative as 
rileys but delegates hoped it would tip the balance in a less 
rockribbed state like the one next door 
even with a healthy percent of the swing white vote dukakis 
probably cannot hope to win a state like north carolina without a 
high turnout among blacks and so reaction like that of lewis 
woods a jackson delegate from catawba county nc is important 
to the dukakis campaign 
we dont forget where we came from weve got to keep hope 
alive but what that means now is unity in the democratic 
party woods said 
sen terry sanford said he expects north carolina to be a hotly 
contested bellwether state with bentsen and jackson both 
working for the ticket 
the coalition kirk is dreaming about for the fall campaign can 
already be seen in another swing state georgia state sen al 
scott said he hopes the blackwhite partnership will be extended to 
atlanta mayor andrew young who is considering a campaign for 
governor in the meantime scott said he was encouraged by the 
positive reaction of white politicians to jacksons convention 
address and by sen sam nunns denunciation of the south african 
policy of apartheid in his remarks 
if bush werent worried about all this hed be relaxing at his 
summer place in kennebunkport instead of counterprogramming the 
democrats with appearances this week in michigan the carolinas 
wisconsin and new jersey

house speaker jim wrights role in this weeks 
convention has underscored a democratic sleaze factor thats 
stifled virtually all rhetoric about attorney general edwin meese 
republican critics said thursday 
i think they have felt uncomfortable talking about sleaze when 
the camera right over the shoulder of the speaker focuses on jim 
wright said rep guy vander jagt rmich 
im never happy when youre talking about which sleaze is the 
greatest he added but i sure dont think the democrats want 
to open the door to the debate as to whose sleaze stain is 
biggest 
capping a weeklong gop truth squad effort a panel of 
republican officials launched some of their sharpest attacks on 
democratic nominee michael dukakis and insisted that ethical 
questions surrounding meese and others in the reagan administration 
have been effectively defused by wrights problems 
wright is under investigation by the house ethics committee over 
allegations that he channeled royalties from a book of his writings 
into his campaign fund and that the book was edited by a staffer on 
his congressional payroll he has rejected any suggestions of 
wrongdoing 
the texas congressman is presiding over this weeks democratic 
national convention despite some suggestions that he should have 
stepped aside 
meese who has resigned and will leave office next month has 
been the subject of two investigations over his finances and 
ethics independent counsel james mckay in a report filed this 
week said meese had probably violated some tax and 
conflictofinterest laws but said he found no grounds to indict 
him 
while meeses name has been mentioned during the week his legal 
troubles have not been a central issue during the convention 
mike mccurry spokesman for the democratic convention said that 
in general the democrats have steered away from highlighting 
meeses problems because we felt in was important to stay focused 
on delivering a positive message about what democrats would do 
the republicans also worked hard to sow some divisions among the 
democratic ticket of dukakis and texas sen lloyd bentsen 
vander jagt said dukakis has benefited throughout the primary 
process because hes been running against jesse jackson and that 
casts him in the role of the moderate alternative 
with the more conservative bentsen at his side vander jagt 
said voters will begin to view dukakis as a liberal damaging 
democratic hopes 
it is lloyd bentsen that is going to help us turn off the 
reagan democrats and conservative because by comparing bentsens 
voting record and what dukakis is for that paints mike dukakis as 
the lefty liberal that he is vander jagt said 
it is bentsen that is our salvation vander jagt said it 
has been a great convention for republicans

former president jimmy carter said thursday that 
communism would have died in nicaragua long ago had it not been for 
the failed policies of the reagan administration 
restoring peace and human rights to that country can still be 
accomplished in an enlightened and competent and honest 
administration carter said 
carter spoke at a luncheon for hispanic and native american 
delegates to the democratic national convention at his new 
presidential libary 
we could have had peace in nicaragua long ago we could have 
had a death of communism in nicaragua long ago and an enhancement 
of freedom and democracy in nicaragua long ago had the united 
states government worked with our other democratic friends in this 
hemisphere carter said 
the reagan administration has sought to undermine the marxist 
sandinista government of nicaragua by financing the contra rebels 
carter said the united states should support democracy and human 
rights but not intrude in its neighbors affairs 
its contrary to my philosophy for us to try to impose our own 
will or to give advice to our neighbors to the south he said 
they are just as competent as are residents of my own nation to 
make decisions about the future 
rep bill richardson dnm said carter had conducted a far 
different foreign policy in central america than reagan 
there was a time when the united states did not mine harbors 
a time when our government did not deal with drug lords a time 
when our government did conduct foreign policy with dummy companies 
and white house conspiracies said richardson 
carter said jesse jackson told him that all he wants from 
michael dukakis is the same close relationship minority leaders 
enjoyed with carter 
the former president said he never made a major campaign or 
white house decision without consulting them their political 
support was absolutely crucial to my success he said 
and when you arrived at the white house you found top staff 
members and members of my cabinet who understood your problems and 
would listen to your voice said carter 
he said he now sees the same relationship evolving in its 
initial stages at this convention its not a concession on the 
part of dukakis and his people its a great reaching out and an 
additional asset to him 
richardson noting much is made of dukakis fluency in spanish 
recalled that as governor of georgia carter once addressed an 
organization of american states meeting in spanish 
yes laughed carter but i dont think either the latin 
contingent or the americans could understand what i said

michael dukakis the methodical campaign 
marathoner accepts the presidential nomination tonight from a 
newly unified democratic party his top aide acknowledging dukakis 
is still no household word said hell use his primetime 
television address to tell the american people who he is 
dukakis won the nomination over jesse jackson in a wednesday 
night roll call that was loud and long but lacking in suspense he 
had clinched victory in a string of primary election wins in the 
spring 
a last obstacle to unity was removed today when jacksons 
supporters did not submit a petition by a 9 am deadline to put 
his name in nomination to challenge texas sen lloyd bentsen in 
tonights vicepresidential roll call 
just mr bentsens petitions had been turned in said rick 
boylan an aide in the convention secretarys office 
in another sign of harmony jackson campaign chairman willie 
brown emerging from a meeting with the congressional black caucus 
said jacksons people and dukakis people are now one and the 
same 
meanwhile dukakis went to the omni convention hall to practice 
his speech at the podium he objected at one point to a sentence 
that didnt sound right thats lousy he told an aide who had 
helped write the speech 
later he made a brief appearance at a luncheon sponsored by the 
democratic national committee and the partys senate and house 
campaign committees 
as all of you know im a stemwinding orator he said with 
selfdeprecating humor he went on to say his wife had asked to 
look at his acceptance speech 
i said ok and she went into the bedroom he said when i 
went into the room myself to get my jacket my wife was fast asleep 
on the bed and the speech was beside her halfread 
campaign chairman paul brountas said dukakis would use the 
speech to reach out to voters 
during the course of this campaign while governor dukakis has 
traveled extensively probably no more than three or four or five 
million people have seen him personally on television brountas 
said 
so dukakis will use his acceptance speech to introduce himself 
identify himself and tell the american people who he is where he 
came from what he has done and what his vision of the future is 
brountas said 
dukakis speeches are generally lowkey affairs but brountas 
indicated there was no concern he would seem dull after the 
highenergy efforts of jackson and others at this weeks democratic 
national convention 
some people may compare but i think mike dukakis has gotten 
where he is by being what he is and i think thats what youll see 
tonight brountas said on cbstv 
now just 10 days after a blowup over dukakis selection of 
bentsen as running mate the conventions next order of business is 
bentsens formal nomination and acceptance tonight giving the 
democrats a ticket considerably less liberal than has become 
customary 
the frictions touched off by the choice of bentsen and by 
dukakis failure to notify jackson first once threatened to raise 
a jackson challenge for second place a job he said he wanted 
but in the determined spirit of harmony that guided this 
convention that seemed forgotten 
with no suspense about the outcome the delegate tally wednesday 
night reached 287625 for dukakis to 12185 for jackson before 
jackson released his delegates to make the nomination unanimous 
so tonight belongs to dukakis to deliver an acceptance speech 
setting the theme for his campaign to break an eightyear gop lock 
on the white house and defeat vice president george bush the sure 
nominee of the republican party 
in the long battle of primary elections dukakis the 
massachusetts governor outlasted six other opponents and won 22 of 
36 states he promised to extend nationally the massachusetts 
miracle of economic prosperity that has blessed his home state 
dukakis showed little emotion when the nomination finally became 
his during a latenight convention roll call wednesday 
we want mike thousands of delegates roared they waved a 
sea of signs they would have danced if there had been room in the 
narrow aisles 
its all a little bit like a play i feel terrific dukakis 
said watching on television at a nearby hotels penthouse with his 
wife kitty and family 
he smiled and raised his fist in victory as california delegates 
gave him the winning margin 
dukakis and bentsen came to this convention city with a modest 
lead in the polls over bush who calls himself the underdog with 
the intense publicity of this week the democrats look for a boost 
democrats believe bush unlike president reagan is vulnerable 
given the voters concern over the irancontra scandal and illegal 
drug trafficking and what the polls say is a broad uneasiness over 
the nations economic prospects 
dukakis was formally nominated by fellow gov bill clinton 
whose 35minute speech ran way beyond the 15 minutes allotted one 
of his biggest ovations came when he said in closing 
clinton described dukakis as oldfashioned the kind of man 
who plays it straight keeps his word and pays his bills 
his character is steadfast and consistent he said he 
wakes up in the same world every day a trait of no small 
importance in a president 
in a gesture weighted with symbolism jackson was put in 
nomination by union chief william winpisinger who described him as 
one who has ignited the passionate fires of justice in our 
souls

two counties have declared states of 
emergency because of nearly 100 complaints from people who say 
agricultural irrigation has caused their residential wells to dry 
up 
one legislator said he has seen water sprayers going in the heat 
of the day and sending water onto roads 
the declarations were made by kankakee county board chairman 
marwood hendrix and iroquois county board chairman russell 
rosenboom 
the declaration means the county has exhausted all of its 
resources and this allows the county to get outside help said 
vicki senesac office manager of the kankakee county planning 
department 
state sen jerome joyce and state rep phil novak said the 
illinois state water survey would investigate the complaints about 
irrigation and well failures 
the illinois department of agriculture also is to send staff 
members to the area next week to determine how many highcapacity 
irrigation wells there are in the two counties 
officials of the us army corps of engineers went to papineau 
on wednesday at the request of ted horner iroquois county 
emergency services coordinator to see if they could help 
corps officials said they could transport water but that local 
governments would have to pay if new wells were drilled 
one optimistic thing is that we have got the state agencies to 
begin to look at these complaints said novak this is becoming 
a serious issue about water rights and the allocation of 
underground water is becoming very serious 
joyce called for a show of neighborliness 
yesterday i took a drive around pembroke township and over 
around papineau and right at high noon i saw some irrigation 
equipment shooting water up in the air the most inefficient 
method at that time of day particularly said joyce also on 
the road to the iroquois conservation area you could stop in the 
middle of the road and get your car washed

correspondent paulo francis of the liberal folha de sao paulo 
newspaper of sao paulo said in a report from atlanta dukakis 
ideas are good but i confess im little scared because he has so 
many ideas this almost always fouls things up better to be a big 
healthy dope like ronald reagan and confuse bolivia with brazil 
than to be a guy who insists on interfering everywhere like 
dukakis 
the independent newspaper jornal do brasil of rio said a 
campaign promise is something so sacred that it doesnt occur to 
the american politician not to keep it when assuming an executive 
post thats why the backroom negotiations between michael dukakis 
and jesse jackson before the elaboration of the candidate dukakis 
final platform were so important it is one of the greatest 
demonstrations of how the mechanism of democracy works when it is 
practiced conscientiously

america is a very large country and what will matter is 
the administrations policy and the majority of the american public

first day back in the united states some longhair spit on my 
shoes 
mrs dukakis told washington that even if we love our country

a military judge thursday set trial for 
aug 22 in the courtmartial of lt thomas a torchia officer in 
charge of the navy rescue swimmer school when a recruit died during 
a training exercise 
airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis died in march 
when he was forced back into a swimming pool after he panicked 
climbed out and screamed that he was quitting the school at 
pensacola naval air station 
torchia who was on the telephone in his office overlooking the 
pool when mirecki was pushed into the water is charged with 
dereliction of duty 
the navy had offered torchia a chance to accept nonjudicial 
punishment but he opted for the courtmartial though a trial 
gives him a chance of being exonerated he risks up to three months 
imprisonment and removal from the navy if convicted 
four instructors agreed to take nonjudicial punishment of loss 
of pay and rank after being charged with conspiracy to commit 
battery

manslaughter battery and conspiracy to commit battery is petty 
officer 2nd class michael combe one of the instructors 
the navy has alleged combe forced mireckis head under water 
just before he collapsed and died 
at a hearing last month a navy psychiatrist testified mirecki 
had a phobia about being dragged under water and that fear 
triggered heart failure followed by drowning when mirecki was 
forced under by instructors a pathologist was uncertain whether 
the recruit died from the heart attack or drowning 
a flight surgeon had declared mirecki unfit for the rescue

democrats shouldnt assume nominee michael 
dukakis will retain his lead among women voters because certain 
opponent george bush is about to become a bornagain on 
feminist issues rep pat schroeder of colorado said thursday 
ms schroeder who briefly pondered a run for president last 
summer told women activists that bush has scheduled speeches 
before womens groups and will begin moving to cut into a gender 
gap that has found him trailing badly among women in most polls 
if hes successful she said dukakis will lose the fall 
election 
if george bush bridges the gender gap hell win ms 
schroeder said they did it in 1984 dont let those other folks 
steal it we cant afford it 
throughout the week of the democratic national convention the 
women delegates and other activists have been meeting daily to 
devise ways to push feminist issues and build on dukakis strength 
among women 
ms schroeder issued a blunt warning that the stakes are 
enormous and the outcome far from settled 
he bush is going to become a born again daycare advocate 
ms schroeder said george bush is going to try to transplant 
mike dukakis record onto his resume 
in addition ms schroeder said democrats who control congress 
risk losing their support among women unless they win approval for 
such feminist priorities as required maternity leaves 
we cant keep talking gender gap and keep voting it down 
ms scroeder said 
beginning with the keynote speech of the convention by texas 
treasurer ann richards bush has been under fire from women and 
ms schroeder continued the assault as the gathering neared its 
end insisting republicans have been insensitive to womens issues 
their problem is the shortage of nannies in america she 
said somehow it doesnt translate into having to live on 
10000 per year

rain this week over some droughtstricken areas brought 
instant recovery for some hay farmers but other crops are 
still threatened and more rain is needed 
overall it has eased things a little bit but the drought is 
still in effect said alan ringo a hydrologist with the national 
weather service in cleveland those streams and reservoirs that 
were low are still going to be low because for the most part all 
this rain was sucked up into the earth 
the grass will turn green and it will help somewhat for the 
crops but if they had the rain two or three weeks ago it would 
have been much better he said 
farmers are in a much better mood than three weeks ago said 
morris bitzer an extension specialist with the university of 
kentucky in lexington 
a bill to give droughtstricken wisconsin farmers a property tax 
cut of up to 1000 was signed thursday by gov tommy thompson 
farmers said it would not make or break them but it would help 
its hard its tough for the government to come out and 
please everybody said carl gorell 76 who owns a 240acre farm 
at seymour wis they cant make it rain and that would be the 
only way to do it 
rainfall amounts varied widely ranging across ohio from 062 
inch at toledo since monday morning to 528 inches at cincinnati 
the weather service said massachusetts quabbin reservoir which 
supplies 25 million people including boston has 431 inches so 
far this month above the normal 394 
eastern iowa got isolated showers wednesday but amounts were 
onetenth of an inch or less while northern new jersey got more 
than 6 inches 
parts of tennessee got a few inches of rain in the past week 
but as of the end of june the area was 63 inches below normal for 
the past four years which is more than a years normal rainfall 
the rain cooled parts of iowa but most of the state is still 
firmly in the grip of the dfrought said acting state climatologist 
harry hillaker 
there are certainly areas which are much better off than they 
were two weeks ago but 8085 percent of the state is still very 
much drier than usual said hillaker 
western massachusetts farmers said the rain was too late for 
some crops 
right now you take what you can get scott danner sales 
coordinator for the 66member pioneer valley growers association 
said thursday what was lost during the dry spell is gone and 
wont come back the sweet corn had a rough time and so did the 
peppers but this will help save what is left 
our problem now is our fields are muddy said great 
barrington mass vegetable grower daniel tawcynski but its 
either feast or famine 
gary palmer a tobacco specialist for the university of kentucky 
college of agriculture said the rain did a tremendous job of 
bringing the tobacco out of the problems it had been in 
he estimated the burley yield would be reduced as much as 10 
percent to 15 percent or maybe 150 million pounds short of the 
eightstate quota because of the drought 
the kentuckyamerican water co which serves several central 
kentucky counties said its customers will remain on a water alert 
despite increased flow of the kentucky river 
august is typically dry and that has some bearing on our 
making a decision too soon said robert edens company vice 
president and general manager the kentucky river reacts quickly 
to rain it also reacts quickly when it is dry and the rainfall is 
not to be interpreted as a cureall

ali people spent 750 to 5000 a space after sizing up the 
situation she said she gave up nine of her spaces and sent home 
the people she had hired 
the vendors in the huge world congress center were all but 
hidden from delegates who attended the convention in the omni arena 
next door which was next door in the same way that fort worth is 
next door to dallas the area is four floors down marked by a 
small sign 
many of the 275 vendors have pulled out and mark weiner 
marketing director for the democratic national convention 
committee said he refunded 100000 in booth rental fees the

convention next month but i would not want to go into another deal 
like this she said this is a raw deal

convention but that he decided to try it because there is little 
summer business anyway he paid 1500 for his space on his rack 
are coats priced from 675 for a rabbit furlined raincoat to 
5995 for a natural female black glama mink which he says sells 
for 14000 in season 
im sorry we came he said but you have to spend money to 
make money 
ms ali said we are considering legal advice we have 
consulted an attorney to see if there is any recovery its a 
horrible situation for a small business firm 
ms spencer has been working conventions for three years if 
its set up right vendors can make back their expenses and make 
money the first day she said im out 15000 i have to pay 
for the hotel rooms of employees their meals their 
transportation 
she pointed to the furriers booth if there were people 
coming by they would have been swamped with inquiries youd see 
women trying on coats i havent seen any one doing it yet

primetime choreography has sapped the democratic 
national convention of its spontaneity reducing delegates to 
television props with no real deliberative role some complained 
thursday 
the whole focus has been subordinated to tv showmanship 
said jerry calvert a delegate from bozeman mont this 
convention is much less a deliberative body than a television 
extravaganza and thats bad 
calvert and others in a sampling of delegates said the unity on 
display at the convention was preferable to disarray but there was 
a cost they said in achieving that unity and projecting it to the 
nation 
just about everything is rubberstamped said bob madore 
from newington conn i feel somewhat like a prop the stage is 
set the agenda is there the program is established delegates 
dont have much of a say 
convention sessions are carefully planned and controlled 
videotaped biographies break up the speeches house lights rise and 
fall to signal applause all but two platform issues were settled 
before the opening gavel 
ultimately delegates said it is the structure of modern 
conventions that prevented much drama the primary elections and 
caucuses gave massachusetts gov michael dukakis enough votes to 
prevail on whatever issue arose 
because of the nature of conventions having changed no longer 
are major matters decided said sen paul simon of illinois an 
unsuccessful candidate for the nomination who is attending as a 
delegate 
im not saying its overchoreographed but it is 
choreographed he said the reality is its a huge rally 
as such there is a sense of illusion in the proceedings what 
comes across on tv probably suggests that we are all having more 
fun than we really are on the floor said linda almy of 
underhill vt its mostly genuine but it feels staged 
sometimes 
despite such frustrations delegates said they recognized value 
in the convention planners approach this is much smoother much 
better run than the 84 convention said state sen mary just 
skinner also of vermont im pleased that its choreographed so 
well it makes for a lot of unity 
skinner noted that delegates are discussing issues of substance 
at forums outside the convention hall and several delegates said 
they already had played their key roles by organizing in their 
states for their candidates 
ive been in involved in the process right along when you 
come here as a convention delegate thats the just end of the big 
game said jack obenour of mansfield ohio 
were not playing around here said delegate tom best of 
tumwater wash we came because we believe in the process 
calvert though critical of the emphasis on television images 
said the convention had maintained its integrity the national 
convention is the one place when this political party meets as an 
institution and this meeting is necessary to the organizational 
vitality of the institution he said its not just an 
extravaganza 
on another level it is psychologically exciting to be part of 
a mass of people that share common values and goals calvert 
said thats worth the trip

democrats looking ahead to the fall campaign 
called illegal narcotics trafficking a new kind of national 
security threat and said thursday that the reagan administration 
was premature in announcing progress in the crusade for a drugfree 
america 
members of the democratic senatorial campaign committee meeting 
on the final day of their partys national convention accused the 
republican administration and gop nomineeinwaiting george bush 
by association of cutting funds for drug education and 
enforcement programs at the same time it announced fullscale war 
against dealers 
sen dennis deconcini of arizona said the administration is 
seeking to cut more than 450 million for state and local drug 
enforcement programs and 60 percent of the 3 million that was spent 
in 1986 on drug education programs 
the forum called for coordination between federal state and 
local governments in such areas as education interdiction and 
rehabilitation and it declared that while democrats might not have 
all the solutions they had the leadership necessary to wage a 
successful war on drugs 
the antidrug rhetoric resounded at the session 
sen john kerry of massachusetts called the widespread use and 
trafficking a new kind of national security threat financed by 
the narcodollar 
we have a crime wave sweeping across america that is due to 
one factor and one factor only illegal drugs added deconcini 
who presided over the forum 
deconcini said that while president reagan pronounced progress 
in the campaign toward a drugfree america the hard fact is this 
nation is outmanned outgunned and outspent by narcotics 
traffickers 
the participants praised democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis and runner up jesse jackson for their leadership on the 
drug issue 
democrats should be particularly grateful to jesse jackson on 
this issue which runs very very deep for the american 
people said consultant john marttila 
he said a survey for americans talk security a group formed to 
promote interest in national security affairs said 41 percent of 
the those polled considered illegal drug trafficking as the first 
or second most important national security concern 
the survey polled 6013 registered voters between october 1987 
and may 1988 it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent

would be an energetic active last six months for president 
reagans administration 
as reagan vacationed at his ranch in the santa ynez mountains 
north of of santa barbara duberstein and 14 other white house 
officials met for three and a half hours at a santa barbara hotel 
to discuss a wide range of issues 
duberstein said the president had asked him about two weeks ago 
to hold the meeting 
he wants a positive energetic active last six months of his 
presidency the chief of staff said 
he said reagan who returns to washington on sunday plans to 
meet with republican congressional leaders on tuesday 
one of the subjects for discussion at that meeting he said 
will be ways to get as much aid as possible for the contra 
rebels in nicaragua

nature he said it is something we are going to discuss with the 
congressional leaders next week

relief legislation and other domestic policy measures he said the 
officials also agreed that special attention needs to be given 
to getting senate action on 26 federal judicial nominations that 
reagan has sent to capitol hill 
on the foreign policy side he said the administration will be 
moving forward toward a treaty with the soviet union on 
intercontinentalrange nuclear missiles following up last 
decembers pact on intermediate and shorterrange missiles

meeting and the president told him he was anxious to get going 
on the agenda 
he said the group also discussed plans for reagans 
participation in the presidential and congressional election

vietnam said thursay it will try to 
resolve 70 priority cases of missing us servicemen this year and 
will carry out more joint excavations at warplane crash sites 
foreign minister nguyen co thach made the pledges in an exchange 
of letters this month with retired gen john w vessey us 
presidential envoy on the issue of accounting for 1761 americans 
still missing 13 years after the vietnam war ended according to a 
voice of vietnam radio report 
thach affirms vietnams efforts to solve before the end of 
this year 70 cases of americans missing in action considered 
priority by the us side said the broadcast monitored in 
bangkok 
he welcomes the us side for joint efforts in seeking out and 
excavating the remains of mias in august september and october 
this year 
a us government statement read to reporters in washington 
said we have long urged vietnam to agree to joint activities 
such as field investigations surveys and excavations to expedite 
the resolution of the powmia issue 
the vietnamese offer is an encouraging development and we 
look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in the coming months 
the two governments have agreed to hold planning meetings in hanoi 
july 2528 to discuss technical aspects of implementing this 
offer 
vessey and thach reached an agreement in august 1987 under which 
vietnam would speed the search for remains and the united states 
would consider vietnams humanitarian concerns 
washington has sent medical teams and encouraged private 
american agencies to help vietnamese including those disabled in 
the war 
last august vessey gave thach a list of 70 discrepancy 
cases the united states considers most easily resolvable because 
the vietnamese should have information on them included are cases 
in which there are photographs of airmen taken after they were 
captured 
vietnam has delivered many purported mia remains since 
including 27 sets april 6 the largest turnover since the war few 
discrepancy cases have been resolved however and us officials 
have complained about the slow pace 
despite pledges to do so vietnam has not allowed joint 
excavations since the first one a dig in late 1985 at the site of 
a b52 bomber crash near hanoi us officials in bangkok say the 
vietnamese have not given a clear explanation 
on thursday the radio said thach wrote vessey a letter july 9 
urging the united states to seriously carry out all agreements 
relating to vietnam 
it said a reply received monday welcomed the joint excavations 
according to the report vessey hoped that the cooperation 
between the two countries this year will be continued and 
expanded and said the united states will continue trying to 
respond to vietnams humanitarian concerns 
thach indicated previously vietnam wants more us government 
aid but washington refuses to agree until vietnam ends its 
9yearold occupation of cambodia 
the united states and vietnam have no diplomatic ties but 
relations have improved with the recent agreements 
diplomats said one indication was the relative speed with which 
vietnam returned three us navy aviators it rescued after their 
plane made an emergency landing july 12 in the south china sea 
they arrived at subic bay naval base in the philippines on tuesday 
previously any foreigners found in vietnamese territorial 
waters were confined for months in difficult conditions 
the same hard bargaining continued however bill schauer a 
us embassy spokesman in bangkok said thursday vietnam asked the 
united states to pay all costs incurred in the rescue 
transportation and lodging of the aviators 
this request is under review he said

thai officials expressed outrage thursday at a 
proposal that they lend sculptures to the art institute in exchange 
for returning a historic relic the thai government contends was 
illegally removed from the country 
the feeling of the people of thailand is that it is stolen 
said prince subhadradis diskul an expert in thai art and 
archaeology who came to chicago to negotiate return of a 
900yearold sculpture from a temple 
and they think that if it is stolen we shouldnt have to send 
anything in return he added at a news conference 
the stone sculpture at issue called a lintel or crosspiece 
over a door or window is titled birth of brahma with reclining 
vishnu on a makara 
the 2feetlong by 3feetwide lintel depicts the hindu god 
vishnu reclining on water and dates to cambodias khmer dynasty 
from 8051250 ad it is the only important original piece missing 
from the 10acre khmer temple of phnom rung in the northeastern 
buri ram province near the cambodian border 
following a morning meeting art institute of chicago officials 
proposed a revolvingloan program that would bring to chicago for 
at least 10 years ancient thai sculptures of a comparable period 
and aesthetic importance 
the prince and a delegation of thai officials planned to take 
the proposal back to their government but he predicted it would be 
rejected 
the piece was legally purchased by a dealer in bangkok who sold 
it to a new york dealer who finally sold it to the alsdorf 
foundation of winnetka ill said art institute spokeswoman eileen 
harakal it was on loan to the art institute from 1967 until 1983 
when the foundation made it a gift she said 
the art institute said is had no legal requirement to return the 
lintel under terms of the 1970 unesco agreement or the 1983 us 
cultural property act 
but the art institute proposed that three sculptures be loaned 
for display over a 10year period with the third one returned to 
thailand following successful negotiation of a continuing loan 
agreement between the two parties 
but if negotiations fail at that time the prince said 
they would keep the third piece we can agree to everything but 
they want a guarantee these negotiations would be successful 
this is not a loan it is an exchange 
the agreement was designed to be vague enough so that there 
would be something to work with so that both sides would have 
something they want ms harakal said 
on july 4 about 30 thai university students staged a peaceful 
protest in bangkok outside the us embassy urging the us 
government to help return the ancient lintel 
and members of the thai vishnu lintel committee have staged 
similar protests outside the art institute in recent months the 
group scheduled another demonstration saturday 
in effect they are holding this piece for ransom said 
katherine bowie a university of chicago anthropologist and 
committee member it does not seem by any stretch of the 
imagination to be right 
the prince said he believed his government would reject the art 
institute proposal and simply drop the matter 
we will probably put a sign at the temple where the lintel 
should be so tourists including americans will know it was 
taken that we asked to give it back he concluded and that 
they would not

college and moved to the united states in 1984 on a workers permit 
after marrying in july 1985 she applied for citizenship

president saddam hussein said thursday he 
was astonished iran rejected facetoface peace talks with iraq in 
favor of indirect unmediated talks to end the persian gulf war 
diplomats in baghdad said iraq fears un peacemaking efforts 
will fail despite irans acceptance monday of a un resolution 
calling for a ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold conflict 
iran on wednesday rejected a call by iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz for direct talks sponsored by un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
the iraqi news agency said hussein stressed the un resolution 
was not a temporary formula for a ceasefire but part of a 
framework for ending the war 
hussein said he was astonished iran rejected direct talks 
adding that anyone who rejected them did not want peace but only 
sought tactical gain the report said 
hussein made his comments in a telephone conversation with 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi the iraqi agency said it did 
not provide direct quotes from the conversation 
iraq has claimed iran accepted the ceasefire resolution monday 
only to give its forces time to regroup after a series of losses on 
the battlefield 
later in the day hussein chaired a meeting of the ruling 
revolution command council during which top leaders stressed the 
necessity of a positive iranian response to the iraqi proposals 
the iraqi agency said 
iraqi proposals include direct ceasefire talks leading to 
fullfledged peace talks the clearing of the clogged shattalarab 
waterway and guarantees of free navigation including a halt to 
attacks on shipping in the persian gulf 
first deputy foreign minister wissam zahawi told the news agency 
irans rejection of direct peace talks is tantamount to rejection 
of the united nations ceasefire measure itself and of the 
principle of a comprehensive and lasting peace 
if the iranians dont want to talk to iraq then who do they 
want to talk to zahawi asked 
a western diplomat in baghdad who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the iraqis regard direct talks as a token of 
serious purpose 
iraqi officials who accepted the un resolution upon its 
adoption last july have repeatedly insisted the ceasefire must be 
part of a broader plan to achieve peace 
if it is clear the secretarygeneral is only talking about a 
ceasefire they the iraqis will certainly put a stop to it 
the western diplomat said 
iraqi suspicions have been fueled by iranian assertions that a 
ceasefire would not end the war 
diplomats said the iraqis have been mistrustful of perez de 
cuellar since september of last year when he appeared to consider 
iraniansuggested modifications to the ceasefire measure 
they certainly dont trust the iranians they really dont 
trust the secretarygeneral and they dont much trust the rest of 
the world the western diplomat said 
public reaction to the iranian announcement has been muted in 
iraq which has suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in the 
war diplomats atttributed the muted reaction to skepticism that 
the iranians truly want peace

a small fire in an unused kitchen at the us 
ambassadors residence destroyed some american indian prints and 
handicrafts that were in storage for an exhibition planned in the 
fall a spokesman said thursday 
us embassy press attache richard gilbert said the fire was 
detected at about 450 pm wednesday in the kitchen of what was 
previously a separate apartment within the residence but is now 
used as an art gallery 
ambassador jack matlocks wife rebecca had received an advance 
shipment from a group in michigan for an exhibit she plans on 
american indian art this fall gilbert said he did not know the 
name of the group whose works were involved 
the prints and handicrafts were being stored in the unused 
kitchen he said 
it appears that the electric stove somehow got turned on 
gilbert said 
he did not know the value of the artworks ruined in the fire 
which was put out by soviet firefighters shortly after they were 
summoned to the residence known as spaso house 
there was no damage to the main quarters of the residence

in a unity gesture that would make michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson proud cbs newsmen dan rather and walter 
cronkite posed happily in their anchor booth at the democratic 
national convention thursday to show what good friends they are 
the problems of the past are the past theyre gone said 
cronkite who preceded rather as the top cbs anchor rather called 
cronkite a master broadcaster 
things were not so chummy last year when cronkite suggested 
rather should have been fired for walking off the cbs evening 
news set in miami and causing six minutes of air silence recent 
tellall books about cbs news recounted how cronkite steamed as he 
stood by in a studio in washington as rather ignored him during the 
1984 convention 
cronkite is renegotiating his contract with cbs after suggesting 
he might be free to work for another network under a phaseout that 
kicks in this fall 
so cronkite was invited back into the anchor booth this year to 
provide commentary during the conventions he and rather often 
chatted amiably during cbs coverage 
we would be terribly dishonest if we said that we hadnt had 
communications problems in the last couple of years but as far as 
im concerned that ended with our association with this event 
said cronkite i will also say that i came into it with a certain 
amount of trepidation which perhaps dan had since we havent been 
in the close communication we once had in the last few years i 
feel really very warmly that we have reestablished that 
communication here

vice president george bush said thursday 
that the democratic partys show of unity in atlanta for michael 
dukakis will soon fade and we will remember gone with the wind 
about his presidential rivals convention city 
bush on a campaign swing to the carolinas on the climactic day 
of the democratic gathering said he watched the roll call for 
dukakis nomination wednesday night and was impressed by the 
apparent unity it reflected 
but i dont know whats bubbling under the surface bush 
said at a news conference opening a visit to the carolinas 
theres a lot of bubbling discontent on their side 
but thats got nothing to do with me he continued my 
business is to take on michael dukakis 
soon the convention will be over and we will remember gone 
with the wind said bush in a sly reference to the famed civil 
war movie set in atlanta 
the vice president however praised dukakis as a very good 
man and said he intended to watch his rivals acceptance speech 
on television thursday night 
im going to stay plugged in bush said at the airport news 
conference earlier he said he missed the first two days of the 
democratic convention entirely while he was in the midst of a 
fourday fishing excursion with treasury secretary james baker iii 
bush said he expected dukakis acceptance speech to be 
somewhat positive it would a nice change of contrast with the rest 
of the proceedings im told 
the vice president attending gop fundraisers here and in 
greenville sc told reporters im trying to keep a relatively 
low profile 
i dont think it would be good to make it look like we 
frantically jump in and try to make news in the last days of the 
democratic convention he said 
his visit to the carolinas was part of a fiveday campaign swing 
that began on wednesday 
he said he wasnt troubled by the prospect of the rev jesse 
jackson campaigning around the country for the dukakis ticket along 
with the democratic vice presidential candidate sen lloyd bentsen 
of texas 
three on two asked bush those odds arent bad bush 
didnt mention that along with his own running mate he also will 
have a powerful third force president reagan on his side 
i cant wait for the debates dukakis versus bentsen its 
going to be great bush quipped 
he made similar remarks in greenville sc saying youve 
got two different stripes and three candidates theres very 
liberal and theres lloyd bentsen 
my responsibility is just to take on the top of the ticket 
he said at the south carolina stop 
on the subject of a running mate bush reiterated that he still 
intends to delay the announcement of his choice until the 
republican national convention next month 
he told reporters on his north carolina stop that he wanted his 
decision to be laden with suspense 
i will try to avoid the perception of gameplaying or 
selecting a candidate by the applause meter he said 
the vice president said on wednesday that former rival sen bob 
dole rkan would be on any list of potential gop candidates 
bush told that democrats were ridiculing him at their 
convention with questions like where was george when key 
reagan administration decisions were made said he would not 
respond to such attacks 
you expect the ploy the old rhetorical shout at the 
convention he said just let it go 
at another point as reporters pressed him on saying when baker 
would join his campaign bush retorted lighten up 
administration and campaign sources have said baker will soon 
resign as treasury secretary to become bushs campaign chairman 
probably in the first week in august 
bush said he would have something publicly to say on bakers 
role several thursdays from now reinforcing that timetable 
baker flew to california after the fishing trip and will return 
to washington with president reagan bush confirmed 
on another subject the vice president said he had not yet read 
the report of independent counsel james mckay on attorney gen 
edwin meese 
however bush said as ive said before the justice 
department should be beyond any perception of impropriety 
the press stories have indicated there is a perception of 
impropriety in the meese case he continued that standard 
would not meet the high standard ive tried to bring to public life 
and which i would aspire to have in cabinet appointees 
bush previously had praised meese for having done the right 
thing in announcing he would resign 
mckay said in a report earlier this week that meese probably 
violated tax and conflictofinterest laws even though no criminal 
prosecution would be pursued

armenians ignored activists calls for a strike 
thursday to protest the soviet governments rejection of their 
demand to annex a region in neighboring azerbaijan residents and 
the staterun media reported 
the reports suggested the government after a fivemonth 
struggle may be gaining the upper hand in controlling labor unrest 
that has caused millions of dollars in lost production in the 
southern republic of armenia 
however for the third night in a row a large crowd of 
armenians upset with the kremlins decision gathered thursday in 
the central square of the armenian capital yerevan after working 
hours according to one activist 
a former leader of the annexation drive igor muradyan told the 
associated press that a huge meeting took place with a 
prominent citizen he identified as sergo khanzodyan railing against 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev for failing to support armenians 
on the issue 
the telephone line went dead before muradyan could comment 
further and repeated efforts to call to his and other yerevan 
numbers met only busy signals 
meanwhile a 2monthold strike was reported continuing in the 
disputed region nagornokarabakh whose population is mostly 
armenian 
the national television news program vremya broadcast footage 
from stepanakert the regions administrative center showing 
trucks and buses standing idle construction sites empty and 
workers milling around the city 
vremya showed hundreds of buses and trucks parked in protest of 
the decision monday by the central leadership to keep the region 
within azerbaijan the broadcast blamed local officials for failing 
to encourage workers to return to their jobs 
the people are embittered said a worker with the 
gostelradio state broadcasting authority in stepanakert we dont 
know what to do but we know that the refusal to make 
nagornokarabakh part of armenia wasnt just 
a correspondent for the official soviet news agency tass in 
yerevan said the call for a strike beginning thursday went largely 
unheeded 
the majority of enterprises are working its a normal working 
day said the journalist who declined to give his name pressed 
to say whether anyone was striking he conceded some enterprises 
are not working fully 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev told reporters at a 
briefing that industries in armenia were nearly back to normal 
khovik vasilyan an armenian activist said the strike call had 
no noticeable effect in yerevan 
the city today is working factories are in operation and 
mass transit is running vasilyan a former political prisoner 
said in a telephone interview 
in a dispatch from yerevan a city of 11 million residents 
tass said that since monday more and more industrial enterprises 
of armenia have begun to work at a normal pace 
those who did not work or didnt work at their full capacity 
are returning to their jobs in yerevan kirovakan and other 
cities tass said 
armenians rallied tuesday and wednesday in yerevan to show their 
displeasure with the soviet leaderships decision 
on monday the presidium of the supreme soviet with gorbachevs 
blessing ruled that transferring nagornokarabakh to armenia would 
violate the soviet constitution because azerbaijan had objected to 
the move 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the predominantly moslem 
republic of azerbaijan for 65 years and azerbaijani leaders had 
vetoed the regions decision to secede 
armenians most of whom are christians make up threequarters 
of the 160000 people of the contested region and they contend 
that azerbaijanis discriminate against them 
the annexation movement began in february after central 
authorities rejected an initial appeal from nagornokarabakh 
strikes and mass demonstrations have plagued the region since then 
at times triggering violence such as the feb 28 riot in the 
azerbaijani port of sumgait in which 32 people were killed 
there was no word thursday on the fate of paruyr ayrikyan an 
armenian nationalist 
tass said wednesday he was being deported for active 
instigation to interethnic strife ayrikyan 39 was arrested 
march 25 and charged with defaming the soviet state 
perfilyev told reporters he believed ayrikyan was still in the 
soviet union but had received an invitation from a foreign country 
he did not identify 
speaking in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley criticized the arrest and expulsion order but had no comment 
on the territorial dispute 
asked if ayrikyan was applying for admission to the united 
states mrs oakley said we cannot confirm that mr ayrikyan 
wishes to settle in the united states should he request to come 
here we would review his request sympathetically 
however a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
soviet officials had contacted the us embassy about the 
possibility of resettling ayrikyan in the united states where he 
has relatives

taking a cue from heart surgeons 
engineers are considering a thin tube with an expandable balloon on 
the end to plug a leak that threatens a long delay of the next 
space shuttle mission 
to work the device would have to follow a tortuous path 20 
feet through a onehalf inch line that contains six sharp bends 
it would be something like a medical procedure known as an 
angioplasty but instead of opening a clogged artery it would 
close off the leaking line 
this approach is just one of several being weighed to fix the 
small leak on the launch pad and avoid rolling discovery back to a 
hangar for repairs which could delay the planned early september 
launch by as much as two months 
a decision on moving discovery is not expected until after a 
testfiring of the shuttles three main engines on the pad that 
test is set for july 28 but officials said thursday preparations 
were behind schedule and it might have to be postponed a day or two 
the leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas is in a fitting on an engine 
compartment vent line leading to an oxidizer tank it is six feet 
from the nearest access panel and thus inaccessible for normal 
repairs 
weve got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to 
do said forrest s mccartney director of the kennedy space 
center the odds he said are 5050 on a rollback of discovery 
the three main nasa centers involved with the shuttle are 
working on different approaches to fixing the leak on the pad 
at the johnson space center in houston the focus is on entering 
the shuttles cargo bay and cutting holes through both the rear of 
the bay and the engine compartment to reach the leak then plug it 
by some method including encapsulating it with a clamshelllike 
device filled with a sealant 
the kennedy space center is considering ways of reaching and 
sealing off the leak through the engine compartment access panel 
at the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala the 
materials and processing lab is devising a mockup of the 20foot 
line to test the angioplasty approach 
lab director bob schwinghamer said two heads are being developed 
for the snake 
the snake with the balloon on the end would have to run 
through this tortuous path like an angioplasty procedure he 
said the balloon would be filled with an epoxy and when it 
reached the leak it would be expanded we would leave pressure on 
the line until the expoxy cured then we could extract the snake or 
leave it there 
he said leaving the snaketube would cause no problem because 
the line is no longer needed its sole purpose is to vent excess 
air when the nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer tank is being filled the 
tank already has been filled and the tiny leak has allowed only a 
small amount of the gas to escape 
schwinghamer said the balloon material would have to be 
something like teflon or allrez to be compatible with the leaking 
nitrogen tetroxide gas the escaped gas can cause a problem if it 
mixes with moisture in the air forming corrosive nitric acid 
schwinghamer said a second approach would be to fit the head of 
the tube with a tiny string of beads to ease its course through the 
vent line at the appropriate location we would inject a sealant 
through the hollow tube he said 
engineers hope to be able to start testing all suggested 
approaches by this weekend 
discovery with a crew of five astronauts is to make the first 
shuttle flight since challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 killing 
the crew of seven

the state bar says it is investigating 
attorney e robert wallachs activities involving the wedtech corp 
and attorney general edwin meese iii as well as meese himself 
at the same time an inquiry into whether wallach and a former 
partner charged excessive fees in two civil suits has been closed 
without any accusations of improper conduct bar spokeswoman anne 
charles said wednesday 
indepenent counsel james mckay ruled out criminal charges 
against meese but concluded the attorney general had probably 
violated criminal laws on income taxes and conflicts of interest 
the report also questioned some of meeses actions on behalf of 
wallach in connection with wedtech a collapsed new york military 
contractor and a 1 billion iraqi pipeline plan 
the bar already has said it has asked for a copy of the report 
to investigate whether meese who is licensed to practice law in 
california violated any ethical standards for lawyers 
meese also faces an inquiry by the justice departments office 
of professional responsibility the opr is expected to use mckays 
report as a basis for determining whether meese may have violated 
ethical standards for officials in the executive branch of 
government 
wallach has been indicted in new york on federal charges that he 
defrauded wedtech by accepting 13 million for purported legal 
work that actually paid for his efforts to influence meese and his 
promises of favors in a future government job that never 
materialized he has denied the accusations 
the concluded investigation into wallachs legal fees involved 
an attempt by wallach and former partner david baum to collect 1 
million from a 173 million settlement in san francisco for two 
burn victims and 862000 in fees and expenses they collected from 
a 22 settlement in sacramento in both cases the fees were 
approved by judges

arkansas gov bill clinton conceded thursday that 
his nominating speech for michael dukakis bombed but he said the 
dukakis campaign wanted him to give a serious address 
clinton said he cleared the 19page address with dukakis and his 
top aides before he delivered it wednesday and they loved it 
they even added some things to the speech they said this 
really makes the case for a mike dukakis candidacy said clinton 
they wanted ann richards to be funny then for me to present 
the serious case for dukakis clinton said outside the convention 
hall richards texas treasurer delivered the keynote address on 
monday night 
clinton said when he got up to the podium wednesday night he 
realized the placardwaving crowd full of pentup emotion after 
two days of a convention dominated by jesse jackson did not want 
to hear a solemn address 
i just fell on my sword it was a comedy of errors one of 
those fluky things said clinton he acknowledged it was a bust 
in the hall 
clintons talk ran 35 minutes more than twice the allotted 
time delegates shouted wrap it up and drew fingers across 
their throats they saved their loudest cheer for when he began 
in closing 
clinton ignored a flashing red light on the podium at one 
point house speaker jim wright edged close to urge him to finish 
the yellers took half my speech time clinton complained 
television anchors made clinton the butt of wisecracks a cable 
news network anchor ended an interview with him thursday with the 
jibe a flashing red light is here weve got to stop now 
mike mccurry a spokesman for the democratic party said the 
speech was clearly longer than we had anticipated clinton 
apparently revised the speech up until the last moment mccurry 
said 
i guess should i say revisions or additions mccurry 
added but he defended the speech as a worthy endeavor because it 
laid before the convention a great deal of information it was 
important to have on the record

the un representatives prepared to 
mediate ceasefire talks and investigate prisoners of war in the 
iraniraq conflict thursday but iraq said it was wary of irans 
motive in refusing direct negotiations 
in tehran iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said 
thursday he wept while listening to ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
statement reluctantly accepting a un ceasefire resolution 
official tehran radio reported 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported one 
civilian died and two were injured thursday by iraqi shells falling 
on the village of sardasht in northwestern iran 
the iraqi news agency said iraqi forces launched a series of 
attacks on iranian troops in northern iraq purging iraqi border 
peaks of the filth of enemies 
un spokesman francois giuliani said an eightmember team of 
military observers assembled in jerusalem and vienna will mediate 
ceasefire talks and a second group being assembled in geneva will 
look into the prisoner of war situation 
the second team will endeavor to ascertain the facts and 
inquire into the concerns expressed by the two governments with a 
view to ensuring observance of relevant rules of international 
humanitarian law giuliani said 
both teams were expected to begin their trip over the weekend 
going first to tehran and then baghdad he said 
un officials said most of the military observers being sent to 
mediate come from the un truce supervision organization based in 
jerusalem and will be led by norwegian lt gen martin vadset 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced 
wednesday that un observers would travel to the warring nations 
to help implement the un resolution passed one year ago but not 
accepted by iran until monday 
un resolution 598 aimed at ending the nearly 8yearold war 
calls for an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a 
peace plan to end the war including the return of captured 
soldiers 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein said he was 
astonished iran rejected facetoface peace talks the official 
iraqi news agency reported 
the agency quoted hussein as telling libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi in a telephone conversation that anyone who rejected direct 
talks did not want peace and sought tactical gain 
iraq has claimed iran accepted the ceasefire call only to give 
its forces time to regroup after a series of losses in the war 
iran on wednesday rejected a call by iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz for direct unsponsored talks on ending the war 
rafsanjani also commanderinchief of irans armed forces was 
quoted as saying thursday that iranians should not ask too many 
questions about the decision 
we should not ask why and how not create more problems for 
our society tehran radio quoted him as saying 
rafsanjani said iranians would come to accept khomeinis change 
of heart in accepting the ceasefire resolution the radio reported 
until this week khomeini was adamantly opposed to ending the 
war with iraq until hussein was driven from power the war which 
has killed and wounded an estimated 1 million people began in 
september 1980 when iraq invaded iran after several border 
skirmishes 
in a statement wednesday the 87yearold khomeini stressed how 
difficult it was for him to accept the ceasefire resolution 
i shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more 
deadly to me than poison but i am happy to submit to gods will 
and drank this cup for his satisfaction the revolutionary 
patriarch said 
khomeinis turnaround appeared to be influenced by rafsanjani 
who introduced a less bellicose tone to irans war policy when he 
took over as commanderinchief last month 
while fully backing the war effort rafsanjani 53 has 
consistently advocated diplomatic efforts to end the conflict and 
has pushed for forging links to the west analysts believe he is 
the man most likely to hold temporal power when khomeini dies 
rafsanjani called khomeinis decision a great sign of imam 
khomeinis soul and health adding he wept while listening to the 
message 
also thursday four more bodies from the iran air jetliner shot 
down july 3 by the us navy were recovered bringing the total of 
recovered bodies to 186 tehran radio reported a total of 290 were 
killed in the incident 
the radio said iran obtained the equipment needed to search for 
the black box flight recorder and a serious effort for 
finding the box will soon be started in the persian gulf 
a letter was on its way to the uss vincennes the ship that 
downed the iranian plane bearing nearly 10000 signatures 
expressing support for the officers and crew us navy officials 
said 
the letter weighs 50 pounds and is 570 feet long four feet 
longer than the cruiser itself it originated in san diego calif 
home port of the vincennes 
the vincennes returned to duty overnight a us navy 
spokesman said it had been in port for 15 days while a team of 
us military experts investigated the july 3 incident

washington ap the federal communications commission is 
cracking down on television pirates who market illegal descrambling 
devices for backyard satellite dishes the agencys chairman said 
thursday 
we will put them out of business and if we can put them in 
jail dennis patrick told a news conference were putting the 
public on notice that we will no longer look the other way 
patrick said the fcc is sending warning letters to 19 firms that 
the fcc believes sell the technology that enables a dish owner to 
decode the scrambled signals used by premium program services like 
home box office and showtime 
using such illegal devices allows a dish owner to receive the 
broadcasts without having to pay the fees charged by the 
programmers or the cable firms authorized to retransmit their 
signals 
patrick said he was unable to say how many illegal descramblers 
are in use around the country but he said their use is increasing 
and some estimates put the number at as many as half of all the 
units sold 
the letters pointed out that sale and use of illegal 
descramblers is prohibited by both the federal communications act 
and the us criminal code they warned of fcc fines and possible 
criminal prosecution for any continued illegal activity 
we strongly encourage you to discontinue selling this 
technology immediately the letters said 
patrick said signal piracy not only hurts programmers but also 
the public because it increases the cost of programming 
discourages new programmers from entering the market and could lead 
existing cable services to refuse to sell their signals to dish 
owners 
this market may dry up in the long run if we cannot stamp out 
piracy said patrick he declined to predict whether an end to 
piracy would lead cable services to lower the prices they charge 
dish owners

multiracial people through independence and early statehood 
officials announced thursday 
speaking in a global teleconference from lusaka the capital of 
zambia and the united nations in new york prize jury chairman 
bradford morse described mugabe as one of the intellectual giants 
of the african continent 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia spoke about mugabe an old 
friend calling him a truly gallant freedom fighter 
mugabe and joshua nkomo led the black independence struggle in 
zimbabwe a southern african nation previously known as rhodesia

mugabes visionary approach to political leadership morse said 
under mugabe black peasant farmers increased their crop 
revenues tenfold since 1980 according to morse who coordinated 
famine relief as former administator of the un development 
program at the same time the black farmers increased their share 
of the nations farm production from 10 percent to 64 percent

the likely source of pollution that 
has plagued four new jersey seashore communities since last week is 
the asbury park sewage treatment plant health officials said 
thursday 
beaches in asbury park ocean grove bradley beach and 
avonbythesea were closed again thursday after tests showed high 
levels of coliform or fecal bacteria in the ocean 
the first beach closings occurred june 13 and monmouth county 
health officials initially pointed to polluted sylvan lake which 
empties into the ocean but health officials realized the lake 
would not be the source of balls of grease that had washed ashore 
such pollution is commonly associated with sewerage plants 
the county received state department of environmental protection 
assistance and investigators checked all local sewerage plants and 
pumping stations chlorinated nearby lakes and looked at local 
rivers 
meantime the bacteria slowly dissipated and beaches reopened 
by wednesday all but four blocks in asbury park were reopened to 
swimmers said myron lavake environmental program administrator 
for the monmouth county health department 
then on wednesday night as part of their investigation county 
and state health officials monitored operations at the sewage 
treatment plants in asbury park and neptune 
the team discovered the asbury park plant was inefficiently 
operating during the night monmouth county spokesman paul ridner 
said during the day it seemed to be fine 
apparently tides washed away most of the pollutants by the time 
health officials took tests each morning prompting beaches to 
slowly reopen said lester jargowsky monmouth county health 
officer 
the coliform sometimes reached more than eight times the state 
standard which is 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water he 
said 
officials in the four affected seashore communities meanwhile 
lamented the loss of business since the pollution closings began 
business has been absolutely brutal in ocean grove this past 
week said beach manager august g stoll

new yorks democratic delegation called on the 
national party thursday to work for the release of nine americans 
held hostage in lebanon 
the resolution was pushed by delegates for jesse jackson who 
this week raised the possibility that he might renew efforts to 
free the hostages now that the iranians have agreed to accept a 
cease fire in the war with iraq 
new yorkers acted on the resolution because terry anderson the 
longestheld american hostage grew up in batavia ny according 
to joyce burns an alternate delegate from orchard park 
anderson the associated press chief middle east correspondent 
was seized by gunmen in beirut in march 1985 
the resolution asks the convention to bring the plight of the 
american hostages before the american people 
should michael dukakis be elected president in november the 
resolution asks that his administration have as a priority 
freedom for all present hostages and a commitment to positive 
responses to conflicts among people 
burns said there was not enough time to arrange for speakers to 
mention the hostages on the convention podium but some new york 
delegates brought placards to the floor of the omni arena thursday 
night saying bring our hostages home from lebanon now 
other delegates sported yellow ribbons to remember the hostages 
in the past jackson has met with leaders and ambassadors from 
middle eastern countries in an attempt to win freedom for the 
americans held in lebanon 
he said on monday that he may renew intense efforts to free the 
hostages who are thought to be held by proiranian lebanese 
shiites jackson made an appeal on behalf of anderson and the other 
hostages in his speech to the convention tuesday night

two unexploded pipe bombs were found 
lying in a street here officials said thursday while a bomb scare 
in a nearby town has prompted authorities to seal all mailboxes 
until further notice 
the bombs found in wellesley were similar to four that exploded 
in neighboring needham no injuries were reported but authorities 
said there was a close call for a jogger as one of the bombs blew 
up in a newspaper vending box 
a resident spotted the first wellesley bomb lying in the street 
wednesday night state police told wellesley officers the bombs in 
needham had been found in pairs so the area was searched and a 
second bomb was found about 30 yards away 
in needham two pipe bombs exploded minutes apart sunday night 
one on a curb near the police and fire departments building and 
the other in a parking lot nearby 
a third bomb exploded tuesday night in a newspaper box outside 
the needham public library said needham police lt thomas leary 
the bomb that exploded in front of the public library went off 
just 15 seconds after a woman jogger had passed by the newspaper 
box said joseph sainato senior explosives technician with the 
state police if it had gone off when she was in front of it it 
would have cut her to shreds 
about two hours after tuesdays explosion a postal employee 
found a pipe bomb in a mail deposit box outside a post office 
the bomb was as powerful as a military grenade and could 
send 10 pieces of shrapnel flying off at 6000 feet a second 
sainato said 
leary would not comment on whether authorities had received any 
threatening messages related to the bombs 
the four bombs in needham were made of the same materials 
leading investigators to believe they are connected said detective 
trooper michael cherven who is assigned to the state fire 
marshals office

republican officials noting the seating 
shortage at the democratic national convention in atlanta say they 
are considering opening their bash to the general public 
they can consider that option because the republican national 
convention next month will be held in the spacious louisiana 
superdome which will have room for an estimated 40000 
conventioneers 
in atlanta democrats held their convention this week at the 
omni which after construction of an elaborate madefortv podium 
could hold only about 11000 people more than 4000 delegates 
and 13000 reporters attended the fourday convention which ended 
thursday 
when the republicans assemble in new orleans aug 1518 there 
should be some seats left over said nadine wong a convention 
management spokeswoman 
wong said she expects about 30000 people delegates reporters 
and guests to attend the fourday event 
convention officials are looking for a way to parcel out the 
empty seats and still maintain security 
one idea under consideration is offering tickets to the public 
wong wouldnt speculate on how the tickets might be distributed a 
decision should be made next week she said

here are excerpts from the prepared text of 
thursday nights speech by sen lloyd bentsen of texas the 
democratic nominee for vice president 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twentyeight years ago our party nominated a president from 
massachusetts and a vice president from texas the texan on that 
ticket was lyndon baines johnson lyndon johnson knew then what you 
and i know so well today equality of opportunity is the ultimate 
civil right 
his vision and his victories paved the way for democratic 
leaders like the rev jesse jackson whose eloquence whose 
leadership and achievements transcend pride of party and inspire a 
nation 
democrats agree that a good job at a fair wage is the passport 
to opportunity in america 
democrats agree that america needs a trade policy based on the 
simple premise of fairness we demand that nations selling goods 
freely in our country must allow america equal access to their 
markets 
democrats agree that the economic trade and energy policies of 
the reaganbush administration have devastated vast areas of 
america we see an agricultural economy that has been driven to its 
knees we see the energy economy reeling in crisis we see the loss 
of more than a million highpaying jobs in manufacturing 
democrats agree that the american worker who has struggled for 
20 years to support his or her family has earned 60 days notice if 
management decides to shut down that plant 
but the reaganbush administration insists that a pink slip in 
the mail is notice enough 
democrats want a strong national defense and we will pay the 
price to defend freedom but we also demand a careful accounting of 
our hardearned dollars we will not tolerate the corruption and 
greed that threatens to undermine our military might 
my friends america has just passed through the ultimate epoch 
of illusion an eightyear coma in which slogans were confused with 
solutions and rhetoric passed for reality a time when america 
tried to borrow its way to prosperity and became the largest debtor 
nation in the history of mankind when the reaganbush 
administration gave lip service to progress while fighting a 
frantic losing battle to turn back the clock on civil rights and 
equal opportunity a time of tough talk on foreign policy amid 
strange tales of doubledealing swiss bank accounts and a botched 
campaign against a drugrunning tinhorn dictator 
my fellow democrats it is easy enough to create the illusion of 
prosperity all you have to do is write hot checks for 200 billion 
a year

for 200 years america has worked better than any society in 
history a major reason for our success is that every generation of 
americans has accepted a responsibility to expand the frontiers of 
individual opportunity we have expanded that opportunity through 
universal education the homestead act landgrant colleges 
womens suffrage social security the gi bill civil rights and 
health care 
i know that if you are a teacher or a factory worker or if you 
are just starting a family its almost impossible to buy a house 
no matter how hard you work or how carefully you plan 
a college education is slipping beyond the reach of millions of 
hard working americans if you have a child today plan to have at 
least 60000 to send that child to a public university 18 years 
from now and if the republicans have their way dont count on any 
college loans to help you out 
michael dukakis has an uncanny ability to bring forth the best 
in america he knows that government cant solve all our problems 
but he also understands that government has an obligation to lead 
and together mike dukakis and i will lead a government that 
cares about people about jobs about all regions of america about 
housing and the homeless about the defense of freedom about 
education and health care about justice and opportunity for all 
americans 
my father is also here he is 94 years old proud of his 
country and proud of his son 
he has been telling the reporters stories about me so let me 
tell one about him my father is a symbol of what people of courage 
and vision and daring can achieve in america 
he has lived the american dream the dream we want to come true 
for our children 
talk about risktakers his family came to this country across 
the ocean across the prairie to homestead in south dakota back 
when the government would bet 160 acres that you couldnt make it 
through the winter 
my father made his way to texas ive made my way to atlanta 
with michael dukakis to stand before my family before a united 
democratic party before the american people to accept your 
nomination as vice president 
thats the american dream we have nourished and protected for 
more than two centuries the dream of freedom and opportunity the 
chance for a step up in life 
i want to help michael dukakis protect that dream for the next 
generation i want to help michael dukakis maintain freedom as the 
most powerful and persuasive force on earth and i want to thank 
all of you for the opportunity to serve america

richie havens the folk singer whose politically 
oriented songs helped define the woodstock generation said after a 
rally thursday near the democratic national convention that hes 
never voted and probably never will 
havens performed three songs during the rally for independent 
presidential candidate lenora b fulani 
in an interview after the rally was interrupted by a sudden 
heavy rain havens said his political focus is on the millions of 
people who do not vote and are unhappy with both major political 
parties 
for about 11 years now ive been working with trying to 
figure out why it is the majority of people dont vote havens 
said it isnt apathy as the press might say or it isnt that 
they dont care about the country 
they dont find anything to vote for just like me im a 
nonvoter myself i never voted and i probably wont until an 
individual can get a chance to vote for his country and not for a 
party 
havens remembered by many for his emotional performance at the 
woodstock festival in 1969 said he performs yearround and 
recently completed his 20th tour of europe 
he said he continues to find an audience for his style of music 
and said more young people are discovering the music from his 1960s 
heyday 
havens added that wherever he goes people still ask him about 
woodstock 
its a big boom its a big return to a consciousness of music 
going on in the world actually he said most of my friends 
who were screaming about their kids listening to heavy metal a few 
years ago are glad now that theyre stealing their 1960s records

here are court transcript excerpts of assistant 
us attorney edward j littles closing arguments to the jury 
thursday in the wedtech racketeering trial during which he called 
attorney general edwin meese iii a sleaze 
there is only one way out for congressman mario biaggi and 
his son richard biaggi and this is a defense which his lawyers 
have pounded away with from the very beginning of this case they 
opened up on this mario biaggi defense attorney james larossa 
told you that he is going to tell you about ed meese he was going 
to tell you about ronald reagan and the white house all this 
other detail which is fundamentally irrelevant to this case 
these people arent being tried for what meese did or former 
meese aide james jenkins did or former white house aide lyn 
nofziger did or any of those other people this is a distraction 
it would have been better although not practical to have everyone 
that wedtech paid off in this courtroom everyone from jerry doe 
smith in the post office up to nofziger who used to work in the 
white house up to jenkins for what he did and if the proof 
establishes it up to meese 
whats the defense here you are going to hear this one and 
its very clear the wedtech officers would not have bought 
congressman biaggi good they already bought ed meese well this is 
ridiculous there are two short answers to this meese defense 
first is meese was a sleaze the second is meese was a 
sleaze too also in addition to these people because what these 
people did was to sell influence in new york city and to sell 
influence in congress and what jenkins did and what meese 
friend e robert wallach did and what they did together and we 
dont know the details of it in this case because its irrelevant 
but whatever they did with meese was wrong but that was done 
separately in the executive branch 
that is the big thing that the defense has been hanging their 
hat on on the meese defense

love longtime party secretary dorothy bush 
mrs bush no relation to the vice president has been calling 
the roll of the states at democratic conventions in her distinctive 
southern lilt since time immemorial actually 1944

scenes from past conventions and magazine accounts of the striking 
young woman who created a stir when she broke into the 
maledominated political world 
wiping tears from her eyes the silverhaired mrs bush said 
the democratic party really has been good to me and its been 
good for me for many many years 
probably the greatest reward of all has been in the vast 
number of interesting people that i have met from precinct workers 
to presidents of the united states she said 
you may be sure each and every one of you democrats that i 
promise to be a good hardworking democrat for the rest of my 
life absolutely she said

the democratic national convention was dismissed 
by a soviet news commentator thursday as a visual spectacle with 
little of the openness or freedom evident at the recent communist 
party conference in moscow 
the thursday evening news from moscow complete with standups in 
front of the omni was taped and translated by soviet television 
experts at emory university here 
the segment about 20 minutes into a 35minute newscast opened 
with a yellow map of the united states and shots of the omni 
michael and kitty dukakis and john f kennedy jr with his uncle 
sen edward kennedy 
a voiceover described to soviet viewers the large number of 
senators congressmen and other prominent politicians at the 
gathering and said the democrats have a good chance of returning to 
power according to a translation supplied by political science 
professor ellen mickiewicz creator and director of a soviet media 
center at emory 
then genrikh borovik described by mickiewicz as a wellknown 
commentator writer and journalist was interviewed in front of the 
omni by a colleague boris kalyagin a europeanbased soviet 
reporter 
its good that the convention invited soviet guests borovik 
said his credentials flapping on his chest he then went on to 
say after our party conference this is just boring because its 
all determined in advance its a show its a spectacle its 
visual for seriousness and openness and freedom our party 
conference was better 
at this point borovik switched to a friendlier assessment of 
the festivities americans have their own ways their own 
customs he said 
he said the convention sent a friendly message to the soviet 
union one compatible with that countrys new thinking the 
code word for the reforms pressed by soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
mickewicz said the convention was featured on the soviet news on 
monday wednesday and thursday but not on tuesday on thursday it 
followed items about a strike at a soviet factory troops returning 
from afghanistan and us observers arriving east germany under 
terms of the nuclear reduction treaty

sen john glenn of ohio introduced lloyd bentsen 
to fellow democrats on thursday as a winning vice presidential 
candidate who unlike george bush wont be out of the room 
out of pocket out of town or out of touch when major white house 
decisions are made 
glenn himself a serious contender as democratic nominee michael 
dukakis running mate until bentsen was chosen gave no hint of 
personal disappointment as he presented the texas senator to the 
democratic national convention 
speaking shortly before bentsens nomination for the no 2 spot 
on the democratic ticket glenn drew a scathing comparison between 
bentsen a real texan and vice president bush 
how many real texans do you know whose idea of mexican food is 
refried quiche glenn asked in the prepared text of his speech 
the ohio democrat said bentsen rejects the idea that we should 
be hard on needy children and easy on greedy defense contractors 
and believes you cant talk like rambo and act like bambi in 
overcoming americas foreign trade deficit 
glenn tied bush to a reagan administration that he said had 
consistently taken its cues from rightwing zealots on womens 
and civil rights issues 
on the ethics issue glenn said bush talks about being tough on 
crime and wanting four more years while more than 100 reagan 
administration officials already have been indicted or left office 
under a cloud 
at the rate theyre going i think some of them may end up 
serving 10 or 20 glenn said 
the ohio senator said dukakis and bentsen would make no deals 
with terrorists or drugpushing dictators and that when major 
decisions are being made vice president bentsen will not be out of 
the room out of pocket out of town or out of touch

iraq renewed its demand for direct peace 
negotiations with iran and said thursday it has not yet decided 
whether to receive a un team assigned to work out details of a 
truce in the 8yearold war 
the request of the secretarygeneral to dispatch the mission 
is under discussion in baghdad iraqs ambassador ismat t 
kittani told a news conference 
iran said monday it would accept a yearold security council 
ceasefire resolution it has agreed to receive the eightman un 
military team due in tehran on sunday but rejected iraqs demand 
that the two governments negotiate directly with each other 
mohammad jaafar mahallati the iranian ambassador criticized 
iraqs demand for direct talks and its other new proposals as 
extraneous elements which will only complicate the whole thing 
and delay a truce 
he told reporters iraq wants to prolong the war gain some 
more territory and leverage and reinforce their aggressive 
policies 
members of the 15nation security council began informal 
consultations on the situation they also were discussing problems 
with the technical team and the new iraqi demands 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar later told 
reporters that he was reflecting very carefully on the letter 
from iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz who urged immediate and 
direct consultations with iran in new york the un chief also 
said he was considering inviting both foreign ministers to un 
headquarters in new york but had not made a decision 
aliakbar velayati the iranian foreign minister sent a letter 
to perez de cuellar on thursday saying his government is fully 
prepared to receive and cooperate with the technical mission on 
details of a ceasefire 
his letter which diplomats made available to the associated 
press said iran also is prepared to show military restraint 
iraq said soon after the council passed resolution 598 on july 
20 1987 that it would accept the plan if iran did but the 
iranians said no truce could take effect until iraq was branded the 
aggressor in the war 
now iran favors an immediate ceasefire and iraq is hesitant 
president saddam husseins government says it suspects iran of 
playing for time to rebuild its war machine 
perez de cuellar is assembling a second un team to visit the 
region this weekend and determine the situation of prisoners of war 
the security councils resolution 598 calls for a ceasefire to 
be followed by withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders 
prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an investigation of which 
side started the war iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after 
several border skirmishes 
kittani the iraqi ambassador said after his fourth meeting in 
two days with perez de cuellar we think the first step should be 
facetoface discussions with iran under the auspices of the 
secretarygeneral 
in response to questions perez de cuellar told reporters he was 
not yet disappointed with progress in implementing a truce and did 
not blame either side 
asked whether iraqs insistence on direct talks might block or 
delay the technical mission perez de cuella said no they the 
iraqis only want clarifications which i will give to them 
the military team of officers from the un truce supervisory 
organization is to leave friday or saturday from vienna or 
jerusalem 
iraq has said it was suspicious of irans abrupt acceptance of 
the security council plan after rejecting it for a year 
kittani said thursday that the iranian ambassadors comments 
added to our legitimate suspiciouns as mr mahallati dismissed 
our proposals as irrelevant 
he wants an immediate ceasefire but there is no commitement 
from himself or his government to even talk to iraq 
the iraqi envoy also emphasized the importance of dredging the 
shattalarab waterway which forms the southern border between the 
two countries and is iraqs only outlet to the sea 
rival claims to the shattalarab were a major cause of the war 
kittani said thursday the issue should be discussed in direct 
talks and that iraqi access to the waterway is essential to peace 
in the region he declined to answer questions about whether 
acceptance of the ceasefire team was linked to iraqs demand for 
direct negotiations 
middle east diplomats said privately that iraq was annoyed by 
perez de cuellars handling of his announcement of the technical

a plan to dump american household garbage in 
britain has been well dumped 
nick baig the british businessman who devised the scheme said 
thursday that an application for permission to import refuse from 
the eastern united states to northwest england has been withdrawn 
because of impossible conditions set by the government 
critics of the idea say the american garbage could have brought 
new diseases into the country and taken up dumping space needed by 
britain so when parliament was told wednesday night that the deal 
was off there was general relief 
it is unacceptable that the northwest should be made the 
worlds dust bin said winston churchill grandson of the wartime 
leader and lawmaker for the area 
baig however accuses the british of getting too emotional 
about what he believes was a beautifully simple idea to extract 
gold from them thar trash cans 
in an interview he explained that his british company power 
water and waste was negotiating with american municipalities for 
ships to pick up garbage in new york boston and philadelphia and 
take it across the atlantic to be dumped on a 390acre landfill 
site in merseyside greater liverpool 
the americans he said would pay him 50 for each ton of 
garbage removed and he would pay the british authorities 12 per 
ton dumped at this end 
baig said he would have relieved the americans of 12 million 
tons a year over five years 
but things could never be that simple 
when baig eyed abandoned tin mines in cornwall the southwest 
peninsula of england as potential garbage sites the opposition 
was so fierce that he had to shift his sights northward the 
manchester ship canal co was interested and applied for a license 
to have the imported garbage dumped at its merseyside landfill 
but faced with an influx of sticky beer cans nonbiodegradable 
cereal boxes and halfeaten hamburgers the government proved less 
than enthusiastic 
our opinion was that it was a large volume of waste which 
could have serious implications for plant and animal health 
because it could carry viruses from outside the country said 
brendan clark an environment department spokesman 
the ministry of agriculture told the importers they would need a 
sanitation license 
that is an impossibility because how can anybody inspect half 
a million dust bins said baig the law was designed for the 
import of fresh meat and products in our plan none of the rubbish 
would enter the food chain of beast bird plant or man 
cheshire county councilor derek bateman was quoted as telling 
the daily telegraph newspaper the garbage would include waste from 
new york hospitals animal fat and rotting vegetation 
the rubbish will not be covered so we will have the prospect 
of it blowing all over cheshire and exposing people to a potential 
health risk he was quoted as saying 
baig called such responses ignorance and a sign of the 
insularity of the situation here he said he never expected 
emotions to be aroused 
but david norbury a cheshire council spokesman said britain 
has garbage problems too he said in an interview that his 
district is relying on the dumping site to accommodate local 
garbage for 25 more years and if baigs scheme was approved the 
site would be full in five years

gay rights activists whose kissin was 
thwarted by police earlier in the week restaged it thursday a 
halfblock from the democratic national convention site after 
receiving an apology from the mayor 
a halfdozen members of the aids coalition to unleash power or 
act up kissed in front of the omni hotel largely ignored by 
passersby uniformed riot police kept their backs to the 
demonstrators and watched the designated convention protest zone 
instead 
later after a week of temperatures over 90 degrees that sent 
270 protesters and bystanders to a red cross tent for treatment for 
blisters and heat exhaustion rain fell folk singer richie havens 
was entertaining a crowd of about 1000 in the parking lot that 
serves as the protest site when the downpour started and most 
bystanders scattered 
on monday when act up first tried to stage the kissin 
about 80 helmeted police officers carrying shields forced the 
activists 1 blocks to the protest site where they were taunted 
and spat on by some youths 
a bystander later identified as a dukakis campaign aide was hit 
in the head by a rock and a man was subsequently charged with 
aggravated assault 
act up filed a complaint with the city and on wednesday mayor 
andrew young apologized saying the officers might have been 
shorttempered because of the heat and some might have trouble 
dealing with homosexuality the city negotiated with act up and 
agreed to the 15minute sidewalk demonstration 
frank smithson of new york a spokesman for act up said we 
were very excited about the mayor hes an incredible man with real 
concern about the lesbian and gay community 
as the convention wound down so did the level of interest in 
the activities in the hot blacktop parking lot where the city has 
provided a stage and sound equipment to various groups 
a morning demonstration by a mental health group drew few 
spectators one reporter read a newspaper in a patch of shade 
later bystanders appeared far more interested in the shiftchange 
by riotuniformed policemen and some officers posed for pictures 
along marietta street 
by far the most arrests of the week came tuesday morning when 
135 antiabortion activists tried to blockade a clinic where 
abortions are performed all were granted bond but some 120 
remained jailed thursday for refusing to give their names 
also in the protest zone thursday a coalition of groups from 
the home state of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
complained about his environmental record saying he has been 
insensitive to such issues as governor of massachusetts

educate him and educate him now said noreen brodeurrouthier

campaign literature issued by texas sen lloyd 
bentsen during his previous senate races exaggerated the number of 
missions he flew in world war ii but the error was corrected a few 
years ago a spokesman said thursday 
bentsen is campaigning for a fourth term in the senate at the 
same time he is running for vice president on the democratic ticket 
with massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
all versions of bentsens biography agree that as a b24 bomber 
pilot based in italy he was decorated for distinguished service and 
discharged at the end of the war as a colonel in the reserves 
air force records consistent with bentsens biographies show 
that he received the air medal with three oak leaf clusters and the 
distinguished flying cross and europeafricamideast theater ribbon 
for serving in italy 
but official biographies put out during earlier campaigns by the 
senator say that bentsen flew 50 bomber missions over europe 
during the war 
air force records show that he flew 35 combat missions and 
logged 129 combat hours according to an air force spokesman maj 
lou figeroa 
bentsen spokesman chris peacock contacted at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta said that the biography issued by 
the senators office now lists no number of combat missions 
the reason for that is that several years ago there were 
biographies that had a number we discovered that the number was in 
error so the number was dropped 
jack devore bentsens press secretary said he is not sure how 
the incorrect number worked its way into the official biographies 
a few years ago i sent his bio routinely in for senator 
bentsen and senator bentsen said jack i dont think thats 
right devore said he said bentsen could not remember whether 
he had flown 34 or 35 missions so the number was omitted 
altogether in subsequent literature 
according to the air force bentsen enlisted in the army air 
corps the precursor to the air force on april 11 1942 and 
became a commissioned officer on oct 28 of that year 
he served as an assistant intelligence officer until june 1943 
then was a student pilot from june 1943 to january 1944 
from march 1945 bentsen was stationed in italy as a b24 pilot 
rising to squadron commander air force records show 
according to biographies put out by bentsen he was promoted 
from major to a colonel in the reserves at the time of his 
discharge on july 20 1945 
a brochure bearing bentsens logo and dated jan 2 1970 the 
year he was first elected toooe senate said he flew 50 
missions over europe 
another biography from the 1970 campaign said in world war 
ii he entered the army air corps as a private became a pilot and 
flew more than 50 combat missions earning the distinguished flying 
cross and three air medals ending his career in the service as a 
colonel 
an eightpage advertising supplement in the fort worth star 
telegram from sunday april 5 1970 said during world war ii 
he flew more than 50 combat missions as a bomber pilot part of 
them as a squadron commander 
a biography bearing the logo bentsen 76 senate campaign 
said he served in the army air corps as commander of a b24 
squadron flew 50 missions over europe and rose to the rank of 
major 
a biography on the 1984 democratic national convention fact 
sheet said that bentsen flew 50 bomber missions over europe 
during the war 
bentsens current biography says that he rose to major and 
b24 squadron commander during world war ii and was a colonel 
in the air force reserves when he left active duty 
during one bombing mission over europe he made a forced 
landing on the island of viz in the adriatic the current 
biography says 
years later in 1972 as a senator visiting yugoslavia he had 
a chance to personally thank marshal jozef broz tito whose 
partisans kept the viz airstrip open and made it possible for 
allied forces to send in a plane and bring bentsen and crew to 
safety the official biography says

wisconsins corn crop looks a little 
greener than that of other droughtstricken states but that does 
not diminish the help needed by wisconsin farmers agriculture 
secretary richard lyng said thursday 
lyng wearing a think rain button inspected the 285acre 
farm of ken and mary ellen falch as part of a 10state tour through 
the parched corn belt 
weve seen corn thats terribly disappointing lyng told a 
crowd of about 250 gathered at the farm i dont think theres 
anyplace where we havent seen corn thats totally unusable 
in breckenridge mich a rumbling sky announced the approach of 
rain later on thursday while lyng viewed the droughts effects it 
was the last leg of the agriculture secretarys tour 
seeing it firsthand has a lot more impact than hearing 
reports its the same all over its hard lyng told several 
dozen farmers i am impressed with the challenge agriculture is 
facing and the way farmers are responding i for one will try to 
help 
us rep bill schuette michigans only representative on the 
house agriculture committee working on a drought relief bill said 
he expects the bill to go to a floor vote july 28 
while lyng was in chippewa falls republican gov tommy thompson 
was at the farm to sign a bill to provide farmers with a 10 percent 
property tax credit up to a maximum of 1000 on this years 
bills 
right now were going through the psychology of the 
drought thompson said standing beside lyng in a few months 
well be going through the economy of the drought 
falch told lyng that his yield would be cut from 165 bushels per 
acre last year to about 50 bushels per acre this year 
lyng told the crowd that the trip to wisconsin and other drought 
states has given him a better appreciation of the need for 
forage lyng said he hoped federal farm legislation to address 
the problem would emphasize direct payments to farmers to buy feed 
and to help them pay for other daytoday needs 
lyng said he will report to president reagan on monday

here is a transcript of the speech delivered by 
new jersey sen bill bradley to the democratic national convention 
thursday night 
thank you very much thank you very much 
mr chairman and delegates to the democratic national 
convention this is a real first for me tonight this is the first 
time i have spoken to a national convention and this is the first 
time i will have performed in the omni wearing long pants 
ive been asked to speak about the role of the presidency in 
american life let me begin by asking a few questions 
does it make a difference whos president of the united states 
did lincoln make a difference did woodrow wilson ask any child 
who stares in wonder at the grand canyon if teddy roosevelt made a 
difference ask anyone who lived through the depression out of 
work and out of luck if franklin roosevelt made a difference ask 
any european who loves democracy if harry truman made a difference 
ask anyone who cares about human rights if jimmy carter made a 
difference 
do presidents make a difference teapot dome irancontra 
watergate the depression do presidents make a difference you bet 
they do and democratic presidents have made the most positive 
difference 
the strength of a president comes from his character a good 
president knows that public office is one of democracys marvelous 
abstractions that you exercise power but you must never claim it 
when you go into the voting booth and pull that lever down for 
president you make the most important decision a voter makes 
before making that decision id ask myself a few questions whom 
do i trust with my life whom do i trust with my job and who 
shares my hopes for my town my family and my country 
a president must engender trust because a president leads by 
trust trust is a bond earned by honest words and honest actions 
a good president doesnt define honesty as simply staying out of 
jail 
the words of a president can show how the past is a part of the 
present and how both can lead to a better future he can give 
reassurance and understanding to those who have never been 
reassured or understood he can give guidance in a world that 
technology changes every day the words of a president like 
natures returning seasons can provide continuity in the midst of 
change

here are excerpts from the prepared text of the 
speech by massachusetts gov michael s dukakis to the democratic 
national convention on thursday night as he accepted the partys 
presidential nomination 
were going to win because we are the party that believes in the 
american dream 
a dream that brought my father to this country 76 years ago 
that brought my mother and her family here one year later poor 
unable to speak english but with a burning desire to succeed in 
their new land of opportunity 
and tonight in the presence of that marvelous woman who is my 
mother and who came here 75 years ago with the memory in my heart 
of the young man who arrived at ellis island with only 25 in his 
pocket but with a deep and abiding faith in the promise of 
america tonight as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and 
four terrific children as a proud public servant who has cherished 
every minute of the last 16 months on the campaign trail i accept 
your nomination for the presidency of the united states 
its time to rekindle the american spirit of invention and 
daring to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics to build 
the best america by bringing out the best in every american 
its time to wake up to the new challenges that face the 
american family 
time to see that young families in this country are never again 
forced to choose between the jobs they need and the children they 
love time to be sure that parents are never again told no matter 
how long they work or how hard their child tries a college 
education is a right they cant afford 
its time to ask why it is that we have run up more debt in this 
country in the last eight years than we did in the previous 200 
and to make sure it never happens again 
its time to understand that the greatest threat to our national 
security in this hemisphere is not the sandinistas its the 
avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this country and poisoning 
our children 
because this election isnt about ideology its about 
competence 
were going to take americas genius out of cold storage and 
challenge our youngsters were going to make our schools and 
universities and laboratories the finest in the world and were 
going to make teaching a valued and honored profession once again 
were going to light fires of innovation and enterprise from 
coast to coast 
now i have a reputation for being a frugal man in nine years 
ive balanced nine more budgets than this administration has and 
ive just balanced a tenth and ive worked with the citizens of my 
state worked hard to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs 
and i mean good jobs jobs you can raise a family on jobs you can 
build a future on jobs you can count on 
and what we have done reflects a simple but very profound idea 
an idea as powerful as any in human history 
it is the idea of community 
it is the idea that we are in this together it is an idea 
that was planted in the new world by the first governor of 
massachusetts 
we must said john winthrop love one another with a pure 
heart fervently we must delight in each other make each others 
condition our own rejoice together mourn together and suffer 
together we must be knit together as one 
when a young mother named dawn lawson leaves seven years of 
welfare to become a personnel specialist in a fortune 500 company 
in worcester mass we are all enriched and ennobled 
when a catholic priest named bill kraus helps homeless families 
in denver not just by giving them shelter but by helping them to 
find the jobs they need to get back on their feet we are all 
enriched and ennobled

when a high school principal named george mckenna and his 
dedicated staff of teachers and counselors create a real 
environment for learning at the george washington preparatory high 
school in los angeles a high school that is 90 percent black and 
10 percent hispanic and has 80 percent of its graduates admitted to 
college we are all enriched and ennobled 
when a dedicated new management team and a fine union in 
milwaukee work together to turn harleydavidson around and help it 
come back to life we are all enriched and ennobled 
and when a man named willie velasquez can register tens of 
thousands of his fellow citizens as voters and bring new energy 
and new ideas and new people into court houses and city halls and 
state capitals all across the southwest we are all enriched and 
ennobled 
y cuando un willie velasquez puede inscribir decena de miles de 
sus conciudadanos para votar brindando asi nuevas energias nuevas 
ideas nuevas personas a los gobiernos municipales y estatales del 
suroeste todos nos enriquecemos y enoblecemos 
we must be we are and we will be militarily strong 
but we must back that military strength with economic strength 
we must give the men and women of our armed forces weapons that 
work we must have a secretary of defense who will manage and not 
be managed by the pentagon and we must have a foreign policy 
that reflects the decency and the principles and the values of the 
american people 
president reagan has set the stage for deep cuts in nuclear arms 
and i salute him for that 
he has said that we should judge the soviet union not by what it 
says but by what it does and i agree with that 
but we can do a lot more to stop the spread of nuclear and 
chemical arms we can do a lot more to bring peace to central 
america and to the middle east and we can and we will do a lot 
more to end apartheid in south africa 
were going to have a justice department that isnt the 
laughingstock of the nation 
were going to have nominees to the federal bench who are men 
and women of integrity and intelligence and who understand the 
constitution of the united states 
were going to have an environmental protection agency thats 
more interested in stopping pollution than in protecting the 
polluters 
were going to have a real war not a phony war against 
drugs and we wont be doing business with drugrunning panamanian 
dictators 
were going to have a vice president who wont sit silently by 
when somebody at the national security council comes up with the 
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for 
hostages were going to have a vice president named lloyd bentsen 
who will walk into the oval office and say mr president this 
is nuts 
and as i accept your nomination tonight i cant help recalling 
that the first marathon was run in ancient greece and that on 
important occasions like this one the citizens of athens would 
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge 
that pledge that covenant is as eloquent and timely today as 
it was 2000 years ago 
we will never bring disgrace to this our country by any act 
of dishonesty or cowardice we will fight for the ideals of this 
our country we will revere and obey the laws we will strive to 
quicken our sense of civic duty thus in all these ways we will 
transmit this country greater better stronger prouder and more 
beautiful than it was transmitted to us 
that is my pledge to you my fellow democrats 
and that is my pledge to you the american people

harry truman would say that the words of the next president must 
be plain talk to the american people about what needs to be done 
and why 
weve made government very complex when its really very simple 
do we want young couples to be able to own a home 
do we want our children to live in safe neighborhoods with good 
schools 
do we believe child care for working parents is a necessity 
do we want our grandparents to get decent health care 
do we want to clean up the environment 
these are very simple questions made difficult by people who 
dont care about the answers do we care do we care enough to 
elect a president who cares 
a president who cares will never shy away from confronting those 
who sit in judgement of the poor from the vantage point of the 
veranda 
the founding fathers didnt write a constitution and create a 
government only for the 1790s they created a political system 
enduringly alive and flexible enough to allow each generation of 
americans to remake its world 
our motto as rev jackson recalled the other night out of 
many one recognizes both our individualism and our common 
purpose but achieving unity is no easy task 
part of us always strives for difference for individual 
liberty individual progress individual achievement weve put our 
faith in free men and women and open markets weve achieved 
material progress on a scale never before known on earth and we 
have never feared to speak our mind 
surely no serious person would risk that individual freedom 
but individualism without some limits imposes heavy costs 
personal initiative can become destructive greed the company that 
employed thousands can leave town without notice the business that 
gave life to a community may have poisoned it with toxic wastes 
and beyond individualism our life depend on virtues simple 
virtues courage honor truth these are the essential virtues of 
a republic the essential elements of political character and none 
of them can be bought rather theyre gifts we give to each other 
and we can repay each other only in kind 
fdr said the presidency is preeminently a role of moral 
leadership 
a good president knows that our lives are not separate from 
other lives around us he knows too that the ultimate challenge 
posed to a citizen in a democracy is to ask yourself what you owe 
another human being and by that i dont mean what you owe 
yourself or your family or your friends but what you owe a 
stranger simply because he or she is a human being do you owe more 
than a contribution to charity or taxes to the government do you 
owe a commitment of some part of your life or do you believe you 
owe them nothing at all how we answer these questions will 
determine the kind of society we become

in this century its been democrats whove committed our 
political capital to the belief that longterm prosperity derives 
from a caring national community we not only believe it we lived 
it we made it work its been democrats whove understood that our 
future is stagnant unless our economy expands to include all those 
whove been left out yet we also believe that the promise of 
america is not comfort but freedom not a numbing 
selfpreoccupation but an opportunity for everyone to compete on 
reasonably equal footing 
as john kennedy said courage not complacency is what we 
need today the new frontier arrived and departed long ago but 
the need for courage remains we live in a time when thousands die 
each year from a disease that was unknown a decade ago when the 
soviet unions arsenals remain full even as gorbachev moves toward 
reform when environmental plunder threatens the building blocks of 
nature when drugs and violence create noparent families and 
homeless tenyearolds 
the next president must be a person who is awake and will stay 
awake because he cant rest while kids kill kids in our cities 
and families sleep on the streets 
the next president must be a person with enough wisdom to know 
that despite the bitterness and bloodshed in the modern world 
mankind has never been able to do more for itself than it can today 
the next president must not merely preside but must work and 
lead 
the most mysterious bond in american politics is the bond 
between the people and the president it goes beyond words to 
symbols memories and a sense of place 
remember franklin roosevelt in his wheelchair his words over 
the radio clear and simple aimed first at depression and then 
war but always at fear 
remember john kennedy his peace corps that urged young people 
to go to every corner of the world and young people who went 
because they sensed in him a commitment to truth and the absence of 
cant that honored their own intelligence and judgement 
remember lyndon johnson a southerner a texan who affirmed in 
law our conviction both black and white that we shall overcome 
remember the feeling the first time you visited the jefferson 
and lincoln memorials i do 
remember last night seeing jesse jackson his name placed in 
nomination for president of the united states rev jackson thank 
you for helping us understand 
the president is in emersons phrase our representative 
man he embodies america and gives our lives meaning he doesnt 
express some higher truth from above or lead a legislative 
majority hes simply himselfbut with the right person at the 
right time by being himself he becomes a part of us all 
maybe thats why most of us remember where we were and what we 
were doing and how we felt the day we heard that fdr died or the 
day john kennedy was shot 
tonight after two years of party contest and on the eve of a 
tough general election we give our candidate to the country 
michael dukakis the son of immigrants who personifies the promise 
of america and the traditions of new england a person committed to 
excellence who is calm under pressure and has the capacity to 
know whats important a democrat excited to take the reins of 
government and make it work once again a leader committed to 
govern all of the people and proud of this land 
thank you

for once a really towering democrat not the 
towering kind evoked in political rhetoric addressed the 
democratic national convention 
bill bradley the senator from new jersey who once played on two 
world champion new york knicks basketball teams got the kind of 
reception from convention delegates that marks him as a political 
comer 
the hall blossomed with orange and blue signs not for michael 
dukakis or jesse jackson but for bill bradley new jerseys 
pride 
at 6foot5 bradley was too tall to use the prompting devices 
on either side of the podium so his speech was scrolled up on a 
television screen across the hall 
this is a real first for me tonight he said its the 
first time ive spoken to a national convention and the first time 
ive performed in the omni wearing long pants 
the convention hall normally is used for atlanta hawks games 
bradley made everybodys list of vice presidential possibilities 
early in the democratic campaign but he took himself out of 
consideration last month 
does it make any difference who is president of the united 
states he asked 
did lincoln make a difference did woodrow wilson ask 
anyone who lived through the depression if franklin delano 
roosevelt made a difference ask any european who has democracy if 
harry truman made any difference ask anyone who cares about human 
rights if jimmy carter made a difference 
by the time bradley took the microphone before sen lloyd 
bentsens name was put in nomination for the vice presidency the 
convention hall was filled to overflowing 
the delegates let loose with some of the most enthusiastic 
cheering of the night when former rep barbara jordan of texas a 
heroine of democrats since the watergate days of richard nixon 
seconded bentsens nomination 
why she asked first of all because hes my senator and i 
wasnt planning to come to this convention for any purpose other 
than that 
our minds are turning away from hooray for hollywood and we 
are now confronted with the hard reality of a natioln which desires 
to become solvent again 
we want to retake the moral high ground she said 
the rostrum was lowered to desk height to accommodate ms 
jordans wheelchair she suffers from a degenerative bone disease 
true to his word the fire marshal closed the doors at 730 
pm shutting out hundreds for the third night the smart people 
got in early 
rep claude pepper of florida the oldest house member at age 
87 sat on the front row of his states delegation for his 13th 
democratic convention every one since 1940 when roosevelt was 
nominated for his third term 
its a wellrun convention wellhandled he said it 
shows dukakis good management skills were going to be 
victorious 
but you couldnt sell that to many democrats who had to miss 
dinner to make it inside the hall long lines formed at the omnis 
food concessions where the menu consisted of pizza hot dogs 
popcorn and ice cream bars 
inevitably some concessions ran out of food 
that did nothing to dampen the spirit of john economos a 
restaurateur from des moines iowa he carried a handlettered sign 
that read vote for dukakis and bentsen nothing unusual about 
that except it was in greek 
all was hope and promise in the convention hall on the last 
night 
do you feel the excitement in the air asked the chairman 
house speaker jim wright of texas 
yes shouted the delegates 
are we going carry the south this year 
yes 
will we win in november 
yes 
do you promise me that 
yes

the overcrowded arena holding the democratic 
national convention was sealed thursday night for the third night 
in a row as the party turned out for the conventions final night 
acceptance speech by presidential nominee michael dukakis 
the omni was sealed for safety reasons by order of the fire 
marshal at 735 pm edt about a halfhour before the evening 
session began democratic national committee officials said they 
agreed with the decision 
about 200 people many of them delegates crowded around two 
entrances to the arena some of them cursing and shouting im a 
delegate and demanding admission to the hall 
among those locked out were rep mary rose oakar of ohio 
theodore sorensen a guest of the new york delegation and a white 
house aide to former president kennedy and willard scott the 
ubiquitous weatherman from nbcs today show 
in addition to dukakis speech the party thursday night was 
selecting lloyd bentsen as the vice presidential nominee and 
hearing an acceptance speech from him 
party officials earlier had braced for another round of 
complaints from delegates locked out of the omni and said a system 
had been set up to get super delegates and essential personnel 
into the hall even after it is closed but the new system would not 
accommodate regular delegates they said 
outside the hall mayor johnny ford of tuskegee ala a jackson 
delegate said he was disappointed but not angry there was a 
time when we would be raising cain but as you can see were very 
calm theres more important things to worry about like winning in 
november 
the crowd was sedate until polly miller a gore delegate from 
asheville nc suddenly started shouting at the top of her lungs 
into a television camera under a klieg light we were elected in 
our states whos in our seats she demanded we paid to get 
here whos voting in there 
we want in the delegates started chanting many of them 
bitterly denouncing the democrats choice of atlanta for the 
convention site but the outrage died quickly when they spotted 
willard scott and many scrambled to get his autograph 
i can see locking me out but how can they lock out the 
delegates scott said i cant believe it 
there was little sympathy from convention organizers who said 
delegates should know better than to show up late for the nightly 
sessions 
everybody knew we were going to have this problem said 
party finance director donald r sweitzer if you dont have 
foresight enough to get in to meet your obligations as a delegate 
i dont have a lot of sympathy 
the arena had been sealed in midsession on tuesday and 
wednesday nights when atlantas fire marshal determined that 
crowding inside had reached its maximum safe level 
but dozens of delegates including members of the house and 
senate were steamed when they were locked out and missed votes or 
what they saw as historic speeches 
this is an injustice its outrageous said michael 
stein a delegate from chicago who was left out in the heat 
wednesday night 
among members of congress fenced out were sens edward kennedy 
of massachusetts alan cranston of california bob graham of 
florida and j bennett johnston of louisiana texas treasurer ann 
richards who delivered the convention keynote speech also was 
barred from entering wednesday night 
thank god weve got another chance to go somewhere else in 
four years where there will be some room retiring rep ed jones 
told his tennessee delegation thursday 
by contrast republican officials said they expect to have so 
many extra seats available for their convention in new orleans next 
month that they may offer tickets to the public the spacious 
louisiana superdome will have room for an estimated 40000 
conventioneers 
nadine wong a convention management spokeswoman said thursday 
she expects about 30000 people delegates reporters and guests 
to attend each day of the fourday event she said officials are 
looking for a way to parcel out the empty seats and still maintain 
security 
adding to the confusion and overcrowding at the democratic 
convention were an estimated 1700 people who received passes to 
get into the omni arena because of their status as bigticket 
contributors to the party 
members of the partys national finance council whose members 
give at least 5000 each its business council who give 10000 
or more apiece and its victory fund who commit to give or raise 
100000 all receive passes to the convention hall sweitzer said 
he estimated that during convention sessions about 1000 of 
those with contributor passes were actually in the hall which 
seats 12500 to 13000 people in its configuration for the 
quadrennial event thousands of seats were sacrificed to build a 
huge podium full of technical gear and press seating and skyboxes 
for television crews 
but sweitzer said contributors do not compete for the 4212 
delegate seats their passes do not permit them on the convention 
floor but give access only to guest seating high in the arena he 
said they share that space with 1170 alternates and other guests 
he said

here is a transcript of the speech by sen thomas 
daschle of south dakota seconding the nomination of sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas for vice president at the democratic national 
convention on thursday night 
my name is tom daschle and im here to tell you that the last 
thing we need on the prairie is another dried up old bush 
we need a change we need michael dukakis 
and we need lloyd bentsen 
south dakotans pay no greater respect to anyone than to those 
pioneers who found partnership with the land our glory comes from 
those who carved dreams from that land under a sky so vast that 
only greatness could unfold 
the bentsen family is a story of the american dream of taking 
chances of beating the odds a story of a familys life in south 
dakota and the rigors of survival in the american west a rugged 
beginning from which our roots take hold roots of american life 
that sprout qualities from which our nation draws its greatness 
roots of american soul that lend strength to our nations values 
roots from which descendants of greek and danish immigrants will 
soon become the president and vice president of the greatest 
country in the world 
and it is from these roots that values are born 
roots are not forcefed they are passed on 
values are not worn on the sleeve but come from the soul and 
emanate through the words and deeds of those who live them 
lloyd bentsens values born in the west nurtured in the south 
are now evident across this land 
like those of michael dukakis they are values of genuine 
american leadership 
a deep respect of human dignity 
a rare courage to stand up for ones beliefs 
and a profound belief that he owes the nation much more than 
this nation owes him 
as this man lives out these beliefs this nation has been paid 
back in multitude and we are the beneficiaries 
so now as he faces the american people let us confirm what we 
know that bentsen leadership is american leadership of the most 
valuable kind leadership marked not by what one says but by what 
one does 
and for those of us who call rural america home we also call 
lloyd bentsen friend someone who fights with us not against 
us for the family farm and someone who believes as we believe 
that reagan and bush are to agriculture what the drought is to 
wheat and corn someone who fights with us not against us because 
americans can win in any marketplace if the competition is fair 
and who believes as we believe that someone deathly sick in the 
countryside ought to have the same chance opportunity as someone in 
country club square 
to rural americans tonight who listen from their family farms 
who may be watching from the town cafe who may occupy a bed in a 
rural hospital or a desk in a small classroom or a counter in the 
town hardware store let me say to each one of you and to all 
americans this man stands with us on accomplishments not 
promises on values not vagaries with roots that are our roots he 
is the son of our heritage he is our friend 
so it is with humility and great pride tonight that i second the 
nomination of the next vice president of the united states sen 
lloyd bentsen

negotiators to complete their talks by the end of this month the 
41yearold lease applies to clark air base subic naval base and 
four smaller us outposts

an ariane3 rocket carrying 
satellites for european and indian customers blasted off without a 
hitch thursday from the european space agencys launch site in the 
jungles of french guiana 
shortly after the 712 pm edt liftoff the satellites were put 
into orbit 
the liftoff from the launch pad in kourou on the northeast 
coast of south america was the 24th for arianespace the company 
responsible for commercial flights of european rockets 
we are particularly happy tonight to have successfully 
launched the indian satellite said frederic dallest director 
of arianespace 
he noted that arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in 
11 months and said the company had additional launches scheduled 
for september october november and december nine launches are 
set for 1989 
but we need to remain vigilant and not be lulled into a 
routine he said 
cloudy weather at the launch site caused a sixminute delay in 
the countdown 
at 707 pm edt the countdown was resumed and five minutes 
later the rocket lifted off into the night sky its brilliant 
orange flame was obscured by the low clouds moments after takeoff 
seventeen minutes after takeoff the rocket attained the orbiting 
altitude of 22500 miles 
within four minutes the two satellites were launched into a 
geostationary orbit ecs5 for eutelsat the european organization 
of satellite communications and insat1c for the indian government 
ariane3 is capable of lifting 28 tons into space compared to 
the new generation ariane4 rocket which can carry a maximum load 
of 46 tons the new powerful rocket was launched for the first 
time june 15 carrying three satellites into orbit it is scheduled 
to blast off again in november 
the versatile ariane4 developed at a cost of 575 million 
will be used with increasing frequency to meet arianespaces 
backlog of 42 launch orders 
ecs5 weighing 2607 pounds was constructed jointly by the 
french aerospace and defense giant matra and british aerospace the 
satellite will upgrade long distance telephone service from 
portugal to finland and turkey to ireland during its sevenyear 
lifespan 
eutelsat which groups 26 national telecommunications 
authorities had reserved a place on the american atlas centaur 
rocket in case of setbacks in the arianespace program 
on may 31 1986 technicians were forced to destroy an ariane2 
rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the thirdstage 
ignition caused the rocket to go off course arianespace suspended 
launches for 16 months following the failure 
insat1c constructed by ford aerospace has a lifespan of 10 
years it will expand television and longdistance telephone 
service and collect meteorological data the 2618pound satellite 
was originally to be carried by an american rocket but after the 
failure of the us space shuttle challenger indian authorities 
decided to put their valuable cargo aboard an ariane 
the space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronauts 
were killed in the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster 
a small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay the 
scheduled september launching of the next us space shuttle 
mission by as much as two months us officials said space 
shuttle discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronauts 
into space 
arianespace now hauls half the worlds commercial payloads and 
holds launch contracts worth 25 billion eight launches are 
scheduled for 1988 with nine launches a year planned beginning in 
1989

we engaged in an important task at a very important time we are 
positioning ourselves for the last decade of the twentieth century 
our minds are turning away from hooray for hollywood and our 
minds and we are now confronting the hard reality of a nation 
which desires to become solvent again 
competitive again a nation which desires to have the trust of 
its allies and its compatriots we want we want to retake the 
moral high ground now to be what we want to be to become the 
people we want to become we have to be moved to action by what is 
reasonable sensible logical and rational 
lloyd bentsen is a sensible logical and rational choice for 
vice president of the united states 
you know the people who founded america were very smart those 
founders warned us not to become overcome by factions but to rely 
on reason as our guide if we rely on reason as our guide reason 
will temper and tender our emotions 
reason will help us to do the right things reason will tutor us 
toward doing the right things 
i say that lloyd bentsen is a rational and sensible and 
reasonable choice 
why 
first of all hes my senator and i wasnt planning to come to 
this convention for any purpose but when lloyd bentsen was tapped 
by michael dukakis as his choice for vice president of the united 
states i knew that if lloyd bentsen wanted me to come and second 
his nomination i could not resist doing that and im here to do 
it tonight 
you know lloyd bentsen has been in the united states senate for 
almost eighteen years lloyd bentsen is a man who has an instinct 
for doing what is right lloyd bentsen does not have to be 
pressured and lobbied to do the right thing 
now robert bork lloyd bentsen voted no on that nomination 
and do you know what lloyd bentsen didnt have to be pressured 
into voting no for bork 
he said lloyd bentsen bork will put our civil rights and 
our civil liberties at risk and we cannot afford to do that and 
thats why i vote no 
you heard then rostenkowski tell you about bentsens service on 
the finance committee and now as chairman on the finance committee

legislation involving 24 committees of the house and the senate 
meeting over eight months lloyd bentsen was patient and moved it 
through now the president vetoed it but lloyd bentsen got the 
momentum for trade legislation going and that momentum will not 
dissipate lightly

police seized bolivias cocaine kingpin 
roberto suarez gomez after trekking through jungles all night to 
catch him by surprise asleep at his ranch the minister of the 
interior reported thursday 
in miami chief assistant us attorney richard gregorie said 
on hearing the news hes the biggest cocaine producer in the 
world he has enormous acreage in coca plants 
suarez gomez was flown to la paz from trinidad city where he 
was taken after 10 antidrug police captured him wednesday morning 
at his el sujo ranch 25 miles away interior minister juan carlos 
duran said 
el sujo is one of suarez gomezs five ranches in the heart of 
the tropical northeastern beni region 
duran said suarez gomez was asleep when 10 antidrug police took 
over the ranch confiscating 20 automatic weapons and arresting two 
bodyguards 
suarez gomez 56 is wanted in miami on drug trafficking charges 
and has been called by authorities the godfather of bolivias 
illegal cocaine trade and a major supplier of drugs to the 
medellin colombia drug cartel 
however duran told a news conference that bolivia will not 
extradite suarez gomez to the united states since he already has 
been sentenced to 15 years in prison here 
he said suarez gomez had heart problems and would be examined 
medically before being presented to the press 
the 15year sentence was handed down by a judge earlier this 
year the former rancherturneddrug baron never showed up for his 
trial and was tried convicted and sentenced in his absence on drug 
trafficking charges 
bolivia a nation of 67 million people in the center of south 
america produces a third of the cocaine that reaches us and 
european markets 
until now suarez gomez has used his money and influence to buy 
his freedom in bolivia he publicly spoke of paying off political 
figures and policemen 
duran told reporters president victor paz estenssoro says he 
is very pleased with suarez gomezs arrest and that the fight 
against drugs is the top priority of the government 
in 1980 the bolivan human rights association says suarez gomez 
helped finance the military coup that overthrew the civilian 
government of lidia gueiler tejada the interim president and 
installed a government that hired italian german and argentine 
mercenaries to undertake a campaign of terror 
under that rightwing government headed by gen luis garcia 
meza drug traffickers operated with impunity and leftwing 
political figures and labor leaders were killed tortured or 
exiled the mercenaries went after opposition figures and provided 
protection to traffickers suarez gomez was considered the main 
player on behalf of cocaine traffickers 
according to the us drug enforcement administration during 
and after the 1980 military coup suarez gomez became a close 
associate of interior minister luis arce gomez who offered him 
protection from prosecution in return for large sums of money 
i think that suarez gomezs arrest shows that bolivian police 
are serious about going after major cocaine traffickers frank 
macolini the dea country attache for bolivia said in a telephone

three years after the summer of his arrest 
richard ramirez went on trial thursday and the long search began 
for jurors to judge him on charges he committed 13 grisly murders 
and 30 related felonies 
perhaps you have heard about this case superior court judge 
michael tynan told 50 prospective jurors at the beginning of an 
expected eightmonth jury selection process this is the 
socalled night stalker case 
tynan pointed out ramirez a pale shaggyhaired drifter dressed 
in a loosefitting doublebreasted dark blue suit wih a blue 
hankerchief in his pocket to match his tie ramirez did not 
acknowledge the jury prospects and continued to sit with his back 
to them at the counsel table 
tynan told the group he is looking for committed people 
willing to devote from one to two years to the case 
this is a very serious business a very serious trial he 
declared 
tynan then began listening to reasons jurors said they were 
unable to serve including the inability to get time off from work 
at least six panelists were dismissed when they declared their 
belief in the defendants guilt thirtytwo were excused because 
their employers would not pay for two years of jury service after 
a halfday of questioning jury selection recessed until monday 
the trial which had been delayed many times got under way 
after a last defense motion in which ramirez lawyers sought to 
exclude the press and public from the jury selection 
an attorney for the los angeles times opposed the motion but the 
judge said he had already decided to deny it 
the state supreme court also rejected a defense motion thursday 
to block the trial defense lawyers contended jury selection 
procedures would keep young people and hispanics off the panel in 
disproportionate numbers 
i am ecstatic about finally going to trial in this case 
said deputy district attorney p philip halpin and i hope we can 
move the trial along a little more efficiently than weve attended 
to the pretrial affairs 
ramirez 28 a native of el paso tex could be sentenced to 
die in the gas chamber at san quentin if he is convicted of the 
spree of murders rapes and assaults 
defense attorneys anticipating extensive questioning of jury 
prospects said it is unlikely a jury will be seated until spring 
then the jurors will settle in to hear from some 1000 
witnesses 
attorneys daniel hernandez and arturo hernandez who are not 
related say their client is eager to have his case resolved 
hes been ready to go to trial all along eager is a good 
word said daniel hernandez 
ramirez was captured and beaten by east los angeles residents 
during the hot labor day weekend of 1985 after his picture appeared 
in newspapers as the prime suspect in murders and attacks that had 
terrorized southern californians 
residents locked their windows and bolted their doors against 
the random killer who typically entered homes through unlocked 
doors raped women killed both men and women and stole jewelry and 
other valuables 
at a preliminary hearing for ramirez in 1986 anguished 
witnesses including several women who had been raped told of 
horrific confrontations with the night stalker who invaded their 
homes killed their husbands and demanded they swear to satan 
some murders were ghoulish including one in which the victims 
eyes were gouged out 
the killer often left behind drawings of pentagrams inverted 
fivepoint stars often associated with devil worship 
ramirez bizarre courtroom behavior at early hearings fueled 
speculation that he was a devil worshiper he once shouted hail 
satan and flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm during the most 
grisly testimony at his preliminary hearing he appeared to giggle 
but in recent months he has been content to slump in his 
courtroom chair scribbling notes or reading legal papers

archbishop of york john habgood the 
church of englands secondranking prelate said wednesday that 
anglicans agonizing over the issue of women bishops should 
compromise by allowing them to ordain priests but only with a 
male bishop present 
habgood spoke amid warnings that the worldwide anglican 
communion of faithful in 164 countries could break up if us 
episcopalians consecrate their first woman bishop 
i have a very simple suggestion and that is whenever a woman 
bishop ordains a priest a male bishop should ordain with her 
habgood said in a british broadcasting corp television interview 
i would say that women bishops would then be acceptable within 
the council of the church and recognized as having a place in the 
next lambeth conference and so forth i think that is a possible 
compromise 
other church leaders made no immediate response to habgoods 
proposal 
the current lambeth conference of 525 bishops representing the 
worlds 70 million anglicans has been overshadowed by the 
controversy over admission of women priests by some anglican 
churches 
the conference held once every 10 years was due to debate the 
issue of women priests on friday the threeweek conference opened 
in this cathedral city in southeastern england on sunday 
the church of england has so far refused to ordain women as 
priests but it is deeply divided on the question 
the issue involving 25 million us episcopalians centers on 
whether the church would accept a priest ordained by a woman 
bishop some church of england leaders say they would others say 
they could not 
habgood ranks second in the church of england hierarchy behind 
the state churchs spiritual leader archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie 
runcie who leads the worlds anglicans without the kind of 
formal authority the pope exercises over roman catholics warned 
monday that the anglican church worldwide was endangered by an 
unholy conflict over women priests and bishops 
we need to recognize that our unity is threatened over the 
ordination of women to the priesthood and episcopate in whatever we 
ultimately decide to do he told the conference in a keynote 
speech 
a minority of the 27 selfgoverning anglican churches in the 
world including us episcopalians and canada have admitted women 
to the priesthood since 1977 but they have so far stopped short of 
permitting women bishops

a soviet soldier who took refuge in canada after 
his release by afghan rebels returned home and told other deserters 
abroad that he suffered no reprisals an official report said 
wednesday 
nikolai golovin 25 flew to moscow late monday on an aeroflot 
flight from montreal and met with journalists the news agency tass 
said

afghan rebels then spirited away by canadian officials on a secret 
mission in november 1986 
he was working parttime at a meat processing plant in 
kitchener ontario but he complained that he never felt at home in 
canada

russian orthodox church in toronto persuaded rebel leaders to 
release the men if canada offered asylum my comrades staying in 
canada should know that nothing has happened to me after my return 
home tass quoted golovin as saying i believe that fear of a 
possible punishment keeps them there 
he said the deserters had been warned by their canadian contacts 
that they would face reprisals if they returned to the soviet union 
the former soldier said those fears have been alleviated by 
soviet prosecutorgeneral alexander sukharevs declaration of 
amnesty for soldiers who had been unable to suffer any longer 
tortures and privations of captivity and committed wrongdoings to 
the detriment of the ussr 
golovin told reporters before leaving canada that he wanted to 
return to where russian was spoken and to see his sister and ailing 
mother he planned to find work as an electrician in his home town 
of ulyanovsk a city on the volga river 500 miles east of moscow

back in the soviet union the five young 
moscow rockers who make up black coffee rank as the nations 
premier heavy metal heroes boasting the countrys two bestselling 
rock records 
but if a recent concert in madrid their first in the west is 
any indication their western counterparts need not worry about 
developing strategic defenses 
the group led by energetic frontman and singer dmitri 
varshavsky 24 managed to attract an audience of 2000 in the 
large openair stadium where they played a deafening hourlong set 
their soundman had asked spanish officials for political asylum 
earlier in the day 
the rock critic of the daily diario 16 condescendingly described 
their music as orthodox 
in concert however the group generated sparks from diehard 
leathergarbed rock fans mainly through varshavskys 
irrespressible screams and growls reminiscent of ozzy osborne or 
the australian heavy metal group acdc and the inspired pounding 
of drummer sergei chernyakov 29 
in the soviet union the group is responsible for the two 
topselling rock recordings the album over the threshold and 
the foursong disc black coffee both recorded last year group 
manager ovanes melikpashaev said in an interview 
after the spanish gig he said black coffee has set its sights 
on other countries especially the united states and is rehearsing 
songs in english to record and perform in the west 
melikpashaev said he is talking with a dallas promoter called 
sovitex inc to arrange a us tour this summer to include stops 
in dallas atlanta san francisco and perhaps chicago and 
washington 
despite his preconcert claims that black coffee plays melodic 
hardrock with touches of heavy metal thrown in on stage the 
groups grinding earsplitting doublelead guitar attack sounded 
similar to aggressive western bands such as def lepard 
but unlike western bands that spout tough lyrics and glamorize 
violent attitudes black coffee promotes peace friendship and 
happiness singer varshavsky said through an interpreter 
our songs are very optimistic they speak of the struggle 
between good and evil with good triumphing over bad he said 
melikpashaev said there was no censorship of lyrics but added 
the group doesnt like to use offensive words or the language of 
criminals 
varshavsky said the group has not been influenced by any 
particular western band but expressed admiration for black sabbath 
led zeppelin and whitesnake 
melikpashaev described the groups repertoire as rock for 
peace that stays clear of political references 
but rock is a social phenomenon so in an indirect way the 
group cant help but be political the manager said 
the high point of the concert came during the obligatory drum 
solo which went on for six minutes and stirred the crowd to chant 
in unison 
other members of the group are sergui kudishin 29 lead guitar 
igor kupriyanov 24 bass guitar and igor andreev 23 rhythm 
guitar 
the group was formed in december 1986 since then it has gone 
from playing clubs in moscow to recording for the staterun 
melodiya label touring the soviet union and frequent appearances 
on the soviet television youth shows the look and tomorrows 
mail 
the group appeared in madrid at the invitation of the municipal 
government which promoted the concert as part of the citys annual 
festival in honor of st isidro the laborer the citys patron 
saint 
madrid police said 38yearold soundman samouil savitskys 
request for political asylum had been granted on a provisional 
basis speaking through the interpreter members of the group said 
they didnt understand his action but did not elaborate 
j perez de albeniz rock critic for spains leading daily the 
leftofcenter el pais had nothing but harsh words for 
melikpeshaev saying he didnt let the musicians speak freely to 
reporters the critic wrote that the manager was a master of the 
art of talking without saying anything 
melikpashev a serious blackbearded 38yearold said the 
groups success was due as much to the policies of glasnost 
openness and perestroika economic restructuring championed 
by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as to its music 
he said some 5000 rock groups had emerged in the soviet union 
in the last two years and melodiya is doing more rock recording 
and giving the soviet rockers a greater opportunity to obtain 
instruments especially highly coveted fender and gibson guitars 
some of the american instruments cost 2000 he said but 
cheaper copies have become easier to acquire at secondhand music 
shops 
the groups stage show is austere by western standards bassist 
kupriyanov by far the fanciest dresser showed off his black 
michael jacksonlike military jacket embroidered in gold and swung 
the gold epaulets from side to side while running to and fro on 
stage

television producers from the land of such pbs 
hits as upstairs downstairs are hoping the 4monthold 
writers strike will give them a chance to break into the lucrative 
commercial network market this fall 
the three major us commercial networks have been forced to 
postpone new shows scheduled for this fall because no scripts have 
been written nbc and cbs have indicated an interest in buying 
british programs to help fill the void 
so far the networks are merely browsing difficulties in 
translating british shows into the style of fastpaced 
starstudded american airwaves may inhibit many import deals 
weve had a lot of increased interest said vivian wallace 
chief executive of manchesterbased granada one of the largest of 
the 16 independent television companies that broadcast over the 
countrys two commercial channels the noncommercial british 
broadcasting corp runs two other national channels 
i cant report any brilliant coups she added in an 
interview things we have sold in the past to the public 
broadcasting system market are probably too slowpaced for the 
networks but obviously we are using the opportunity to pitch 
projects which may be possible 
everybody would love to sell to the networks because the money 
is much higher 
peter clark a director of the international sales subsidiary of 
one of britains largest independent companies television south 
plc said us networks are starting to look to investigate 
but theyre going to have to take creative risks if they want 
to use programming from other sources said clark whose parent 
company has just purchased mtm the us production company 
cofounded by actress mary tyler moore 
rather than completed programs however scripts coproductions 
and convertible formats have a better chance of traveling to us 
television officials said 
they point to the longrunning american hit series all in the 
family which was based on a british show called till death us 
do part whose bigoted londoner alf garnett became archie 
bunker 
john reynolds head of the bbcs us subsidiary lionheart 
says he is talking to all three networks about sales of 
miniseries comedies and movies either as finished programs or 
formats 
speaking from his new york office reynolds said obviously 
the american networks current difficulties could present 
opportunities to the bbc 
the strike by the 9500member writers guild of america began in 
march against the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers over disputed payments for domestic and foreign 
television reruns 
increasingly bitter over the weeks it has caused layoffs among 
californias 230000 entertainment industry workers 
in the past most british programming in the united states has 
been sold to cable or public television stations nonprofit pbs 
carries so many british shows that some in britain call it the 
principally british service 
upstairs downstairs the story of the family and servants 
in an edwardian household was a london weekend television 
production that ran for 68 episodes on pbs 
in january a bbc soap opera called eastenders had a trial 
run on 19 pbs stations despite warnings that the cockney slang 
would prove unintelligible to americans the show still airs and 
has been snapped up by 10 other stations said ian duncan of bbcs 
commercial arm 
but the commercial networks are different 
its been very difficult for english programming to get into 
the networks said jay blumler a new yorkborn professor who 
holds posts at the center for tv research at the university of 
leeds and the university of maryland 
the english are very good at producing classic serials and 
dramas but thats not the sort of thing that the american networks 
have commonly geared up to 
clark said american producers prefer us television stars us 
locations and a fast pace 
in our dramas we tend to develop the character much more 
he said 
another potential problem is that british television is 
generally far more permissive about foul language sex and nudity 
industry officials said the strike may accelerate a growing 
trend toward usbritish coproductions which they say americans 
prefer because it gives them control over the show 
although british stations do air us shows most said they had 
not been caught short yet because of the strike

after 94 years in the grip of chiang 
kaishek and his family the longruling nationalist party has a 
new leadership that hopes to steer taiwan from the authoritarian 
and uncompromising ways of its past 
the changes at the top and in direction came at the partys 
recent 13th congress in taipei 
ever since the government of chiang kaishek was driven to 
taiwan from mainland china in 1949 by mao tsetungs communists 
the nationalist party or kuomintang has been consumed by an 
undying dream of returning to govern the worlds most populous 
nation 
while the congress vowed to keep that dream alive it cautiously 
acknowledged the need to replace its aging party elders who date 
from the chiang days on the mainland to a more dynamic leadership 
aware of the need for democratic change at home and pragmatism in 
dealing with mainland china 
the new thinking comes as the mainland chinese have been making 
radical changes of their own including overtures to taiwan for a 
onenation twosystems type of arrangment they made with the 
british on capitalist hong kong 
the nationalist partys new leadership unveiled at the congress 
clearly showed power is shifting to native taiwanese who 
constitute 85 percent of this prosperous islands nearly 20 million 
people 
president lee tenghui was acclaimed the first native taiwanese 
leader of the party that helped consolidate his power base that 
was virtually nonexistant when he succeeded chiang chingkuo the 
eldest son of chiang kaishek as head of government upon his death 
in january the elder chiang died in 1975 
the partys policymaking central standing committee long 
dominated by mainland chinese for the first time has a native 
taiwanese majority 
giving more power to native taiwanese was part of a sweeping 
liberalization program that began with chiang chingkuo the final 
ruler of the chiang family dynasty 
shortly before his death chiang chingkuo lifted martial law 
allowed the formation of opposition political parties and ended a 
38year ban on travel to china to allow family reunions 
president lee has promised to continue the liberalization 
process but may proceed with caution since his new 31member 
central standing committee still contains some party elders who 
remain unenthusiastic about a quick pace of change 
we dont believe drastic change will benefit society the 
partys 38yearold deputysecretary general ma yingjeou told 
reporters at the end of the congress 
the major unresolved political issue is overhauling the 
parliamentary system in which aging nationalists elected in 
mainland china before 1949 hold a majority of seats as a symbol of 
the partys claim to rule the country 
in the legislative yuan the highest lawmaking body the old 
guard has an advantage of about 2to1 over taiwanelected 
legislators 
ma said that through retirement of party elders and an increase 
in the number of seats contested on the island the ratio of 
holdovers to taiwanelected lawmakers should be about equal after 
elections in late 1989 
after another three years taiwanelected representatives should 
hold a 2to1 edge he said 
the opposition democratic progressive party however has staged 
street demonstrations in support of opening all seats to elections 
actions that elicited expressions of caution from the nationalists 
on the need to maintain law and order 
under pressure from the new generation of leaders the party 
congress adopted a more practical approach to dealing with the 
mainland ma described the new policy as providing much more 
flexibility to what we had been doing before 
the kuomintang which once sent ballons across the taiwan strait 
with handbills urging an uprising against communist bandits 
now will try to influence their compatriots by taking the taiwan 
experience of economic prosperity and growing democracy to china 
the ban on travel to taiwan from china also has been eased the 
nationalists also will tolerate imports of chinese raw material and 
the export of taiwan investment to the mainland so long as the 
business is conducted through a third country 
there is no way we can control indirect investment as well as 
indirect trade ma said 
the point of the new flexibility according to the policy 
statement is to utilize our political and economic influence to 
win the support of our mainland compatriots 
the changing face of the kuomintang prompted a leading member of 
taiwans opposition party to acknowledge the ruling partys new 
dynamism 
huang huanghsiung a lawmaker from the opposition democratic 
progressive party acknowledged that his party is facing a new 
challenge from the restructured kuomintang 
but i believe the condition is better for democratization 
now he said we can better pressure them to compete with us on 
equal footing

roy carlson had a good job a huge house and a stable life in 
arizona when he traded it all for a dream offer in silicon valley 
he thought he was kicking off a fresh new career two months later 
he was out of work 
mikel duffy hoped to climb the ladder of high finance with a new 
job at a new york exportimport firm a year later convinced shed 
never reach the first rung she quit 
two tales of job troubles one west coast one east coast one 
veteran one beginner but both are among the small but increasing 
number of americans whove accused their japanese or korean 
employers of job discrimination 
the explosion of asianowned companies has created jobs for 
americans but has also generated complaints from workers claiming 
they were rejected denied promotion or laid off because of their 
color race sex or ethnic group 
you should be evaluated for your performance not what you 
look like who you are or your race or sex said duffy one of 
three women whove sued c itoh amp co america inc a japanese 
company for discrimination 
some say cultural clashes arise because the japanese are 
unaccustomed to minority workers and female managers others call 
it intentional bias 
some complaints are in court the government is investigating 
others some probes have led to financial settlements and new 
policies 
honda of america manufacturing inc for example agreed this 
spring to pay 6 million to 377 blacks and women after a 
3yearlong investigation by the equal employment opportunity 
commission concluded the company should have hired them sooner 
honda admitted no wrongdoing 
most complaints involve japanese companies simply because of 
their dominance of the us market the cases represent a tiny 
fraction of 190000 americans working for japaneseowned firms a 
number expected to rise to 900000 by 1995 as of 1986 539 
japanese manufacturing firms had been established in the united 
states 
many business experts insist the japanese generally are good 
bosses known for innovative management and fierce loyalty from 
workers 
still tensions have surfaced when east meets west in the 
workplace some say its because the japanese live in a homogeneous 
society and maleoriented work world 
they import their own cultural bias said lawyer lewis 
steel whose firm has been involved in three cases in which women 
have charged japanese companies with job discrimination 
they run their corporations here in a way that really 
mirrors the structure in japan he said they have to adapt to 
our culture it is not easy for them to do that it was not 
easy for companies in the south to rid themselves of overt 
discrimination 
labor experts note that the record of us firms isnt 
unblemished in 1983 for instance general motors settled a race 
and sex discrimination case for 42 million the eeoc said 
bias complaints some pending for two years include 
hirings two former executives of nec electronics inc a 
microprocessor and semiconductor firm claim they were unfairly 
demoted they assert theyd advised against a policy of dismissing 
americans to make room for japanese workers when the company 
removed them from the board of directors they filed suit and then 
were fired according to their breachofcontract suit 
they had opposed discrimination and they were retaliated 
against they were whistleblowers said attorney robert kahn an 
nec lawyer denies the claims 
firings nine former workers mostly engineers have sued 
hyundai electronics america claiming they were hired to begin a 
computer division in california but lost their jobs when it closed 
months later in 1984 although koreans were transferred within the 
organization 
the eeoc has also sued the koreanowned firm charging 
discrimination in favor of korean workers a lawyer for hyundai 
denies the charges noting the koreans were trainees in america 
temporarily 
exemployees arent mollified i disrupted my life to join 
them said carlson adding he was laid off two months after being 
guaranteed job security they got whatever they wanted from us 
and they let us go 
promotions the eeoc in new york is investigating claims 
japanese men get preferential treatment and women have no promotion 
opportunities at the nikko securities co international inc said 
attorney susan ritz who is representing three women 
in the separate case against c itoh duffy said she was hired 
as a clerk two years ago and soon given other duties when when she 
requested relief from clerical work to tackle new tasks she said 
she was told in a fatherly reassuring manner no no its ok 
if you feel you cant handle this you can go back to your old job 
and we can get a man to do yours 
the eeoc however found no discrimination at c itoh and 
anyone who possesses the proper jobrelated skills can be 
promoted said lawyer bill carmell representing the company i 
get a little frustrated with the attitude since were a japanese 
company we must have mistreated women 
another sex discrimination case was resolved in a 1987 
multimillion dollar settlement involving sumitomo corp of america 
and 13 female clerical workers sumitomo stipulated it hadnt 
violated laws 
that settlement ended 10 years of litigation including a 1982 
supreme court decision holding that subsidiaries of japanese firms 
in the united states are bound by american laws barring job bias 
three japanese automakers also have come under eeoc scrutinty 
the agency said 
nissan is discussing settlement of a race sex and age 
discrimination charge 
toyota last year agreed to add five minority workers at two 
california plants and pay 47880 after a race and national origin 
discrimination probe 
honda in 1987 agreed to pay 457111 to 85 people following an 
age bias investigation 
in march honda settled a case after the eeoc claimed its hiring 
practices were discriminatory in its early years honda based in 
marysville ohio hired only people who lived within a 20mile 
radius of the plant the radius was later increased to 30 miles 
and the policy was also applied when honda opened an engine plant 
at anna ohio 
the 30mile limit excluded potential workers from columbus 35 
miles away which has the regions largest minority population 
about 24 percent 
honda spokesman bill lambert said the marysville area had asked 
the automaker to hire locally because manufacturing layoffs and 
closings in the early 80s had put thousands out of work 
but florence warren columbus affirmativeaction administrator 
said thirty miles is ludicrous if you can get to work and you 
can apply for a job you ought to be hired on your merit 
honda last fall expanded its hiring area to 17 counties and 
agreed to recruit and advertise in columbus and implement new 
training programs some 34 percent of hondas 5700 associates 
are black lambert said 
experts say the japanese will adjust quickly but carlson now a 
consultant feels cheated 
if i was going to korea and opened up a little business 
solicited help from senior technology people and closed it all down 
and left them stranded my guess is an iron boot would remove 
me summarily he said 
i was wooed and pursued in this job with great vigor they 
just kind of deposited me the whole thing just stinks

this is curtis carlson weekend in minneapolis 
and st paul and thousands of folks there will go back over his 
incredible career and attempt but fail to capture the essence of 
the man 
no shame on their part how do you explain a man wh began with 
an unproven idea and 50 borrowed dollars in the great depression 
and erected an empire of 75 companies employing 50000 people 
doing more than 4 billion a year in sales 
theyll try all 4000 who attend a sitdown gourmet dinner at 
the st paul civic center prepared by chefs from his own 
restaurants and hotels and all the top executives of the various 
companies among them 
carslon marketing group the largest motivation company in the 
world offering incentive marketing training and the like to some 
of the bestknown corporations 
carlson promotion group which creates programs to stimulate 
sales and capture customer loyalty for blue chip and other 
companies 
carlson hospitality group a major force in the worlds hotel 
resort and restaurant industries including the 160property 
radisson hotel corp colony hotels and resorts tgi fridays and 
other wellknown names 
carlson travel group north americas largest travel 
organization with more than 600 outlets and 3500 travel 
professionals 
every employee has a story perhaps everyone who has met the 
affable but obviously hardknuckled carlson has a tale but none 
can reveal anything but a brief flash against the facade of an 
intricately ingeniously packed 74 years 
the comments came in advance this week almost like 
obituaries he said as preparations progressed for the big event 
there are no obits for carlson there are many beginnings this 
50th anniversary itself is one 
all the boys signed declarations he said this week we 
have four operating groups for the various companies and each 
group has a number of presidents each president signed their 
staffs too 
what they signed were promises to employ all their resources in 
raising revenues to more than 9 billion a year in 1992 each has 
a goal carlson said each knows what he has to do 
its a tradition when carlson formed his first company gold 
bond trading stamp co that serviced grocery stores he began 
writing his goals on little slips of paper and putting them in his 
wallet 
writing down the goal he explained tends to keep your 
from straying too far over the years he never missed a goal 
extravagant as the goals might have seemed to someone who knew the 
contents of his wallet 
from 1938 to 1978 i grew a bit more than 30 percent a year 
compounded he related i reached 1 billion in 1978 and then 
i dropped the goal back to 15 percent a year big companies just 
cant grow as fast as small ones 
at 15 percent a year a company will double in about five 
years in 1982 i hit 2 billion but in 1987 i barely made 4 
billion made it by just 200 million that is revenues reached 
42 billion 
revenues of that amount would put carlson companies about 125th 
on the fortune 500 list of largest publicly held companies but 
carlson is private and so isnt listed though it owns some of the 
bestknown corporate names in america 
to attempt doubling a 1 million company in five years is 
ambitious and carlsons operations already are 4000 times that 
but he said i wanted to go for 8 billion 
carlson was too good a teacher over the 50 years his key 
personnel absorbed his drive the rest of the guys wanted to 
better my record he said they set a goal of 175 percent 
growth for five years or 9 billionplus in 1992 
carlson reflected may even have had second thoughts i never 
missed a goal and i dont want to miss one now he said 
gradually he is turning things over to his successor soninlaw 
edwin c skip gage the challenge is his 
over the years carlson did it his way i never had a 
longterm vision he said in answer to a question i was just 
concerned about the coming year those little reminders in his 
wallet were changed upgraded annually 
all the time he remained an entrepreneur a creator rather than 
a corporate executive discovering inventing devising and always 
examining his own moves perhaps for this reason he remembers the 
lessons learned and can teach them 
for just about anybody starting out in the business world 
dont wait for something to happen what would you really be 
happy doing listen to your heart rather than going into something 
that isnt right for you 
on raising money if youre a young entrepreneur without money 
dont go to the bank go to the guy youll be getting your supplies 
from hell want you to grow as a customer 
behind that advice is a lesson learned in 1938 carlson sought 
a 1000 bank loan and was turned down now he has a 100 million 
revolving credit line with the same bank he might not forget but 
he forgives 
on hours worked we always work six days i told all my people 
that by working five days we stay with the rest of them on the 
sixth day we get ahead of them 
wed come in on saturday some in sports clothes wed talk 
exchange ideas wed eat lunch and maybe leave early but these 
were the most productive hours because we communicated 
as he grew the stakes did too growth meant evergreater 
risks internal growth wasnt always sufficient and 30 percent of 
todays revenues is from acquisitions 
all bite size he said we dont try to buy something like 
texaco i like to sleep at night just bite size and i take good 
personnel with me 
did he ever doubt or lose confidence 
i dont remember it as a question of losing confidence but i 
remember running scared when i knew the amount of money needed for 
supplies and inventories could put me under he answered 
do some of the dire economic forecasts today disturb him 
the progress of my company has never coincided with the 
economic forecasts he said you just cannot find a correlation 
between my chart and the economic chart 
do forecasts worry me yes but i need a little tension in the 
company the main thing on your mind should be moving goods and 
satisfying customers

the japanese are breaking with a tradition of 
frugality to bring some luxury into their lives big cars 
european furniture diamond jewelry 
the government has been urging them to spend the yen they 
ordinarily put in the bank in hopes of spurring the domestic 
economy 
analysts say skyrocketing property values easy credit price 
stability and the yens rise in value are generating a fastgrowing 
market for luxury goods a turnaround from three years of slumping 
consumption when the surging yen subdued the exportdriven economy 
selling well are expensive and luxurious durable goods such as 
largesize tv sets refrigerators furniture and dining ware 
imported from europe said mitsuhiro hirose of the sales 
promotion division at matsuya co a major department store on 
tokyos bustling ginza 
a recent bank of japan report called brisk personal buying a 
key element of japans current economic success the government 
has cut income taxes and launched a 5trillionyen 40 billion 
public spending program spurring housing starts the bank cut its 
discount rate to a record low 25 percent and the public housing 
loan corp trimmed more than a percentage point off its interest 
rate currently 435 percent 
consumer demand as measured by department store sales jumped 82 
percent in april from a year earlier according to the japan 
department stores association total sales by 254 major department 
stores last year rose an average 47 percent every month the 
association said 
and the gross national product which measures total output of 
goods and services grew at an annualized rate of 113 percent in 
the first quarter of this year figures from the economic planning 
agency indicate 
people regard expensive new products as a means of being 
somewhat different from others said takayuki ikeda manager of 
the consumer electronics product division at mitsubishi electric co 
in 1985 the company began marketing its 37inch color television 
set the industry equivalent of 35inch american models for 
478000 yen 3825 
at first we never thought a largesized tv with a builtin 
picture tube would be accepted in japanese homes which some 
europeans have ridiculed as rabbit hutches ikeda said in an 
interview but the opposite is true people have realized that 
the larger the tv screen the more fun they can have the more 
feeling of real ambience 
japanese bought 96 million color tv sets last year 20 percent 
of which measured 22 inches or larger up 12 percent from 1986 
according to industry figures 
automakers are benefiting from the japanese who now want bigger 
more expensive cars toyota motor co in april sold 14673 of its 
largesize 46millionyen 37000 topoftheline crown models 
a 925percent jump from a year earlier 
peoples sense of money has become accentuated said isao 
takayama chief of the jewelry division at the swank mitsukoshi 
department stores several years ago you could buy a house for 50 
to 60 million yen now it costs up to 500 million yen 4 million 
it tends to dull peoples sense of money 
reflecting a demand for expensive ornaments imports of polished 
diamonds rose 616 percent to 106 million carats in the first four 
months of this year over last year according to the ministry of 
international trade and industry 
takayama said the hottest items are diamond rings priced at 2 
million yen 16000 
nowadays customers come in asking to see diamonds of about 100 
million yen 228000 he said four or five years ago that 
was the stuff of dreams

palestinians throw stones and sometimes 
firebombs at israelis in the uprising on the west bank and gaza 
strip israeli soldiers sometimes strike back with live ammunition 
but more often with rubber bullets tear gas and clubbings the 
rubber bullets which are not intended to kill are taking a toll 
nevertheless and palestinian children have been caught by them in 
the crossfire some have lost their eyes leaving them in a state 
of trauma and with little understanding of what happened to them 
at the same time the stones and firebombs are leaving israelis 
seriously injured some maimed for life following are two stories 
by associated press correspondents on how the disorders have

threeyearold rasha 
hoshiyeh stabs out the eyes of her dolls and stuffed animals 
she is trying to understand her mother says what happened when 
a rubber bullet fired by an israeli soldier put out her left eye 
shes not the same rasha said the mother majdouleen 
hoshiyeh at night she looks at herself in the mirror without her 
eye and sometimes she starts to cry 
rasha hoshiyeh was playing at the door of her familys home in 
the west bank town of ramallah in march when the rubber bullet 
fired by one of the soldiers chasing palestinian protesters 
smashed through the glass and hit her in the left eye 
the force of the bullet knocked rasha over the eyeball was 
hanging outside the socket there was blood flowing everywhere 
mrs hoshiyeh 24 recalled in an interview 
rasha has since undergone two operations today the darkhaired 
child with curly pigtails and long black lashes wears an immobile 
glass eye several shades darker than her chestnutcolored right eye 
since losing her eye rasha is more nervous her mother said 
evidence of that is a blondhaired doll and teddy bear that sit 
eyeless on a shelf in her bedroom 
eye loss is among the most dramatic of the injuries suffered by 
36000 palestinians hurt by gunfire tear gas beatings or rubber 
bullets during the sevenmonthold palestinian uprising on the west 
bank and the gaza strip 
of the total about 6000 have suffered lasting injuries 
according to figures compiled from hospital and field reports by 
the arabrun human rights information center 
one palestinian yussef abu eid 32 was killed in march by a 
rubber bullet fired at point blank range into his right eye two 
soldiers were charged with manslaughter 
one of the youngest palestinians to lose an eye is 9monthold 
fidah sharafi of the jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza strip on 
june 6 troops chasing demonstrators fired rubber bullets into the 
marketplace where her mother said they had gone to buy milk 
when my daughter is old enough to understand said safia 
sharafi 22 i will tell her the jewish soldiers came here and 
opened fire and thats how you lost your eye 
another infant victim was hoda masoub 
on june 1 hodas mother grabbed her daughter and ran into the 
narrow alleyway after troops hurled a tear gas cannister into her 
home while pursuing stonethrowing youths hoda was hit by seven 
rubber bullets 
my daughter is disfigured for life and she did nothing said 
mrs masoub 29 as her daughter sat sucking a lollipop her face 
halfconcealed by a bandage and her right arm in a cast 
dr ziad jaouni an ophthalmologist at st johns eye hospital 
in jerusalem said 81 palestinians had been treated at the facility 
for eye injuries received in clashes with troops of that group 42 
lost their eyes about half of them innocent bystanders 
we have treated many small children and elderly people who 
were not demonstrating they were hit while standing in windows 
doorways or on balconies he said 
doctors say dozens of others with serious eye damage or loss 
have been hospitalized elsewhere 
eye injuries have been caused primarily by the corkshaped 
rubber bullets which are embedded with a hard metal core 
an israeli army spokesman col ranaan gissin said rubber 
bullets do not have a straight trajectory and aiming is difficult 
when soldiers are chasing rioters 
we dont fire rubber bullets at children and their mothers 
gissin said it is one of the nonlethal means we use to disperse 
a mob and is not intended to cause bodily harm

dan cohen a 20yearold soldier was struck in 
the head by a 65pound block thrown from a rooftop while he 
patroled the occupied west bank city of nablus in march 
the injury left him paralyzed from the chest down and confined 
to a wheelchair 
im very angry said cohen who is expected to remain in the 
hospital here at least until september if i found him the 
assailant i would hang him from a high tree 
but moshe nussbaum who was badly burned on the hands in a 
firebomb attack while on reserve duty in the west bank said he had 
no intention of seeking revenge 
they werent after moshe nussbaum they were after israeli 
soldiers and they found me those are the rules of this war i can 
understand it i cant say i hate those kids 
cohen and nussbaum are among 428 israeli soldiers injured since 
the dec 8 start of the palestinian uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip in addition 272 israeli civilians have been hurt 
army officials said they could not provide a breakdown of 
injuries but according to media reports most soldiers have been 
injured by stones and a smaller number burned in firebomb attacks 
during the same period about 36000 palestinians were hurt by 
army gunfire tear gas rubber bullets and beatings according to 
the palestinianrun human rights information center it estimated 
6000 suffered lasting injuries 
israelis involved in the confrontations with palestinians say 
homemade weapons used by palestinian youths are far more lethal 
than people realize 
firebombs are dangerous weapons said nussbaum 35 a police 
reporter for israel radio when he wasnt on military reserve duty 
i used to say on the radio two people were hurt by a firebomb 
now i understand the real meaning of the word 
nussbaum and two other soldiers were on patrol in the west bank 
village of janiyeh on june 9 when a firebomb was hurled into their 
open jeep 
it exploded between my friend and me nussbaum said i 
started to burn so i jumped out and rolled on the ground to 
extinguish the flames 
nussbaum was burned severely on his hands and back and was given 
skin transplants he has been unable to return to work because he 
has not regained the full use of his hands 
in retaliation for the attack the army blew up two homes 
belonging to three suspects and sealed the house of a fourth the 
army also has begun to issue fireretardant overalls to soldiers 
cohen was on patrol in the narrow alleyways of nablus old city 
when the block was dropped on his head march 19 the assailant has 
not been found 
we were afraid because we did not know from where they would 
throw the next stone at us it was like a war cohen said in 
an interview 
but he added that the israelis were at a disadvantage despite 
their superior weapons and firepower 
the arabs knew our orders on opening fire they knew we 
werent allowed to shoot at stonethrowers and that as soldiers we 
could not run away from the stones so what was left was to be hit 
by stones and shut up 
cohen who says he hopes to study commercial photography after 
his release from the hospital complained that injuries to soldiers 
were largely ignored while the media focused on the palestinians 
when a soldier gets hurt nothing is written about it he 
said i would like it to be known that not only the arabs are 
suffering

on a corner in harlem amid the men selling 
baseball caps windup toys and perfume sharon williams tries to 
save a life or two by killing off a popular myth 
she is a black woman trying to convince other blacks that the 
face of aids isnt always white 
i tell them what you dont know can kill you said 
williams who has spent 18 months passing out truth and condoms as 
a city health department outreach worker she believes information 
means salvation but on the street denial runs deep 
if people cared to hear statistics they would learn the virus 
doesnt discriminate 
blacks represent 12 percent of the population but account for 
26 percent of all us aids cases a figure constant since the 
government began tracking cases in 1981 hispanics make up 7 
percent of the population and 14 percent of the aids cases 
blacks make up 73 percent of all heterosexual transmission 
cases compared with 13 percent each for whites and hispanics the 
risk of contracting aids is at least 15 times greater for black and 
hispanic heterosexuals than for white heterosexuals 
more than half of all women with aids are black 19 percent 
are hispanic 
more than half the children with aids are black 25 percent 
are hispanic 
the numbers only hint at the worst part of the story when 
educators talk about aids in minority communities theyre talking 
about the death of entire families 
what you have now is grandparents who are burying their kids 
who are burying their grandkids said ravinia hayescozier 
director of the office for community development for the new york 
city health department theres a possibility for two generations 
to be destroyed if we dont take it seriously 
this is going to wipe our community out said henri norris 
director of the multicultural alliance for the prevention of aids 
in san francisco in the 21st century black americans are going 
to be in very short supply 
aids is the fatal insult to an already injured community said 
hayescozier who likens the black community to an immune system 
long ravaged by societal ills such as poverty homelessness 
unemployment drugs and crime 
its not by accident this same community should be the perfect 
host for aids she said 
ultimately the spread of aids among minorities has nothing 
specifically to do with race and everything to do with behavior 
studies show that people of color engage more frequently than 
whites in activities known to spread the fatal disease such as 
needlesharing and casual sex among intravenous drug users of 
cases contracted through intravenous drug use 80 percent are black 
or hispanic 
but as researchers and educators prepare for the second annual 
minority aids conference scheduled for aug 1517 in washington 
dc they say the message filtering down to minority communities 
particularly blacks has been too confusing too inaccurate or too 
demeaning to evoke widespread concern and action 
instead the most common response has been fear and denial a 
denial reinforced by aids media campaigns aimed at gay white men 
who make up the bulk of total aids cases 
the message was if youre not gay youre not white youre 
not sleeping with anyone whos gay or white youre not at risk for 
the disease said ernest andrews an aids educator in the poor 
predominantly black bayviewhunters point area of san francisco 
the community became very comfortable with the idea it was not 
at risk weve had to fight that kind of denial which really has 
blanketed the black community 
in a recent survey of black adults in south carolina 95 percent 
either did not know or did not believe that more than half the 
children and women with aids in the united states are black 
onefourth characterized aids as a gay disease 
a 1987 los angeles times survey of 2100 people found anxiety 
about aids highest among blacks and an illinois department of 
public health poll showed blacks and hispanics to be among the 
least knowledgeable and most fearful of aids 
in big cities educators must address the fear that aids is a 
government conspiracy to eliminate societys undesirables 
namely minorities drug addicts and homosexuals they must overcome 
cultural and religious barriers that prevent people from halting 
behavior that puts them at risk or from using condoms to protect 
themselves from infection 
and they must constantly seek funding in a struggle that pits 
minority outreach efforts against betterorganized gay groups with 
significant resources and political clout 
in san francisco a city that spends more per capita for aids 
education treatment and research than any other in the nation 
only 100000 of the 20 million spent in 1985 and 1986 was 
earmarked for minority communities last year a coalition of 
minority education groups bypassed the city and asked the state for 
150000 to target highrisk behaviors in their communities 
this years 177 million federal aids informationeducation 
budget up from last years 104 million includes 7 million for 
state and local minority activities the same as 1987 an 
additional 3 million was included for national minority efforts 
federal treatment of perinatal aids aimed largely at black and 
hispanic women in new york and new jersey receives about 6 
million 
they divide the two populations gay vs minorities 
hayescozier said it almost sets up the scenario that its a 
battle that cant be won

in the trenches they are disheartened but still fighting 
williams and 14 other outreach workers must cover a dozen 
neighborhoods with the highest hiv infection rate in new york 
which has 15000 aids cases more than any other us city the 
statistics and the job can be overwhelming 
sometimes you get really really busy and it gets depressing 
you can feel helpless said williams 26 how can one person 
ideally educate 300000 people across five zip codes its 
impossible 
she does what she can and she walks away from presentations at 
places like the harlem mens shelter knowing she has told them what 
they need to know to avoid the virus she also knows that aids is 
like a festering wound open it and a hundred other poisons bubble 
to the surface 
the biggest problem we have is that there are so many other 
problems she said how can you teach someone about aids when 
they cant pay their rent theyre facing eviction their husband 
abuses them theyre homeless 
you cant worry about something five years down the line when 
youre worried about feeding yourself today said sunny rumsey 
who coordinates aids outreach for the new york city health 
department these communities are just overstressed i think aids 
is the straw thats breaking the camels back 
a man in alabama told venus medina an associate for minority 
affairs at the national aids network that he couldnt discuss aids 
education with her i have no food in my refrigerator i have no 
food stamps no work how can i talk about aids when i have nothing 
to eat he said 
some of these people say i should get aids and get out of 
this awful world medina said they say dont talk to me 
about whats going to happen next week or next month talk to me 
about how to keep my stomach full and keep a roof over my head 
how do we talk about aids to a person whos already given up 
we talk their language we put it in terms they can 
understand san franciscos andrews said we also address the 
fears they might have 
one of the most pervasive is the conspiracy theory the belief 
that aids is a plot by authorities the us government in the 
most popular version the soviets in another to wipe out 
minorities the concept of genocide ranges from benign neglect to 
an outright campaign of annihilation and there is enough evidence 
of the former to give credence to the latter educators say 
does the government really want to save its citizens the 
minority community will tell you no rumsey said the 
community will say they want us to get infected they want us not 
to know whats going on 
blacks have been disproportionately affected since the beginning 
of the epidemic but minority educators note that while the 
government initially listed haitians as a risk group it failed to 
warn blacks in general 
why werent tv messages made to say that black people are 
being affected said the rev carl bean founder of the los 
angeles minority aids project everytime they saw anything on the 
news it was always a white gay male it gave people an opportunity 
to say thats not me 
outreach workers say their job has been made more difficult 
because the epidemic was well along before they were alerted bean 
started the los angeles project in his home in late 1984 after 
hearing the statistics in an aids support training program 
it just blew me away he said i couldnt understand why i 
was sitting in training class with only three people of color out 
of 50 i thought i must go back home to my people 
at the time there were no culturally sensitive brochures or 
posters in my community there was nothing that put a face on it 
that said black bean said he created his own in simple 
language and the red black and green of the black liberation 
movement 
lack of money elsewhere has meant that little effective 
literature has been produced outreach worker williams carries a 
bagful of brochures that she knows many people wont bother to 
read in south carolina the founder of the states aids education 
network uses tips from her beauticians job to buy aids information 
materials and develop her own 
getting the message out is one challenge getting people to 
listen is another techniques used in the middleclass white gay 
community dont work in poor black and hispanic neighborhoods with 
their basic distrust of governmental agencies 
in san francisco andrews mounted a production of an original 
play community at risk reformed drug addictsturnededucators 
in san francisco chicago new york and atlanta go into shooting 
galleries where addicts inject drugs to talk oneonone about the 
dangers of sharing needles 
frustration over reaching so few people breeds creative 
solutions aids rap contests free blow the whistle on aids 
concerts raffles and aids information parties paid for by outreach 
groups meanwhile the country still lacks a national media 
campaign that shows the many faces of aids in a hardhitting 
nonjudgmental way 
the community needs to see and hear real live people saying 
ive got aids my babys got aids my mother has aids that has 
not happened andrews said and until that happens its going 
to be like chipping away at granite with a small chisel

someday soon dr mireille tribie a family 
practitioner hopes to enlist the help of a voodoo priest 
she thinks he may help convince haitian women infected with aids 
that the virus might ultimately kill any children they bear 
they dont believe what i tell them said tribie director 
of the minority aids program for the haitianamerican community 
association of dade county 
they think the disease is mystical something evil that 
someone put a voodoo hex on them they think its impossible for 
them to be sick because they dont feel sick 
in miamis little haiti where some of the citys 80000 
haitians seek out voodoo priests for spiritual advice mysticism 
and medicine clash with deadly results 
and in minority communities across the nation religious and 
cultural practices from disapproval of condoms to bisexuality 
frustrate health officials desperately trying to change risky 
behavior 
there are some tremendous cultural barriers i dont think 
well ever be able to surpass said jeanne easton director of 
the dade county aids program office in miami whats more 
entrenched in a culture than sexuality 
tribie has contacted an anthropologist to seek a meeting with 
the areas chief voodoo priest hoping he can preach to 
aidsinfected women on the dangers of getting pregnant childbirth 
is so important in haitian and other cultures that the 5050 chance 
of delivering a healthy child is considered worth the risk 
haitians were originally identified as a highrisk group for 
aids until it was shown their behavior not their nationality made 
them susceptible in florida which has the thirdhighest number of 
aids cases behind new york and california 33 percent of blacks 
with aids were born in haiti 
many minorities have yet to learn that what they do rather than 
race puts them at risk for the disease much of the complacency 
and denial stems from the fact aids was first identified in white 
homosexuals 
hispanic men who have anal sex with males however dont regard 
themselves as homosexuals and therefore may not recognize the risks 
to their wives as well as themselves 
it starts off in third world poverty men have sex with other 
men for money said dr laureano vega director of the south 
florida aids project they did not consider themselves gay 
because it was not something they did for pleasure theyre into 
heavy denial 
if they are the penetrator theyre not the ones receiving 
infected semen he said they tend to think theres a lower 
risk for contracting the disease thats not the case 
aids brochures are being translated into spanish but there are 
subtle dialect differences among cubans puerto ricans mexicans 
and south americans some sexual acts have no translation in 
spanish such as fisting a variation of anal intercourse that 
weakens the warning 
in addition everything has to be less explicit vega said 
you have to sterilize the message we cannot approach these 
issues as openly as we can in the anglo community 
religious conservatism in the black community and its associated 
homophobia have forced many gay black men to hide their sexual 
identity making it difficult to reach them educators say 
there is a percentage that identify as black first gay 
second said san francisco aids educator ernest andrews they 
dont go to gay bars and they dont read gay newspapers their 
sexuality is very private 
religious beliefs have proved a profound obstacle to aids 
education in very basic ways with the roman catholic church 
opposing condom use it is difficult to persuade hispanics to use 
them 
were asking them to almost walk away from their culture 
said sunny rumsey aids educator for the new york city health 
department how do they stay religious and still protect 
themselves from the virus 
the churchs position has made that impossible minority social 
workers say 
we have to cut out this moral judgment its not a moral 
issue its not a religious issue its a health issue said ruth 
rodriquez of the hispanic aids forum in new york the shame of it 
is people are infected and die in the meantime 
even when religion is not a factor economics may be cutting 
off sexual activity for instance might mean cutting off a source 
of income 
for poor women sex may function as a source of employment a 
method for establishing ownership or proprietary rights in a 
relationship or a means of acquiring much needed tangible 
support dr vickie mays a ucla psychology professor said in a 
presentation at the american psychological association in new york 
last year 
when people are perpetually poor theyre not going to spend a 
dollar for a condom when they can buy food said dr emo akpaeti 
of miami 
in addition many men refuse to use condoms and minority women 
have little power to persuade them 
we ask them to negotiate safer sex when many of them 
dont know what the word negotiate means mays said despite 
riskreduction advice to talk to their prospective partners a 
rather middleclass notion many women dont bother to ask men 
about previous sexual or drug use behaviors because they know the 
men will lie or discount the risk 
to complicate matters in the haitian community some women 
believe condoms damage their bodies 
they feel the vagina is a sacred part you have sex and babies 
with it nothing else can go in there like a condom because it 
would spoil her sexual organs tribie said 
childbearing is such a strong cultural imperative that even 
knowing they are hivpositive doesnt stop minority women from 
getting pregnant 
these people dont equate the virus or infection with having 
sex or having a baby easton said of the haitian community 
theyre used to having their children die its no big deal its 
an extension of the poverty they came from 
in poor communities where the infant mortality rate already is 
staggering the 5050 chance of producing an infected child often 
seems acceptable odds particularly to women who know childbearing 
will bolster their relationship or enhance their community standing 
its a very basic instinct said new yorks rodriquez 
theres something very lifegiving about your worth and having 
been alive at all in leaving a child some people say i believe 
in god and god would not do this do me or my baby

about a disease that seems too remote to be real only 300 cases of 
aids have been reported in south carolinas largely rural 
population of 4 million an additional 1600 people are 
hivpositive about 65 new cases are reported each month more than 
half the cases so far are among blacks 
diana and partner bambi sumpter who met at a state health 
department aids training program and formed the south carolina aids 
education network understand that information has to spread faster 
than the disease to change the future 
so they teach anyone anywhere anyway they can they do it on 
their own time mostly with their own money so far 4000 people 
have gotten the message among them children parents beauticians 
lawyers prison officials and of course the ladies and gentlemen 
who come to dianas hair ego 
people been coming in here six eight years and i never know 
much more than that their kids gone from first grade to high 
school said diana who has spent 25 of her 40 years making other 
people beautiful and then they come in and all of a sudden 
because of this aids stuff they have these very very personal 
conversations that are unbelievable 
they have had graphic discussions about sexual preferences what 
to do about sexually active preteens and how to get men to use 
condoms 
you can talk to your beautician you know about things you 
wouldnt normally say to other people jacobs said its a 
little like talking to a therapist 
it began when diana decided she needed to know about aids were 
any beauty services risky what precautions should she take the 
more she learned the more convinced she was that everyone needed 
to know what she knew the sooner the better 
now a dose of reality awaits everyone who comes through the 
door women under hairdryers watch aids education tapes a table 
holds neat stacks of aids pamphlets donated or purchased with 
customers tips the centerpiece is a glass bowl filled with 
giftwrapped condoms ladies once too embarrassed to pick one up 
now take handfuls for themselves and their teenagers 
aids posters hang on the walls amid blowups of impeccably 
coifed models last to know maybe first to go reads one 
handlettered sign and next to dianas mirror is a copy of her 
most recent aids column from a weekly black newspaper featuring 
real questions and nononsense answers 
why do yall make it sound like a black problem dont more 
white folks have aids than blacks 
can you get aids if you sit where an aids kid sat 
if this aids problem is so bad why doesnt somebody do 
something 
somebody is diana and partner sumpter a doctoral candidate in 
public health education have created educational materials for 
illiterate people and a program that trains children to teach their 
peers about aids dianas new support group mothers against 
aids helps parents communicate with youngsters using the 
language they use 
the children are especially important diana said because 
theyre the next generation who are going to have to take over and 
clean up the mess this generation is letting happen 
she talks quickly skillfully smearing relaxer on norma hipps 
hair while another beautician crimps hipps young daughter kidada 
i learn something new every time i come here and im teaching 
her about it hipp said of her 9yearold the way the world is 
now i dont think any kid is too young to learn about aids 
because of diana she knows how to keep kidada from becoming 
another sad statistic 
everybody used to ask me why was i doing this diana 
said im just doing it because i think its important and i 
think everybodys worst science fiction movie is getting ready to 
come true

a federal indictment accuses a gruntal amp co 
stockbroker of making about 250000 in illegal stock trading 
profits by using insider information about the acquisition by great 
atlantic amp pacific tea co of the waldbaum supermarket chain 
the 31count federal indictment handed down wednesday accused 
robert chestman 41 of lawrence ny of using confidential 
information about the impending merger from a client distantly 
related to waldbaum incs founder 
charges against chestman a senior vice president include mail 
and securities fraud counts and one count of perjury for allegedly 
lying under oath to the securities and exchange commission that he 
did not receive inside information about waldbaum 
keith loeb who is married to the niece of ira waldbaum settled 
an sec civil suit last october by agreeing to pay 45307 in fines 
and alleged illegal profits stemming from the acquisition 
wednesdays indictment did not name either loeb or gruntal 
gruntal officials said they had no immediate comment on the 
charges although a spokesman said chestman would continue to be 
employed by the firm a unit of the insurance holding company home 
group inc during the proceedings 
chestmans attorney otto obermaier told the new york times 
that his client would fight the allegations 
mr chestman vigorously denies that charges that have been 
made obermaier said we are distressed that this matter has 
escalated to the point of filing criminal charges 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani said that in late novermber 
1986 chestman bought 11000 shares of waldbaum stock for himself 
and nine clients including members of the waldbaum family after 
learning from loeb that the company was about to be sold to aampp at 
50 a share chestman kept 3000 shares for himself he said 
waldbaum stock had been trading over the counter for between 
2350 and 2475 a share but after the merger was announced 
publicly about a week later it jumped to around 49 a share 
giuliani said 
the sec noted suspicious trading in the stock and commenced an 
investigation giuliani told a news conference he said his 
office and the us postal inspection service later were called 
into the investigation 
giuliani said the case was especially significant because the 
alleged illegal trading occurred less than two weeks after the case 
of former stock speculator ivan f boesky was made public the two 
cases were not connected he said 
boesky paid the sec a record 100 million to settle 
insidertrading charges and was sentenced last december to three 
years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to lie to 
the sec boeskys cooperation with federal investigators has since 
led to several other indictments 
in addition to the perjury count the grand jury indictment of 
chestman includes 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts of 
mail fraud 
each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a fine of up to twice the total gain from the 
transactions 
chestman is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges july 28

polaroid corp hinted it would reject a 
proposed friendly takeover by roy e disney nephew of the late 
walt disney who announced a bid that values the instantfilm 
company at 284 billion 
disney an investor with an estimated personal wealth of 560 
million announced the offer wednesday and disclosed he already 
owns 69 percent of cambridge massbased polaroid through his 
familys shamrock holdings inc 
polaroid said it was reviewing the 40ashare cash offer with 
the help of outside advisers but suggested management would look 
unfavorably on a buyout 
referring to a retrenchment plan involving layoffs and 
costcutting that was announced last week polaroid said in a news 
release we firmly believe that this is without doubt the right 
course for polaroid and for all of its shareholders employees 
customers and communities 
polaroids stock shot up 6 to 40 a share wednesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
polaroids retrenchment plan announced july 12 was widely seen 
as an antitakeover measure and analysts said wednesday the timing 
of the shamrock offer suggested it was the trigger for the polaroid 
changes 
it would be very hard to say theyre unassociated william 
relyea who follows polaroid for eberstadt fleming inc in new 
york said of the offer and the changes announced at polaroid 
polaroid said it would cut up to 8 percent of its us workforce 
and save 50 million a year by reducing overhead and research and 
development costs the company also announced it would repurchase 
300 million of its own shares and create an employee stock 
ownership program that owns 14 percent of the companys stock 
polaroid also said it would enter the 7 billionayear world 
market for conventional film challenging eastman kodak co and 
fuji photo film co ltd 
disney described polaroids planned foray into the conventional 
film business as a misguided attempt to regain momentum in the face 
of a stagnating market for instant cameras and film 
the announcement of the companys entry into the conventional 
consumer film business appears to be a pedestrian attempt to give 
the company new direction stanley p gold shamrock president 
and chief executive officer said in a news release 
it betrays polaroids heritage of invention and creativity in 
the development of new products and markets he said 
gold also denounced polaroids stock repurchase and employee 
stock ownership plans as a management entrenchment scheme 
in a letter delivered wednesday to i macallister booth 
polaroid president and chief executive officer shamrock proposed 
that polaroid management cooperate with the takeover offer 
including a recent issue of 10 million shares that created the 
employee stock ownership program polaroid has 71 million shares 
outstanding the 40ashare offer thus places a value of 284 
billion on the company 
shamrock already holds 493 million shares or 69 percent to 
buy the rest at 40 a share would cost shamrock 264 billion 
shamrock offered as an alternative if approved by the polaroid 
board to pay a smaller amount of cash and agree to share the 
aftertax proceeds of any money polaroid might win in the damage 
trial of its 57 billion patent infringement suit against kodak 
kodak and polaroid are scheduled to appear in us district 
court in boston on jan 9 to begin the damage award trial in the 
suit in which polaroid claims kodak violated polaroid patents on 
instant film and cameras from 1976 to 1986 kodak calls the claim 
unreasonably inflated 
disney is the son of the late roy o disney brother of 
disneyland creator walt and the organizer of the business side of 
the disney empire forbes magazine last year listed disney as being 
worth 560 million 
shamrock an investment vehicle for disneys family has 
holdings in walt disney co as well as three television and 14 
radio stations 22 percent of enterra an energy services company 
real estate and a diverse investment portfolio shamrocks most 
recent acquisition was music plus a 56outlet los angeles record 
store chain 
in announcing its revitalization plan july 12 polaroid said it 
planned to lay off between 500 and 800 workers in a costcutting 
move the polaroid workforce has dropped from about 20000 to 
13000 since 1978 
in announcing the buyout offer shamrock also said it had filed 
suit in delaware chancery court challenging the employee stock 
ownership plan as being overly dependent on borrowing and seeking 
damages over cancellation of a meeting between disney and booth 
shamrock said it had filed suit in federal court in 
massachusetts seeking to overturn the states antitakeover law

food maker beatrice co has taken down its for 
sale sign prompting speculation that chairman donald p kelly is 
about to begin another lucrative exercise in conglomeratebuilding 
chicagobased beatrice revealed in its quarterly filing with the 
securities and exchange commission it has stopped looking for a 
buyer following a breakdown in negotiations with an unidentified 
company 
some foodindustry analysts said wednesday they expected kelly 
to launch a new effort to build a conglomerate using one or more 
of beatrices businesses as a vehicle for acquisitions 
kelly needs a vehicle to do what he does best and i think 
hell be looking for that vehicle said ronald morrow an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
kelly 66 employed such a strategy as chairman of eii holdings 
inc an acquisition vehicle he built from some beatrice units 
after kohlberg kravis roberts amp co took beatrice private in 1986 
and installed him as chairman 
eii was bought by american brands inc for 27 billion earlier 
this year after eii made a bid to acquire that company 
morrow said kelly could create a suitable acquisition vehicle by 
buying or spinning off as an independent company one or more of 
beatrices profitable subsidiaries which consist of huntwesson 
inc swiftekrich inc and beatrice cheese inc 
beatrice once a 13 billion conglomerate has sold all of its 
other assets since going private it had hoped to find a single 
buyer for the remainder of the company 
but following the termination of talks with the unidentified 
potential buyer beatrice has no current plans to engage in 
further discussions relating to the acquisition of beatrice by a 
third party or the disposition of its major operating companies 
the company said in the sec filing 
analysts said industry rumors held that beatrice had been 
negotiating a buyout with netherlandsbased foods giant unilever 
nv but beatrice spokesman charles long would not comment on that 
long said kelly might announce plans for himself and beatrice in 
september 
despite the intense speculation that has followed kelly since 
the eii buyout roger spencer a chicagobased analyst with 
painewebber inc said he doubted beatrices announcement masked 
secret designs 
i think they evidently werent able to attract a price in line 
with their valuation for the property and the owners have decided 
to run it as an operating company spencer said

19 percent stake in the company to japans largest cement maker 
company officials said 
brierley of new zealand will sell his stake for 4175 a 
share or 242 million a company official said wednesday

from calmat to buy in two years its california portland cement co 
and 13 readymix concrete plants in the los angeles area 
onoda will become the states biggest cement producer if as 
expected the firm exercises its option to buy california portland 
cement 
the deal probably will also increase foreign control over the 
us cement industry which already is 55 percent foreign owned 
said max d moore of the portland cement association a skokie 
illbased industry trade group 
onodas option will allow it to swap the 6 million shares it is 
acquiring in calmat for california portland cement and debt worth 
310 million or calmat can insist on buying back the shares for 
271 million in which case onoda will be offered california 
portland cement for 360 million in cash

general motors corp said today its net profit 
rose 53 percent in the second quarter from a year ago but the 
increase would have been 28 percent if an accounting change had 
been made retroactive 
the company attributed the strong gain to recordbreaking 
overseas results and improved performance in north america 
the worlds largest automaker said it had an aftertax profit of 
15 billion or 452 a common share in the apriljune period 
compared with earnings of 9803 million or 280 a common share 
in the same quarter a year earlier 
the company said however that if an accounting change made in 
the third quarter of 1987 had been applied to the secondquarter 
results for 1987 its profit for the yearago period would have 
been 117 billion or 339 a share 
secondquarter revenue rose 12 percent to a record 299 billion 
from 267 billion 
in the first six months of 1988 gm earnings rose 368 percent 
to 26 billion or 763 a common share from 190 billion or 
542 a common share a year earlier 
the company said that if the accounting change had been 
retroactive to the entire first half of 1987 the yearago profit 
would have amounted to 229 billion or 665 per common share 
sixmonth revenue rose 66 percent to 563 billion from 528 
billion 
gm changed the way it depreciates plants tools and equipment in 
the third quarter of 1987 
in a statement gm said the results reflect its increasing 
competitive north american automotive operations both in terms of 
strengthening market position and improving operating efficiency 
further overseas earnings in 1988 are exceeding the record levels 
achieved in 1987 
in 1987 gm barely broke even building and selling cars and 
trucks in north america much of its 356 billion in 1987 earnings 
came from accounting changes tax benefits and record contributions 
from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries 
on wednesday gm reported earnings by its three subsidiaries 
general motors acceptance corp electronic data systems corp and 
gm hughes electronics corp 
gm blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings 
for an 189 percent drop in gmac earnings to 3339 million from 
4118 million a year ago 
earnings by eds a computer services company rose a third to 
957 million or 78 cents per gm class e share on revenue of

costs 
inland steel reported record net income of 799 million or 
227 per share for the three months ending june 30 compared with 
175 million or 44 cents per share for the same period a year 
ago 
the previous record quarterly earnings of 636 million were 
reported for the first three months of 1988 the company said 
inlands secondquarter sales increased 24 percent to 105 
billion from 845 million while steel mill shipments during the 
period totaled 13 million tons a 12 percent gain from the 
yearago period

243 per share for the first six months of 1987 
first half sales rose to 19 percent to 201 billion from 169 
billion in 1987 
a sharp rise in industrial expansion and plant modernization led 
to increased demand for structural steel while the dollars 
dramatic fall in value last year against the japanese yen and west 
german mark raised the price of imported steel above that of 
domestically produced steel said inland spokesman sam saran 
chairman frank w luerssen said shipments of domestic steel 
likely will reach 80 million tons this year compared with 76 
million tons last year and inlands shipments probably will exceed 
the companys earlier estimate of 5 million tons

soybean futures closed mixed while corn and wheat 
finished sharply higher thursday on the chicago board of trade in 
volatile trading that reflected an uncertain weekend weather 
picture and weakening technical factors 
private forecasts for a mostly dry weekend in the midwest and a 
return to 100degree temperatures as early as monday supported the 
soybean market through midday analysts said conflicting 
predictions for a wetter weekend kept prices from rising sharply 
but the failure of the august soybean contract to rally above 
858 a bushel convinced several large investment firms it was time 
to sell others joined in and the august soybean price plunged 
nearly 40 cents before rebounding to close above 840 a bushel 
there was definitely some disappointment that we couldnt get 
much of a rally going and they sunk her into the hold there for a 
while said jerry gidel grains analyst with gh miller amp co a 
chicagobased trading firm

general motors corp reported thursday that its 
profit rose strongly in the second quarter as overseas operations 
had a recordbreaking performance and sales picked up in north 
america 
financial analysts said the gains in domestic sales should cheer 
the worlds largest automaker which has seen its us market share 
eroded in recent years 
gm had aftertax earnings of 15 billion or 452 a share in 
the apriljune period the companys best quarterly profit in four 
years that was up 53 percent from a net of 9803 million or 
280 a share in the same quarter of 1987 but gm noted the gain 
would have been about 28 percent if an accounting change had been 
made retroactive to the first half of last year 
gm said its profit for the 1987 period would have been 117 
billion if the change had been in effect 
secondquarter revenue rose 12 percent to 299 billion from 
267 billion surpassing gms previous quarterly sales record of 
276 billion set in 1986 
general motors improved profitability reflects its increasing 
competitive north american automotive operations both in terms of 
strengthening market position and improving operating efficiency 
gm chairman roger smith and president robert stempel said in a 
joint statement 
further overseas earnings in 1988 are exceeding the record 
levels achieved in 1987 they said 
for the first six months of 1988 gm had a profit of 26 
billion or 763 a share on revenue of 563 billion that was up 
133 percent from the 229 billion or 665 a share it would 
have earned on revenue of 528 billion a year ago if the 
accounting change had been in effect 
gm slowed the rate of depreciation of plants tools and 
equipment beginning in the third quarter of 1987 to match 
depreciation schedules used by its auto industry competition 
financial analysts were upbeat over gms sales gains for the 
quarter 
the number of units produced per employee went up almost 17 
percent versus secondquarter last year said ronald glantz at 
montgomery securities inc in san francisco thats phenomenally 
good showing the kind of earnings general motors can have if sales 
pick up 
in its announcement gm said our main challenge is to 
continue to build profitability in our north american automotive 
business and to profitably raise our market share we are committed 
to managing our cost levels so that they are consistent with market 
share 
the analysts agreed 
last year sales volume was so low that most of their gains 
came from accounting changes said kathleen heaney with nikko 
securities international in new york this year it seems based 
on volume sales were strong in the first half particularly in the 
second quarter 
gm said that as of june 30 it had implemented 27 billion of 
the 4 billion in cost cuts it plans to make during 1988 
gm said it sold 225 million cars and trucks worldwide during 
the quarter which was up 93 percent from the previous year 
the company said it held 351 percent of the us market for 
cars and light trucks built in north america that was up slightly 
from 338 percent at the end of june 1987 
last year gm barely broke even building and selling cars and 
trucks in north america much of its 356 billion in 1987 earnings 
came from accounting changes tax benefits and record contributions 
from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries 
but in the second quarter of 1988 operating income rose 64 
percent to 18 billion from 11 billion a year ago it rose 16 
percent in the first six months to 24 billion from 21 billion 
gm reported wednesday that earnings for the quarter rose 33 
percent at its electronic data systems subsidiary and 164 percent 
at gm hughes electronics earnings were down 189 percent at 
general motors acceptance corp

bank of new york quoted a late bid of 44150 for a troy ounce of

hectic trading in europe and that continued here explained james

intervention in dollar trading for the first time in several weeks

strong british economy and the prospect for higher interest rates

west publishing co and mead data central 
inc have settled their court battle for control of the 
computerassisted legal research marketplace the two companies 
announced thursday 
west attorney vance k opperman said both parties finally came 
to the realization that the diversion of time and money would be 
better spent focused on the market 
two federal judges helped settle the three lawsuits between the 
competitors which dominate a rapidly growing market that generates 
more than 200 million in annual sales 
both companies had sued and countersued in federal courts in 
minnesota and ohio accusing each other of copyright and 
restraintoftrade violations in connection with wests westlaw 
computerized legal research service and meads competing lexis 
service 
the settlement was reached late wednesday said dorothy molstad 
director of public relations for st paulbased west a major 
lawbook publisher 
under terms of the settlement mdc will pay west license fees 
for the use of the case report arrangements from wests copyright 
national reporter system publications on mdcs lexis system 
according to the statement 
wests national reporter system publishes judicial opinions from 
every state and federal court westlaw already includes case 
arrangements from that system 
mdc a subsidiary of mead corp a paper products manufacturer 
based in dayton ohio also will be granted a license to add wests 
compilations of various state statutes to lexis the statement said 
opperman said he thinks the two companies decided to stop 
spending their resources in the courtroom and instead fight it out 
in the market 
i think both companies feel that their business is in the 
marketplace their business is not in the courtrooms and they 
would like to return and focus all their resources on what they do 
best which is serve their customers and develop their products 
he said 
the two sides had been negotiating for the last 2 months

a varied crop of weather forecasts set the grain and soybean 
futures markets on edge thursday and prices teetertottered to a 
mixed close wheat and corn advanced oats were mostly lower and 
soybeans were mixed 
on other markets livestock and meat futures moved sharply 
higher energy futures advanced precious metals slipped and 
stockindex futures retreated 
a national weather service forecast predicting a return to hot 
dry conditions in the droughtstriken midwest by the middle of next 
week supported crop futures on the chicago board of trade and 
helped stem a threeday slide in the corn pit analysts said 
but traders in the volatile soybean market who had seen the 
price for august delivery plunge a total of 135 a bushel over the 
previous three days were reluctant to buy in the face of forecasts 
predicting rain the farm belt on sunday 
youve got some conflicting weather forecasts with some 
private forecasters calling for a little more than the national 
weather service said joel karlin research analyst for research 
department inc in chicago 
analysts said the soybean market remains extremely sensitive to 
any weather changes which will have a heavy impact on yields as 
the crop moves from its podforming to its podfilling stage during 
the next two or three weeks 
a storm system that moved slowly through the midwest earlier 
this week helped the soybean crop recover and drove the price for 
august delivery of soybeans down to 856 a bushel by the close of 
trading on wednesday 
the price fell another 14 cents thursday to 842 well below 
the recent high of nearly 11 reached on june 23 but substantially 
above 690 the price for nearmonth delivery of soybeans on may 
2 just before the drought rally began in earnest 
analysts said the failure of the august soybean contract to 
rally above 858 a bushel on thursday convinced several large 
investment firms it was time to sell others joined in and the 
august soybean price plunged nearly 40 cents before rebounding 
there was definitely some disappointment that we couldnt get 
much of a rally going and they sunk her into the hold there for a 
while said jerry gidel grains analyst with gh miller amp co a 
chicagobased trading firm 
rumors that the soviet union had purchased some us corn lent 
additional support to corn futures and expectations of new export 
business gave the wheat market a boost analysts said 
wheat settled 4 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 386 
a bushel corn was 5 cents to 10 cents higher with september at 
317 a bushel oats were 12 cents lower to 8 cents higher with 
september at 267 a bushel soybeans were 14 cents lower to 25 
cents higher with august at 842 a bushel 
cattle and pork futures soared on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in reaction to an upswing in wholesale demand for beef and 
feelings that recent losses in the pork markets had been overdone 
analysts said 
the october live cattle contract and the august and october hog 
contracts advanced the permitted limit of 150 cents a pound while 
all frozen pork belly contracts finished up their 2centsapound 
limit 
shipping volume by beef packers on wednesday hit its highest 
midweek level since february and packers were paying higher prices 
for cattle said tom ohare livestock market analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co in chicago 
live cattle settled 85 cent to 150 cents higher with august at 
6562 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent to 130 cents 
higher with august at 7650 cents a pound hogs were 52 cent to 
150 cents higher with august at 4462 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with july at 3775 
cents a pound 
energy futures made strong gains on the new york mercantile 
exchange on ideas that a ceasefire between iran and iraq would 
increase the likelihood of an opec agreement to limit production 
said peter beutel oil analyst with elders futures inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents 
higher with september at 1639 a barrel heating oil was 55 cent 
to 93 cent higher with august at 4553 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 90 cent to 166 cents higher with august at 5210 
cents a gallon 
on the new york mercantile exchange gold settled 280 to 3 
lower with august at 44270 a troy ounce silver was 85 cents to 
96 cents lower with july at 7737 a troy ounce

savings banks hold deposits equal to 1700 for 
every man woman and child in the soviet union which reflects how 
difficult it is for people to find anything worth spending their 
money on 
the per capita savings figure of 1000 rubles represents half a 
years salary for most soviet workers and the hoard could generate 
serious inflation when more consumer goods reach the market the 
figures were given thursday in a partial report on soviet economic 
performance in the first half of 1988 
savings banks hold personal deposits of 280 billion rubles 451 
billion for the nations 284 million residents said nikolai g 
belov deputy chairman of the soviet state committee on statistics 
that indicates soviet citizens have far more savings in relation 
to income than people in the united states or other western 
industrial countries 
last year the average american saved only 37 percent of his 
income or 488 and japanese workers put aside about 156 percent 
of their income according to the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
the average us income was about 13200 last year 
per capita savings were not given on an annual basis in the 
soviet economic report soviet salaries generally range between 150 
and 200 rubles a month 242 to 323 at the official exchange 
rate or about 1800 to 2400 rubles annually 
what the latest figures say about the soviet economy is that 
desirable goods are scarce and consumers appear to be stashing 
their money in fear of high prices when subsidies are removed from 
basic items like food and housing 
the current fiveyear economic plan crafted by mikhail s 
gorbachev and his advisers calls for simultaneous increases in 
quality and quantity which western analysts and some soviet 
economists consider unrealistic 
although broad figures belov gave at a news conference indicated 
the kremlin was seeing the quantity output it has ordered the 
savings figure and a look in any staterun store illustrate the 
slow improvement in production of consumer goods and services 
only about 10 percent of soviet families own cars laundry is 
done by hand in most homes for lack of washing machines and many 
adults own just three or four changes of clothing 
economist nikolai shmelev has said the high savings level 
indicates pentup demand among consumers and is a potential cause 
of inflation 
savings accounts grew by 42 billion rubles in 1987 shmelev has 
criticized the trend in a series of articles proposing improvements 
in economic planning and analysis 
in a speech to the communist party conference last month 
economist leonid abalkin echoed western financial analysts in 
saying soviet leaders get a skewed picture of industrial 
performance by measuring quantity but not quality 
abel aganbegyan another economist told reporters in late june 
the soviet consumer is no better off now than before the economic 
reforms gorbachev introduced last year 
unfortunately the majority of soviet families are not 
witnessing the material benefits of perestroika he said 
perestroika which means restructuring is what gorbachev calls his 
reform program 
reform has brought significant changes in personal freedom and 
created a more open atmosphere but little visible improvement in 
the marketplace 
the state committee on statistics reported in a dispatch 
distributed by the tass news agency that industrial output from 
january through june was 47 percent higher than the first half of 
1987 
soviets face little threat of job loss and are guaranteed state 
pensions theoretically lessening the need to put money away for 
hard times or retirement housing costs are fixed at 3 percent of 
family income 
shmelev and other economists favor reforms that would end state 
subsidies and make prices of goods and services reflect their 
actual cost 
soviet officials plan to introduce such changes in the 1990s 
but the growth in disposable cash could generate inflation before 
that 
this is a huge potential inflationary pressure a western 
economics attache said were already seeing this in places like 
izmailovo 
artists gather at izmailovo park in northeast moscow each 
weekend to sell their art works and handicrafts for high prices 
that shoppers who want unique gifts are willing to pay
